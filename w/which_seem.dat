5|$|Data for the abelisaurid forelimbs {{are known}} from Eoabelisaurus and the carnotaurines Aucasaurus, Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus. All had small forelimbs <b>which</b> <b>seem</b> {{to have been}} vestigial. The bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) were {{extremely}} short, only 25% {{of the length of}} the upper arm (humerus) in Carnotaurus and 33% in Aucasaurus. The entire arm was held straight, and the elbow joint was immobile.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is centred on the Storkyrkan church, first mentioned in historical records in 1279 and gradually enlarged {{over the following}} centuries. In 1468–1496, {{during the reign of}} Sten Sture the Elder, its size was doubled — the chapels where transformed into aisles, while rounded windows and a taller roof allowed more light into the building. The building in the painting depicts the church as it must have appeared when Gustav Vasa became king — the buttresses added in the 1550s are not present in the painting, <b>which</b> <b>seem</b> to confirm that the 17th century copy was faithful to the original. The church still exists, although the present exterior is mostly a later Baroque design.|$|E

5|$|Following the battle, John {{accompanied}} the Nicaeans in their rapid {{occupation of the}} Epirote domains, but he quickly became alienated from them. He brought his own followers to Vonitsa, from where he contacted his father, who had taken refuge in the Ionian Islands. Michael accepted his son's apologies, and soon joined him on the mainland. Byzantine control over Epirus {{had not yet been}} consolidated, and father and son were quickly able to recapture the Epirote capital of Arta and then relieve the besieged city of Ioannina. Within a short time, the Nicaeans had been evicted from Epirus. John's half-brother Nikephoros was then sent in spring 1260 to recover Thessaly, which he mostly accomplished after defeating and capturing the Nicaean general Alexios Strategopoulos. Part of eastern Thessaly, however, around Demetrias, Velestino, Halmyros, and Pharsalos, remained in Nicaean hands for several years thereafter. Again, despite his association with Thessaly, John is not mentioned as playing a role in these events or in the administration of the Thessalian territories in the early 1260s, <b>which</b> <b>seem</b> rather to have been under the control of Nikephoros.|$|E
5|$|French {{paleontologist}} Eric Buffetaut and a Thai colleague, Varavudh Suteethorn, {{described a}} partial {{upper and lower}} jaw from the Aptian-Albian Khok Kruat Formation of Thailand in 1992, giving it the name Psittacosaurus sattayaraki. In 2000, Sereno questioned the validity of this species, citing its eroded and fragmentary nature, and noted an absence of features characteristic of the genus Psittacosaurus. However, in 2002 the original authors published new images of the fossil <b>which</b> <b>seem</b> to show teeth in the lower jaw that exhibit the bulbous vertical ridge characteristic of psittacosaurs. Other authors have also defended its validity, while some continue to regard it as dubious. Sereno (2010) proposed that the best assignment for the type material may be Ceratopsia incertae sedis.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{surviving}} {{art from}} the Mesolithic period in Scotland, probably because the mobile peoples of the period would have made this on perishable organic items. Probably the oldest surviving portable visual art from Scotland are carved stone balls, or petrospheres, that date from the late Neolithic era. They are a uniquely Scottish phenomenon, with over 425 known examples. Most are from modern Aberdeenshire, {{but a handful of}} examples are known from Iona, Skye, Harris, Uist, Lewis, Arran, Hawick, Wigtownshire and fifteen from Orkney, five of which were found at the Neolithic village of Skara Brae. Many functions have been suggested for these objects, most indicating that they were prestigious and powerful possessions. Their production may have continued into the Iron Age. The complex carved circles and spirals on these balls can be seen mirrored in the carving on what was probably a lintel from a chambered cairn at Pierowall on Westray, Orkney, <b>which</b> <b>seem</b> {{to be part of the}} same culture that produced carvings at Newgrange in Ireland. Similarly, elaborately carved maceheads are often found in burial sites, like that found at Airdens in Sutherland, which has a pattern of interlocking diamond-shaped facets, similar to those found across Neolithic Britain and Europe.|$|E
