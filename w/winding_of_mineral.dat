5000|$|According to one view, {{ownership}} <b>of</b> <b>minerals</b> and petroleum not yet {{extracted from}} the land is vested in the state; another view seeks to distinguish mineral and petroleum resources from minerals and petroleum as such, so that the collective wealth <b>of</b> <b>minerals</b> and petroleum vests in the state, while ownership <b>of</b> unsevered <b>minerals</b> still vests in {{the owner of the}} land, even though the owner {{may not be able to}} exploit such minerals. A third view holds that the state's [...] "custodianship" [...] <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> and petroleum resources does not amount to ownership <b>of</b> unsevered <b>minerals</b> and petroleum: Subject to the public-trust doctrine, the landowner remains the owner <b>of</b> unextracted <b>minerals</b> and petroleum.

40|$|There {{is concern}} that modern cultivars and/or agronomic {{practices}} {{have resulted in}} reduced concentrations <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> elements essential to human nutrition in edible crops. Increased yields are often associated with reduced concentrations <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> elements in produce, {{and a number of}} recent studies have indicated that, when grown under identical conditions, the concentrations <b>of</b> several <b>mineral</b> elements are lower in genotypes yielding more grain or shoot biomass than in older, lower-yielding genotypes. Potato is a significant crop, grown worldwide, yet few studies have investigated whether increasing yields, through agronomy or breeding, affects the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> elements in tubers. This article examines the hypothesis that increasing yields, either by the application <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> fertilizers and/or by growing higher-yielding varieties, leads to decreased concentrations <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> elements in tubers. It reports that the application of fertilizers influences tuber elemental composition in a complex manner, presumably as a consequence of soil chemistry and interactions between mineral elements within the plant, that considerable variation exists between potato genotypes in the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> elements in their tubers, and that, like in other crops, higher-yielding genotypes occasionally have lower concentrations <b>of</b> some <b>mineral</b> elements in their edible tissues than lower-yielding genotypes. ...|$|R

The number <b>of</b> <b>minerals</b> present in tailings samples, and their unusual composition and structure compared with minerals naturally occurring at the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface, poses challenges for quantification <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> concentrations.
