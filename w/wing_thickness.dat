5|$|In August 1947, Chadwick {{was killed}} in the crash of the Avro Tudor 2 {{prototype}} and was succeeded by Sir William Farren. Reductions in <b>wing</b> <b>thickness</b> made it impossible to incorporate the split bomb bays and stacked engines, thus the engines were placed side-by-side in pairs either side of a single bomb-bay, with the fuselage growing somewhat. The wingtip fins gave way to a single fin on the aircraft's centreline. Rival manufacturer Handley Page received a prototype contract for its crescent-winged HP.80 B.35/46 tender in November 1947. Though considered the best option, contract placement for Avro's design was delayed whilst its technical strength was established. Instructions to proceed with the construction of two Avro 698 prototypes was received in January 1948. As an insurance measure against both radical designs failing, Short Brothers received a contract for the prototype SA.4 to the less-stringent Specification B.14/46; the SA.4, later named Sperrin, was not required. In April 1948, Vickers also received authority to proceed with their Type 660 which, although falling short of the B.35/46 Specification, being of a more conventional design would be available sooner; this plane entered service as the Valiant.|$|E

The studies encompassed blowing systems powered by low-pressure (single stage) and high-pressure (three and four stage) engine fans.

40|$|The conical {{transformation}} of variables of M. D. Haskind and S. V. Falkovich {{is applied to}} the steady-state problem of thin delta wings with subsonic leading edges in a supersonic flow. It is shown that solutions may be obtained, in terms of elliptic functions, for lifting <b>wings</b> of zero <b>thickness</b> with prescribed angle-of-attack distribution, and for symmetric non-lifting where the perturbation pressure is prescribed on the <b>wing</b> surface (<b>thickness</b> case, mean-surface assumption); the wing boundary conditions are assumed to be given in terms of polynomials in the space variables in the plane of the wing.

50|$|Weber's {{subsequent}} {{work with}} Küchemann was {{in improving the}} theory of subsonic aerodynamics. Initial methods treated <b>wing</b> <b>thickness</b> and lift in isolation. In the 1950s, she developed a simultaneous treatment of all the features of a <b>wing</b> (<b>thickness,</b> twist, sweepback, camber) to predict the air pressure distribution over it. The Vickers aircraft team then solved the inverse problem - that of determining the wing shape that best suited a required pressure distribution. The resultant wing shape, the most advanced for a civilian craft, was used on the VC10 airliner.|$|E

40|$|The severe weight {{limitations}} of flapping wing micro air vehicles necessitates {{the use of}} thin flexible wings, which in turn requires an aeroelastic modeling tool for proper numerical characterization. Furthermore, due to the unconventional nature of these vehicles, wing design guidelines for thrust and/or power considerations are not generally available; numerical design optimization then becomes a valuable tool. This work couples a nonlinear shell model to an unsteady vortex lattice solver, and then computes analytical design gradients: the derivative of aerodynamic force/power quantities {{with respect to a}} large vector of thickness variables. Gradient-based optimization is then used to locate the wing structure that maximizes the thrust, or minimizes the power under a thrust constraint, for a variety of shell boundary conditions. Changes in the topological features of the optimal <b>wing</b> <b>thicknesses</b> highlight important aeroelastic interactions that can be exploited for efficient flapping wings...|$|R
40|$|Changes {{in future}} {{aircraft}} technology which conserve energy are studied, {{along with the}} effect of these changes on economic performance. Among the new technologies considered are laminar-flow control, composite materials with and without laminar-flow control, and advanced airfoils. Aircraft design features studied include high-aspect-ratio <b>wings,</b> <b>thickness</b> ratio, and range. Engine technology is held constant at the JT 9 D level. It is concluded that wing aspect ratios of future aircraft are likely to significantly increase as a result of new technology and the push of higher fuel prices. Whereas current airplanes have been designed for AR = 7, supercritical technology and much higher fuel prices will drive aspect ratio to the AR = 9 - 10 range. Composite materials may raise aspect ratio to about 11 - 12 and practical laminar flow-control systems may further increase aspect ratio to 14 or more. Advanced technology provides significant reductions in aircraft take-off gross weight, energy consumption, and direct operating cost...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{purpose of}} this work is to present a {{methodology}} to ensure the metrological confidence during measurement of aerospace parts by ultrasonic, focusing the thickness measurement of an airplane wing skin. This methodology involves from the criteria used to perform {{the selection of a}} proper measurement system (ultrasonic) to the establishment of a conformity zones, using the Monte Carlo simulation for the uncertainty measurement determination. It will be shown, through experimental analysis, that minor variations in the steps of the proposed methodology could reflect in relevant quality loss of the measurement result and, in addition, by not to considering a realistic conformity zone, the aerospace industry will be subjected to two possible mistakes: the approval of <b>wing</b> skin <b>thickness</b> out of the allowable limits, compromising, therefore, the passengers, crew and airplane safety; or the rejection (repair requested) of a <b>wing</b> skin <b>thickness</b> within specification limits, mistakenly affecting in the maintenance costs. Based on the above mentioned context, the methodology proposed in this work objects to prevent that both situations may occur in the inspection practice, in realistic costs...|$|R
50|$|In addition, to the {{adoption}} of the Proteus, there were other envisioned changes for the Brabazon Mark II. In particular, a revised wheel arrangement which had been planned would have enabled the type to use the majority of runways on both the North Atlantic and Empire routes. Although the Proteus was slimmer than the Centaurus, the <b>wing</b> <b>thickness</b> was not to be reduced in the Mark II but the leading edge would be extended around the engines.|$|E
5000|$|F3D is {{the fastest}} class in [...] "glow-powered" [...] pylon racing. These planes reach speeds of over 100 m/s (225 mph) on the race course. The race course {{is the same as}} in AMA 424 or AMA 428, but there are few limits on the {{airframe}} and engine. The maximum engine displacement is [...]40ci, ignition must be a glowplug, fuel must be 80% methanol/20% castor oil, all else is free. There are airframe limits on <b>wing</b> <b>thickness,</b> fuselage dimensions, and weight for safety reasons.|$|E
50|$|Although {{a larger}} wing carries larger forces, {{it is also}} thicker. The main spar in the wing approximates an I-beam, whose depth equals the <b>wing</b> <b>thickness.</b> For a given overall load to be carried, the forces in the beam {{decrease}} with the square of its depth. If a wing is doubled in span it is also doubled in thickness. This reduces the forces in the spar {{by a factor of}} 2 x 2 = 4, allowing a fourfold increase in the overall load. This exactly matches the increased lift available from the larger wing area.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the effect of linear variation of the spanwise skin thickness on tile divergence, flutter, and aileron reversal speeds of thin wings, It is assumed that the wing weight and stiffness are provided by the skin alone and-that the wing mass remains constant for the tapers considered. It is shown that for rectangular <b>wings,</b> a skin <b>thickness</b> tapering from root to tip produces an increase of up to S; 6 in the critical speeds, whereas an inverse taper results in a reduction of up to ll&. For a tapered <b>wing,</b> skin <b>thickness</b> tapering from root to tip results in a reduction in the critical speeds of up %o $h. A comparison is made between the results obtained from the analysis and from some flutter speed criteria. Further the effect of skin taper on the mode of distortion and on the dynamic torsional stiffness is investigated...|$|R
25|$|The F-15 has an {{all-metal}} semi-monocoque fuselage {{with a large}} cantilever shoulder-mounted wing. The wing planform of the F-15 {{suggests a}} modified cropped delta shape with a leading-edge sweepback angle of 45°. Ailerons and a simple high-lift flap are located on the trailing edge. No leading-edge maneuvering flaps are utilized. This complication was avoided by the combination of low wing loading and fixed leading-edge camber that varies with spanwise position along the <b>wing.</b> Airfoil <b>thickness</b> ratios vary from 6% at the root to 3% at the tip.|$|R
50|$|By 1964, the US Government issued new {{requirements}} {{regarding the}} SST Program which required Lockheed {{to modify their}} design, by now called the L-2000-2. The new design had numerous modifications to the wing; one change was rounding {{the front of the}} forward delta in order to eliminate the pitch-up tendency. To increase high-speed aerodynamic efficiency, the <b>wing's</b> <b>thickness</b> was reduced to 2.3%, the leading edges were made sharper, the sweep angles were changed from 80/60° to 85/62°, and substantial twist and camber were added to the forward delta; much of the rear delta was twisted upwards to allow the elevons to remain flush at Mach 3.0. In addition, wing/body fairings were added {{on the underside of the}} fuselage where the wings are located, allowing a more normally shaped nose to be used. To retain low-speed performance, the rear delta was enlarged considerably; to increase the payload, the trailing edge featured a forward sweep of 10°. The new nose reduced the overall length to 214 ft (65.2 m) while retaining virtually the same internal dimensions. Wingspan was identical as before, and despite the thinner wing, the increased wing area of 9,026 ft² (838.5 m²) allowed the same takeoff performance. The airplane's overall lift-to-drag ratio increased from 7.25 to 7.94.|$|R

The triangular-shaped wing and tail control surfaces were mostly fabric-covered, and included all-metal two-part split flaps, and statically balanced ailerons. Fuel was carried in four self-sealing wing tanks, two forward and two behind, providing a capacity of 525 litres. The undercarriage included [...] "wide-stance" [...] main gear retracting outwards into the wings, and a fully retractable tail wheel.

40|$|ABSTRACT Correlation {{coefficients}} between {{abdominal fat}} and two skin measurements {{were obtained from}} 314 male and 347 female broiler chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus).

Correlation coefficients between <b>wing</b> web <b>thickness</b> and abdominal fat weight were r = +. 14 for males and r = +. 05 for females. Correlations for humeral tract pinch with abdominal fat weight were r = +. 12 and +. 17 (males) and r = +. 18 and +. 13 (females) for tracts on left and right shoulder regions, respectively. Abdominal fat was expressed as precentage of live weight to reduce variation in weight between birds.

50|$|The {{solution}} to this problem took on many forms. One was the addition of a fin known as a wing fence on the upper surface of the wing to redirect the flow to the rear (see the MiG-15 as an example.) Another closely related design was addition of a dogtooth notch to the leading edge (Avro Arrow). Other designs took a more radical approach, including the Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor's wing that grew wider towards the tip to provide more lift at the tip. The Handley Page Victor had a crescent wing with substantial sweep-back near the wing root where the wing was thickest, and progressively reducing sweep along the span as the <b>wing</b> <b>thickness</b> reduced towards the tip.|$|E
50|$|The Helios Prototype {{shares the}} same 8 ft wing chord (distance from leading to {{trailing}} edge) as its Pathfinder and Centurion predecessors.

The <b>wing</b> <b>thickness</b> {{is the same}} from tip to tip, 11.5 in inches or 12 percent of the chord, and it has no taper or sweep. The outer panels have a built-in 10-degree dihedral to give the aircraft more lateral stability. A slight upward twist at {{the tips of the}} trailing edge helps prevent wing tip stalls during the slow landings and turns. The wing area is 1,976 sq ft., which gives the craft a maximum wing loading of only 0.81 lb./sq. ft. when flying at a gross weight of 1,600 lb.|$|E

5000|$|... 1,327 Reliants of {{all types}} were made from 1933 to 1941, in {{different}} models, from SR-1 to SR-10. The final commercial model, the Stinson Reliant SR-10, was introduced in 1938. A militarized version was first flown in February 1942 and remained in production through several additional versions (all externally identical) until late 1943 for the US and British armed forces. Reliant production can be broken into two distinct types - the straight-wing Reliants (all models up to SR-6) and the gull-wing Reliants (all models from SR-7 and after, including the militarized V-77/AT-19), with there being little in common {{between the two groups}} of types. The straight-wing Reliant had a wing of constant chord and thickness which was supported by two struts each side with additional bracing struts. In contrast the taper-wing Reliant had the broadest chord and thickness of the wing at mid-span, with the outer wing trailing edge heavily angled forward and a rounded cutout on the leading edge root, all supported by a single strut. The taper wing had a significant step up between the fuselage and the wing, and the changes in <b>wing</b> <b>thickness</b> gave it a distinct gull appearance from the front.|$|E

40|$|Free-oscillation {{tests were}} made in the Langley {{high-speed}} 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel {{to determine the effects of}} <b>wing</b> <b>thickness</b> and wing sweep on the hinge-moment and flutter characteristics of a trailing-edge flap-type control. The untapered semispan wings had full-span aspect ratios of 5 and NACA 65 A-series airfoil sections. Unswept wings having ratios of <b>wing</b> <b>thickness</b> to chord of 0. 04, 0. 06, 0. 08, and 0. 10 were investigated. The swept wings were 6 percent thick and had sweep angles of 30 deg and 45 deg. The full-span flap-type controls had a total chord of 50 percent of the wing chord and were hinged at the 0. 765 -wing-chord line. Tests were made at zero angle of attack over a Mach number range from 0. 60 to 1. 02, control oscillation amplitudes up to about 12 deg, and a range of control-reduced frequencies. Static hinge-moment data were also obtained. Results indicate that the control aerodynamic damping for the 4 -percent-thick wing-control model was unstable in the Mach number range from 0. 92 to 1. 02 (maximum for these tests). Increasing the ratio of <b>wing</b> <b>thickness</b> to chord to 0. 06, 0. 08, and then to 0. 10 had a stabilizing effect on the aerodynamic damping in this speed range so that the aerodynamic damping was stable for the 10 -percent-thick model at all Mach numbers. The 6 -percent-thick unswept-wing-control model generally had unstable aerodynamic damping in the Mach number range from 0. 96 to 1. 02. Increasing the wing sweep resulted in a general decrease in the stable aerodynamic damping at the lower Mach numbers and in the unstable aerodynamic damping at the higher Mach numbers. The one-degree-of-freedom control-surface flutter which occurred in the transonic Mach number range (0. 92 to 1. 02) for the 4 -, 6 -, and 8 -percent-thick unswept-wing-control models could be eliminated by further increasing the ratio of thickness to chord to 0. 10. Flutter could also be eliminated by increasing the wing sweep angle to either 30 deg or 45 deg. The magnitude of variation in spring moment derivative with Mach number at transonic speeds was decreased by either increasing the ratio of <b>wing</b> <b>thickness</b> to chord or increasing the wing sweep angle...|$|E
40|$|Demonstration of the {{performance}} of adaptive structures on air vehicles in general has been a rather difficult subject. Different reasons such as cost, risk, actuator capability, time and possibly others have prevented performance of adaptive aeronautical structures to be demonstrated exhaustively. Although operating at lower Reynolds numbers a means to alleviate some of the reasons preventing smart technologies to be applied is to demonstrate those adaptive structures' capabilities on a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) which is what is presented along this article. Based on a modular MAV design it is shown how within minutes if not even seconds wings, tails or the propulsion systems can be easily changed resulting in differences of the MAV's performance. Principally based on the same fuselage this allows different features of adaptive structures to be performance and analyzed such as a change in a <b>wing's</b> <b>thickness,</b> aspect ratio, stiffness or angle of attack, or a vector thrust propulsion system, before an adaptive structures' solution is practically realized. The performance of all these features has been demonstrated in flight tests and the results obtained have been validated through analytical and numerical analysis, mainly from the point of flight performance stability and manoeuvrability which will be described and explained throughout the article.
