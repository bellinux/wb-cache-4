Barefooting requires the skier to travel at higher speeds than conventional <b>water</b> <b>skiing</b> (30-45mph/50-70kmh). The necessary speed required to keep the skier upright varies by the weight of the barefooter and can be approximated by the following formula: (W / 10) + 20, where W is the skier's weight in pounds and the result is in miles per hour. It is an act performed in show skiing, and on its own.|$|R
