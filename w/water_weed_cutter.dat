50|$|Elodea canadensis, {{sometimes}} called American or Canadian <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> or pond weed, is widely {{known as the}} generic <b>water</b> <b>weed.</b> The use of these names causes it {{to be confused with}} similar-looking plants, like Brazilian elodea (Egeria densa) or hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata). American <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> is an attractive aquarium plant and is a good substitute for Brazilian elodea. It can be used for science experiments in classrooms demonstrating how plants use carbon dioxide with the usage of bromothymol blue.|$|R

50|$|This species {{lives in}} <b>water</b> <b>weeds,</b> in ponds and marsh {{drainage}} ditches. It is uncommon to rare.|$|R
30|$|The {{production}} of biomass briquettes from water hyacinth is recommended. This could help alleviate the challenges posed by this <b>water</b> <b>weed.</b> Successful commercialisation of the briquettes {{can lead to}} increased incomes, job creation and improved environmental management. The use of briquettes may help reduce the prevalence of the <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> in aquatic bodies and also help reduce the intensive use of wood fuel which usually leads to deforestation.|$|R
60|$|The {{delicate}} paludina, of brown, horn-coloured, gracefully-formed shell, creeps on the <b>water</b> <b>weeds,</b> and {{hosts of}} snails may be studied.|$|R
50|$|The male has an {{elaborate}} courtship display, holding <b>water</b> <b>weeds</b> in his bill and bowing {{to the female}} with loud chuckles.|$|R
50|$|This large snail {{lives in}} slow flowing rivers and canals which are unpolluted, and which have hard water with many <b>water</b> <b>weeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} end of the lake, near Schüttdorf, is shallower and mostly filled with <b>water</b> <b>weed,</b> making it unsuitable for boating or swimming.|$|R
50|$|Trithuria inconspicua {{is seriously}} {{threatened}} {{due to the}} competition by the introduced bladder wort (Utricularia gibba) {{as well as other}} fresh <b>water</b> <b>weeds.</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>weed</b> <b>cutter</b> CombCut is a {{new type}} of machine that a Swedish organic farmer has {{developed}} against thistles in cereals. The video shows that the use of the CombCut may be successful in particular situations. First of all, it can be used for a longer-term strategy against thistles or black grass. Beyond that, it is suitable for example in systems with reduced tillage and green manures after a mild winter, when the green manure crops such as mustard or Phacelia don’t freeze off and grow beyond the corn stock...|$|R
30|$|The {{abundance}} of {{the rapidly growing}} hyacinth <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> presents both environmental challenges and opportunities. It is envisaged that water hyacinth is a potential biomass material {{for the production of}} briquettes because of its high growth yield and availability in large amounts throughout the year. The present research investigates the potential use of water hyacinth from nearby watercourses as biomass material for making briquettes. The calorific value of the <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> briquettes will be compared to other briquette samples made from other leaf species.|$|R
50|$|The American <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> lives entirely {{underwater}} {{with the}} exception of small white flowers which bloom at the surface and are attached to the plant by delicate stalks. It produces winter buds from the stem tips that overwinter on the lake bottom. It also often overwinters as an evergreen plant in mild climates. In the fall, leafy stalks will detach from the parent plant, float away, root, and start new plants. This is the American <b>water</b> <b>weed's</b> most important method of spreading, while seed production plays a relatively minor role.|$|R
50|$|The women's most {{important}} tasks were drawing <b>water,</b> <b>weeding,</b> cooking, plastering huts and granaries, winnowing, pounding grain, sweeping huts, using the coil method to make pottery, and raising children.|$|R
40|$|Curley <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> is a {{southern}} African submerged macrophyte {{that has become}} a serious <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> in several countries including New Zealand after its introduction by the aquarium industry. It has been recorded in Australia, including Queensland, but is not considered to have established. The chapter describes the ecology and management of this weed. Control of further dispersal is considered critical to its management. It has also been considered for classical biological control and manipulation of grass carp densities has also been studied. Issues relating to the use of herbicides in freshwater systems are also discussed...|$|R
25|$|The lakes play a {{vital role}} in the University’s {{stormwater}} system, but they are shallow, making them susceptible to eutrophication. Each spring harvesting takes place to remove excess <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> and remove pest fish.|$|R
50|$|Sooties feed {{mainly on}} invertebrates, {{especially}} freshwater prawns, and small fish. But their diet can {{be far more}} varied when river flows and water levels fall, and then can include <b>water</b> <b>weeds</b> and falling figs and Pandanus nuts.|$|R

50|$|It inhabits {{areas of}} rainforest, wet sclerophyll, and open forests. Breeding occurs from September to May after heavy rain. From 300 to 600 eggs are {{deposited}} in temporary pools and flooded areas, and are laid in clumps among <b>water</b> <b>weeds</b> at the <b>water's</b> surface.|$|R
50|$|The lake has {{an ongoing}} {{problem with the}} growth of {{eelgrass}} and Eurasian milfoil in shallower areas. Because of the silt kicked up by boats and the problem with <b>water</b> <b>weeds</b> and algae, the visibility in the lake is from 5 to 20 ft.|$|R
50|$|Flowers are pollinated by the Forcipomyia midge. Cuttings {{are poor}} to good in striking, and growth is slow. However, {{germination}} from fresh seeds is not difficult. Seeds are viable for germination for around three months. Appropriate <b>watering,</b> <b>weed</b> removal, protection from snails, climbing support and fertilizing are recommended for young plants.|$|R
30|$|The {{research}} {{motivation is}} how best an environmental challenge can be utilised {{to alleviate the}} energy crisis experienced by communities living in and around hyacinth water weed-infested water courses. The {{results of the study}} are expected to influence environmental and energy policy decisions on hyacinth <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> harvesting and utilisation.|$|R
5000|$|The current {{record for}} the {{marathon}} is 2 h 59 min 45 s, set in 1991 by a University of London Boat Club men's eight. [...] The race was cancelled in 2000, due to that year's fuel crisis, and in 2011 due to an unusually prolific growth of <b>water</b> <b>weed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fahaka {{pufferfish}} {{can reach}} up to 43 cm in length. Like all puffers {{they have the}} ability to inflate when threatened and carry the toxin tetrodotoxin. Fahaka pufferfish, like other molluscivores, feed mainly on benthic organisms which may include freshwater mussels and snails. They are typically found in large rivers, open <b>water,</b> <b>weed</b> beds and vegetated fringes.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to water volume retention, floating solar plants provide additional water quality benefits, of particular benefit to potable water infrastructure management. By shading water, floating solar farms also inhibit {{the growth of}} <b>water</b> <b>weeds</b> (that require sunlight for photosynthesis). The growth of bacteria, such as giardia and cryptosporidium, is also restricted by water temperature reduction.|$|R
50|$|A {{cover crop}} is a crop planted {{primarily}} to manage soil erosion, soil fertility, soil quality, <b>water,</b> <b>weeds,</b> pests, diseases, biodiversity and wildlife in an agroecosystem (Lu et al. 2000), an ecological system managed and largely shaped by humans across {{a range of}} intensities to produce food, feed, or fiber. Currently, not many countries are known for using the cover crop method.|$|R
40|$|It {{is located}} in eastern Uganda, the wetland system is {{characterized}} by open water that is clear with some emergent vegetation mainly of sedges and floating vegetation dominated by the day water lily Nymphaea sp and submerged <b>water</b> <b>weeds.</b> Some patches of Cyperus papyrus exist in areas with minimal agricultural encroachment. The main inflow into the Opeta system is through River Sironko...|$|R
50|$|In {{its human}} form {{it is said}} to appear as a {{handsome}} man, and can be recognised as a mythological creature only by the <b>water</b> <b>weeds,</b> or profuse sand and mud in its hair. Because of this, people in the Highlands were often wary of lone animals and strangers by the water's edge, near where the each-uisge was reputed to live.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the other}} members of the pochard group, hardheads feed by diving deeply, often staying {{submerged}} for as long as a minute at a time. They slip under the water with barely a ripple, simply lowering their heads and thrusting with their powerful webbed feet. They eat a broad range of small aquatic creatures, and supplement this with <b>water</b> <b>weeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{salt water}} barrier has also {{disrupted}} the harmony {{of the sea}} with the backwaters and has caused problems not foreseen before the salt water barrier like the omniprescence of the <b>water</b> <b>weeds.</b> Earlier the salt water tends to cleanse the backwaters {{but this does not}} happen any more leading to the pollution of the backwaters and the entire land nearby.|$|R
50|$|Silty sediments {{and water}} rich in {{nutrients}} favor {{the growth of}} American <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> in nutrient-rich lakes. However, the plants will grow {{in a wide range}} of conditions, from very shallow to deep water, and in many sediment types. It can even continue to grow unrooted, as floating fragments. It is found throughout temperate North America, where it is one of the most common aquatic plants.|$|R
50|$|In April 2011, the <b>water</b> {{hyacinth}} <b>weed</b> {{was found}} in the river system for the first time.|$|R
5|$|Although many non-sessile {{bivalves}} {{use their}} muscular foot to move around, or to dig, {{members of the}} freshwater family Sphaeriidae are exceptional in that these small clams climb about quite nimbly on weeds using their long and flexible foot. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum), for example, climbs around on <b>water</b> <b>weeds</b> {{at the edges of}} lakes and ponds; this enables the clam to find the best position for filter feeding.|$|R
