In addition, some components of the band also practice on Sunday afternoons and planning of the drills takes place throughout the fall semester. During weeks with complicated drills, extra practice and planning time is sometimes also done on weekday afternoons. All told, drills {{can take up to}} 40 hours per week on top of a full academic schedule and Corps/ROTC activities.|$|E

25|$|The {{country is}} rich and fertile, and the farms {{appear to have}} been {{advantageously}} cultivated, but it now has the marks of a country in ruins, {{a large portion of the}} proprietors having abandoned their homes. On the high road where heretofore was a continuous stream of travelers and vehicles, not a single traveler was seen from <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>week,</b> month to month. The countryside was silent. The very tracks of the carriages were grown over with grass or weeds. Travelers walked along bypaths. The villages are abandoned, the residents having fled to the north, leaving their homes, where possible, in charge of elder persons and servants.|$|E

25|$|The show's premiere {{ranked as}} Fox's highest-rated debut in three years. Viewership has {{increased}} continuously; Empire {{is the first}} primetime broadcast series in at least 23 years to have its viewership increase <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>week</b> for its first five episodes. The show continues to increase its viewership with further episodes. Episodes of the show have also been heavily watched on Video on Demand and other streaming services. As of its first season finale, Empire has now surpassed The Big Bang Theory as the highest rated scripted program in the 2014–2015 television season. The first season finale is also the highest rated debut season finale since May 2005, when Grey's Anatomy ended its first season. Empire's season one finale grew 82 percent from its series premiere, making it the show that has grown the most {{over the course of}} its first season since Men in Trees during the 2006–2007 season.|$|E
25|$|He {{worked with}} great rapidity and long hours, but {{he used his}} colours thin and covered the canvas with innumerable coats of paint. The colours {{increased}} in depth and intensity as the work progressed. At first the entire figure was painted in greyish-brown tones, with very little flesh colour, the whole blending perfectly with the greyish-brown of the prepared canvas; then the entire background would be intensified a little; then the figure made a little stronger; then the background, and so on {{from day to day}} and <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>week,</b> and often from month to month.... And so the portrait would really grow, really develop as an entirety, very much as a negative under the action of the chemicals comes out gradually—light, shadows, and all from the very first faint indications to their full values. It was as if the portrait were hidden within the canvas and the master by passing his wands day after day over the surface evoked the image.|$|E
25|$|William Perkin {{continued}} active {{research in}} organic chemistry {{for the rest}} of his life: he discovered and marketed other synthetic dyes, including Britannia Violet and Perkin's Green; he discovered ways to make coumarin, one of the first synthetic perfume raw materials, and cinnamic acid. (The reaction used to make the latter became known as the Perkin reaction.) Local lore has it that the colour of the nearby Grand Union Canal changed from <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>week</b> depending on the activity at Perkin's Greenford dyeworks. In 1869, Perkin found a method for the commercial production from anthracene of the brilliant red dye alizarin, which had been isolated and identified from madder root some forty years earlier in 1826 by the French chemist Pierre Robiquet, simultaneously with purpurin, another red dye of lesser industrial interest, but the German chemical company BASF patented the same process one day before he did. During the next decade, the new German Empire was rapidly eclipsing Britain as the centre of Europe's chemical industry. By the 1890s, Germany had a near-monopoly on the business and Perkin was compelled to sell off his holdings and retire.|$|E

500|$|The {{first season}} of Veronica Mars {{features}} a different [...] "case of the week" [...] each episode, and the season-long mystery of Lilly Kane's murder. In addition {{to developing a}} separate mystery for each episode, the writers also had to provide clues {{that would lead to}} the murder's resolution in the season finale. The murder mystery plot was planned {{from the beginning of the}} season and the killer's identity remained the same throughout production.

50|$|The {{return of}} the Browns {{increased}} the number of teams to 31, the first time the league had played with an odd number of clubs since 1966.

Under a new system, for ten weeks of the season (<b>Week</b> #1 <b>to</b> <b>Week</b> #2, and <b>Week</b> #10 <b>to</b> <b>Week</b> #17), one team was scheduled a bye; for seven weeks of the season (<b>Week</b> #3 <b>to</b> <b>Week</b> #9), three teams sat out.

[...] In 1905, McCay had Nemo appear in his own strip in the New York Herald. [...] In comparison to Little Nemo, the artwork of the Rarebit Fiend strips had minimal backgrounds, and were usually done from a static perspective with the main characters often in a fixed position. [...] The content of Rarebit Fiend played a much bigger role than it did in Little Nemo, whose focus was on beautiful visuals. [...] The stories were self-contained, whereas the Nemo story continued from <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>week.</b> [...] The dreams in Nemo were aimed at children, but Rarebit Fiend had adult-oriented subjects—social embarrassment, fear of dying or going insane, and so on.

500|$|Hechicero was one {{of sixteen}} wrestlers {{given a chance to}} compete in the 2014 En Busca de un Ídolo ("In search of an idol") tournament. The En Busca de un Ídolo tournament {{featured}} younger wrestlers, mostly low-to-mid-card wrestlers where they were given an opportunity to showcase their wrestling skills on a national scale. As part of the tournament each wrestler would earn points from the outcome of their matches, feedback from a panel of judges and a weekly online poll. Hechicero was one eight wrestlers to qualify as he survived a Torneo cibernetico elimination match along with Cavernario, Chachorro, Dragon Lee Guerrero Negro, Jr., Soberano, Jr., Star Jr., and Super Halcón, Jr. Hechicero ended up on the team being coached by Virus each week, with coaching focusing not just on the actual wrestling but also how to play their characters in the ring, interact with the fans and so on. During the weekly judging Hechicero received praise for his in-ring skills but also got several comments on {{the fact that he did}} not wrestle a very rudo style and needed to be more aggressive in the ring, something he tried to incorporate from <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>week.</b> After the first round Hechicero won almost every single weekly online poll, propelling him to the top of the ranking at the end with a total of 565 points, 114 more than the second place Cavernario. In the week between the first and the second round Hechicero teamed up with Virus and Cachorro to defeat Negro Casas, Cavernario and Dragon Lee on the May 23 Super Viernes show. In the second round Hechicero lost to Cavernario but defeated both Dragon Lee and Cachorro to earn a total of 250 points, including the majority of the online poll votes. The point score qualified Hechicero for the finals against Cavernario. In the final Cavernario defeated Hechicero two falls to one to win the tournament. The following week all eight [...] "Busca" [...] competitors two trainers faced off in a torneo cibernetico elimination match that saw Negro Casas eliminate Virus as the last man to win the match, Hechicero was eliminated as the sixth man by as he and Cavernario pinned each other at the same time. In the weeks following the En Busca de un Ídolo finals Hechicero began teaming with Mephisto and Ephesto for a couple of shows, possibly signaling that CMLL had plans to make them a trio after Mephisto and Ephesto's regular partner Averno had left CMLL. Later when Mephisto and Ephesto were announced as teaming with El Hombre Sin Nombre ("The Man with No Name") there was initial confusion if that meant Hechicero was being given a new ring identify, but once El Hombre Sin Nombre made his debut, it was obvious that the physical appearance and wrestling style did not match Hechicero. On the October 10, 2014 Super Viernes show Hechicero debuted a new look, including a new mask design and trunks in black with gold or red embellishment. As part of his image makeover Hechicero began carrying a bowl that burned with red flames as part of his entrance rituals. At ringside Hechicero often touches and sometimes scoops out the flames from the bowl without hurting his hands.|$|E
