40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the process integration of a temporary <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> for wafer thinning and thin wafer backside processing. Thin wafer handling is a key technology and enabler for the wafer level fabrication of through silicon via (TSV) based 3 D architectures. The work was done as evaluation study to prove the compatibility of a thin <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> with standard processes used for thinning and backside processing of "via-first" TSV wafers {{as well as for}} thinning of bumped wafers. The used thin <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> is based on perforated carrier wafers, which are bonded by an adhesive to the customer wafer and de-bonded by solvent release of the adhesive. All wafers used in this work had 200 mm format. The evaluation was run systematically in three major phases. In the first phase the main process scenarios, which require thin wafer handling, were defined. In a second phase setup trials for bonding, thinning, backside processing and debonding we re run on monitor wafers with different types of front side topography, but without TSVs. After finishing the setup trials in a third phase, the monitor wafers were replaced by wafers with copper filled TSVs, which were fabricated in "via-first" technology. Using the established thin wafer handling and processing sequence, silicon interposer wafers with 55 m thickness were manufactured. The measured via chains have via pitches of 28 m using 15 m via diameter...|$|E

An electron beam which covers {{the entire area}} of the wafer was chosen for the solar cell processor.

The electrical parameters of the pulsed electron beam subsystem were chosen {{on the basis of}} computer calculations and past experience in pulsed electron accelerator design and operation. The pulser, designated SPI-PULSE 7000, is designed to anneal 10 cm diameter silicon wafers at a rate of 30 per minute.

40|$|Instrument vendors have {{suggested}} that utilizing a total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) instrument as an in-line analysis tool in a semiconductor wafer manufacturing area is a reasonable and safe mode of operation. In practice this seldom occurs due to concerns about the cleanliness of the TXRF system. This paper describes the results of tests on the particulate levels introduced by several TXRF instruments. The top (polished) sides of bare silicon wafers were analyzed by a Tencor particle counting system and then analyzed by TXRJ! either top-side up (to detect particles introduced on the top side by a typical TXRF analysis) or top-side down (to detect particles normally introduced onto the wafer bottoms by the <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system).</b> The wafers were returned for a second particle count on the top side {{to determine the number}} of add-on particles introduced. When patterns of particles were detected, wafers were analyzed by TXRF in areas of high and low particle density to determine the identity of the particles. The results from three TXRF instruments of various vintages and in different environments indicated that significant numbers of add-on particles were introduced on the front side, with much higher levels introduced on the back side, primarily from the wafer chuck; consequently, until improvements are made such that particulate levels are reduced, TXRF cannot safely be used as a true in-line analysis tool in a modern semiconductor wafer manufacturing area.

40|$|To achieve higher {{utilization}} of production floor, reduce traffic congestion, and improve travel time efficiency and layout flexibility, material <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> is extended to move loads through every spatial paths to perform factory-wide handling tasks. We designate this material flow structure the Orthogonal Spatial Material Flow (OSMF) structure. Instead of planar (2 -D) moves, OSMF structure outlines a three-dimensional material flow network with feasible orthogonal paths between the spatial points {{which may be}} spread over factory floor, ceiling, overhead, underground, or multifloor spaces. The OSMF paths can possess multiple flow layers that are laid in the space virtually or physically, vertically or horizontally, disjointedly or connectedly. ^ The OSMF problem is studied {{within the context of}} automated <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> <b>systems</b> in semiconductor fabs. As all the goals are set on 300 mm. or larger wafer manufacturing for the 21 st century, fab automation becomes the current trend in semiconductor fabrication facilities due to the heavy wafer pod (16 â€“ 20 lbs) and the large flow times distances (360 miles per day). ^ In this dissertation, a two-layer single-floor OSMF structure is adapted to existing fab layouts. Our approach to the OSMF problem confronts the issues of flow path design and transport service level. We focus on the following developments: (1) overhead interbay track layout design by constructing circular layout for multi-carrier heavy traffic system in interbay zones, (2) overhead intrabay track layout design by developing optimal single and double spine layouts, and (3) mixed model fleet sizing capacity model by M/G/ 1 queue with server vacations. ^ To our knowledge, this is the first study of OSMF analysis of material <b>handling</b> <b>systems.</b> The study aims at the development of a generic design framework for OSMF systems and to assist planar material flow systems to expand to OSMF analysis. We demonstrate the static analysis procedures by generating a two-layer mixed model system for semiconductor fabs. The procedures introduced are efficient, requiring only minor computation time, and are applicable to many real-world scenarios. The problem is significant in that, with an OSMF system all the movement activities in the shop floor can be done with less space, cost, and time. ...|$|R

This thesis describes the generation and mathematical verification of a dynamic model for a three degrees-of-freedom <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> mechanism with one linear and two rotary axes.

The simulation time increase from the addition of flexible connections can be minimized by modeling only the component stiffnesses that impact the closed-loop mechanism response.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for the verification of controls in material <b>handling</b> <b>systems.</b> While currently these controls are mostly validated using simulation, in the proposed approach, the correctness of the involved controls is automatically proven by means of model checking. Model checking is a formal method that automatically verifies whether a system meets its specification by exhaustively analyzing {{a model of the}} corresponding system. To achieve a model of the material <b>handling</b> <b>system,</b> a modeling methodology has been developed and is introduced in this thesis.

40|$|Photovoltaic {{manufacturing}} is material intensive {{with the}} cost of crystalline silicon wafer, used as the substrate, representing 40 % to 60 % of the solar cell cost. Consequently, there is a growing trend to reduce the silicon wafer thickness leading to new technical challenges related to manufacturing. Specifically, <b>wafer</b> breakage during <b>handling</b> and/or transfer is a significant issue. Therefore improved methods for breakage-free handling are needed to address this problem. An important pre-requisite for realizing such methods is the need for fundamental understanding of the effect of handling device variables on the deformation, stresses, and fracture of crystalline silicon wafers. This knowledge is lacking for <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> devices including the Bernoulli gripper, which is an air flow nozzle based device. A computational fluid dynamics model of the air flow generated by a Bernoulli gripper has been developed. This model predicts the air flow, pressure distribution and lifting force generated by the gripper. For thin silicon wafers, the fluid model is combined with a finite element model to analyze the effects of wafer flexibility on the equilibrium pressure distribution, lifting force and handling stresses. The effect of wafer flexibility on the air pressure distribution is found to be increasingly significant at higher air flow rates. The model yields considerable insight into the relative effects of air flow induced vacuum and the direct impingement of air on the wafer on the air pressure distribution, lifting force, and handling stress. The latter effect is found to be especially significant when the wafer deformation is large. In addition to silicon wafers, the model {{can also be used to}} determine the lifting force and handling stress produced in other flexible materials. Finally, a systematic approach for the analysis of the total stress state (handling plus residual stresses) produced in crystalline silicon wafers and its impact on <b>wafer</b> breakage during <b>handling</b> is presented. Results confirm the capability of the approach to predict <b>wafer</b> breakage during <b>handling</b> given the crack size, location and fracture toughness.
