500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+", and wrote {{positively}} {{of the way}} the show was able to write-in the presence of the Documentarians into the episode's plot; he compared this to the story arc in the ninth season involving Brian the boom mic operator, noting that the documentarians presence in [...] "Email Surveillance" [...] was much better executed than then the aforementioned Brian plot. He also called the episode's conclusion, featuring Michael and Jim singing a duet, [...] "emotionally satisfying" [...] because it relies [...] "on <b>what</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> mean to each other outside of the office".|$|E
500|$|Mullen and The Edge both {{agreed that}} playing the Sarajevo concert {{had been the}} {{highlight}} of their careers; Mullen said, [...] "here's no doubt that that is an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life. And if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, [...] I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's <b>what</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of his voice had [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble to come here, and they were just going to make it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E

2500|$|A {{key part}} of the defense being {{prepared}} by Harvey Volzer, a lawyer for Spc. Megan Ambuhl, who England and another soldier both have said was not directly involved in the abuse. Volzer will argue Ambuhl could not have been derelict in her duty to guard prisoners because the memos show that the government believed the rough treatment to get information was justified. [...] "We have multiple legal memoranda ... condoning <b>what</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> did," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, when Francis X. Bellotti {{ran against}} {{establishment}} candidate Endicott Peabody {{in the primary}} race for governor, Massachusetts senate president John E. Powers accused him of sabotaging the Democratic party, saying, [...] "I don't want to see an Italian party, and that's just <b>what</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> are doing." [...] At the St. Patrick's Day parade, South Boston residents pelted Bellotti with beer cans and shouted ethnic slurs. Rumors circulated that Bellotti was beholden to the Mafia. In fact, Mafia capos were caught on FBI surveillance tapes complaining about Bellotti's refusal to accept their campaign donations.|$|E
2500|$|What {{they call}} [...] "Israel" [...] is no mere {{military}} state. A subsumed militarism, a systemic mendacity with an ingrained violence constitutional {{to the very}} fusion of its fabric, has penetrated the deepest corners of <b>what</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> have to call their [...] "soul."... Half a century of systematic maiming and murdering of another people has left its deep marks {{on the faces of}} these people, the way they talk, the way they walk, the way they handle objects, the way they greet each other, the way they look at the world. There is an endemic prevarication to this machinery, a vulgarity of character that is bone-deep and structural to the skeletal vertebrae of its culture.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2012, in an {{interview}} with Rap-Up, T.I. shared details about his collaboration with singer-songwriter Pink on the T-Minus-produced [...] "Guns and Roses," [...] which he describes as a [...] "bittersweet romantic story." [...] "We found that we had a few things in common," [...] says T.I. of the pop-rocker. [...] "We clicked. She real people, she from the streets. I’m a real cat, I’m from the streets. We found ourselves in rooms where we were like, ‘You know <b>what?</b> <b>These</b> <b>people</b> fake as hell in here.

So in Planet of the Apes they put her in with Frank Schaffner, then in mine, they underwrote her. They had nothing {{for her to do}} in this one, except just be part of the sequel. In other words, she was so badly conceived in the writing that I had to conceive actions for her to make her belong to the piece. And the big action which I gave her – and I think she came off beautifully with it – was to try to understand <b>what</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were trying to communicate to her. And struggling to understand and feeling sympathetic vibrations coming from these people. So I gave her something which was not in the script to play and she played that, I think, very simpatico, very beautifully." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a search}} on 19 September, Spanish police seized {{significant}} election material {{which had been}} in store by referendum organizers at the offices of a private delivery company in Terrassa. These included voting cards contained in envelopes with the Catalan government's logo. The next day, the Civil Guard raided Generalitat offices and arrested fourteen senior officials from the Catalan government—most notably, these included , deputy to regional Vice-President Oriol Junqueras. This came after mayors from towns supporting the referendum were questioned in court by state prosecutors. Regional premier Carles Puigdemont condemned the actions as [...] "anti-democratic and totalitarian", accusing the Spanish government of 'de facto' imposing {{a state of emergency}} and of suspending Catalonia's autonomy after it took effective control over Catalan finances. Public protests occurred in Barcelona after news of the arrests emerged, with left-wing political party Podemos and Barcelona mayor Ada Colau joining the growing criticism of Mariano Rajoy's government crackdown on public servants, dubbing it as an [...] "authoritarian regression". The previous day, the Congress of Deputies had voted down a motion from Ciudadanos to support the Spanish government's response to the referendum, which was rejected by 166 votes to 158. Rajoy defended his government's actions in that [...] "What we're seeing in Catalonia is an attempt to eliminate the constitution and the autonomous statute of Catalonia... Logically, the state has to react. There is no democratic state in the world that would accept <b>what</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> are trying to do. They've been warned and they know the referendum can't take place". Rajoy also called for the Catalonia government to give up its [...] "escalation of radicalism and disobedience", calling for them to [...] "Go back to the law and democracy" [...] and dubbing the referendum a [...] "chimera", as tens of thousands gathered in the streets of Barcelona and other Catalan cities to protest police actions. The Spanish government did not rule out invoking Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which would allow the central government to adopt [...] "the necessary measures to compel regional authorities to obey the law"—in practice, allowing for the autonomy's effective suspension and [...] of the region.|$|E
