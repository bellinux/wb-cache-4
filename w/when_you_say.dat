5|$|The {{books are}} written in first-person narrative, {{primarily}} through Bella's eyes with the epilogue of the third book {{and a part of}} the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I have a hard time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out there–Anne Rice's and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.|$|E

The Times Rebecca Keegan asked, [...] "So <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> you’re not {{on either side of the}} aisle, does that mean you’re not voting for Trump?" [...] Eastwood replied, [...] "I’m totally an enigma. I’m just astounded. I hate to pick up the paper.

500|$|... "The hope, {{first and}} foremost, {{was to put}} this on people’s radar. Apart from the UN and a few newsreaders who mention this every year, people don’t even know this day exists. It’s also to make people realize it’s not just about {{volunteering}} to go {{and live in the}} Congo for four years. It’s as much about working a soup kitchen as it is helping an elderly person. Contributing something positive doesn’t have to be a lifelong commitment; it can just be daily gestures. So, it was about giving the whole issue perspective... One video and a message aren't going to save everything. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> things together, maybe the message will be heard and hopefully will provoke action. Inherently people are good, and inherently people are distracted and somewhat lazy, so it comes down to how do you get people’s attention." ...|$|E

500|$|Delany {{auditioned for}} the role of Bree for the series' pilot episode in 2004. Cherry offered her the role three times, but she {{rejected}} it, and Marcia Cross was hired soon after. Delany turned down the role because she believed the Bree character was too similar to her character on Pasadena. Cherry acknowledged that while Delany captured the slyness he had originally intended for the character, Cross ultimately became the better choice: [...] "Marcia, who {{will be the first to}} tell you, 'I'm not funny, I never get the joke,' her Bree was kind of oblivious to her own Breeness. Interestingly enough, when we went forward with the show, it became a much funnier character than I envisioned." [...] While developing the Katherine character, Cherry immediately offered the role to Delany. [...] "That's unusual in Hollywood," [...] Delany commented. [...] "Usually <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> 'no,' they hold it against you for the rest of your career. I've experienced that." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
500|$|He {{was very}} careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation. He {{explained}} in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, {{what is it that you}} were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. If I could have said it any differently, I would have". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their [...] "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a Time magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: [...] "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves." [...] He also said [...] "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious".|$|E

2500|$|Basil of Caesarea, in {{his writing}} On the Holy Spirit, says: [...] "The honor paid to the image passes to the prototype".

2500|$|Consulting {{producer}} for A Nero Wolfe Mystery, Doyle was the show's only full-time writer — overseeing {{the work of}} freelance screenwriters and writing 11 of the teleplays herself. She devoted most of {{her attention to the}} dialogue: [...] "What Stout writes actually sounds good <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> it out loud, but the stuff that makes you laugh out loud and fall {{on the floor in the}} books doesn't work most of the time when you transpose it directly into actors' mouths. Frequently I end up moving words — tenderly and respectfully — but retaining as much of the language as possible. I feel a great belief in Rex Stout. I see the script process as writing his second draft." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 22 May, Regenvanu was {{publicly}} criticised and ridiculed in Parliament by Internal Affairs Minister Patrick Crowby and Minister for Lands Harry Iauko, {{who read}} out an e-mail Regenvanu had been circulating, {{in which the}} young MP broadly accused his fellows of widespread corruption. He had also stated in the e-mail that Speaker of Parliament Maxime Carlot Korman would be [...] "buried" [...] if he attempted {{to stand in the}} 2012 general election. Carlot Korman addressed Regenvanu in these terms: [...] "I, along with your father are veteran politicians.

2500|$|In 1978, McCotter {{was criticized}} in the Des Moines Sunday Register for a {{statement}} he made during a sermon about child rearing. The sermon {{was based upon}} the Bible verse Proverbs 20:30 ("Blows that wound cleanse away evil; strokes make clean the innermost parts.") In it, McCotter said, [...] "When you discipline, this verse indicates, as others do, {{that you want to}} do it so it wounds. Now, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> ‘wounds,’ it doesn’t mean that you have a bloody mess on your hands necessarily. It doesn’t mean that you have a child ‘wounding’ like he has a broken leg....

2500|$|Of the trilogy, Steven Pate of The Chicagoist wrote, [...] "There is {{a moment}} in each {{installment}} of Don Hertzfeldt's masterful trilogy of animated shorts where you feel something in your chest. It's an unmistakably cardiac event, the kind that great art can elicit when something profound and undeniably true is conveyed about the human condition. That's <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> to yourself: are stick figures supposed {{to make me feel}} this way? In the hands of a master, yes. And Hertzfeldt is to stick figures what Franz Liszt was to planks of ebony and ivory and what Ted Williams was to a stick of white ash: someone so transcendentally expert that to describe what they do in literal terms is borderline demeaning." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cohan {{became one}} of the leading Tin Pan Alley songwriters, {{publishing}} upwards of 300 original songs noted for their catchy melodies and clever lyrics.

2500|$|Elliott, later {{speaking}} about the session, said [...] "The technique I used on this man was {{to get him to}} completely relax. I got him started counting by ones, twos, threes, etc., to a hundred and then backwards. I had established in his mind that I was his friend. He knew he was in very serious trouble and he knew he was innocent. When he went under, he was counting by threes backward. He was completely relaxed. The critical stage is the next state <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> the subject is cataleptic. The longer you keep them in the state of catalepsy, the deeper they sink into the third state. I kept him ten minutes in this state of catalepsy. He {{was in a state of}} extreme exhaustion. Sweat was on his face. Observing that even Bill [...] was still somewhat skeptical of hypnosis, whether or not the man was truly hypnotized or faking, I resorted to a fail safe demonstration. Through suggestion, I removed all feeling, reflex actions, etc., from the subject's right arm and stuck a burning cigarette to his arm--absolutely no reaction. Bill was thoroughly convinced." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2003 Granada Television {{documentary}} titled Living with Michael Jackson, British journalist Martin Bashir interviewed Jackson extensively over {{a period}} of 8 months. The film was broadcast in the UK on February 3, 2003, and in the U.S. three days later. In one scene, Jackson introduces the Arvizo children and they talk happily about Gavin's unexpected recovery from cancer. Then Gavin and Jackson are interviewed together, Gavin holding Jackson's hand and at one point resting his head on Jackson's shoulder. At the trial, Gavin testified that Jackson initiated the hand-holding, but that he had put his head on Jackson's shoulder because he was [...] "really close to Jackson" [...] and Jackson was his [...] "best friend". In the video, Gavin tells Bashir about a night when he slept in Jackson's bed. He says that he and Jackson both offered to sleep on the floor and give each other the bed, but in the end Jackson slept on the floor while Gavin and Star slept in the bed. Jackson stated in the documentary that many children, including Macaulay Culkin, his younger brother Kieran, and his sisters had slept in Jackson's bed. When Bashir asked if Jackson could see why some people might disapprove, Jackson said, [...] "See, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> 'bed,' you're thinking sexual. They make that sexual. It's not sexual; we're going to sleep." ...|$|E
