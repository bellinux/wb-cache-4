25|$|Sequoyah first {{taught the}} syllabary to his six-year old daughter, Ayokeh (also spelled Ayoka), {{because he could}} not find adults <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> it. He {{traveled}} to the Indian Reserves in the Arkansaw Territory where some Cherokee had settled. When he tried to convince the local leaders of the syllabary's usefulness, they doubted him. Sequoyah asked each leader to say a word, which he wrote down, and then called his daughter in to read the words back. This demonstration convinced the leaders to let him teach the syllabary to a few more people. This took several months, during which it was rumored that he might be using the students for sorcery. After completing the lessons, Sequoyah wrote a dictated letter to each student, and read a dictated response. This test convinced the western Cherokee that he had created a practical writing system.|$|E

25|$|In general, Romansh is the {{dominant}} language {{in most of the}} Surselva. In the western areas, the Cadi and the Lumnezia, it is the language of a vast majority, with around 80% naming it as their language of best command, and it often being a daily language for virtually the entire population. In the eastern areas of the Gruob around Ilanz, German is significantly more dominant in daily life, though most people still use Romansh regularly. Romansh is still acquired by most children in the Cadi and Gruob even in villages where Romansh speakers are in the minority, since it is usually the language of instruction in primary education there. Even in villages where Romansh dominates, newcomers rarely learn Romansh however, as Sursilvan speakers quickly accommodate by switching to German, so that there is often little opportunity to practice Romansh even when people are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> it. Some pressure is often exerted by children, who will sometimes speak Romansh even with their non-Romansh-speaking parents.|$|E
500|$|The {{complete}} {{version of}} Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, {{consisting of the}} 24 collected monthly instalments, was published on 1 October 1861; it {{became one of the}} major publishing events of the nineteenth century. Isabella included an extensive 26-page [...] "Analytical Index" [...] in the book. Although not an innovation—it had been used in The Family Friend magazine since 1855—Hughes considers the index in the Book of Household Management to be [...] "fabulously detailed and exhaustively cross-referenced". Of the 1,112 pages, over 900 contained recipes. The remainder provided advice on fashion, child care, animal husbandry, poisons, the management of servants, science, religion, first aid and the importance in the use of local and seasonal produce. In its first year of publication, the book sold 60,000 copies. It reflected Victorian values, particularly hard work, thrift and cleanliness. Christopher Clausen, in his study of the British middle classes, sees that Isabella [...] "reflected better than anyone else, and for a larger audience, the optimistic message that mid-Victorian England was filled with opportunities for those who were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how to take advantage of them". The food writer Annette Hope thinks that [...] "one can understand its success. If... young ladies knew nothing of domestic arrangements, no better book than this could have been devised for them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The seminary {{accepted}} any pupil who was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn,</b> and {{is said to}} {{have welcomed}} pupils as young as three. [...] Frances Shimer herself had begun school at the age of two and a half. [...] During and after the US Civil War, female enrollment rose while male enrollment fell. [...] Facing space constraints due to rising demand, the formerly coeducational seminary limited residential study to women in 1866, although some men were still allowed as day students. [...] Despite an expressed intent to reopen the school to male students, it remained a women's school throughout the seminary period and did not become coeducational again until the modern Shimer College program was established in 1950.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{there had}} already been rumblings that Lind may not be present; {{in a letter to}} Lumley in April, the {{composer}} had warned the impresario that he [...] "would not put up with the slightest shortcoming" [...] and that he would withdraw the opera [...] "if my opera is not put on at the proper time and with everything done as it ought to be done" [...] An additional issue emerged. The travelers having reached Paris, Verdi heard rumours that Lind was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> new roles and, therefore, Muzio was sent across the English Channel ahead of the composer, who waited for an assurance that the soprano was in London and willing to proceed. From London, Muzio was able to give Verdi that assurance, informing him that Lind was ready and eager to go to work. Verdi continued his journey, crossing the Channel on 5 June.|$|E
