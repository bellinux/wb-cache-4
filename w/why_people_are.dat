The dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people walking over it, leading to blowout, the rapid wind erosion of the sand.

As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there is likely to be more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower-impact activities like bathing.|$|E

500|$|The {{stories of}} the {{original}} game's characters were written by Yoko, Shiba and Iwasaki, while the main game script was written by Sawako Natori, who {{would go on to}} co-write the main scenarios for future Drakengard games. Yoko designed the darker elements to both contrast and actively compete with the likes of Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. Yoko conceived the [...] "insane" [...] characters around the premise that people who killed hundreds of people in pursuit of their goals and took satisfaction from it were naturally insane. During the production of Nier, his focus changed to writing a story where everyone believed they were in the right whatever their actions. Through the series, Yoko has also been attempting to answer the question of <b>why</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> driven to kill. Although some of the dark narrative themes were kept for Drakengard 2, many of the other narrative elements were made more mainstream. Drakengard 3 was intended to return to a dark aesthetic, but also to include moments of humor and tie in with Nier.|$|E
500|$|It was {{not until}} a decade later that the album started to receive almost {{unanimous}} praise from rock critics, many of whom made particular note of its influence in modern rock music. Christgau wrote in his 1977 retrospective review for The Village Voice that the record was difficult to understand in 1967, [...] "which is probably <b>why</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> still learning from it. It sounds intermittently crude, thin, and pretentious at first, but it never stops getting better". In The Encyclopedia of Popular Music (1998), Colin Larkin called it a [...] "powerful collection" [...] that [...] "introduced Reed's decidedly urban infatuations, a fascination for street culture and amorality bordering on voyeurism." [...] In April 2003, Spin led their [...] "Top Fifteen Most Influential Albums of All Time" [...] list with the album. On November 12, 2000, NPR included it in their [...] "NPR 100" [...] series of [...] "the most important American musical works of the 20th century". Rolling Stone placed it at number 13 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time in November 2003, calling it the most prophetic rock album ever made.|$|E

500|$|Irreemplazable is {{primarily}} a R and Latin pop album. The Spanish-language songs from the EP were written by Cuban American composer Rudy Pérez and he wrote the lyrics phonetically to help Beyoncé perform the songs in Spanish. [...] "We spent hours and hours working on it. She {{wanted to make it}} perfect. She worked hard. That's <b>why</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> saying it sounds like she's fluent in Spanish", Perez added. Pérez changed some of the words in Spanish as he felt it they [...] "didn't fit the music" [...] and [...] "doesn't make sense". He assisted with Beyoncé on pronouncing her r's in Spanish. Irreemplazable opens with [...] "Amor Gitano", a duet with Alejandro Fernández originally from Fernández' fifteenth studio album, Viento a Favor. [...] "Listen", a theme song from Dreamgirls, in which Beyoncé appears, was re-recorded under the title [...] "Oye". The EP's title track is a Spanish version of [...] "Irreplaceable", a song that was highly successful in its English recording. Three recordings of [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] appear on Irreemplazable: a Spanish version (titled [...] "Bello Embustero"), a remixed English version and a Spanglish version.

500|$|Stevie is {{the privately}} educated {{daughter}} of rich parents, who have abandoned {{her to go}} travelling. [...] She {{is said to be}} clueless about real life, with her profile on the official E20 website describing her as generous, creative and unlucky in love, though she has a boyfriend. Although she is described as posh, Fairbank-Hynes said Stevie is not just like a posh girl in East London, but would be out of place anywhere as she is in her own world. Fairbank-Hynes opined that posh characters in Walford stand out and can bring comedy to the show. Stevie is very naive and, according to Fairbank-Hynes, [...] "away with the fairies"—the most naive person anyone could meet. However, writer Emer Kenny was worried that Stevie being [...] "away with the fairies" [...] would make her unrealistic, but said that Fairbank-Hynes made the character recognisable. Because of Stevie's naivety and her kind nature, people see this as an invitation to take advantage of her. Stevie does not understand <b>why</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> cruel to her because she sees the good in them and wants to look after them, be around people and mother them. Fairbank-Hynes commented, [...] "Stevie's {{the type of person who}} thinks a stranger is a friend she hasn't met yet". However, Stevie is very forward, which can scare people away. She is also creative, empathetic and a complete daydreamer who lacks common sense but has bursts of assertiveness and intelligence, which can surprise people. Thompson said that Stevie has a good balance as she can be ditzy but also quite smart. Fairbank-Hynes identified with the character's mad outbursts, innocence and daydreaming, and also said Stevie is quirky, lovely and eccentric. Her daydreaming can lead people to believe she is a bimbo, but she is not.|$|E
500|$|Merit is a [...] "beneficial and {{protective}} force which extends {{over a long}} period of time" [...] (B.J. Terwiel)—and is the effect of good deeds ( [...] , [...] ) done through physical action, words, or thought. As its Pāli language (the language of Theravada Buddhism, as practiced in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, etc.) definition indicates, this force is associated with goodness and purity of mind. In traditional Buddhist societies, it is believed that merit is more sustainable than that of magical rites, spirit worship or worldly power. The way merit works, is that acts of merit bring good and agreeable results, whereas demeritorious acts bring bad and disagreeable results. A mixture of the two generates mixed results in a person's life. This [...] (...) or [...] "automatic cosmic reaction" [...] (Brokaw) is a common idea found in Buddhist texts and Buddhist societies, and explains <b>why</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> different and lead different lives in many ways. Karma is self-regulatory and natural: it operates without divine intervention and human intention is fundamental to it. Internally, merit makes the mind happy and virtuous. Externally, present good circumstances, such as a long life, health and wealth, as well as the character and abilities someone is born with, arise from merits done in the past and vice versa, with demerits. The merits and demerits a person has done may take a while to bear fruit. Merit or demerit may cause a good or bad future respectively, including in the next lives to come. A bad destination after rebirth may be caused by demerit, but merely a lack of merit may also lead a person to be born in an unhappy destination. When someone is reborn in a happy destination, however, one can only stay there as long as merits last. Thus, it is stated in the Tipiṭaka that people cannot take anything with them when they die, except for whatever merit and demerit they have done, which will affect their future. Merit can be accumulated in different quantities, and stored up, but also has an impermanent character: it can run out. Summarizing from the Buddhist text Milinda Pañhā, some scholars conclude that merit is inherently stronger than demerit. Moreover, many merits together have the power to prevent demerits from having an effect, by pushing them [...] "to the back of the queue" [...] (Richard Gombrich), though demerits can never be undone.|$|E

The shark's electrical receptors, which pick up movement, detect signals like those emitted from fish wounded, for example, by someone who is spearfishing, leading the shark to attack the person by mistake.

2500|$|Mayfield's {{first solo}} album, Curtis, was {{released}} in 1970, and hit the top 20, {{as well as being}} a critical success. It pre-dated Marvin Gaye's album, What's Going On, which it has been compared to. The commercial and critical peak of his solo career came with Super Fly, the soundtrack to the blaxploitation Super Fly film. Unlike the soundtracks to other blaxploitation films (most notably Isaac Hayes' score for Shaft), which glorified the ghetto excesses of the characters, Mayfield's lyrics consisted of hard-hitting commentary on the state of affairs in black, urban ghettos at the time, as well as direct criticisms of several characters in the film. Bob Donat wrote in Rolling Stone magazine in 1972 that while the film's message [...] "was diluted by schizoid cross-purposes" [...] because it [...] "glamorizes machismo-cocaine consciousness... the anti-drug message on [...] is far stronger and more definite than in the film." [...] Because of the tendency of these blaxploitation films to glorify the criminal life of dealers and pimps in order to target a mostly black lower class audience, Mayfield's album set this movie apart. With songs like [...] "Freddie's Dead", a song that focuses on the demise of Freddie, a junkie that was forced into [...] "pushin' dope for the man" [...] because of a debt that he owed to his dealer, and [...] "Pusherman", a song that reveals how many people in the ghetto fell victim to drug abuse, and therefore became dependent upon their dealers, Mayfield illuminated a darker side of life in the ghetto that these blaxploitation films often failed to criticize. However, although Mayfield's soundtrack criticized the glorification of dealers and pimps, he in no way denied that this glorification was occurring. When asked about the subject matter of these films he was quoted stating [...] "I don’t see <b>why</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> complaining about the subject of these films”, and “The way you clean up the films is by cleaning up the streets.” ...|$|E
