40|$|This {{work is a}} part of {{a larger}} project {{together}} with Danisco Sugar AB, which tries to prevent compaction in the subsoil when using heavy sugar beet harvesters. The work is based on measuring the <b>water</b> <b>con</b> tent during a growing season (1997) and to calculate the water content with the simulation model SOIL. After that, the <b>water</b> <b>con</b> tent has been simulated from weather data for a longer period, and the risk for compaction in the autumn has been calculated. Agriculture has gone through a lot of changes since the second world war, for example the machines have become larger and heavier. The purpose of the project was to examine how often soil compaction in the subsoil should arise by measuring and calculating the <b>water</b> <b>con</b> tent. We have measured the water content every 14 th day during the growing season 1997 on two sites: Elvireborg east of Landskrona and Kronoslätt dose to Hemmesdynge in the very south of Sweden. At Elvireborg sampling was made in sugar beets and spring wheat, and at Kronoslätt in sugar beets and spring barley. The soil at Elvireborg is a sandy day loam with a porosity of 38 % (vol/vol) with 18, 4 % (vol/vol) water at permanent wilting point and 15, 6 % plant available water. The soil has a good hydraulic conductivity in the topsoil (O - 30 cm), but much lower in {{the lower part of the}} subsoil (60 - 100 cm). During dry summers the hydraulic conductivity will improve by crack formation. Kronoslätt is a sandy loam with a porosity of 36, 7 % with 12, 6 % (vol/vol) water at permanent wilting point and 20, 9 % plant available water. Kronoslätt has a strongly reduced hydraulic conductivity in the subsoil (30 - 100 cm) in comparison with the topsoil (O - 30 cm). An opened cylinder drill or an Ultuna drill was used to take out the soil samples to determine the water content at every 10 th centimeter to one meter depth. Soil cores were sampled to one meter depth to determine saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention. The water content was used to calibrate the simulation model (SOIL). Weather data for 1997 was collected from Jordberga sugar factory for Kronoslätt and from Svalöv weather station for Elvireborg. In the simulations the daily mean values were used for temperature, precipitation and sun radiation. Calculations have been done for changes in water content in 1997 and for the period 1963 - 1988 with 1997 as a calibration year. The precompression stress (Casagrande, 1936) was determined at four water tensions, and a logarithmic function was made between precompression stress and water tension. By combining this function with the soil water simulation, the susceptibility to compaction was estimated. The cereal crops took up less water than the sugar beets, and the sugar beets took up water during a longer period of the year, depending on a longer growing season. In the end of July practically all plant available water in the profile had been used in 1997. The measured <b>water</b> <b>con</b> tent was sometimes below permanent wilting point and lower than the simulated values. However, in general there was good correlation between measured and simulated values. Calculations were also made for the vertical soil stress in the soil, for a wheel load of 8 tons and 220 kPa ground contact pressure corresponding to a fully loaded sugar beet harvester. The soil was considered susceptible to compaction when the stress at a certain depth was higher than the precompression stress of the soil at that specific water content. Driving late in the autumn involves a big risk of compaction of the subsoil both at Elvireborg and Kronoslätt. From the middle of October there was a compaction risk in the subsoil at 50 cm depth for half of the years. In the results over the whole year, the Elvireborg site was more susceptible to subsoil compaction than Kronoslätt. This could be due to Kronoslätt being a more compact soil with a higher precompression stress...|$|R

Adequate knowledge of coning phenomena and breakthrough time {{is essential to}} overcome this issue. A series of experiments using fractured porous media models were conducted to investigate the effects of production process and pore structure characteristics on <b>water</b> <b>coning.</b> In addition, a hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was applied to predict breakthrough time of <b>water</b> <b>coning</b> {{as a function of}} production rate and physical model properties.

40|$|During the {{exploitation}} of bottom water oil reservoir, bottom <b>water</b> <b>coning</b> influences the breakthrough of bottom water significantly. Because water cut rises quickly after the breakthrough of bottom water, measures should be taken before the breakthrough to postpone production period without water, thus improving oil recovery. So accurate prediction of <b>water</b> <b>coning</b> profile and breakthrough time is very essential. Through mathematical derivation, this paper proposed a prediction method of bottom <b>water</b> <b>coning</b> profile and bottom water breakthrough time in bottom water reservoir without barrier. Based on theory of fluids flow in porous media, this paper assumes that the flow models are plane radial flow in opened intervals and spherical radial flow in unopened intervals.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is to further examine the <b>water</b> <b>coning</b> {{phenomenon}} in annular geometry in a horizontal well completion. This phenomenon {{is of particular interest}} to the oil & gas industry, as it may restrict production rates, and lead to reduced production effectiveness due to water carry-over. An overview of industry experience and a review of academic research conducted on the topic of <b>water</b> <b>coning</b> phenomenon is provided. The study has been carried out by conducting experiments of flow inside annular geometry of a horizontal well in a laboratory setup and by utilizing CFD simulations. The experimental findings provided valuable inputs for the CFD simulations, and the CFD simulations may in turn become a useful tool for testing ICD designs. Furthermore, this study provides a detailed analysis and comparison of analytical methods that can be utilized to predict critical flow rates. The experiments were conducted using a simple, yet effective, setup with a symmetric inflow of the liquids. It was based on a 2 D-principle giving good visualization of the experiments. The main emphasis was placed on the single orifice geometry, but geometries with two orifices were also used during the experiments. Two different oils were used: Nexbase 3080 due to its similarity to the North Sea oil regarding viscosity, andMarcol 52 to have an oil with a viscosity between those of water and Nexbase. A total 766 experimental runs were conducted. From these experiments the effect of <b>water</b> <b>coning</b> was studied in regard {{to the size of the}} annulus gap ±, the flow rate, the type of oil, different plate geometries with one and two outlet orifices, and the distance between the water level and the orifice. The results indicated that <b>water</b> <b>coning</b> features are highly dependent on and all of the parameters mentioned above. High flow rates and a short distance between the initial water level and the orifice, both give a high tendency of <b>water</b> <b>coning</b> and large water cuts. However, large annulus gaps lower the tendency of <b>water</b> <b>coning.</b> Nexbase oil with its high viscosity demonstrated a larger tendency to induce <b>water</b> <b>coning</b> than the less viscous Marcol oil. Low flow rates, large annulus gaps and large distances between the water level and the orificewillminimize the effect of <b>water</b> <b>coning.</b> A powerful and versatile CFD package that is well equipped to simulate coning phenomenon, ANSYS-CFX commercial code was utilized for running simulations. A total of 210 simulations were set up and conducted, both in 2 D and 3 D. For this research study, it was important to conduct a large number of simulations in order to correctly observe trends when changing the input variables. The simulations were all planned to ensure that an acceptable step size in variable changes was utilized. In this manner it was possible to stay within a reasonable number of simulations while still being able to uncover trends fromflow behaviour. The CFD-simulations conducted indicated that the two-dimensional modeling approach was effective to study <b>water</b> <b>coning</b> phenomenon, in that the simulations displayed the same underlying trends observed in the experiments, and required a relatively short amount of computational time. The main focus of the analytical aspect of this study is directed towards a pressure balance analysis. However, dimensional analysis was utilized to forge a correlation for the critical flow rate. The comparisons of the different analyticalmethods indicate that the dimensional analysis approachmay provide valuable insight to critical flow rates. Comparisons with experimental data suggest that the analytical expression derived from pressure balances leads to a largely varying magnitude of discrepancy depending on the case in question...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to follow the changes in soil <b>water</b> <b>con</b> tent during the growing period, in a spring sown crop and in sugar beets. Two sites with different soil types were used during the period of growth 1997. The method used was to take soil samples for gravimetric water content every two weeks in 10 cm layers to 1 m depth. Saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention was determined on soil cores in each 10 cm layer to l m depth. Meteorological data was collected from nearby weather stations. The calculated evaporation from the crop was compared with the potential. The water content in the subsoil changed more slowly than in the topsoil. The cereal crop absorbed more water than the sugar beets until the middle of the summer, but during late summer and autumn the water content in the soil was lower in the sugar beets than in the cereal crop. At both sites the profile was practically emptied on plant accessible water down to l meter during the summer. At one of the sites the calculated transpiration from 6 July to 8 August was approximately half of the potential, which indicates that the crops suffered from drought. At harvest time of the cereal crop the soil had low <b>water</b> <b>con</b> tent. The <b>water</b> content in the sugar beet field was larger at the time of harvest of the sugar beets. At harvest time of the cereal crop there was little risk of subsoil compaction because of the low soil water content.

40|$|Therefore was {{objected to}} {{identify}} the effects of acute supplementation of caffeine with 8 and 16 mg. kg- 1 in hematological and immunological parameters {{and the performance of}} the Wistar rats submitted in intense exercise until exhaustion. Materials and Methods: was selected 24 Wistar male rats, adults and sedentary with average weight of 174. 86 + 8. 26 g and were randomly divided in control group (<b>water)</b> <b>CON</b> (n= 8), CAF 8 (n= 8) (8 mg/kg) e CAF 16 (n= 8) (16 mg/kg) administered the caffeine by gavage 30 minutes before the begin of experiment. The swimming happened in an aquarium with 60 cm of depth, water at 28 °C, until the exhaustion with overload of 7. 5 % from their weight and immediately euthanized for the withdrawal of 1 ml of their blood for lab analyzes. Results: 8 mg. kg- 1 e 16 mg. kg- 1 do not change the performance and the last do not change both parameters. The supplementation whit 8 mg. kg- 1 of caffeine was able only increase the platelets count (p< 0. 05) and tended decrease the immunosuppressive tendency. Conclusions 8 mg. kg- 1 of caffeine was able of increase the platelets account and decrease the immunosuppressive tendency of exhaustive exercise, but, do not shows be able in increase performance and 16 mg/kg of caffeine do not change all investigated parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the effects of food form and physicochemical properties of protein snacks on appetite and subsequent food intake in healthy adults. Twelve healthy subjects received a standardized breakfast and then 2. 5 h post-breakfast consumed the following snacks, in randomized order: 0 kcal <b>water</b> (<b>CON)</b> or 96 kcal whey protein snacks as beverages with a pH of either 3. 0 (Bev- 3. 0) or 7. 0 (Bev- 7. 0) or gels as acid (Gel-Acid) or heated (Gel-Heated). In-vitro study showed that Bev- 3. 0 was more resistant to digestion than Bev- 7. 0, while Gel-Acid and Gel-Heated had similar digestion pattern. Appetite questionnaires were completed every 20 min until an ad libitum lunch was provided. Post-snack hunger, desire to eat, and prospective food consumption were lower following the beverages and gels vs. CON (all, p < 0. 05), and post-snack fullness was greater following the snacks (except for the Bev- 3. 0) vs. CON (all, p < 0. 05). Gel-Heated treatment led to lower prospective food consumption vs. Bev- 3. 0; however, no other differences were detected. Although all snacks reduced energy intake vs. CON, no differences were observed among treatments. This study suggested that whey protein in either liquid or solid form improves appetite, but the physicochemical property of protein has a minimal effect...|$|R
