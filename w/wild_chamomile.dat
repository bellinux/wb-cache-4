40|$|Common lambsquarters, cleavers, ladysthumb and <b>wild</b> buckwheat, <b>chamomile,</b> mercury, foolsparsleey and {{volunteer}} rapes are {{only some of}} the most important weeds in fooder and sugar beets. For the control of classical weed societies farmers can fall back on a limited number of active ingredients. Generally, Phenmedipham (PMP), Desmedipham (DMP) and Ethofumesate are the basis of a spray sequence. They are complemented with other active ingredients depending on the specific weed situation. The newly formulated BELVEDERE® Extra combines the three mentioned active ingredients in an optimal ratio. Hence, the herbicide covers a very broad weed spectrum with an excellent efficacy on Common lambsquarters, cleavers, ladysthumb and wild buckwheat. BELVEDERE® EXTRA is a liquid, selective, and systemic herbicide. It is formulated as suspoemulsion so that a high efficacy is achieved while preserving a very good selectivity. The product allows for flexible control of leaf activity as an additive (e. g. OLEO FC) is appended. Ethofumesate, which is mainly effective via the roots of the plant, belongs to a different HRAC group than Phenmedipham and Desmedipham. The high concentration of 200 g/L Ethofumesate leads to an effective resistance management especially regarding Fathen and other important weeds. Since 23 rd of September 2013 BELVEDERE® extra is registered for post emergence splitting application (3 applications) against annual dicotyledonous weeds. The maximum application rate per treatment is 1, 3 L/ha. In combination with GOLTIX® TITAN® (Metamitron + Quinmerac) or Goltix® Gold (Metamitron) the weed spectrum is broadened. Basically, a timely application whose application rates are adapted to the location is essential for a good efficacy of beet herbicides...|$|R
40|$|Infant {{botulism}} is a {{very rare}} neuroparalytic disease that can occur in babies under two years of age, caused by ingestion of Clostridium botulinum, an ubiquitous gram positive bacilli that grows better under anaerobic, low salt and low acid conditions. The spores formed by this bacterium are not inactivated, unless the food is heated under high pressure to 121 ºC, for at least 20 minutes. This rare occurrence {{is due to the}} toxin produced by the bacteria, after ingestion of the spores and their germination in the infant’s intestine. Those neurotoxins interfere with the presynaptic release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. The first case detected in Portugal occurred in 2009. The patient was a boy aged one month. The child was breastfed, but sometimes his parents used to give him <b>wild</b> herbal <b>chamomile</b> infusion and honey. After refusing to eat for three days, the boy was taken to the Hospital, with the symptoms overlapping with botulism. The laboratory identification was performed using mouse bioassay, according to standard procedures issued by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta, USA. Type B botulinum toxin was detected in the infant´s faeces sample. Clostridium botulinum type B was isolated from the faeces as well as from honey and chamomile herbs samples. In contrast to foodborne botulism, associated to the ingestion of botulinum toxin pre-formed in foods, infant botulism occurs after ingestion of the spores and subsequent production of the toxin in the children’s intestine because of their still weak defences. One way to prevent this disease is not to give honey and wild herbal tea to the infants under two years of age...|$|R
40|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>chamomile</b> (Matricaria chamomilla L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular herbal {{materials}} with both internal and external use to cure different health disturbances. As a consequence of its origin, chamomile could carry various microbial contaminants which offer different hazards to the final consumer. Reduction of the microbial load to the in force regulation limits represents an important phase in the technological process of vegetal materials, and the electron beam treatment might be an efficient alternative to the classical methods of hygienic quality assurance. The purpose of the study was to analyze the potential application of the electron beam treatment in order to assure the microbial safety of the <b>wild</b> <b>chamomile.</b> Samples of chamomile dry inflorescences were treated in electron beam (e-beam) of 6 MeV mean energy, at room temperature and ambient pressure. Some loss of the chemical compounds with bioactive role could be noticed, but the number of microorganisms decreased as a function on the absorbed dose. Consequently, the microbial quality of studied vegetal material inflorescences was improved by e-beam. irradiation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Gembloux, Belgium Chemical weeding in {{agriculture}} increasingly raises environmental, health and economic preoccupations. European authorities {{has set up}} legislations (directive 91 / 414, settlement 1107 / 2009, directive 2009 / 128) aiming to reduce risks related {{to the use of}} pesticides and encouraging integrated pest management. This situation leads professionals and scientists to take interest in the biology and population dynamics of weeds and to study the impacts of integrated pest management on weeds and crops. Tillage can potentially be an efficient weed control method in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). We studied <b>wild</b> <b>chamomile</b> (Matricaria chamomilla L.) population dynamics and crop yields in an experimental winter wheat crop, in relation to tillage methods. Five modalities (i. e. different combinations of a stubble cultivator and/or a moldboard plow, including a no-tillage control) were applied during three years (2009 - 2012), with four replications, in Gembloux (Belgium). In each plot, M. chamomilla density was recorded throughout the seasons. In summer 2012, <b>wild</b> <b>chamomile</b> density was significantly lower in plots tilled with a moldboard plow. The use of a stubble cultivator did not significantly affect M. chamomilla density. In addition, we found higher wheat yields in ploughed plots, indicating that the decrease in M. chamomilla density reduced competition for wheat. To confirm these results, experiments are still under investigation in similar conditions. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{chromatography}} (GC) and GC–mass spectrometry {{are used}} to identify a new sesqiterpene, β-eudesmol, {{which seems to be}} a characteristic essential oil component of the intact and in vitro organized root of chamomile [Chamomilla recutita (L.) Rauschert]. It is identified on three types of stationary phases by GC. The confirmation of identity is carried out by comparison of mass spectra with those reported in the literature and measured from a reference compound. The percentage evaluation of the oil component is made by area normalization, on the basis of three parallel measurements.

The increasing interest in optical imaging techniques and the development of related technologies have made possible the investigation of the optical properties of several compounds. Luminescent properties of essential oils have not been extensively investigated. We evaluated the luminescent and fluorescent emissions of several essential oils, in order to detect them in living organisms by exploiting their optical properties. Some fluorescent emission data were high enough to be detected in dermal treatments. Consequently, we demonstrated how the fluorescent signal can be monitored for at least three hours on the skin of living mice treated with <b>wild</b> <b>chamomile</b> oil. The results encourage development of this technique to investigate the properties of drugs and cosmetics containing essential oils...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chamomile is {{medicinal}} and hygienic plants {{which have}} anti -inflammatory and anti-spasmodic characteristics. Its secondary metabolites (and etc.) were varied by biodiversity and environmental effect. There is little {{information about the}} <b>wild</b> <b>chamomile</b> in natural habitats of the Bushehr province. In this study, different chamomile species were selected for essential oil content and active substances. Material and methods: In this field study, several samples of chamomile from different natural habitats were collected and screened for extraction of essential oil and secondary metabolites. The essential oil and methanolic extract were prepared by water distillation liquid and flask reflux condenser stirrer, respectively these were determined by the United States and Iran pharmacopeia methods. Essential oil and methanolic extract were analyzed by GC/Mass and HPLC devices, respectively. Results: Four species, Anthemis pseudocotula, Anthemis austro-iranica, Matricaria recotita and Matricaria aurea were indicated based on screening methods. Matricaria species was observed to have essential oil and beneficiary secondary metabolites, but were not observed {{to be present in}} Anthemis species. Results of the chemical analysis showed that, Matricaria species contained Essential oil (0. 6 %), Apigenin 7 -Glycoside (0. 62 %), Chamazulen (5. 5 %) and other substances such as derivatives of Bisabolole, Bisaboleneand Farenzene. Conclusion: Two species of wild chamomiles, Matricaria recotita and Matricaria aurea, were found in Bushehr province containing significant amount of essential oil and secondary metabolites such as Chamazulen, -αBisabolole and Apigenin. Thus these species can be cultivated for commercial proposes...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} and profitability of solarization for weed control in strawberry (Cv. Chandler and Camarosa) in Turkey was investigated. Two trial sites were selected and a Randomized Complete Block Design with four replicates was used. Prior to planting, fields were cultivated and irrigated and raised beds were prepared. Both the raised beds and the soil between them {{were covered with}} clear plastic sheets {{in order to increase}} soil temperature due to exposure to the sun. Mean soil temperature of solarized areas at 5 cm soil depth was 47. 5 �C, which was about 10 �C higher than non-solarized areas. This increased temperature was maintained for 45 - 50 days before transplanting After transplanting, the beds were mulched with black polythene sheets. Weeds were counted before and after mulching (at 3 - 4 dates), both on the bed around the strawberry transplants and between the raised beds. Data were analyzed using the student t-test within each field. Results showed that solarization reduced the population of common weeds including common purslane, annual bluegrass, redroot pigweed, wild radish and <b>wild</b> <b>chamomile</b> more than 99 % compared to untreated controls. Horseweed was not controlled by solarization. The costs of buying and laying clear plastic sheeting for solarization were significantly lower than the costs of labor for hand-weeding and for herbicides, which are normally used. Calculations indicated that profitability increased by $ 470 /ha using solarization only for weed control in strawberry rather than other methods...|$|E
40|$|By {{naturally}} occurring gene-transformation Ri-plasmids of Agrobacterium rhizogenes have been {{integrated into the}} plant genome of Chamomillo recutita, thereby inducing the formation of hairy roots. Clones with the best biosynthetic potential were multiplied for phytochemical investigations. The amounts of terpenoid and polyene compounds in the genetically transformed cultures were compared with those in in-vivo plants. In Hungary a <b>wild</b> <b>chamomile</b> population was found which contained significant amount of (-) -alpha-bisabolol in the oil from the inflorescence. We used biotechnological methods to preserve the genome of this wild type. Transformed chamomile root cultures were obtained by infection of sterile organized cultures with Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains #A- 4,# 15834, and #R- 1601. Hairy roots freed from bacteria were cultivated on solid medium and then in liquid, hormone-free, B 5 and MS media. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the essential oil was examined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The volatile compounds were identified by comparing their retention times with those of authentic standards and of essential oils of known composition, and by peak enrichment. Confirmation of identity was achieved by comparison of mass spectra with those {{reported in the literature}} and those of reference compounds. The amount of each component {{as a percentage of the}} total was determined by area normalization. GC and GC-MS studies showed that genetically transformed chamomile cultures generated the terpenoid and polyene compounds most characteristic of the parent plant. The main components of hairy root cultures were trans-beta-farnesene, alpha-farnesene, geranyl isovalerate, and cedrol. We identified beta-selinene as a new component of the genetically transformed cultures...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} Chamomilla recutita (L.) Rauschert {{is made up}} by several groups of active substances, among which terpenoids in the inflorescences are of {{greatest}} importance. Among cultivated species, the Hungarian BK- 2 contains more chamazulene in its essential oil than the German Degumil type, which is mainly cultivated for its (-) -alpha-bisabolol. Both components have important antiinflammatory activities. Among <b>wild</b> <b>chamomile</b> populations in Hungary, a population {{was found in the}} area of Szabadkigyos containing significant amounts-on average 48 %-of (-) -alpha-bisabolol in its inflorescence oil. In vitro cultures were made from this population to obtain propagation material containing a high number of active substances. The intact roots contained no (-) -alpha-bisabolol but the sesquiterpene alcohol beta-eudesmol as new compound was identified by our group. Sterile plantlets, cultured in vitro, were multiplied for phytochernical investigations. Pharmacologically important compounds of the essential oils were followed in great detail. The amount of in vitro cultured terpenoids and polyin compounds was compared with that of in vivo plants. These volatile compounds were identified by comparing their retention times with those of authentic standards, essential oils of known composition and peak enrichment. The confirmation of identity was done by comparison of their mass spectra with those reported in the literature and reference compounds. The percentage evaluation of each component was made by area normalisation. Gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS) showed that sterile chamomile cultures generated the most important terpenoid and polyin compounds characteristic of the parent plant. We identified germacrene-D, berkheyaradulene, 4 -(2 ', 4, 4 '-trimethyl-bicyclo[4. 1. 0]hept- 2 '-en- 3 '-yl) - 3 -buten- 2 -one, geranyl-isovalerate and cedrol as new components in these sterile cultures.
