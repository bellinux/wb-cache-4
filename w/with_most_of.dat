The Japanese, for their part, mistakenly believed that they had heavily damaged two U.S. carriers, instead of just one.

5|$|As Cannon—along <b>with</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the {{defensive}} starters—returned, LSU {{was expected to}} compete for another title in 1959. The Tigers began the season as the top-ranked team, {{and the number of}} season-ticket holders tripled compared to the previous season. The team won its first six games without allowing a touchdown. Cannon showed his versatility in those games; he led the team in total yards on offense, returned an interception for a touchdown on defense, and averaged 40 yards per punt while also returning punts and kickoffs. This set up a highly anticipated match-up between LSU and rival Ole Miss Rebels, who were also undefeated.|$|E
