5|$|Baroness Gisela von Donner {{had refused}} to marry Galland as the {{restrictions}} imposed upon her by her former husband's will <b>would</b> <b>deny</b> her the wealth and freedom she had enjoyed. She left for Germany in 1954. Galland married Sylvinia von Dönhoff on 12 February 1954. However, {{she was unable to}} have children and they divorced on 10 September 1963.|$|E
5|$|These three Native American {{leaders were}} the first to be tried, for raids (Warren Wagon Train Raid) and murder, in a United States civil court instead of a {{military}} court. This <b>would</b> <b>deny</b> them any vestige of rights as prisoners of war by being tried as any common criminal in the Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District of Texas in Jacksboro, Texas near Fort Richardson.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{ordered that}} no more {{transport}} flights be made. Albert Kesselring complained that this <b>would</b> <b>deny</b> the Axis forces vital supplies, and Göring once again permitted flights. This time they were to travel via Sardinia, {{but no more than}} 60–70 flights would be allowed per night; some 250 had been mounted daily before Flax. The transports also had to run the gauntlet of radar-equipped Bristol Beaufighters but these rarely were successful at intercepting them.|$|E

5|$|Kant's Formula of Autonomy {{expresses the}} idea that an agent is obliged to follow the Categorical Imperative because of their {{rational}} will, rather than any outside influence. Kant believed that any moral law motivated {{by the desire to}} fulfill some other interest <b>would</b> <b>deny</b> the Categorical Imperative, leading him to argue that the moral law must only arise from a rational will. This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that, as moral laws must be universalisable, what is required of one person is required of all.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} {{target was}} RAF Fighter Command. The service's destruction <b>would</b> <b>deny</b> the British their air superiority asset. Throughout July and early August, the Germans made preparations for Adlertag. The {{date of the}} assault was postponed several times because of bad weather. Eventually, it was carried out on 13 August 1940. The German attacks on 13 August inflicted significant damage and casualties on the ground, but, marred by poor intelligence and communication, they {{did not make a}} significant impression on Fighter Command's ability to defend British air space.|$|E
5|$|To achieve this, both {{divisions}} {{would be}} dropped {{near the village}} of Hamminkeln, and were tasked with a number of objectives: they were to seize the Diersfordter Wald, a forest that overlooked the Rhine, including a road linking several towns together; several bridges over a smaller waterway, the River Issel, were to be seized to facilitate the advance; and the village of Hamminkeln was to be captured. The Diersfordter Wald was chosen by Lieutenant-General Dempsey, the British Second Army commander, as the initial objective because its seizure <b>would</b> <b>deny</b> the Germans artillery positions from which they could disrupt Second Army's bridging operations. Once these objectives were taken, the airborne troops would consolidate their positions and await the arrival of Allied ground forces, defending the territory captured against the German forces known to be in the area.|$|E

5|$|After its {{removal from}} Operation Varsity, the {{division}} remained in reserve as the Allied armies advanced even further into Germany, moving to Oise, France, on 3 April for supply and administrative tasks. The division {{was scheduled to}} participate in several other airborne operations; however, these were all cancelled before they could take place. The first of these was Operation Arena, which envisioned landing between six and ten divisions into what was termed a 'strategic airhead' in the Kassel region of Northern Germany; the planners of the operations envisioned that the operation <b>would</b> <b>deny</b> a large swathe of territory to the German defenders and give the Allied armies a staging area for further advances into Germany. The 13th was chosen to participate, along with the 17th, 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and the British 6th and 1st Airborne Divisions. A preliminary date for 1 May was set for the operation once all of the required airborne and air-landed infantry divisions had been located and supplied, but it was ultimately cancelled on 26 March due to the rapid movement of Allied ground forces negating {{the need for the}} operation. Two other airborne operations were planned to include the 13th. Operation Choker II was to be an airborne landing on the east bank of the Rhine near Worms, Germany; planning for the operation got to an advanced stage, and the division was only hours from taking off from airfields in France when the operation was cancelled due to Allied ground forces overrunning the proposed landing areas. Operation Effective was designed to land the 13th south of Stuttgart, seize a nearby airfield and create an airhead for further forces to land in near the Black Forest. The operation was scheduled for 22 April, but was cancelled on 18 April due to Allied units encircling the Black Forest region and making it unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{accounts}} of the subsequent battle: the account of Wen Daya, and a later official account, which became the dominant version in traditional Chinese historiography. The latter was compiled {{during the reign of}} Li Shimin, and therefore enhances his own role, having him decide the battle in a cavalry charge, while denigrating the role of both his father and his elder brother Li Jiancheng, whom Li Shimin would murder and supplant on the throne. The two accounts are difficult to reconcile, but Wen Daya's account, despite its own inadequacies, is to be preferred as an eyewitness testimony. According to Wen Daya, Li Yuan feared that Song Laosheng <b>would</b> <b>deny</b> battle and instead force him to engage in a prolonged and costly siege of the town. For this reason, as soon as the headquarters with the cavalry cleared the hills and came into view of Huoyi in the early afternoon of 8 September, Li Yuan sent his sons {{at the head of the}} cavalry to manoeuvre before the walls of Huoyi, hoping to entice the Sui army to come out. In this he hoped to exploit Song Laosheng's reputation for rashness. The slower-moving infantry, which formed bulk of Li Yuan's army, was still in the process of traversing the hills, and Li Yuan sent officers to hurry them up. Song Laosheng, who may have seen this as an opportunity to destroy his enemy piecemeal, deployed his army outside the town wall, but proved reluctant to advance further, and had to be goaded further away from the town through a feigned retreat by the cavalry.|$|E
25|$|If M is {{the cause}} of M∗, then M∗ is over{{determined}} because M∗ can also be thought of as being determined by P. One escape route that a strong emergentist could take would be to deny downward causation. However, this <b>would</b> <b>deny</b> that emergent mental states must supervene on physical states, which in turn <b>would</b> <b>deny</b> physicalism, and thus be unpalatable for some philosophers and physicists.|$|E

25|$|The Revolutionary Settlement {{gave the}} Commons control over {{finances}} and legislation {{and changed the}} relationship between the Executive and the Legislature. For want of money, Sovereigns had to summon Parliament annually and could no longer dissolve or prorogue it without its advice and consent. Parliament became a permanent feature of political life. The veto fell into disuse because Sovereigns feared that if they denied legislation, Parliament <b>would</b> <b>deny</b> them money.

25|$|Some {{religious}} groups argue that having the government decide whether a same-sex marriage should be legally binding {{on the grounds}} of the ideology of other {{religious groups}} restricts their religious freedom. They argue that marriage is a religious term that should not be defined by the government. Where same-sex marriage is recognized in the United States, no church or other religious institution is forced to perform same-sex marriages, but the FMA <b>would</b> <b>deny</b> the opportunity for religions which approve of same-sex marriage to perform legally binding same-sex marriages.|$|E

25|$|Braddock {{suffered}} from {{problems with his}} arthritic hands after injuries throughout his career and, in 1936, his title defense in Madison Square Garden against the German Max Schmeling was canceled under suspicious circumstances. Braddock argued he would have received only a US$25,000 purse against Schmeling, compared to $250,000 against rising star Joe Louis. There was also concern that if Schmeling won, the Nazi government <b>would</b> <b>deny</b> American fighters opportunities {{to fight for the}} title. Finally, American commentators had expressed opposition to the fight in light of the connections between Schmeling and Adolf Hitler, with whom the German fighter had been associated after his earlier victory over Louis.|$|E
25|$|Israel's {{military}} {{options were}} pondered by its leadership {{during the second}} truce, and the Bernadotte Plan prompted the government and army to decide to concentrate the next effort on the southern front. The Operation, codenamed The Ten Plagues, was meant to open a permanent ground connection to the Negev, and gradually encircle the Egyptian forces in the Majdal – Bayt Jibrin corridor by creating wedges that <b>would</b> <b>deny</b> the Egyptians free movements between their main troop concentrations. This was the approach favored by Yigal Allon, head of the Southern Command, which mostly won over the General Staff's proposals to directly assault the large Egyptian concentrations.|$|E
25|$|On August 14, 2009, PNC {{took over}} Dwelling House Savings & Loan and its only branch {{location}} in Pittsburgh's Hill District after Dwelling House failed and was placed under receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Dwelling House {{had been known}} in Pittsburgh to provide low-income African Americans loans that other banks <b>would</b> <b>deny,</b> and had fended off receivership from the FDIC as recently as June 2009 through community fundraisers. PNC closed the former Dwelling House branch shortly after assuming Dwelling House's assets, with accounts transferred to the pre-existing PNC branch in the Hill District.|$|E
