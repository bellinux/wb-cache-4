When the streamer is disrupted by the flux-rope, it will evolve into a configuration resembling the typical observed loop-like Coronal Mass Ejection (CMES) for both cases.

40|$|Casein-gelatin beads {{have been}} {{prepared}} by emulsification extraction method and cross-linked with D,L-glyceraldehyde in an acetone water mixture 3 : 1 (v/v). Casein emulsifying properties cause air bubble incorporation {{and the formation of}} large holes in the beads. The high porosity of the matrix influences the bead properties such as drug loading, drug release and floatation. These effects have been stressed by comparison with low porous beads, artificially prepared <b>without</b> <b>cavities.</b> The percentage of casein in the matrix increases the drug loading of both low and high porous matrices, although the loading of high porous matrices is lower than that of low porous matrices. As a matter of fact, the drug should be more easily removed during washing and recovery because of the higher superficial pore area of the beads. This can explain the drug release rate increase, observed in high porous matrix, in comparison with beads <b>without</b> <b>cavities.</b> This is due to the rapid diffusion of the drug through water filled ports. The study shows that cavities act as an air reservoir and enable beads to float. Therefore, casein seems to be a material suitable to the inexpensive formation of an air reservoir for floating systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Behaviors of {{premixed}} CH 4 /air flame in mesoscale channels {{with and}} <b>without</b> <b>cavities</b> were experimentally investigated. No stable symmetric flame {{was observed in}} the channel <b>without</b> <b>cavities</b> and flame is prone to inclining and pulsating. In contrast, flame can be effectively anchored {{in the presence of}} cavities. When the inlet velocity is increased sufficiently high, curved fluctuating flame front appears. Blow-off limits of the channel with cavities are several times larger than the corresponding burning velocity of incoming CH 4 /air mixture, while the flashback limits are almost the same as the straight channel counterparts. These indicate that the cavities have a strong ability to extend the operational range of inlet velocity. Numerical simulation demonstrates that combined effects, i. e., the formation of recirculation zone and low velocity zone in the cavities, preferential diffusion effect, as well as the preheating effect of upstream inner walls, are major mechanisms responsible for flame stabilization. Furthermore, numerical result reveals that large strain rate and heat loss rate exist at the transition point between the ramped cavity wall and the downstream inner wall, which results in flame splitting at high inlet velocity due to local extinction, and eventually leads to flame blow-off. In summary, the combustion behaviors in the mesoscale channel with cavities strongly depend on the interactions between the reaction zone, conjugate heat exchange and flow field.

The disk affects the spectral energy distribution most strongly at edge-on inclinations, causing a broad dip at about 10 µm (independent of the silicate feature) due to high extinction and low scattering albedo in this wavelength region. The bipolar cavities allow more direct stellar+disk radiation to emerge into polar directions, and more scattering radiation to emerge into all directions.
