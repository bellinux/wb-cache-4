It reviews previous ideological assessments of the two organizations and applies qualitative and quantitative content analysis of annual <b>World</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Reports</b> published by the World Bank and Human <b>Development</b> <b>Reports</b> issued by the United Nations Development Programme to examine their development discourse. Analysis of fifty-seven reports from 1978 to 2011 reveals two major findings.

The 2012 <b>World</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Report</b> (WDR) noted that women in developing nations experience greater mortality rates than men in developing nations. Additionally, women in developing countries have a much higher risk of maternal death than those in developed countries. The highest risk of dying during childbirth is 1 in 6 in Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, compared to nearly 1 in 30,000 in Sweden--a disparity that {{is much greater than}} that for neonatal or child mortality.|$|E

A 2010 study by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reported that 62 percent of Chileans are opposed to full gender equality. Many of those surveyed expressed the belief that women should limit themselves to the traditional roles of mother and wife.

2500|$|The welfare {{model has}} been rooted into Western {{developmental}} practices since the 20th century. [...] In the welfare model, poverty {{is defined as the}} absence of a public good or knowledge. If the state or another vehicle, such as an NGO, provides the absent good, then poverty can be alleviated and development will occur. [...] Billions of dollars have been poured into this approach, however despite some achievements there has not been success with this model. The gap between the rich and poor is widening and according to the <b>World</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Report,</b> nearly half of the world's population live on less than $2 a day.|$|E
2500|$|WHO {{has defined}} health as [...] "a state of {{complete}} physical, mental, and social well-being {{and not merely}} the absence of disease or infirmity." [...] Identified by the 2012 <b>World</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Report</b> as one of two key human capital endowments, health can influence an individual’s ability to reach his or her full potential in society. Yet while gender equality has made the most progress {{in areas such as}} education and labor force participation, health inequality between men and women continues to plague many societies today. While both males and females face health disparities, girls and women experience a majority of health disparities. This {{comes from the fact that}} many cultural ideologies and practices have structured society in a way whereby women are more vulnerable to abuse and mistreatment, making them more prone to illnesses and early death. Women are also restricted from receiving many opportunities, such as education and paid labor, that can help improve their accessibility to better health care resources.|$|E
2500|$|At birth, boys outnumber {{girls with}} {{the ratio of}} 105 or 106 male to 100 female children. However, after conception, biology favors women. Research has shown that if men and women {{received}} similar nutrition, medical attention, and general health care, women would live longer than men. This is because women, on a whole, are more resistant to diseases and less prone to debilitating genetic conditions. However, despite medical and scientific research that shows that when given the same care as males, females tend to have better survival rates than males, the ratio of women to men in developing regions such as South Asia, West Asia, and China can be as low as 0.94, or even lower. This deviation from the natural male to female sex ratio {{has been described by}} Indian philosopher and economist Amartya Sen as the [...] "missing women" [...] phenomenon. According to the 2012 <b>World</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Report,</b> the number of missing women is estimated to be about 1.5 million women per year, with a majority of the women missing in India and China.|$|E

In doing so, it presents evidence of a significant role for distance in determining these disparities, especially within the municipality’s Southeast wing. The evidence of a role for density is more mixed, however, with findings of agglomeration econ-omies depending on the method of estimation used. These results have important policy implications both for the municipality itself and China overall...|$|R
