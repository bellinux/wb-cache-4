He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E

In 1968, he told Guitar Player magazine that electric blues artists Muddy Waters, Elmore James, and B.B.

Of Muddy Waters, the first electric guitarist of which Hendrix became aware, he said: [...] "I heard one of his records <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy and it scared me to death because I heard all of these sounds." [...] In 1970, he told Rolling Stone that he was a fan of western swing artist Bob Wills and while he lived in Nashville, the television show the Grand Ole Opry.|$|E

[...] While on the DL, Hirsh spent a number of weeks in a strengthening program and at extended spring training in Tucson, Arizona, to rebuild his arm strength.

2500|$|In 1979, Lee {{accepted}} {{the role of}} Karen Fairgate on Knots Landing, a spin-off of the immensely popular Dallas. Though slow to start, the series eventually became a ratings hit {{and became one of}} the longest-running American primetime dramas ever, lasting for a total of 14 seasons from 1979 - 1993. Due to her long-running tenure, Lee's alter ego is often credited as being the center of the program. Television personality Joan Rivers commented that Lee was, in theory, the [...] "First Lady of Knots Landing" [...] during her guest appearance on The Late Show, which Rivers hosted at the time. The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying: [...] "Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, maybe people don't remember, but remember when we could go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back door? I remember <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl and my mother and father would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house." [...] Lee was the only performer to appear in all of the show's 344 episodes.|$|E
