5|$|After initial aliveness {{testing that}} showed no issues, STIS <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> {{functional}} testing, and issues were seen when the telescope put itself into safe mode {{due to a}} low thermal limit sensor. Ground controllers at Goddard would restart the testing once the thermal limit sensor was back in normal sensor range, but it is believed the component is in good shape.|$|E

5|$|After {{initially}} {{making good}} returns for investors, the CLR suffered {{a decline in}} passenger numbers due to increased competition from other underground railway lines and new motorised buses. In 1913, it {{was taken over by}} the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), operator of the majority of London's underground railways. In 1933 the CLR <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> public ownership along with the UERL.|$|E
5|$|After the discovery, Libby Sheldon of University College London {{conducted}} several {{tests to}} verify the painting's age, including spectroscopy and laser microscopy. The age of the inscription <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> consideration, and found to be contemporaneous {{with the rest of}} the painting. Pigments, including a type of yellow pigment rarely found after 1600, were appropriate for the 16th century. Dendrochronological analysis later showed that the work was too late to be a life portrait of Jane, but did not rule out the possibility of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of 1997, the {{municipal}} council granted NOK3.2 million to lay artificial turf at Dælenenga. Construction started in May and the pitch <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> use on 4 September 1997. The new turf was Belgian-manufactured, sand-filled Superfoot 32. The upgrade {{also saw the}} first upgrades to the terraces in the stadium's history. New artificial turf was laid in 2008.|$|E

50|$|Five lead {{changes were}} made (consisting of Ned Jarrett, Darel Dieringer, Billy Wade, and Ned Jarrett). After one hour and thirty-two minutes of racing, Billy Wade managed to defeat LeeRoy Yarbrough by six seconds in front of 10,000 live spectators (approximately 24% of the racetrack's modern capacity). The total prize purse handed out for this racing event was $6,395 ($ when {{inflation}} <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> effect); Billy Wade received $1,400 of it ($ when inflation <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> effect) while Lee Petty received a meager $150 ($ when inflation <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> effect).|$|R

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} the case, learning that Jason <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> custody after {{the bus driver}} told police that he pushed Menand {{into the path of}} his vehicle. However, Jason tells authorities {{that he was trying to}} save Menand. The security guard who arrested the old man is found frozen to death after exposure to a chemical refrigerant. Mulder interviews Jason, who explains Menand threatened to go public with a claim that Jason had falsified data on a research paper.|$|E

5|$|In 1879 {{the bridge}} <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> public ownership, and in 1885 {{demolished}} {{and replaced with}} the existing bridge, designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and built by John Mowlem & Co. The narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames in London, {{it is one of}} London's least busy Thames bridges. The location on a bend in the river makes the bridge a hazard to shipping, and it has been closed many times due to collisions.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, {{the owner}} of the tower, H. J. Wood, {{discussed}} selling it to the Commissioners of Works, proposing a price of approximately £1,500; the negotiations broke down. By the 1930s, local magistrates expressed concern about the tower and the risk that it might fall over onto the grounds of a neighbouring private asylum, the Kent Sanatorium, endangering the patients. As an alternative to demolition, it <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> the guardianship of the Office of Works in 1937.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> public {{ownership}} {{and became the}} Metropolitan line of London Transport. The management of London Transport aimed to reduce goods services, and {{it was felt that}} there was little chance of the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway ever becoming viable passenger routes. The line was closed on 30 November 1935, and all buildings and infrastructure at Brill associated with the line were sold at auction. Most of the infrastructure was subsequently demolished, though three station cottages survive.|$|E

5|$|In {{other parts}} of Canterbury, the city walls became used for promenades by the more fashionable citizens.
