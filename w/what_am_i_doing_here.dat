500|$|Chatwin {{returned}} {{to the subject of}} art and objects during his career. In his early writing for the Sunday Times Magazine, he wrote about art and artists, and many of these articles Chatwin included in <b>What</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> <b>Here.</b> The main focus of Utz is on the impact the possession of art (in this case porcelain figures) has on a collector. Utz's unwillingness to give up his porcelain collection kept him in Czechoslovakia even though he had the opportunity to live in the West. Chatwin constantly struggled with the conflicting desires to own beautiful items and to live in a space free of unnecessary objects. His distaste for the art world was the result of his days at Sotheby's, and some of his final writing focused on this. The final section of <b>What</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> <b>Here,</b> [...] "Tales from the Art World," [...] consists of four short stories on this topic. At the end of <b>What</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> <b>Here,</b> Chatwin shares an anecdote about advice he had received from Noël Coward, who told him [...] "Never let anything artistic stand in your way."

500|$|Upon {{his return}} from Patagonia, Chatwin {{discovered}} a change in leadership at The Sunday Times Magazine and his retainer was not continued. Chatwin intended his next project to be a biography of Francisco Félix de Sousa, a nineteenth-century slave trader born in Brazil who became the Viceroy of Ouidah in Dahomey (present day Benin). Chatwin had first heard of de Sousa {{during a visit to}} Dahomey in 1972. He returned to the country, by then renamed the People's Republic of Benin, in December 1976 to conduct research. In January 1977, the 1977 Benin coup d'état attempt took place, and Chatwin was accused of being a mercenary, arrested, and detained for three days. Chatwin later wrote about this experience in [...] "A Coup—A Story," [...] which was published in Granta and included in <b>What</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> <b>Here</b> (1989).|$|E

60|$|Then {{again when}} day {{declined}} she would quit the stream to sit before the blazing logs, {{staring at the}} flames. <b>What</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> she would murmur. And what is this my life? When I was at home in Devon I had a dream of Winchester, of Salisbury, or other great towns further away, where {{the men and women}} who are great in the land meet together, and where my eyes would perchance sometimes have the happiness to behold the king himself--my husband's close friend and companion. My waking has brought a different scene before me; this castle in the wilderness, a solitude where from an upper window I look upon leagues of forest, a haunt of wild animals. I see great birds soaring in the sky and listen to the shrill screams of kite and buzzard; and sometimes when lying awake on a still night the distant long howl of a wolf. Also, it is said, there are great stags, and roe-deer, and wild boars, and it is Athelwold's joy to hunt them and slay them with his spear. A joy too when he returns from the hunt or from a long absence to play with his beautiful wife--his caged bird of pretty feathers and a sweet song to soothe him when he is tired. But of his life at court he tells me little, and of even that little I doubt the truth. Then he leaves me and I am alone with his retainers--the crowd of serving men and women and the armed men to safeguard me. I am alone with my two friends which I have found, one out of doors, the other in--the river which runs at the bottom of the ground where I take my walks, and the fire I sit before. The two friends, companions, and lovers to whom all the secrets of my soul are confided. I love them, having no other in the world to love, and here I hold my hands before the flames until it is hot and then kiss the heat, and by the stream I kiss my wetted hands. And if I were to remain here until this life became unendurable I should consider as to which one of these two lovers I should give myself. This one I think is too ardent in his love--it would be terrible to be wrapped round in his fiery arms and feel his fiery mouth on mine. I should rather go to the other one to lie down on his pebbly bed, and give myself to him to hold me in his cool, shining arms and mix his green hair with my loosened hair. But my wish is to live and not die. Let me then wait a little longer; let me watch and listen, and perhaps some day, by and by, from his own lips, I shall capture the secret of this my caged solitary life.|$|E

The album became massively popular with the mainstream Mexican audience because of songs such as [...] "Dr. Psiquiatra", [...] "Satisfecha", [...] "Ultimo Beso", and [...] "Mañana". This album is noted for using two popular English language songs: [...] "Last Kiss" [...] and [...] "Satisfaction", but both songs were sung in Spanish (in the version of a woman to a man, as Trevi would later described it). These songs (tracks four and five) were perfectly translated into Spanish and became very popular, helping the album sell over 2,000,000 copies.|$|E
