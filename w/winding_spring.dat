50|$|The {{electro-mechanical}} clock functioned {{with a small}} <b>winding</b> <b>spring</b> {{that was}} a little larger than the mainspring of a watch. This spring was kept at a uniform tension and responded to the hour-wheel. It took six seconds to rewind fully. It did this with no interruption to the time. The <b>winding</b> <b>spring</b> was kept at a tension that would only run the clock for one hour and then it would be rewound.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the mechanism for harvesting energy from human body motion. The vibration signal from human body motion during walking and jogging was first measured using 3 -axes vibration recorder placed at various {{places on the}} human body. The measured signal was then processed using Fourier series to investigate its frequency content. A mechanism was proposed to harvest the energy from the low frequency-low amplitude human motion. This mechanism consists of the combined nonlinear hardening and softening mechanism which was aimed at widening the bandwidth as well as amplifying the low human motion frequency. This was realized by using a translation-to-rotary mechanism which converts the translation motion of the human motion into the rotational motion. The nonlinearity in the system was realized by introducing a <b>winding</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness and the magnetic stiffness. Quasi-static and dynamic measurement were conducted to investigate {{the performance of the}} mechanism. The results show that, with the right degree of nonlinearity, the two modes can be combined together to produce a wide flat response. For the frequency amplification, the mechanism manages to increase the frequency by around 8 times in terms of rotational speed...|$|E

50|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>Springs</b> Ranch is a {{historic}} ranch complex located in the <b>Wind</b> <b>Springs</b> Creek Valley in Sioux County, Nebraska. The present ranch, which was built around 1910, was the third European settlement constructed on the property. The ranch has mainly raised cattle and sheep. Settlers constructed two homesteads on the property in the 19th century, neither of which lasted long; the two homesteads only survive as archaeological remains. In addition, the Fort Laramie to Spotted Tail Agency Road ran across the property in the 1800s, and <b>Wind</b> <b>Springs</b> was likely a campsite along the road; wagon ruts still remain along the road's path through the ranch. Researchers have determined the existence of eighteen sites related to European settlement on the ranch; aside from the ranch itself, all are archaeological sites.|$|R

[...] The next generation of the Silver Crush Grippers, released in 1993, marked the next major step in gripper evolution; their stainless-steel handles replaced the previous chrome-plated mild steel handles, and a new assembly technique eliminated the drift pin central {{to the design of}} the older grippers. IronMind briefly offered a model with a right-hand <b>wind</b> <b>spring,</b> although that design was soon shelved in order to concentrate on the more popular left-hand <b>wind</b> <b>spring.</b> The new design also featured a clear band at the midpoint of each handle, an element of trade dress for IronMind’s grippers ever since.|$|R
