5|$|Bok {{has testified}} before the United States Senate and met <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Bush, Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice, telling them his story of slavery. He has been honored by the United States Olympic Committee, the Boston Celtics and colleges and {{universities}} throughout the United States and Canada. Francis now lives in the U.S. state of Kansas, where he works for the American Anti-Slavery Group (AASG) and Sudan Sunrise, an organization that works for peace in Sudan. Bok's autobiography, Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America, published by St. Martin's Press, chronicles his life, from his early youth, his years in captivity, to {{his work in the}} United States as an abolitionist.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1865, McKinley decided on {{a career in the}} law and began {{studying}} in the office of an attorney in Poland, Ohio. The following year, he continued his studies by attending Albany Law School in New York. After studying there for less than a year, McKinley returned home and was admitted to the bar in Warren, Ohio, in March 1867. That same year, he moved to Canton, the county seat of Stark County, and set up a small office. He soon formed a partnership <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Belden, an experienced lawyer and former judge. His practice was successful enough for him to buy a block of buildings on Main Street in Canton, which provided him with a small but consistent rental income for decades to come. When his Army friend Rutherford B. Hayes was nominated for governor in 1867, McKinley made speeches on his behalf in Stark County, his first foray into politics. The county was closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, but Hayes carried it that year in his statewide victory. In 1869, McKinley ran for the office of prosecuting attorney of Stark County, an office usually then held by Democrats, and was unexpectedly elected. When McKinley ran for re-election in 1871, the Democrats nominated William A. Lynch, a prominent local lawyer, and McKinley was defeated by 143 votes.|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} orders and to repay debts, Densmore began to {{manufacture}} the machine in summer 1871. During this time, {{the machine was}} revised to improve durability and the platen was redesigned after feedback from Western Union, which wanted the ability to print on a continuous roll, indicated that clipping paper to the platen was impractical. The new design, however, infringed a patent granted to Charles A. Washburn in November 1870; Washburn, consequently, received royalties on future production. In 1872, to manufacture the new machine in earnest, a former wheelwright shop was secured along with several employees. Although the machines worked well, the lack of economies of scale prevented the venture from yielding a profit. In exchange for funding the ventures, Densmore had been acquiring an ever-increasing ownership interest. Sholes was eventually bought out for a cash payment of $12,000. Glidden kept his one-tenth right of the patent. Densmore consulted <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> N. Yost, a manufacturer {{with whom he had}} been acquainted, who suggested showing the machine to E. Remington and Sons. Remington, an arms manufacturer seeking to diversify after the Civil War, possessed the machining equipment and skilled machinists necessary to further develop the complex machine. A typewritten letter was sent to Remington, where executive Henry H. Benedict was impressed by the novelty and encouraged company president Philo Remington to pursue the device.|$|E

25|$|In August, 2005 the Office of Special Counsel dropped Sternberg's {{religious}} discrimination complaint against the Smithsonian Institution. It {{was determined that}} as an unpaid {{research associate at the}} Smithsonian, Sternberg was not actually an employee, and thus the Office of Special Counsel had no jurisdiction. Nick Matzke, Jason Rosenhouse and other critics have commented that the Office of Special Counsel itself appears biased in its initial handling of the matter, given the links between the religious right and the Republican Party, <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Bush appointee James McVay authoring its opinion.|$|E
25|$|With war still looming on 24 February 2003, Saddam Hussein {{took part}} in an {{interview}} with CBS News reporter Dan Rather.

CBS aired the taped interview later that week. Saddam Hussein later told an FBI interviewer that he once left open the possibility that Iraq possessed {{weapons of mass destruction in}} order to appear strong against Iran.|$|E

25|$|Upon his {{discharge}} in 1946, Altman {{moved to}} California. He worked in publicity {{for a company}} that had invented a tattooing machine to identify dogs. He entered filmmaking on a whim, selling a script to RKO for the 1948 picture Bodyguard, which he co-wrote <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> George. Altman's immediate success encouraged him to move to New York City, where he attempted to forge a career as a writer. Having enjoyed little success, in 1949 he returned to Kansas City, where he accepted a job as a director and writer of industrial films for the Calvin Company. In February 2012, an early Calvin film directed by Altman, Modern Football (1951), was found by filmmaker Gary Huggins.|$|E
25|$|By mid-2010, Clinton and Obama {{had clearly}} forged a good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside, and was careful to make sure that neither she nor her husband would upstage him. He in turn was accommodating to her viewpoints and in some cases adopted some of her more hawkish approaches. She met with him weekly, but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents, such as Condoleezza Rice <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Bush, James Baker with George H. W. Bush, or Henry Kissinger with Richard Nixon. Nevertheless, he had trust in her actions.|$|E

The spokesman said, [...] "I thought the interpretation that was put on Douglas Alexander's words was quite extraordinary.

500|$|Clinton {{left office}} with the highest end-of-office {{approval}} rating of any U.S. president since World War II, and he has continually received high ratings in public opinion polls of U.S. presidents. Since leaving office, Clinton {{has been involved in}} public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address international causes, such as the prevention of AIDS and global warming. He has remained active in politics by campaigning for Democratic candidates, including his wife's presidential campaigns and Barack Obama's presidential campaigns. In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, My Life. In 2009, Clinton was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, he teamed <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund.|$|E
500|$|MacFarlane has {{described}} the initial seasons of American Dad! as being similar to All in the Family, likening title character Stan Smith's originally bigoted persona to Archie Bunker. MacFarlane has also stated that his inspiration to create American Dad! derived from his and Weitzman's exasperation <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Bush's policies as former United States President. After the early couple of seasons however, the series discontinued using these elements of political satire and began to serve up its own brand of entertainment and humor. MacFarlane was described as having difficulty understanding the series in its early going; however, he heavily warmed up to the series after its early seasons once he felt the show truly came into its own. His fellow co-creators have sensed this through MacFarlane's greatly increased attention to the series after its early seasons. MacFarlane has also revealed he is an American Dad! fan himself. He has taken note of the positive reaction to the [...] "Roger" [...] character by fans via his Twitter.|$|E
500|$|<b>With</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Forbes, another Protective Association member, in 1901 Trotter co-founded the Guardian, {{a weekly}} newspaper. [...] At first Forbes, an Amherst College {{graduate}} with some experience in publishing, was the driving operational force in its production, while Trotter funded {{the effort and}} served as its managing editor. [...] The paper became a forum for a more outspoken and forceful approach to gaining racial equality, and its contributors and editorials (which were generally written by Trotter) regularly attacked Washington. [...] The paper's editorial stance brought a stream of criticism from more mainstream African-American publications: the New York Age, calling it [...] "putrescent", wrote that [...] "Editor Trotter... makes himself smelt if not felt"; another wrote that the Guardian was [...] "carrying its cases too fast and too far", and that Trotter suffered from a [...] "mental malady". The Guardian had limited circulation, but was highly influential as one of only 200 African-American publications in the country. [...] It suffered financially due to Trotter's poor accounting and inattention due to his heavy schedule. Forbes, who principally worked as a librarian in the city library, left the business in 1904 because of Booker T. Washington's legal assaults on the newspaper and pressure by Washington supporters on his employers. [...] Trotter's wife, and later his sister, assisted in the paper's publication.|$|E

500|$|Current socio-political {{issues in}} the United States are {{addressed}} on the album, with Vedder claiming the record [...] "deals with real content and the moral issues of our time", and crediting as inspiration both the frustration <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Bush being reelected, {{and the birth of}} Vedder's daughter - [...] "Now that I see it as my daughter's planet, I'm even more (angry)." [...] McCready said, [...] "We all feel that we're living in tumultuous, frightening times, and that ranges from the Iraq war to Hurricane Katrina to wiretapping to anything that smacks of totalitarianism. And just bad political decisions being made. We feel that as Americans, and we're frustrated. So a lot of those feelings have come out in these songs." [...] Vedder also added that among all the dark themes [...] "the hope {{was going to be in}} the guitar solos. It was the guitars and drums going at it that was going to lift you out of the dark abyss that I had painted." [...] The Iraq War is addressed in the songs [...] "World Wide Suicide", [...] "Marker in the Sand", and [...] "Army Reserve". The lyrics of [...] "World Wide Suicide" [...] depict anger against the war. Other themes addressed on the album include alcohol use ("Severed Hand"), religion ("Marker in the Sand"), poverty ("Unemployable"), leaving everything behind to seek a fresh start ("Gone"), and loneliness ("Come Back").|$|E
500|$|With {{only two}} weeks {{remaining}} before the primary, a Quinnipiac University poll released May 4 showed Specter's lead against Sestak had significantly narrowed, dropping from 53-32 percent in the previous month to 47-39 percent. A daily tracking poll by Muhlenberg College showed the race as even closer, with Specter supported by 46 percent of likely voters surveyed, and Sestak trailing only four points at 42 percent. The Quinnipiac poll indicated the strongest factor in these changes was that Sestak was gaining better name recognition due to his television commercials. According to the poll, 43 percent of respondents now had a favorable view of him, compared to only 33 percent in March. The day after the poll was released, Sestak unveiled a new television advertisement strongly critical of Specter, highlighting the incumbent Senator's Republican history and showing images of him <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Bush and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. The commercial featured a clip of Specter saying, [...] "My change in party will enable me to be reelected" [...] and ended with a narrator saying, [...] "Arlen Specter switched parties to save one job: his, not yours." [...] The same week the advertisement ran, T.J. Rooney {{said in an interview}} with Politico that a Sestak primary victory would be [...] "cataclysmic" [...] for the party in the general election, and warned Democratic voters, [...] "If we want to keep this seat in Democratic hands, the only person capable of delivering that victory is Arlen Specter." ...|$|E
