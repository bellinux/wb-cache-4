Students transition from being in small classroom into big lecture rooms. The same goes for food, they transition from being served in cafeterias to buffet styles in college. Dining centers excite new students because this is a new experience, therefore they grab more than what they should. It’s something new and it’s what they’re paying for.|$|E

500|$|In the end, 40 {{songs were}} amassed {{for the new}} record, but only ten were used. According to Schwab, the album's title was chosen to {{represent}} [...] "the tension that exists in everybody [...] the flesh and the spirit."

[...] Ben Kenigsberg of The Village Voice said the film is [...] "not without its moments of elemental dread [...] also obviously padded, too long on action, and painfully short on irony. The satirical element still packs a minor jolt." [...] Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer said that [...] "those who <b>want</b> <b>something</b> more substantial from a movie than a vid-game script with centerfold appeal will not find it in this noisy, bone-crushing survivalist flick." [...] In a negative review, Cinefantastique described Guillory's portrayal of Jill Valentine as the film's only [...] "saving grace".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} for Kingdom of Loathing has been generally positive, with consistent {{praise for the}} game's humor and surrealism. The gameplay and content have been praised as [...] "well designed" [...] and having a [...] "huge amount of content". [...] Matt Gallant of Gizmodo said that the game is [...] "actually very full-featured" [...] with [...] "a lot of content", and according to Worlds in Motion, [...] "Kingdom of Loathing isn't just a great game, but a really unique and interesting MMO." [...] Jay Is Games called it [...] "a 'must play' game for RPG fans who <b>want</b> <b>something</b> different".

500|$|Audiences also {{responded to}} the Beatles' brash social impudence.

Confidence that they could dress as they liked, speak as they liked, talk to the Queen as they liked, {{talk to the people}} on the train who 'fought the war for them' as they liked. ... still based on privilege—privilege by schooling, privilege by birth, privilege by accent, privilege by speech.

500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{praised the}} {{commercial}} {{nature of the}} album and called it [...] "a mature pop album only in that it's aimed at the boozy girl's night out rather than the school disco". Jacqueline Hodges favoured the album's consistency and complimented its commercial prospect, predicting that the album is [...] "going to sell bucket loads". Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly labelled the album [...] "the best guilty-pleasure retro-dance smash since Eiffel 65's [...] "Blue"", but felt that Minogue [...] "milks the formula (of [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head") dry on the album". Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH enjoyed the fun nature of the album and said that [...] "if you <b>want</b> <b>something</b> to drive to, dance to, play at a house party or cheer your workmates up with, Fever is for you". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave the album a negative review, criticizing Minogue's [...] "painfully precise" [...] vocals and the album's monotony.|$|E
500|$|Despite his folkloric qualities, the Slender Man {{is not in}} {{the public}} domain. Several for-profit ventures {{involving}} the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character, while others were civilly blocked from distribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, the issue is complicated by the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media, including film and television. The identity of this option holder has not been made public. Knudsen himself has argued that his enforcement of copyright {{has less to do with}} money than with artistic integrity: [...] "I just <b>want</b> <b>something</b> amazing to come off it... something that's scary and disturbing and kinda different. I would hate for something to come out and just be kinda conventional." [...] As of May 2016, the media rights to Slender Man have been sold to production company Mythology Entertainment.|$|E

500|$|Central to Colbert's {{personality}} is his rigid belief that [...] "what I say is right, and [...] anyone else says {{could possibly be}} true", regardless of any evidence to the contrary. He discussed this in the Reports first Wørd segment, using the term [...] "truthiness" [...] as he explained what he perceives to {{be the difference between}} [...] "those who think with their head and those who know with their heart". He has further gone on to ascribe [...] "truthiness" [...] to other institutions including Wikipedia, which he believes upholds his view that reality can be determined by consensus opinion, and often encourages viewers to use Wikipedia to [...] "change reality". Colbert believes that if a majority of people <b>want</b> <b>something</b> to be true, that thing therefore must become the truth. For instance, after months of scoffing at global warming, Colbert suddenly reversed his position, conceding its existence only due to the box office success of An Inconvenient Truth, a sign that [...] "the free market has spoken".|$|E
500|$|Sullivan {{wished to}} produce further serious works with Gilbert. He had collaborated {{with no other}} {{librettist}} since 1875. But Gilbert felt that the reaction to The Yeomen of the Guard had [...] "not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public <b>want</b> <b>something</b> more earnest still." [...] He proposed instead that Sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera, but should continue also to compose comic works for the Savoy. Sullivan was not immediately persuaded. He replied, [...] "I have lost the liking for writing comic opera, and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing it." [...] Nevertheless, Sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from Julian Sturgis (who was recommended by Gilbert), while suggesting to Gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful Venice. The comic opera was completed first: The Gondoliers (1889) was a piece described by Gervase Hughes as a pinnacle of Sullivan's achievement. [...] It was the last great Gilbert and Sullivan success.|$|E
500|$|Noting the realism in {{the writing}} for the series, Gilchrist stated: [...] "It's as if Rhimes and Co. {{harnessed}} the sublime and the mundane of our daily experiences, that strange sense of drama that emerges from even the most unimportant daily conflicts, and it transported it on {{a world that is}} legitimately fraught with life and death decisions." [...] However, he expressed disappointment in {{the end of the second}} season, which he deemed surprisingly less strong, compared to the [...] "powerful" [...] first half and the [...] "immaculate" [...] first season, describing Stevens' [...] "awkward and self-destructive" [...] relationship with a patient as a way to [...] "slow episodes to a screeching halt with maudlin and painfully underdeveloped turns towards melodrama", while expressing the predictability of Duquette's death. Gilchrist stated in response to Stevens' development in the last part of the second season: [...] "Izzie's descent into abject hysteria, which followed her season-long sanctimoniousness about everything, actually made me <b>want</b> <b>something</b> terrible to happen to her too." [...] He described how some episodes were not among the show's strongest, noting that the some plot lines created poignancy, and connected in an unfamiliar way.|$|E

500|$|On May 3, 2013, just a {{month before}} the film's premiere, {{producers}} announced that Al Pacino had left the film over creative differences about how his character should come to life. At the time of his departure, Pacino's character had already been fully voiced and animated. Chris Renaud, co-director of the film, commented on Pacino's departure: [...] "So we don't want an unhappy actor, and we <b>want</b> <b>something</b> that is well-realized on all sides. If you don't see eye to eye, sometimes it's easier to (part company) and move on from there." [...] Benjamin Bratt, who had already been considered before Pacino, stepped in to voice Eduardo. Chris Meledandri, producer of the film, admitted that he was not [...] "aware of any of the major animated films of the last 15 years that has brought an actor in at such a late stage". Due to the finished animation, Bratt had to match his timing exactly to the character's mouth movement. Initially, during his five-day recording, he tried to imitate Pacino's voice, but found it impossible, saying [...] "no one can out-Al Pacino Al Pacino". He ended up only using Pacino as an inspiration, and resolved to go with his own interpretation of the character. His work was commended by Variety, saying: [...] "You'd never guess he wasn't the filmmakers' first choice." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, The Guardian {{reported}} that the film had [...] "touched a nerve" [...] within the North Korean government, as they are [...] "notoriously paranoid about perceived threats to their safety." [...] The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the state news agency of North Korea, {{reported that}} their government [...] promised [...] "stern" [...] and [...] "merciless" [...] retaliation if the film was released. KCNA said that {{the release of a}} film portraying the assassination of the North Korean leader would not be allowed and it would be considered the [...] "most blatant act of terrorism and war." [...] The next month, North Korea's United Nations ambassador Ja Song-nam condemned the film, describing its production and distribution as [...] "an act of war" [...] and because of Kim's assassination in the film, [...] "the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism." [...] The Guardian [...] described Song-nam's comments as [...] "perfect publicity for the movie." [...] Later in July, KCNA wrote to U.S. President Barack Obama, asking to have the film pulled. Shortly before the planned release of the film on December 25, 2014, screenwriter Dan Sterling told Creative Screenwriting: [...] "I couldn't believe that the most infamous man in the world knew about my script – but most importantly, I would never <b>want</b> <b>something</b> I wrote to lead to some kind of humanitarian disaster.

500|$|Rachid Chouhal was {{the oldest}} athlete to {{represent}} Malta at the London Games {{at the age of}} 37. He had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. Chouhal qualified for the Games via a wildcard because his fastest time of 10.83 seconds, set at the Marsa Sports Complex on 2 June 2012, was 0.59 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for his event, the 100 metres. Before the Games Choudal said [...] "When I <b>want</b> <b>something,</b> I go for it. I am not afraid. I am confident in my training and am careful not to get hurt. I know that the level of the athletes competing in the 100 metre sprint is very high. My aim is to do a personal best or season's best." [...] He was drawn in the fourth heat of the preliminary round on 4 August, finishing fourth out of eight runners, with a time of 10.83 seconds. Chouhal ranked ahead of Tilak Ram Tharu of Nepal (10.85 seconds) and Masoud Azizi from Afghanistan (11.19 seconds) but behind the Saint Vincent and the Grenandines' Courtney Williams (10.80 seconds) in a heat led by Gérard Kobéané of Burkina Faso (10.42 seconds). Overall Chouhal finished 58th out of 75 athletes, but did not progress to the first round because he was 0.21 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in his meat who advanced to the later stages.|$|E
