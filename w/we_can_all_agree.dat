40|$|This paper {{responds}} to the probe, ‘In defence of tourism,’ by Richard Sharpley {{in this issue of}} Tourism Recreation Research. The essence of Sharpley’s argument is his proposition that ‘tourism, if appropriately planned and managed, is fundamentally a good thing’. This naïve and unworldly statement makes two flawed rhetorical claims: firstly that tourism (whatever that is) can be fundamentally good given certain conditions, and secondly these conditions – appropriate planning and management – can be and are, on balance, achieved. While surely Sharpley is playing the role of the devil’s advocate in his article and must intend merely to stimulate debate, the importance of this issue demands a clear and logical response which I have provided below, structured in terms of these two claims. The first claim; that tourism is fundamentally good, is an example of Platonic essentialism (Ross 1976) and should be rejected as should any such claim that complex human objects have an essence that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>all</b> identify and <b>agree</b> on.

40|$|Congress {{pushed past}} the distractions of the {{election}} year to get more done on poverty-related measures in 2008 than the year before, according to the only national analysis that ranks Members of Congress solely on their performance in fighting poverty, released today. The Shriver Center's 2008 Poverty Scorecard, www. povertyscorecard. org, acts as a year-end report card for every member of Congress. The Scorecard assigns letter grades to {{each member of the}} United States Senate and House of Representatives according to their voting records on the most important poverty-related issues that came to a vote in 2008. In the Scorecard, four of the most important anti-poverty bills that Congress considered during 2008 passed both the House and Senate and were signed into law by President Bush. Two more were signed into law after being substantially amended; making a grand total of six important anti-poverty measures that became law. These bills address aspects of the economic downturn such as the housing crisis, unemployment compensation and the impact of high credit costs on students. Although Congress considered more important anti-poverty bills in 2007 than in 2008, only three of them passed both the House and Senate and were signed into law by President Bush. "Overcoming poverty is a huge job that requires national leadership now more than ever," said John Bouman, Shriver Center president. "We hope to use the Scorecard to elevate the subject of poverty in the national policy dialogue, educate the public about why certain votes are important to promoting equal opportunity, and improve legislators' voting records by demonstrating that they will have to be accountable on these issues. " These votes, as well as in-depth bill summaries, poverty rate by Congressional district, analysis from the Shriver Center, and links to antipoverty resources, make up the interactive website through which users can simply click on a map to learn how well their representatives are working to end poverty: * Although half of all Senators had a perfect A+ voting record and over half of all Representatives ranked an A or A+, only five of the 18 bills in the Scorecard passed both Houses and were signed into law by the President. * Several states with high poverty rates have Congressional delegations that had poor records in supporting measures to fight poverty. (Kentucky's poverty rate is the fifth highest in the country, but its Congressional delegation ranked the 40 th lowest of the 50 states.) "No matter what your ideology, I think <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>can</b> <b>agree</b> that government needs to take some role in providing economic opportunities to all Americans during a tough financial climate," Bouman concluded. "We are looking for members of Congress to realize their performances on these issues are being assessed. ...|$|R

40|$|Several youngsters {{need and}} use art based {{expressions}} to communicate their feelings, experiences and ideas. In the presentation I will show {{an example of}} a girls’ message communicated through musical lyrics, which should never been said with just spoken or written words as available forms of expressions. To be able to handle different forms of expressions is a human right. But even if this is something that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>can</b> <b>agree</b> upon, several questions have to be formulated. Who are all of us? What is democracy? What does it mean to ”own” and handle a form of expression? What constitute the process of embodying a form of language? What frames does the Swedish curriculum and syllabus of music give to the process? What challenges and priorities do music educators achieve from Hannah Arendt’s writings in this respect?As a starting point I will share some relevant expressions from the curricula for Swedish primary, and lower secondary schools, which enlighten democratic values, equality and uniqueness in relation to varied forms of expression. For example the directions from the government say that all pupils shall have the possibility to develop as listeners, composers and musicians. All pupils shall also show basic knowledge in relation to the standards or achievement criteria of all areas, mentioned in the syllabuses. In the paper I will use Hannah Arendt’s thinking about democracy to explore possibilities and challenges for music education within and outside the music classroom in Swedish schools. A crucial starting point in Arendt’s thinking was the balance between Vita Activa (the action life), consisting of work, production and action, and Vita Contemplativa (the philosophical thinking life) consisting of different ways of thinking. Arendt sought to see and make connections between the two possible. She meant that Vita Activa takes place in the world wherein we are born, through speech and action, where actors and audience depend on each other. In the social context we become clear to our selves and to others through interaction. In those interactive activities we need different forms of languages to try, modify, and create ideas and insights. But to reach common sense, we also need to step back, Arendt says, and think, imagine, value and reflect. We have to review critically, see through others’ perspective to be able to create our own meaning, Arendt underlines. Consequently, diversity constitutes a prerequisite for the individual, social interaction constitutes unique human beings. At the same time the public sphere, for example school areas, are created by unique individuals, who in collaboration can create new chains of actions, and by that widen the sphere to become something new. Depending on which human beings that are interacting within a common place, the common space creates a specific base for specific individuals and personalities to develop. Diversities such as class, gender, geography, economy and musical belonging are present and could be taken into account and viewed as possibilities for conversations, contradictions, exchanges, imagination and new learning, with unknown results. It becomes important to be heard, and listened to. Questions that have to be elaborated upon when using Arendt’s view of democracy are for example; Who is expected to make their voices heard, who is seen as a possible participant, and who has access to the specific areas? At the informal seminar of Philosophy in Music Education Society I will discuss how and to what extent Arendt’s thoughts about democracy can be used to put light on how Swedish schools, based on expressions in the current curricula, can offer Music as a language for all, with specific focus on gender and ethnicity.
