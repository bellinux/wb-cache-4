[...] While the review was largely negative, the author was still {{impressed}} by the visual depiction of the Japanese capital: [...] "Visually, much {{of the film is}} stunning ... and the art design by Marc Caro (Delicatessen) takes Tokyo's love of neon gaudiness to a surreal extreme".|$|E

Hextall's mother thought her son's love for hockey exceeded that of her husband's teammates and believed it would drive him to achieve his aim of goaltending in the NHL. Each summer, Hextall received training at the hockey school at which his father taught, but the hockey programs in Pittsburgh and Atlanta were sub-standard, and meant that during his teenage years, he was behind many of his fellow players. He describes himself as [...] " [...] <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> call real polished" [...] in his first year of junior hockey, aged17.|$|E

[...] In a positive review, August Brown of The Los Angeles Times jokingly said the song was [...] "almost as good as having shorts in every color." [...] Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post was critical of [...] "Birthday", criticizing the song's lyrics, as well as calling the song's panting and moaning [...] "overwrought" [...] and [...] "excessive". Christina Drill of Popdust gave the song a highly positive 4.5 out of 5 review, declaring it [...] "super fun" [...] and catchy, while later going on to say [...] "Birthday" [...] is [...] "the weirdest and greatest thing Selena's ever done".|$|E

500|$|Early in the First World War, the Royal Navy {{erected a}} signal station on Hirta, and daily {{communications}} with the mainland were {{established for the}} first time in the history of the islands. In a belated response, the German submarine SM U-90 arrived in Village Bay on the morning of 15 May 1918 and, after issuing a warning, started shelling the island. Seventy-two shells were fired, and the wireless station was destroyed. The manse, church, and jetty storehouse were damaged, but there was no loss of life. One eyewitness recalled: [...] "It wasn't <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> call a bad submarine because it could have blowed every house down because they were all in a row there. He only wanted Admiralty property. One lamb was killed... all the cattle ran from one side of the island to the other when they heard the shots." ...|$|E

We had to mature very quickly." [...] She graduated from La Puente High School, where she saw a lack of support for those wishing to continue their education, including a guidance counselor who told her mother that “Your daughter is not college material. Maybe she should follow the career of her older sister and become a secretary.” However, another counselor did encourage her to attend college, and even went to her house to help her fill out an application. She took her younger sisters to the library to get them to follow her lead.|$|E

AllMusic's Brett Hartenbach noted that Kelly's band had fleshed out his {{songs in the}} studio, {{but he was still}} able to show [...] "his vignettes of life, love, and the underbelly of both have plenty of power on their own". Kelly had relocated to Los Angeles and signed with Vanguard Records to tour the US as a solo artist. While in Los Angeles he produced fellow Australian Renée Geyer's album Difficult Woman (1994). Kelly returned to Australia in 1993 and wrote a collection of lyrics, aptly titled Lyrics, which opens with a quote from Anton Chekhov: [...] "I don't have <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> call a philosophy or coherent world view so I shall have to limit myself to describing how my heroes love, marry, give birth, die and speak." ...|$|E

500|$|Seamus Blackley {{designed}} the game's physics system, {{which is a}} modified version of the one he wrote for Looking Glass's flight simulator Flight Unlimited. At the time, Church described it as [...] "far more sophisticated than <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> normally use for an indoor game". The system governs, among other things, weapon recoil and the arc of thrown objects; the latter behave differently based on their weight and velocity. The game's most complex physics model is that of the player character. Church explained that the character's head [...] "tilts forward when you start to run, and jerks back a bit when you stop", and that, after an impact against a surface or object, its [...] "head is knocked in the direction opposite the hit, with proportion to [...] mass and velocity of the objects involved". On coding physics for Looking Glass Technologies games, Blackley later said, [...] "If games don't obey physics, we somehow feel that something isn't right", and that [...] "the biggest compliment to me is when a gamer doesn't notice the physics, but only notices that things feel the way they should".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} over 2,500,000 YouTube views {{in less than}} two days. Billboard writer Andrew Hampp said its production was a [...] "historic milestone in the realm of YouTube creators". Cowan of Canadian Business said, [...] "Cynics will view this as a decidedly stodgy brand trying to make itself hip by hanging out with cool kids. But a less-jaded eye might call it something else—arts patronage for the 21st century". Writing for music website Idolator, Bradley Stern called the video a [...] "squeaky-clean visual," [...] and praised its bright and colorful imagery, while Daily Express writer Stefan Kyriazis called it [...] "red hot". Mike Pell of MTV UK wrote that the clip continued the bubbly, bright themes of Trainor's [...] "All About That Bass" [...] video, and that the singer's sequinned kitty top resembled one [...] Katy Perry wore for the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards. Yahoo! writer Lyndsey Parker remarked about Trainor's fashion in the video; and said it [...] "seems to be an unofficial campaign to land her own M.A.C. Viva Glam endorsement deal". Fuse's Hilary Hughes wrote that the video was a bold and sassy sentiment, and that its style shift from [...] "All About That Bass" [...] "definitely made a statement". Hughes described the video's dance routine as [...] "fierce"; she called it [...] "a super-meta technicolor dance party". Mashable's Brian Anthony Hernandez wrote, [...] "The visuals are <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> expect from a bouncy pop song: young dancers, colorful backgrounds, quirky outfits and exaggerated expressions".|$|E
500|$|The Persona {{series has}} been {{referred}} to as the most popular spin-off from the Megami Tensei franchise, gaining notoriety and success in its own right. Io9's James Whitbrook commented that while [...] "here in the west, we've got plenty of awesome urban fantasy, especially from a YA perspective. But what makes Persona interesting is that it's the familiar concept of Urban fantasy, the balance of the mundane [...] "normal" [...] life of the protagonists and the problems they have there with the fantastical nature of the supernatural world that lies beneath all that, from a Japanese perspective. Over here, that's much less common, and the way the series portrays urban fantasy through that lens is what makes it so different, especially from <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> normally expect from Japanese RPGs.". Nintendo Power, in an article concerning the Megami Tensei series, cited the Persona series' [...] "modern-day horror stories" [...] and [...] "teams of Japanese high-school kids" [...] as the perfect example of the franchise. Persona was mentioned in 1999 by GameSpot's Andrew Vestal as a game that deserved attention despite not aging well, saying [...] "Examining Persona reveals three of the traits that make the series so popular - and unique - amongst RPG fans: demonology, negotiation, and psychology". The game has been named as a cult classic. Persona 3 was named by RPGamer as the greatest RPG of the past decade in 2009, and RPGFan listed Persona 3 and 4 in second and fourth place respectively in their similar 2011 list. Persona 3 was listed by Gamasutra as one of the 20 essential RPGs for players of the genre. Persona 4 was also listed by Famitsu {{as one of the greatest}} games of all time in a 2010 list.|$|E

[...] Canning rated the episode an 8.4 out of 10. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that the episode was [...] "structurally and tonally", but disliked the way the show featured Jon Hamm, as he believed the show was not giving him enough to do besides being [...] "handsome." [...] Nonetheless, Sepinwall enjoyed the story between Liz and Drew in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] writing that it was a [...] "better effort" [...] than shown in the previous episode, [...] "Generalissimo". As with Sepinwall, Maureen Ryan for the Chicago Tribune hoped the show would use Hamm [...] "better" [...] than demonstrated in his first two appearances. Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett wrote that she liked the way the episode handled the Valentine's Day theme, however, was not complimentary towards the way Tina Fey and Hamm were featured in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] with her observing, [...] "the future for TV's most promisingly delicious couple... might not be so sweet." [...] Before the airing of the episode, Barrett very much liked the pairing of the two characters. Kevin D.
