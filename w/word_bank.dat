5000|$|A {{fill-in-the-blank}} item {{provides a}} test taker with identifying characteristics and requires the test taker {{to recall the}} correct term. [...] There {{are two types of}} fill-in-the-blank tests. The easier version provides a <b>word</b> <b>bank</b> of possible words that will fill in the blanks. For some exams all words in the <b>word</b> <b>bank</b> are used exactly once. If a teacher wanted to create a test of medium difficulty, they would provide a test with a <b>word</b> <b>bank,</b> but some words may be used more than once and others not at all. The hardest variety of such a test is a fill-in-the-blank test in which no <b>word</b> <b>bank</b> is provided at all. This generally requires a higher level of understanding and memory than a multiple choice test. Because of this, fill-in-the-blank testsno <b>word</b> <b>bank</b> are often feared by students.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe empirically {{study the}} asset side of market {{discipline}} in the banking system of the Kyrgyz Republic, examining whether borrowers {{are willing to pay}} higher interest rates to high-quality banks. Based on dynamic panel models and a dataset with bank information from 23 banks over the period 2010 – 2012, our findings suggest the presence of market discipline induced by borrowers. In other <b>words,</b> <b>banks</b> with higher capital ratios and liquidity charge higher interest rates on loans. This result has several implications for the banking policy in Kyrgyzstan, where we can recommend to policymakers a disclosure policy following the Third Pillar of Basel III, because not only can the bank's creditors use bank information to penalize the excessive bank risk, but borrowers can also use this information to discipline their banks...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the promotion and legitimization of bank saving in Finnish magazines during the 1950 s. While trying to educate Finnish citizens to save, articles and advertisements ended up outlining a general model for the good life, structured by the ethos of thrift. At the household level, thrift meant a plurality of activities, not only passivity or restraint. The bank-saving discourse introduced new techniques of governing oneself and created possibilities for anticipatory pleasure: it oriented people towards commodities and simultaneously tried to tame consumer impulses. As an ascetic practice, bank saving was portrayed as not denying the material world; rather, its effect was to intensify the relation to the goods. Studying these texts and advertisements gives an enriched perception of economic actors who, with multiple techniques and skills, actively looked after their own welfare, {{as well as that}} of their families, local communities, and ultimately, of the nation.
