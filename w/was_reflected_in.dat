5|$|During 1987, {{relations}} improved steadily, with U.S. military inspectors {{present at}} Soviet military manoeuvres, {{an agreement to}} establish centers on Reducing Nuclear Threat, and a first round of negotiations aimed at banning nuclear tests. The thaw in relations <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> the cultural sphere. Matlock’s invitation to ballerina Maya Plisetskaya to attend a reception at Spaso House provided a way for Matlock to judge Gorbachev’s intentions, as earlier Soviet leaders would have considered it a provocation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fifth}} term, 1999 to 2004, {{there was a}} break in the grand {{coalition}} resulting in a centre-right coalition between the Liberal and People's parties. This <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> the Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the ELDR, rather than the EPP and Socialists. In the following term the liberal group grew to hold 88 seats, the largest number of seats held by any third party in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's growing {{interest}} in art <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> the story, as he included a copy of Alfred Sisley's Le Canal du Loing at Marlinspike Hall. He also included paintings by Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró aboard Rastapopolous' Scheherazade. Muller's pseudonym in the story, Mull Pasha, was based upon the British soldier Glubb Pasha. In the final scene, Hergé included cameos of both himself and his friend and colleague Edgar P. Jacobs.|$|E

5|$|In 1925–26, while {{teaching}} at the Dalhousie Law School, Macdonald took additional courses in law at Columbia University in New York, mainly by correspondence. He used these courses {{as the basis for}} full-time graduate work at the Harvard Law School in Boston, Massachusetts in 1928. Harvard's faculty members saw the law as an instrument for social improvement. That view <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> Macdonald's 1929 doctoral thesis on the responsibility of property holders under civil law.|$|E
5|$|Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, Javot (1896), {{the score}} for the film L'assassinat du duc de Guise (1908), and {{incidental}} music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916. Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by Molière and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns's deep knowledge of French baroque scores <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and Charpentier.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in August 1973 following the tour supporting the previous album, Foxtrot (1972). The group set aside {{a short period of}} time to write new material, which covered a number of themes, including the loss of English folk culture and an increased American influence, which <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> the title. Following the album's release, the group set out on tour, where they drew an enthusiastic reception from fans.|$|E

5|$|The season's {{activity}} <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{rating of}} 32. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of}} the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34knots (39mph, 63km/h) or tropical storm strength.|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} {{finished}} with extremely similar statistical totals, as befitting a close game. The two teams were within 38total yards of each other; Kansas had 344yards and Virginia Tech had 306. That relative closeness <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> the teams' first-down totals as well. Virginia Tech earned 20first downs: 10rushing, eightpassing, and twovia penalty. Kansas, meanwhile, earned 19first downs: fiverushing, 13passing, and onevia penalty.|$|E
5|$|This {{degree of}} control <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> {{negotiations}} held at various times between Croatian authorities and the RSK, as the Serbian leadership under Milošević was regularly consulted and frequently made decisions {{on behalf of the}} RSK. The Erdut Agreement that ended the war was signed by a RSK minister on instructions from Milošević. The {{degree of control}} Serbia held over SFR Yugoslavia and later the RSK was evidenced through testimonies during the Milošević trial at the ICTY.|$|E

5|$|This tour saw the {{beginning}} of a bowling partnership between Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose that would trouble batsmen across the world for the next 12 years. England, on the other hand, had entered the series with low expectations and confidence. This <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> their team selections, with 23 players being used during the series.|$|E
5|$|Vukovar is an {{important}} regional centre on Croatia's eastern border, situated in eastern Slavonia {{on the west bank}} of the Danube river. The area has a diverse population of Croats, Serbs, Hungarians, Slovaks, Ruthenians and many other nationalities, who had lived together for centuries in relative harmony before the Croatian war. It was one of the wealthiest areas of Yugoslavia before the war. Vukovar's long-standing prosperity <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> one of Croatia's finest ensembles of Baroque architecture.|$|E
5|$|Another injury problem; {{this time}} an ankle {{ligament}} injury sustained in a pre-season match at Goodison Park, restricted Shearer to just twogoals in 17games in the 1997–98 season. His injury <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> the club's form, and Newcastle finished just 13th in the Premier League. However, United (now managed by Shearer's old boss at Blackburn, Kenny Dalglish) {{had a good}} run in the FA Cup; Shearer scored the winning goal in a semi-final victory over Sheffield United as the team reached the final. The team were unable {{to get on the}} scoresheet at Wembley, and lost the game 2–0 to Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|Architecture in Croatia {{reflects}} {{influences of}} bordering nations. Austrian and Hungarian influence {{is visible in}} public spaces and buildings {{in the north and}} in the central regions, architecture found along coasts of Dalmatia and Istria exhibits Venetian influence. Large squares named after culture heroes, well-groomed parks, and pedestrian-only zones, are features of these orderly towns and cities, especially where large scale Baroque urban planning took place, for instance in Osijek (Tvrđa), Varaždin and Karlovac. Subsequent influence of the Art Nouveau <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> contemporary architecture. Along the coast, the architecture is Mediterranean with a strong Venetian and Renaissance influence in major urban areas exemplified in works of Giorgio da Sebenico and Niccolò Fiorentino such as the Cathedral of St. James in Šibenik.|$|E
5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} end of the nineteenth century. During this period, the country underwent an economic and social transformation as a result of industrialisation, which <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired building boom that reflected the growing wealth and confidence of the capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during this period were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E
5|$|City {{had only}} {{appeared}} in one previous major final when {{they won the}} 1911 FA Cup Final before Wembley Stadium had been built. Hence, the play-off final was the club's first game at Wembley in their 93-year history. For Notts County, it was the fifth visit to the national stadium since 1990. The historic occasion for Bradford <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> the ticket sales, with City fans outnumbering their opponents nearly three-to-one with 28,000 of the crowd of 39,972 coming from Bradford.|$|E

5|$|From 1357 onwards parliaments {{began to}} be {{referred}} to as the Three Estates, adopting the language of social organisation that had developed in France in the eleventh century. It was composed of the clergy, nobles and burgesses, (those that pray, those that fight and those that work). This marked the adoption of a commonplace view of Medieval society as composed of distinct orders. Within these estates there were ranks for which the terminology was increasingly dominated by the Scots language and as a result began to parallel that used in England. This consciousness over status <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> military and (from 1430) sumptuary legislation, which set out the types of weapons and armour that should be maintained, and clothes that could be worn, by various ranks.|$|E
5|$|From the 1st century AD onwards, Cassel {{developed}} into a key urban centre for the whole region with an extensive road network converging on the hill. Towards {{the end of the}} 3rd century, however, repeated invasions of Germanic tribes caused devastation throughout the region and at least 80% of settlements in the area are thought to have been abandoned, accompanied by a general economic decline. Cassel was fortified with a circuit of walls at around this time but suffered its own decline, which <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> its loss of status as a regional capital; Tournai took over as the capital of the newly constituted Civitas Turnacensium.|$|E
5|$|Harley's {{leadership}} {{qualities and}} {{influence on the}} club as captain was commended {{early on in the}} season after his handling of teammate Steve Johnson's off-field discretions. Johnson was banished from the team during the pre-season and demoted to the reserves for the first five games of the season. However, he successfully returned to the team and finished the season as a Norm Smith Medallist and All-Australian. Harley's leadership influence on the team <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> his finishing fourth in the AFLPA Best Captain award during his first year at the helm. He was also awarded life membership of the Geelong Football Club following his 150th team appearance in the round sixteen win against the Western Bulldogs, and named in the end-of-season South Australian State of Origin team.|$|E
