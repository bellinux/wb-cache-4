25|$|An {{engraved}} gem, frequently {{referred to}} as an intaglio, is a small and usually semi-precious gemstone that has been carved, in the <b>Western</b> <b>tradition</b> normally with images or inscriptions only on one face. The engraving of gemstones was a major luxury art form in the Ancient world, and an important one in some later periods.|$|E
25|$|The Feast of the Ascension {{is celebrated}} on the 40th day of Easter, always a Thursday; the Orthodox {{tradition}} {{has a different}} calendar up to a month later than in the <b>Western</b> <b>tradition,</b> and while the Anglican communion continues to observe the feast, most Protestant churches have abandoned it. The Ascension of Jesus is an important theme in Christian art, the ascending Jesus often shown blessing an earthly group below him to signify his blessing the entire Church.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (865 – 925), {{known as}} Rhazes in the <b>western</b> <b>tradition,</b> was an {{influential}} Persian physician, philosopher, and scientist during the Golden Age of Islam, {{and among the}} first in the world to write on mental illness and psychotherapy. As chief physician of Baghdad hospital, he was also the director of one of the first psychiatric wards in the world.

25|$|The <b>Western</b> <b>tradition</b> of {{sculpture}} began in ancient Greece, and Greece is {{widely seen as}} producing great masterpieces in the classical period. During the Middle Ages, Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith. The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo's David. Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and {{the emphasis on the}} depiction of the human body, with the making of constructed sculpture, and the presentation of found objects as finished art works.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Citizens United ruling, In December 2011, the Montana Supreme Court, in <b>Western</b> <b>Tradition</b> Partnership, Inc. v. Attorney General of Montana, upheld that state's law {{limiting}} corporate contributions. Examining {{the history}} of corporate interference in Montana government {{that led to the}} Corrupt Practices Law, the majority decided that the state still had a compelling reason to maintain the restrictions. It ruled that these restrictions on speech were narrowly tailored and withstood strict scrutiny and thus did not contradict Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1970s, in {{paintings}} such as Untitled (1976), Twombly {{began to}} evoke landscape through colour (favouring brown, green and light blue), written inscriptions and collage elements. In 1978 {{he worked on}} the monumental historical ensemble Fifty Days at Iliam, a ten-part cycle inspired by Homer's Iliad; since then Twombly continued to draw on literature and myth, deploying cryptic pictorial metaphors that situate individual experience within the grand narratives of <b>Western</b> <b>tradition,</b> as in the Gaeta canvases and the monumental Four Seasons concluded in 1994.|$|E

25|$|T. S. Eliot was a {{champion}} of the <b>Western</b> <b>tradition</b> and orthodox Christian culture. Eliot was a political reactionary who used modernist literary means for traditionalist ends. His After Strange Gods (1934) and Notes towards the Definition of Culture (1948) align with the grand tradition of Christian humanism extending back to Edmund Burke, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin, G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc. Educated by Irving Babbitt and George Santayana at Harvard University, Eliot was friends with Allen Tate and Russell Kirk.|$|E
25|$|Being-in-the-world is Heidegger's {{replacement}} for {{terms such as}} subject, object, consciousness, and world. For him, the split of things into subject/object, as we find in the <b>Western</b> <b>tradition</b> and even in our language, must be overcome, as is indicated by the root structure of Husserl and Brentano's concept of intentionality, i.e., that all consciousness is consciousness of something, {{that there is no}} consciousness, as such, cut off from an object (be it the matter of a thought or of a perception). Nor are there objects without some consciousness beholding or being involved with them.|$|E
25|$|Engraved gems {{occur in}} the Bible, {{especially}} when the hoshen and ephod worn by the High Priest are described; though these were inscribed {{with the names of}} the tribes of Israel in letters, rather than any images. A few identifiably Jewish gems survive from the classical world, including Persia, mostly with the owner's name in Hebrew, but some with symbols such as the menorah. Many gems are inscribed in the Islamic world, typically with verses from the Koran, and sometimes gems in the <b>Western</b> <b>tradition</b> just contain inscriptions.|$|E

25|$|With {{the fall}} of the Western Roman Empire, there arose a more diffuse arena for {{political}} studies. The rise of monotheism and, particularly for the <b>Western</b> <b>tradition,</b> Christianity, brought to light a new space for politics and political action. During the Middle Ages, the study of politics was widespread in the churches and courts. Works such as Augustine of Hippo's The City of God synthesized current philosophies and political traditions with those of Christianity, redefining the borders between what was religious and what was political. Most of the political questions surrounding the relationship between Church and State were clarified and contested in this period.|$|E
25|$|Atheism in {{the twentieth}} century found {{recognition}} {{in a wide variety of}} other, broader philosophies in the <b>Western</b> <b>tradition,</b> such as existentialism, Objectivism, secular humanism, nihilism, logical positivism, Marxism, anarchism, feminism, and the general scientific and rationalist movement. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological nominalism. Proponents such as Bertrand Russell emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, Ludwig Wittgenstein attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. H. L. Mencken sought to debunk both the idea that science and religion are compatible, and the idea that science is a dogmatic belief system just like any religion.|$|E
25|$|Like the H/ZBJ-1 combat data {{system on}} board, the JRSCCS is {{distributed}} and redundant and reflects both Russian and Western influence. From the Russian/Soviet tradition, each sensor handles {{as much of}} its own data processing as possible. While this potentially allows the design of individual system components to be simplified, the Chinese followed the <b>Western</b> <b>tradition</b> by ensuring central components can still process all information from the sensors {{in the event of}} sensor hardware malfunction. The cost of such redundancy is such that half the price of the ship is in its C4I systems. Another Western design tradition incorporated was the use of an open architecture software design.|$|E
