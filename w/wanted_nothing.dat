5|$|On November 30, 2011, Gumby Comics/Wildcard Ink {{published}} a single volume collecting Adams' previous two specials featuring Gumby. The book was initially called Gumby's Arthur Adams Specials, but was eventually published with a sticker covering Adams' {{name on the}} cover, effectively renaming the book Gumby's Spring Specials. According to Rich Johnston of Bleeding Cool, this was done on Adams' request, who <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to do with the}} publisher, and took action to keep his name off the book's cover. The book is nonetheless sold by merchants such as Mile High Comics under its originally intended name.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Roosevelt {{backed the}} Hepburn Bill, {{imposing}} railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to do with}} the bill, and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich entrusted management of the bill to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause the defeat of the bill. To Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though he voted for it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.|$|E

5|$|Edgardo {{was visited}} {{by his father}} several times under the {{supervision}} of the rector of the Catechumens, Enrico Sarra, from mid-August to mid-September 1858. The wildly divergent accounts of what happened during these encounters grew into two rival narratives of the entire case. Momolo's version of events, favoured by the Jewish community and other backers, was that a family had been destroyed by the government's religious fanaticism, that helpless Edgardo had spent the journey to Rome crying for his parents, and that the boy <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> more than to return home. The narrative favoured by the Church and its supporters, and propagated in the Catholic press throughout Europe, was one of divinely ordained, soul-stirring redemption, and a child endowed with spiritual strength far beyond his years—the neophyte Edgardo had faced a life of error followed by eternal damnation but now stood to share in Christian salvation, and was distraught that his parents would not convert with him.|$|E

Konstantin did all he could to appease the Poles, but his well-meant reforms did not go far enough for the Polish nationalists who <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> short of independence, by force if necessary.|$|E
25|$|The 1954 movie Salt of the Earth, {{directed}} by Herbert J.

The Port Arthur Street Railway (PASRy) commenced operations in March 1892, and in that same year, McDonald and Company commenced operations of a private street railway in neighbouring Fort William, which connected the Port Arthur Street Railway's southern terminus at Fort William's northern town limits into the downtown core of Fort William. Although Fort William <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with Port Arthur's municipal railway, PASRy gained control of the McDonald and Company line on June 1, 1893, and extended its operations into the town.|$|E

25|$|By the 19th century {{theories}} that Jesus {{was of the}} Aryan race, and in particular of Nordic appearance, were developed and later appealed to advocates of the new racial antisemitism, who <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> Jewish about Jesus. Houston Stewart Chamberlain posited Jesus was of Amorite-Germanic extraction. The Amorites were actually a Semitic people. Madison Grant claimed Jesus for the Nordic race. This found its most extreme form in the Nazi theology of Positive Christianity. Scholars supporting the radical Aryan view also argued that being a Jew by religion was distinguishable from being a Jew by race or ethnicity. These theories usually also include the reasoning that Jesus was Aryan because Galilee was supposedly a non-Jewish region speaking an unknown Indo-European language, but this has not gained scholarly acceptance (in fact, Galilee had a significant non-Jewish minority, but these spoke various local Semitic languages).|$|E

25|$|Carlton Gary {{was born}} on September 24, 1950 in Columbus, Georgia. His father was a {{construction}} worker who <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to do with him}} and would accept no financial responsibility for him. Gary only met his father once, when he was twelve years old. Gary's mother was extremely poor and as a result, they moved around a lot. He was malnourished most of the time and was often left with his aunt or great aunt, both maids for elderly, wealthy, white women. In elementary school, Gary suffered serious head trauma when he was knocked unconscious in a playground accident, and in his teens, he was a heavy drug user. Between the ages of 14 and 18, he was arrested multiple times for robbery, arson, and assault. During that time, he also got married to a woman named Sheila, and had two children. In 1970, he moved to Albany, New York, where he had plans to become a singer, but he continued to carry out his criminal activities.|$|E

McGovern's view on intervention in Southeast Asia took a turn in 1978 in reaction to the ongoing Cambodian genocide. Noting that it affected a percentage of the population which made [...] "Hitler's operation look tame", he advocated an international military intervention in Cambodia to put the Khmer Rouge regime out of power.|$|E
