30|$|The Braive and BK drying {{recorder}} is {{an instrument}} frequently {{employed in the}} coatings industry to measure the drying performance of a paint film operated with different lengths of a test strip; hence the two names used to denote it. This recorder consists of hemispherically ended needles, moving {{along the length of}} the test strip, which is made from plain glass and coated with a thin film. The drying characteristics of paint film are classified into four stages: the paint flows together (<b>wet-edge</b> time), the paint begins to polymerise (dust-free time), surface dries and finally lines become no longer visible on the film (total drying or through drying time) (Miccich√® et al. 2005 a). However, Klaasen et al. classified the drying performance into three phases: open time (a scratch line traced by a pin closes up), dust free time (pin leaves a visible scratchy line, partially closed) and tack free time (a scratch line does not close) (Klaasen & van der Leeuw 2006). Clearly, assessing the drying of film suffers from subjective evaluation.|$|E
