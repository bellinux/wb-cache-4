The gift fund supported 26 charities of the couple's choice, incorporating the armed forces, children, the elderly, art, sport and conservation. These causes are close to their hearts and reflect the experiences, passions and values of their lives so far.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1954–1955, William Shockley, an {{inventor}} of the transistor and a visiting professor at Stanford University, decided to establish his own mass production of advanced transistors and Shockley diodes. He found a sponsor in Raytheon, but Raytheon discontinued the project after a month. In August 1955 Shockley turned for advice to the financier Arnold Beckman, the owner of Beckman Instruments. Shockley needed one million dollars. Beckman knew that Shockley had no chance in the business, but believed that Shockley's new inventions would be beneficial for his own company and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> to his competitors. Accordingly, Beckman agreed to create and fund a laboratory {{under the condition that}} its discoveries should be brought to mass production within two years.|$|E
25|$|Catherine did {{initiate}} {{some changes}} to serfdom, though. If a noble {{did not live}} up to his side of the deal, then the serfs could file complaints against him by following the proper channels of law. Catherine gave them this new right, but in exchange they could no longer appeal directly to her. She did this because {{she did not want to}} be bothered by the peasantry, but did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> reason to revolt, either. In this act, though, she unintentionally gave the serfs a legitimate bureaucratic status they had lacked before. Some serfs were able to use their new status to their advantage. For example, serfs could apply to be freed if they were under illegal ownership, and non-nobles were not allowed to own serfs. Some serfs did apply for freedom and were, surprisingly, successful. In addition, some governors listened to the complaints of serfs and punished nobles, but this was by no means all-inclusive.|$|E

Believing the threat to be a hoax, he ignored it, but a week later received a second e-mail threat: [...] "Hello u website is under us atack to stop the DDoS send us 50000$."

500|$|In 1997, {{producer}} David Heyman {{searched for}} a children's book that could be adapted into a well-received film. He had planned to produce Diana Wynne Jones' novel The Ogre Downstairs, but his plans fell through. His staff at Heyday Films then suggested Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, which his assistant believed was [...] "a cool idea." [...] Heyman pitched the idea to Warner Bros. and in 1999, Rowling sold the company {{the rights to the}} first four Harry Potter books for a reported £1million (US$1,982,900). A demand Rowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British, nonetheless allowing for the inclusion of Irish actors such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such. Rowling was hesitant to sell the rights because she [...] "didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> control over the rest of the story" [...] by selling the rights to the characters, which would have enabled Warner Bros. to make non-author-written sequels.|$|E
500|$|Chimes, {{whose career}} {{aspirations}} owed {{little to the}} punk ethos, had left the band again soon after the recording sessions. He later said, [...] "The point was I wanted one kind of life and they wanted another and, like, why are we working together, if we want completely different things?" [...] As a result, only Simonon, Jones and Strummer were featured on the album's cover, and Chimes was credited as [...] "Tory Crimes". Strummer later described what followed: [...] "We must have tried every drummer that then had a kit. I mean every drummer in London. I think we counted 205. And that's why we were lost until we found Topper Headon." [...] Headon, who had played briefly with Jones's London SS, was nicknamed [...] "Topper" [...] by Simonon, who felt he resembled the Topper comic book character Mickey the Monkey. An excellent musician, Headon could also play piano, bass and guitar. The day after he signed up, he declared, [...] "I really wanted to join the Clash. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> even more energy than they've got—if that's possible"; interviewed over two decades later, he said his original plan was to stay briefly, gain a name for himself, {{and then move on}} to a better gig. In any event, Strummer later observed, [...] "Finding someone who not only had the chops, but the strength and the stamina to do it was just the breakthrough for us".|$|E

500|$|While Retro Studios {{tried to}} create [...] "the {{ultimate}} first-person experience" [...] with the Metroid Prime series, Sakamoto's approach with gameplay was different, particularly for the story Other M intended to tell. When Sakamoto met Team Ninja, he said his intent was a game with [...] "controls as simple as those of a NES game", so it would appeal to modern players. Team Ninja agreed with that approach, as they felt control schemes with excessive buttons were possibly turning players off the action genre, {{and tried to make}} the game employ only the Wii Remote, without resorting to the Nunchuk expansion. The development team also tried to use the simpler controls to provide flashy action, with varied special attacks that would need few button inputs to be executed. Sakamoto focused on 2D-like gameplay because he considered it more [...] "comfortable" [...] for audiences, particularly during shifts from gameplay to cutscenes, as he thought 2D [...] " [...] have the same distractions when you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> story sequences". While the developers felt no need to integrate everything from the Prime series as they were games with different concepts, a few of the elements that [...] "made those games unique" [...] were implemented into Other M, such as the [...] "immersive sight" [...] of the first-person mode. When questioned if Other M would be too similar to Ninja Gaiden, Hayashi responded that while the new game will feature heavy action-based sequences, there will still be the exploration-based sequences characteristic of other Metroid games. Sakamoto said that Other Ms story progression was {{in the same manner as}} Metroid Fusion, and stated that the collaboration between Nintendo and Team Ninja is [...] "unlike anything that's ever been done at Nintendo; it's more than just a collaborative effort — it's one group working toward a common goal".|$|E
500|$|The Herald Tribune began {{a decline}} shortly after World War II that had several causes. [...] The Reid family was long {{accustomed}} to resolve shortfalls {{at the newspaper}} with subsidies from their fortune, rather than improved business practices, seeing the paper [...] "as a hereditary possession to be sustained as a public duty rather than developed as a profit-making opportunity". [...] With its generally marginal profitability, the Herald Tribune had few opportunities to reinvest in its operations as the Times did, and the Reids' mortgage on the newspaper {{made it difficult to}} raise outside cash for needed capital improvements. After another profitable year in 1946, Bill Robinson, the Herald Tribunes business manager, decided to reinvest the profits to make needed upgrades to the newspaper's pressroom. [...] The investment squeezed the paper's resources, and Robinson decided {{to make up the difference}} at the end of the year by raising the Tribunes price from three cents to a nickel, expecting the Times, which also needed to upgrade its facilities, to do the same. [...] However, the Times, concerned by the Tribunes performance during the war, refused to go along. [...] "We didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> any quarter," [...] Times circulation manager Nathan Goldstein said. [...] "Our numbers were on the rise, and we didn't want to do anything to jeopardize them. 'No free rides for the competition' was the way we looked at it." [...] The move proved disastrous: In 1947, the Tribunes daily circulation fell nine percent, from 348,626 to 319,867. [...] Its Sunday circulation fell four percent, from 708,754 to 680,691. [...] Although the overall percentage of advertising for the paper was higher than it was in 1947, the Times was still higher: 58 percent of the average space in the New York Times in 1947 was devoted to advertising, versus a little over 50 percent of the Tribune. [...] The Times would not raise its price until 1950.|$|E
