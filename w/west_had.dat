5|$|A {{longtime}} {{fan of the}} English trip hop group Portishead, <b>West</b> <b>had</b> {{been significantly}} influenced by Roseland NYC Live, the band's 1998 live album with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip hop production. Though <b>West</b> <b>had</b> {{not been able to}} afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album. West juxtaposed the lush, intricate melodies of the string section with the hard, pounding drum rhythms of hip-hop, and used the sound for the foundation of his rapping.|$|E

A hospital, an aerodrome with three undamaged aircraft, a large quantity of petrol, and large stocks of champagne and hock were also captured.

5|$|Carthage, {{the second}} largest city in the empire, was lost along with much of North Africa in 439 AD to the Vandals, {{and the fate of}} Rome seemed sealed. By 476 AD, what {{remained}} of the Empire was completely in the hands of federated Germanic troops and when they revolted, led by Odoacer and deposed the Emperor Romulus Augustus there was nobody to stop them. Odoacer happened to hold the part of the Empire around Italy and Rome but other parts of the Empire were ruled by Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alans and others. The Empire in the <b>West</b> <b>had</b> fallen, and its remnant in Italy was no longer Roman in nature. The Eastern Roman Empire and the Goths continued to fight over Rome and the surrounding area for many years, though by this point Rome's importance was primarily symbolic.|$|E
5|$|Dennie {{was born}} on August 30, 1768, in Boston, Massachusetts to Joseph Dennie, {{a member of a}} well-to-do {{merchant}} family, and his wife Mary Green, whose father was Bartholomew Green, Jr. The Greens were a prominent printing family in colonial America; the progenitor of the family, Samuel Green, emigrated from England with John Winthrop {{and was one of the}} first printers in the colonies. Having moved to Lexington at the age of seven, Dennie returned to Boston in 1783 to study bookkeeping and later clerk in a counting house. He began preparing to enter Harvard College in 1785, under the guidance of Reverend Samuel West. <b>West</b> <b>had</b> a significant impact on Dennie, fostering his pupil's interest in literature, as well as instilling in Dennie a decidedly pro-British mindset.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{disbanding}} of the camps, {{the defeated}} {{forces of the}} former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu. The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, {{many of whom had}} lived in the refugee camps before they were attacked. In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, the population in the north <b>west</b> <b>had</b> stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated.|$|E
5|$|Generalmajor Dietrich Peltz was to {{plan the}} {{operation}} having been appointed C-in-C of II. Fliegerkorps on 8 December. Luftwaffenkommando <b>West</b> <b>had</b> ordered all units—except Jagdgeschwader 300 and 301—to attend the main planning meeting in Flammersfeld on 5 December. On 14 December, Peltz officially initiated plans for a major blow against the Allies in northwest Europe. Peltz was not a fighter pilot; his combat record was as a dive bomber pilot, flying the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. His experiences in Poland, in France, and during the early campaigns on the Eastern Front had moulded him into an outstanding ground attack specialist, making him an ideal candidate for planning Bodenplatte.|$|E

5|$|Shankar's {{parents had}} died {{by the time}} he {{returned}} from the European tour, and touring the <b>West</b> <b>had</b> become difficult because of political conflicts that would lead to World War II. Shankar gave up his dancing career in 1938 to go to Maihar and study Indian classical music as Khan's pupil, living with his family in the traditional gurukul system. Khan was a rigorous teacher and Shankar had training on sitar and surbahar, learned ragas and the musical styles dhrupad, dhamar, and khyal, and was taught the techniques of the instruments rudra veena, rubab, and sursingar. He often studied with Khan's children Ali Akbar Khan and Annapurna Devi. Shankar began to perform publicly on sitar in December 1939 and his debut performance was a jugalbandi (duet) with Ali Akbar Khan, who played the string instrument sarod.|$|E
5|$|The College Dropout is {{the debut}} studio album by American rapper Kanye West. It was {{released}} on February 10, 2004, by Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. It was recorded {{over a period of}} four years, beginning in 1999. Prior to the album's release, <b>West</b> <b>had</b> received praise for his production work for artists such as Jay-Z and Talib Kweli, but faced difficulty being accepted as a recording artist in his own right by figures in the music industry. Nonetheless intent on pursuing a solo career, it was several years before West finally received a record deal from Roc-A-Fella Records.|$|E
5|$|The {{town had}} descended into {{lawlessness}} {{with a number}} of saloons, brothels, dancing halls, and widespread gambling. The town had no law enforcement officers, and the local government officials had become bar keepers. Governor <b>West</b> <b>had</b> extended prohibition laws, but they were widely ignored in Copperfield. Some local residents had appealed to the state government for assistance. Over half the residents of the town had signed a petition, addressed to West, alleging that saloons owned by the mayor and City Council members were selling liquor to minors and staying open later than their posted hours. Governor West responded by ordering county officials to restore order, close the saloons, and force the resignations of the corrupt city leaders by December 25, 1913.|$|E

5|$|The western {{section was}} {{completed}} considerably later than its eastern counterpart, c. 425, after the <b>West</b> <b>had</b> been overrun by Germanic peoples. However, {{it appears that}} the western section was several times revised, in the period c. 400-25: e.g. the dispositions for Britain must date from before 410, as that is when it is believed Roman forces withdrew from Britain definitively. This reflects the confusion of the times. Army dispositions of armies and commands were constantly changing to reflect the needs of the moment. The scale of the chaos in this period is illustrated by Heather's analysis of units in the army of the West. Of 181 comitatus regiments listed for 425, only 84 existed before 395; and many regiments in the comitatus were simply upgraded limitanei units, implying the destruction or disbandment of around 76 comitatus regiments during the period 395-425. By 460, the western army had largely disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|There are no exact figures {{regarding}} German tank {{losses in}} Normandy. Approximately 2,300 tanks and assault guns {{were committed to}} the battle, of which only 100 to 120 crossed the Seine {{at the end of}} the campaign. While German forces reported only 481 tanks destroyed between D-day and 31 July, research conducted by No. 2 Operational Research Section of 21st Army Group indicates that the Allies destroyed around 550 tanks in June and July and another 500 in August, for a total of 1,050 tanks destroyed by enemy action, including 100 destroyed by aircraft. Luftwaffe losses amounted to 2,127 aircraft. By the end of the Normandy campaign, 55 German divisions (42 infantry and 13 panzer) had been rendered combat ineffective; seven of these were disbanded. By September, OB <b>West</b> <b>had</b> only 13 infantry divisions, 3 panzer divisions, and 2 panzer brigades rated as combat effective.|$|E
