What I'm going through {{is nothing compared to}} what they had to go through. Just know things do get better and you need to celebrate who you are. Every <b>weird</b> <b>thing</b> about you is beautiful and makes life interesting. Hopefully the song really captures that emotion of celebrating who you are ... I just felt like people hate because they don't understand or they're jealous, It's all coming from a very negative place and I really feel like people don't need to pay attention to that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Mansion Family" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Michael Polcino {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). It was the first of many episodes of the series that Polcino directed. Executive producer Mike Scully was the one who received the idea for {{the first part of the}} story. He explained on a DVD audio commentary for the episode that his grandmother was the oldest citizen of his hometown West Springfield, Massachusetts, and [...] "they had a ceremony where she was awarded a cane that had a golden head on it. And the <b>weird</b> <b>thing</b> of the ceremony is her name wasn't on the cane, and the mayor of the town stood up and he says: 'And now, of course as soon as Hazel passes away, her name will be engraved on the cane.' So she would never live to see it happen. But nonetheless, she was given the cane." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{sometime}} during Summer 2008. Miller wanted to style the filming {{as if the}} cameras are following the team like in a documentary. The first day was spent in the [...] "Ottawa Bravo" [...] safe house set, where Connie reveals the threat. Throughout the shoot, Gemma Jones had hip problems. Concerned, the producers set up a body double on hand. However, Jones insisted she could do everything herself, {{and in the end}} the double was not used. During the first shootout scene in the episode, Miller wanted to make the sequence as real as possible by having the camera film as if it was under attack. Richard Armitage recalled the shootout sequence; [...] "There was a shoot-out in the final episode where I surprised myself about the amount of rounds I could pull off and how quickly. It's a <b>weird</b> <b>thing.</b> I'm not a violent person but when you put a gun in somebody's hands something strange happens. It's like a little animal comes out of you that wants to fire the gun again." ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Holmes from Destructoid {{questioned}} {{the controversy over}} the decision by stating [...] "While there are surely plenty of folks who adore seeing their screen filled with frilly thong shots, I imagine there may be even more players out there who'd find the sudden prioritization of arse in their fighting games to be little out of place." [...] Chris Carter at Destructoid commented [...] "It's still a bit weird that something this goofy was removed, especially with the design Laura has in general," [...] and noted that a character like Necalli is [...] "probably far more harmful" [...] for children's eyes. In another article by Destructoid, Carter stated [...] "It's such a <b>weird</b> <b>thing</b> to me, because R. Mika's butt is still very visible, she just doesn't lightly tap it a few times per match." [...] Likewise, ND Medina at iDigitalTimes expressed confusion over the change, noting that her full butt was still being exposed. The butt slap was later restored as a mod for the PC version, albeit in a different pose.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Kurt comes out to his father was taken {{verbatim}} from series creator Ryan Murphy's own life.

He commented that: [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end.

[...] Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt [...] "honest" [...] and not comical or [...] "used as a punchline". He explained: [...] "I think it's probably the first time a character's sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way, and I think that's really important, and there needs to be more of that on TV." ...|$|E

He further explained, [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end.

500|$|... "We R Who We R" [...] was {{released}} as the EP's lead single on October 22, 2010.

The song also reached number one in Australia, the United Kingdom and number two in Canada, while charting within the top ten in numerous other countries.|$|E
2500|$|Now there's a <b>weird</b> <b>thing</b> going on. Partly {{proposed}} by {{a colleague of}} mine writing in The Nation, Christopher Hitchens.

The samples were also used in the closing track [...] "Galaxy in Janaki", a tribute to his mother. On the process of recording his mother's respirator, Ellison said: [...] "I {{know it was a}} <b>weird</b> <b>thing</b> to do. I'm not the type to go out recording things like that.

2500|$|In April 1998, Stern {{announced}} {{his return to}} Saturday night television after he signed a deal with CBS to compete with Saturday Night Live on NBC and MADtv on Fox. His show, The Howard Stern Radio Show, an hour-long program that aired on mostly CBS affiliates, was formed of taped highlights from the radio show with additional material unseen from his nightly E! show, including animated segments and exclusive behind the scenes footage. Following its debut on August 22, 1998 on 79 stations nationwide, the show began to lose affiliates after two episodes as local broadcasters became concerned with the risque content. By June 1999, the number of stations carrying the show had decreased to fifty-five. After three seasons, the final show aired on November 17, 2001 to around thirty stations. Stern reflected on the endeavour: [...] "It was a <b>weird</b> <b>thing.</b> When I did the Channel 9 show we used to beat Saturday Night Live in New York ... I didn't think [...] {{was a good idea}} actually because [...] was already running on the E! network. It was a mistake ... they ultimately wanted what the Channel 9 show was doing".|$|E
2500|$|On October 22, 2003, Moody {{left the}} band during the European tour for Fallen, {{reportedly}} because of creative differences. In an interview several months later, Amy Lee said: [...] "...we'd gotten {{to a point}} that if something didn't change, we wouldn't have been able to make a second record." [...] This became a point of confusion, as Moody and Lee stated on the Fallen album liner notes that they were best friends. Lee said it was almost a relief that Moody left because of tensions created within the band. During an interview, Lee has said, [...] "I don't know, I just think it's exactly what I would've expected. He's more about kind of the pop influence sort of thing and also, you know, about being commercial and I mean selling albums: That's the part of him we often disagreed on. I wanted to do the more artistic <b>weird</b> <b>thing</b> and he'd wanna do the thing that people would want to hear..." [...] She adds [...] "So that's a lot of the reason [...] it's been so fun writing now, is [...] we're not thinking about that. It's like 'what do we like?', 'what's fun?', like 'what do we want to do that's different?'" [...] Moody was replaced by Terry Balsamo from Cold.|$|E

2500|$|The duo had not {{expected}} to star in a film at this point of their careers, with Mitchell stating that [...] "it probably came much earlier than {{we thought we would}} do a film. [...] It landed very fortuitously on our doormat." [...] At first, Mitchell and Webb were not considered for the roles of Harry and Karl, but O'Connor changed his mind [...] "it became clear they could do these parts really well. [...] And we thought, well, wouldn't it be great to do our first movie with people we know, because we really admire and enjoy working with them". Unlike most other Mitchell and Webb projects, Olivia Colman does not have a main part in the film. O'Connor explained that [...] "Olivia was part of the development and did some read-throughs with us. [...] I guess our feeling was that because of the relationship between [...] and Olivia in Peep Show, to have taken that same relationship, {{it would have been a}} really <b>weird</b> <b>thing</b> for the audience. [...] I must say I think she'd have been great in the part, she was great in the read-throughs, I just thought we couldn't have done that." [...] Mitchell admitted, the day before the film's release, that he [...] "really got into" [...] his role as Harry.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{features}} multiple post-credit scenes. The first {{gives the}} Vulture {{a chance at}} redemption, showing him protect Parker from another villain. Watts said this [...] "was a really interesting thing {{in the development of}} the story. You couldn’t just rely on the tropes of the villain being a murderer and killing a bunch of people. He had to be redeemable in some capacity in the end and that he believes everything he said, especially about his family." [...] The second post-credits scene is an additional Captain America PSA, where he talks about the value of patience—a joke at the expense of the audience, who have just waited through the film's credits to see the scene. This was a [...] "last-minute addition" [...] to the film. Watts completed work on Homecoming at the beginning of June 2017, approving the final visual effects shots. He stated that he had never been told that he could not do something by Marvel or Sony, saying, [...] "You assume you’ll have to fight for every little <b>weird</b> <b>thing</b> you wanna do, but I didn’t really ever run into that. I got to do kind of everything I wanted to." [...] That month, Starr explained that he was playing the academic decathlon coach at Parker's high school, and Marshall-Green was said to be portraying another Shocker.|$|E
2500|$|Upon the character's announcement, Treadwell-Collins {{explained}} {{that in their}} fictional backstory, Mick and Linda {{have been married for}} over twenty years, and have been together since they were teenagers. Hello called them [...] "childhood sweethearts". They were called [...] "a tight family unit", and Treadwell-Collins said they have a [...] "good marriage" [...] and [...] "an easy shorthand with each other—but can also still fight like teenagers." [...] He said that the characters would laugh, cry, argue and make up, which would embarrass their children, but would delight their neighbours. It was said that the couple [...] "still love each other, no matter what life throws at them", and that after moving to the fictional setting of Walford from Watford, [...] "life's about to throw them a few curve balls." [...] Inside Soap said that Mick and Linda have a passionate relationship and adore each other. Bright {{explained that}} Mick and Linda have grown up together, and said: [...] "It's a <b>weird</b> <b>thing</b> when you've known someone your whole life—you're more than just husband and wife. You're something else." [...] She later said that Mick and Linda have known each other since they were five or six years old, and can finish each other's sentences and know how the other is feeling by the look on their face. Dyer and Bright both said that Mick and Linda are passionate and lustful, with Bright saying they are [...] "madly in love" [...] and describing a [...] "real fizz between them". She said, [...] "they're kind of tearing each other's heads off or tearing each other's clothes off." [...] Dyer said there is a [...] "Den and Angie [...] feel" [...] to the relationship. Jane Simon from the Daily Mirror said that the fact Mick and Linda are happily married is a [...] "rare thing in soapland". However, in July 2014, it was revealed in storylines that Mick and Linda are not married, yet all their families believes they are, a fact that left Carena Crawford from All About Soap wondering why they never got married and why they kept this a secret, but she hoped for a big wedding.|$|E

2500|$|Upon arrival, Bree {{was shown}} as a polite and sensitive, well trained doctor, sharply {{contrasting}} her sister Brooke (Beth Allen). The character made friends quickly and appeared overly generous. However, as the character developed, {{it was revealed}} she too had a nasty side and {{was a lot more}} similar to Brooke than originally thought. Blampied enjoyed playing the personality change, labelling it as; [...] "making a great descent" [...] and stating; [...] "It's a massive change from how the character arrived and through her relationship with Brooke and Vinnie, it goes haywire. I'm looking forward to the challenge of how to justify those decisions she makes." [...] Bree's manipulative persona was blamed on her [...] "tumultuous upbringing" [...] which saw her be fostered by several families before being adopted at 10. As a result, she suffered from self-consciousness. Blampied enjoyed playing such a complex character, stating: [...] "It's definitely a lot more interesting than always being the nice guy because you do get to say and do some things you would never do and it's the furthest thing from my personal character and demeanor, so it is quite a turnaround." [...] Blampied went on to explain her mixed opinions of Bree: [...] "I obviously don't agree with what she's doing. Sometimes I read the script and go, 'Why are you doing that? There are a hundred easier ways to do that.' I have days where I really don't like Bree and what she's doing." [...] The character has been described as [...] "conniving" [...] and [...] "scheming". Blampied did not at first realise how manipulative Bree was to become and when she realised the extent to which writers were pushing her antagonistic characterisation, she described it as [...] "daunting". However Blampied had been warned, [...] "Someone told me, if you're on Shortland Street, always play your character as if you have a secret – because you will have a secret!" [...] To portray Bree's penultimate breakdown, Blampied researched borderline personality disorder and severe narcissism. Blampied enjoyed how Bree was portrayed in her final scene, stating: [...] "We don't often see Bree's vulnerable side side and when we do she's still being manipulative and deceitful ... I really like the way she ends up because {{there is an element of}} real sadness to it ... when she realises how wrong she's been." [...] Blampied cared for her character and hoped for an uneventful future for Bree, [...] "I'd like to see her get well, hold down a job and maybe even get into a relationship. Life is hard for her and always has been. I care about Bree and I know that sounds like a <b>weird</b> <b>thing</b> to say." [...] Describing Bree upon her return, Blampied stated, [...] "She's still mentally very fragile, and her manipulative tendencies are most definitely still at the surface", but affirmed, [...] "she's a lot more aware now though".|$|E

Some jester, enlarging upon {{the increase of}} bald heads and purblind people, has deduced a wonderful future {{for the children of}} men. Man, he said, was nowadays a hairless creature by forty or fifty, and for hair we gave him a wig; shrivelled, and we padded him; toothless, and lo! false teeth set in gold. Did he lose a limb, and a fine, new, artificial one was at his disposal; get indigestion, and to hand was artificial digestive fluid or bile or pancreatine, as the case might be. Complexions, too, were replaceable, spectacles superseded an inefficient eye-lens, and imperceptible false diaphragms were thrust into the failing ear. So he went over our anatomies, until, at last, he had conjured up a <b>weird</b> <b>thing</b> of shreds and patches, a simulacrum, an artificial body of a man, with but a doubtful germ of living flesh lurking somewhere in his recesses. To that, he held, we were coming.|$|E
