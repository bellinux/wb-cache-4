25|$|Harvard {{political}} scientist and historian Samuel P. Huntington argues in <b>Who</b> <b>Are</b> <b>We?</b> The Challenges to America's National Identity that illegal immigration, primarily from Mexico, threatens {{to divide the}} United States culturally, into an Anglo-Protestant north, central, and eastern portion, and a Catholic-Hispanic southwest. Immigration researcher Andrea Nill has a similar point. Nill noted that the association of illegal immigration with Latinos would bring adverse attention to their community. Recent immigration laws could help fuel these associations and possibly encourage citizens to discriminate and {{distance themselves from the}} Hispanic culture. Furthermore, this separation could allow for tensions and possibly violence to grow between both groups.|$|E

500|$|Originally, {{the film}} would stand alone; {{producer}} Kevin Feige said [...] "about half" [...] the movie {{would be set}} during World War II before moving into the modern day. Producer Avi Arad said, [...] "The biggest opportunity with Captain America is as a man 'out of time', coming back today, looking at our world {{through the eyes of}} someone who thought the perfect world was small-town United States. Sixty years go by, and <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> today? Are we better?" [...] He cited the Back to the Future trilogy as an influence, and claimed he had [...] "someone in mind to be the star, and definitely someone in mind to be the director". In February 2006, Arad hoped to have a summer 2008 theatrical release date. Jon Favreau approached Arad to direct the film as a comedy, but he chose to make Iron Man instead. In April 2006, David Self was hired to write the script. He explained that Captain America was his favorite superhero as a child because [...] "my dad told me I could one day be Captain America". Joe Johnston met with Marvel to discuss directing the film.|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{have noted}} that the Earthsea novels in general {{received}} less critical attention because they were considered children's books. Le Guin herself took exception to this treatment of children's literature, describing it as [...] "adult chauvinist piggery". In 1976, literary scholar George Slusser criticized the [...] "silly publication classification designating the original series as 'children's literature'". Barbara Bucknall stated that [...] "Le Guin was not writing for young children when she wrote these fantasies, nor yet for adults. She was writing for 'older kids.' But in fact she can be read, like Tolkien, by ten-year-olds and by adults. These stories are ageless because they deal with problems that confront us at any age." [...] Only in later years did A Wizard of Earthsea receive attention from a more general audience. Literary scholar T. A. Shippey {{was among the first}} to treat A Wizard of Earthsea as serious literature, assuming in his analysis of the volume that it belonged alongside works by C. S. Lewis and Fyodor Dostoevsky, among others. Margaret Atwood said that she saw the book as [...] "a fantasy book for adults", and added that although the book could be categorized as either young adult fiction or as fantasy, but since it dealt with themes such as [...] "life and mortality and <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> as human beings", it could be read and enjoyed by anybody older than twelve. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction echoed this view, saying the series's appeal went [...] "far beyond" [...] the young adults for whom it was written. It went on to praise the book as [...] "austere but vivid", and said the series was more thoughtful than the Narnia books by C. S. Lewis. In his 1980 history of fantasy, Brian Attebery called the Earthsea trilogy [...] "the most challenging and richest American fantasy to date". Slusser described the Earthsea cycle as a [...] "work of high style and imagination", and the original trilogy of books a product of [...] "genuine epic vision". In 1974, critic Robert Scholes compared Le Guin's work favorably to that of C. S. Lewis, saying, [...] "Where C. S. Lewis worked out a specifically Christian set of values, Ursula LeGuin works not with a theology but with an ecology, a cosmology, a reverence for the universe as a self-regulating structure." [...] He added that Le Guin's three Earthsea novels were themselves a sufficient legacy for anybody to leave. In 2014 David Pringle called it [...] "a beautiful story—poetic, thrilling, and profound".|$|E

[...] Similarly, the {{notion of the}} good bloke was attacked in the press when Australian rules footballer Bachar Houli was given a reduced suspension for striking another player in the Australian Football League on the grounds that he was a good bloke.
