25|$|Vasco {{is heavily}} reliant {{on the port}} {{for most of its}} {{economic}} activity. Manganese ore mined in interior regions is brought to Mormugao by barges navigating the rivers Mandovi and Zuari, and then either collected in the Mormugao Port to be loaded onto bulk carrier ships or directly loaded onto the ships using trans-shippers. Ore which is collected on the port is handled by machinery called MOHP (Mechanical Ore-Handling Plant). This includes massive bucket <b>wheel</b> <b>loaders</b> and miles of conveyor belts. The port has berthing facilities for large cruise liners as well as a floating dry dock. There are shipping and freight forwarding agents as well as offices of major mining companies based in the city.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s it was {{realized}} that as the iron mines in Finland would soon be exhausted and there would not be enough suitable ice-strengthened tonnage to guarantee a continuous supply of raw materials for the expanding steel works. The draught of the bulk carriers available in the market exceeded the water depth of the port of Raahe and unloading the ships would have required a large number of cranes. While transporting the raw materials by barges proved to be feasible as they had low draught and could be unloaded with <b>wheel</b> <b>loaders,</b> towed barges could not be used during the winter and their poor maneuverability made them unsuitable for the confined waterways. For this reason it was decided to investigate if {{it would be possible to}} design a pusher-barge system that could also be operated in ice conditions.|$|E

It is considered that there are two categories of <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> energy saving technology: one is to increase fuel utilization rate, and the other is improve transmission efficiency of torque converter. However, realizing one of these two aspects can not save fuel ideally; improvement in both aspects will bring satisfactory energy materials saving effects...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} problem to measure and control signals on a Volvo L 110 G <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> without interfering with the {{original}} Electronic Control Units. The aim is to develop an Electronic Breakout Unit (EBU) that can {{be connected to the}} original wiring without damaging or altering any of the original electronics. The EBU shall be controlled over Ethernet. This allows for data to be logged by an on-board PC while the <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> is tested on the field. The on-board PC also allows the <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> to be controlled with advanced remote control algorithms. In this work, the hardware design considerations of a concept to measure and control a vehicle through an electronic add-on system is presented.

40|$|Project (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Design and {{analysis}} of multi body system is a challenging task that requires the knowledge of machine design, computer aided design (CAD), finite element analysis and structural dynamics. <b>Wheel</b> <b>loader</b> vehicle {{is a type of}} earth moving machine which falls in the category of multi body system. This project is based on the concepts of reverse engineering where in which the <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> is designed and analyzed to precision. Initially the dimensions of the <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> are documented by using vernier caliper and full scale ruler. These dimensions are vitally implemented in generating the 3 D model of the <b>wheel</b> <b>loader.</b> SolidWorks has been used for 3 D model creation. In order to run the design to real time standards a few design modifications are taken into account. Design of lift arm cylinders, lift arms, tilt/bucket cylinder and connecting rod are modified to real time standards. Kinematics of <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> has been analyzed in SolidWorks. For kinetics and structural analysis the model has been exported from SolidWorks to MSC Visual Nastran Desktop 4 D. In order to analyze the structural dynamics, the method of finite element analysis is used. The results obtain from the stress analysis are within the range of yield stress of materials used for designing of <b>wheel</b> <b>loader.</b> The design is verified to be real time with the factor of safety 1. 2. Reverse engineering process is helpful to analyze the existing model and helps in improving design. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

Thisreport describes the work of developing a software designed to remote control a VolvoL 110 G <b>wheel</b> <b>loader.</b> Remote controlling a Volvo L 110 G <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> involves many challenges. One chal-lange that this report focuses on is to enable {{the use of a}} simulator platform developedby Oryx as the remote control station. The simulator from Oryx is a cockpit from a Volvo <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> which has almost allcontrols as the L 110 G has.
