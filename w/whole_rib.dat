5000|$|As a {{breathing}} specialist, Stough worked in several hospitals from 1958 to 1962 assisting emphysema patients. The veterans' hospital in East Orange, New Jersey was the first. At the time, the respiratory muscles and {{the mechanics of}} breathing were called a [...] "no man's land between anatomy and physiology." [...] By comparing the breathing patterns of the patients with his infant daughter's, Stough realized that instead of calmly letting the air come into the lungs from the diaphragm, the patients were gasping for air using accessory muscles that are not efficient for breathing. He then sought to release tensions in those muscles and the <b>whole</b> <b>rib</b> cage by light manual pressure and gentle tapping. Soon, the first positive results could be observed, {{as the amount of}} oxygen needed to be given to the patients dropped after the sessions with Stough.|$|E
5000|$|The {{longitudinal}} sculpture {{shows the}} whorls crossed from suture to suture by low, sharpish, subangulately projecting, dextrally convex, hardly oblique ribs, which run continuously, but are slightly diminishing in number, up the spire, there being about 15 {{on the last}} and 11 on the first regular whorl. On the base they bend strongly to the right, and die out {{at the point of}} the snout. They are parted by hollowed furrows which are rather broader than they. Both ribs and furrows are scratched with very fine, almost microscopic lines of growth, which coincide with the course of the ribs. In the furrows a few of these lines are slightly stronger than the rest. The spiral sculpture shows below the sinus-area a very slight angular projection of the whorls, which is made more marked by a thickening and elevation of the ribs at this point. This is a feature which on the earlier whorls is very distinct, the <b>whole</b> <b>rib</b> being individualised by the central nodule into which it rises. But further on these nodules lose in importance. At the top of each whorl and close to the suture lies a small flattened thread, rising into minute longitudinal nodules at the ribs. Below this and above the angulation is a slight furrow where the scars of the old sinuses occur. In all this part the surface of the shell is covered by minute spiral threads which lower down become stronger. They are parted by minute furrows of about the same breadth as the threads. These are all exquisitely fretted by the longitudinal scratches.|$|E

Current design of restraint systems as well as other passive safety measures are designed based on anthropomorphic details of younger population. Developing another dummy representing elderly female population is a costly effort, while a finite element (FE) model of elderly female with similar anthropomorphic details and age- and gender-specific material properties can be a better alternative solution. The current research focuses on the development of a FE model of an elderly female torso, because a thorough search through literature has identified thorax as the most severely injured body part for elderly females due to rib fractures in motor vehicle induced trauma. Therefore, data from previously conducted rib bending experiments on 278 rib specimens taken from antero-lateral portion of 82 cadavers were analyzed to see the effect of age, gender, height, and weight on the rib bio-mechanical response parameters such as the maximum bending moment (MBM), maximum bending angle (Ɵmax), slope of moment-angle curve (SMT), and on average cortical thickness value. It was found that, in comparison to males, females had significantly lower values for the MBM (p = 0. 000), SMT (p = 0. 000), and average cortical-bone thickness (p = 0. 001). Samples of ribs taken from elderly specimens failed at lower values of MBM than those from younger specimens, and had lower SMT, both in males and females (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). The generalized estimating equations were developed for each bio-mechanical response parameter in terms of dependent variables, namely the age, gender, height, and weight. Further, the material model parameters for elderly female rib specimen with constant cortical bone thickness were optimized, which in turn were used in developed whole body FE model. The cortical thickness variations in different sections (anterior, antero-lateral, lateral, posteo-lateral, and posterior) of <b>whole</b> <b>rib</b> were also assigned based on those reported in the literature. The model predicted peak responses as well as the fracture locations of the ribs were analyzed against <b>whole</b> <b>rib</b> bending tests with favorable result. Once the response of single <b>whole</b> <b>rib</b> was validated, further the response of elderly female <b>whole</b> <b>rib</b> cage was validated against data reported from frontal pendulum impacts at different speeds as well as data reported for belt loading. The validations results showed that the developed FE model can represent the overall behavior of elderly female during the type of loading as experienced in motor vehicle crashes...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare methods for estimative of body composition of goats based on tritiated water space technique (TOH), specific gravity (SG) of carcass and 9 - 11 th ribs. Ten Toggenburg x Alpine intact male goat kids, from 5. 3 ± 0. 4 to 25. 9 ± 1. 3 kg of body weight (BW), were used to estimate body composition by: 1) direct method, 2) TOH method, 3) SG of the carcass and 4) SG of the 9 - 11 th <b>whole</b> <b>ribs.</b> In addition, update linear equations for predicting body composition were developed using data from direct method. The TOH space overestimated water body composition on average 31 %. The SG of the carcass and 9 - 11 th ribs underestimated water empty body composition (%) on average 21 and 12 %, respectively. In spite of its overestimate, the determination of TOH space can be used as a reliable field technique to study relative changes in body composition of growing goats. Specific gravity is practicable in most circumstances and does not require expensive equipment. However, the SG of the carcass and 9 - 11 th ribs has not a valid equation to predict body composition of growing goats. ...|$|R
40|$|An earlier {{model for}} the study of rib cage {{mechanics}} was modified so that rib deformity in scoliosis could be better represented. The rigid ribs of that model were replaced by five-segment deformable rits. Literature data on cadaver rib mechanical behavior were used to assign stiffnesses to the new individual model ribs so that experimental and model rib deflections agreed. Shear and tension/compression stiffnesses had little effect on individual rib deformation, but bending stiffnesses had a major effect. Level-to-level differences in mechanical behavior could be explained almost exclusively by level to level differences in the rib shape. The model ribs were then assembled into a <b>whole</b> <b>rib</b> cage. Computer simulations of <b>whole</b> <b>rib</b> cage behaviors, both in vivo and in vitro, showed a reasonable agreement with the measured behaviors. The model was used to study rib cage mechanics in two scolioses, one with a 43 [deg] and the other with a 70 [deg] Cobb angle. Scoliotic rib cage deformities were quantified by parameters measuring the rib cage lateral offset, rib cage axial rotation, rib cage volume and rib distortion. Rib distortion was quantified both in best-fit and simulated computer tomography (CT) scan planes. Model rib distortion was much smaller in best-fit planes than in CT planes. The total rib cage volume changed little {{in the presence of the}} scolioses, but it became asymmetrically distributed...|$|E

The aim {{of this study is to}} define the 3 D geometry of children's rib cages: including sternum, ribs and costal cartilage. Three-dimensional reconstructions of 960 ribs, 518 costal cartilages and 113 sternebrae were performed on thoracic CT-scans of 48 children, aged four months to 15 years. The geometry of the sternum was detailed and nine parameters were used to describe the ribs and rib cages. A "costal index" was defined as the ratio between cartilage length and <b>whole</b> <b>rib</b> length to evaluate the cartilage ratio for each rib level. For all children, the costal index decreased from rib level one to three and increased from level three to seven. For all levels, the cartilage accounted for 45 to 60 % of the rib length, and was longer for the first years of life. The mean costal index decreased by 21 % for subjects over three years old compared to those under three (p< 10 - 4). The volume of the sternebrae was found to be highly age dependent.

40|$|The {{automatic}} extraction and {{labeling of}} the rib center-lines {{is a useful}} yet challenging task in many clinical appli-cations. In this paper, we propose a new approach integrat-ing rib seed point detection and template matching to de-tect and identify each rib in chest CT scans. The bottom-up learning based detection exploits local image cues and top-down deformable template matching imposes global shape constraints. To adapt to the shape deformation of different rib cages whereas maintain high computational efficiency, we employ a Markov Random Field (MRF) based articu-lated rigid transformation method followed by Active Con-tour Model (ACM) deformation. Compared with traditional methods that each rib is individually detected, traced and labeled, the new approach is not only much more robust due to prior shape constraints of the <b>whole</b> <b>rib</b> cage, but re-moves tedious post-processing such as rib pairing and or-dering steps because each rib is automatically labeled dur-ing the template matching. For experimental validation, we create an annotated database of 112 challenging volumes with ribs of various sizes, shapes, and pathologies such as metastases and frac-tures. The proposed approach shows orders of magnitude higher detection and labeling accuracy than state-of-the-art solutions and runs about 40 seconds for a complete rib cage on the average. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn some cases, {{skeletal}} {{and soft}} issue elements {{are required for}} chest wall reconstruction. Although muscle flaps and ribs are commonly used for achieving ideal reconstruction, deformation and loss of bone strength are unavoidable in such cases. In the present report, we describe a technique for chest wall reconstruction that can help avoid such donor site deformity. A 59 -year-old woman with metastasis of a malignant mixed tumor in the parotid gland underwent resection from the sternoclavicular joint to {{the first and second}} ribs, including the manubrium and part of the sternum body. To achieve chest wall reconstruction, we used a pectoralis major flap along with two dual-partitioned ribs. In this modified procedure, instead of simply using the flaps with the <b>whole</b> <b>ribs</b> (which is common), we only used the anterior cortical portion of the ribs. This helped preserve the chest wall strength and prevented deformity at the donor site. At 7 months after surgery, the cut ribs in the reconstructed area and the original donor site appeared stable, without any complications, on computer tomography. Although the thickness of the bone used was half of that used with the conventional method, the skeletal strength was sufficient for her daily activities. Our modified method requires some additional effort for cutting the ribs, {{but the rest of the}} procedure involves the use of a conventional, simple rib-muscle flap. With this method, donor site deformity can be prevented, and the procedure can not only be adapted for chest wall reconstruction but also for other skeletal reconstructions that require the use of ribs...|$|R

40|$|Manatees are docile {{marine mammals}} that are {{inhabitants}} of the Florida coastline {{as well as some}} of the natural springs. They are listed as an endangered species by the U. S. Department of the Interior. The coexistence of humans and manatees in Florida waterways has contributed to the depletion of the manatee population: collisions between watercrafts and manatees are responsible for 25 % of all manatee deaths. Previous research at the University of Florida aimed to reduce watercraft-related deaths by relating the work-to-fracture of <b>whole</b> manatee <b>ribs</b> to the kinetic energy of a small boat traveling at various speeds. The intention was to provide scientific evidence for the reduction of speed limits in manatee populated waterways. Data collected by the researchers was limited by the scope of their research, and there still remains significant work to be done to understand the response of manatee rib bones to mechanical loading. The purpose of the present study was to fully characterize the elastic anisotropy of the Florida manatee rib bone in terms of mechanical and fracture properties. Previous research conducted on anisotropic materials shows that neglecting anisotropy (directional dependence of material properties) by modeling a material as isotropic (non-directionally dependent) reduces the accuracy of the analysis. Therefore, it was necessary to first establish an appropriate material model for manatee rib bone (specific aim 1) that could be used to accurately predict the response of the material to failure loading. Stereographic imaging techniques utilizing visual (digital) image correlation were developed to measure the elastic anisotropic constitutive constants of manatee rib bone (specific aim 2). These techniques were verified by comparison with traditional mechanical testing techniques. Once fully characterized, experimental fracture tests were performed on the material (specific aim 3). Numerical models of the fracture specimens were then developed that incorporated experimentally determined anisotropic elastic constants, failure loads, and critical crack lengths (specific aim 4) to elucidate the fracture properties of manatee rib bone. It was found that manatee rib bone was more anisotropic and less tough than similar classifications of bone from other animals. Further contributing to the uniqueness of this material, the tissue was previously shown to have a greater mineral density than bone from most other animals, manatee ribs are mostly cortical bone, and the ribs do not possess a marrow cavity. Thus manatee ribs are brittle, solid structures that exhibit a high degree of anisotropy and they have potential to fracture with relative ease. From an engineering perspective, my study introduces modeling and analysis tools never before used to study bone fracture. From a conservation standpoint, the information gathered from this study (with proper interpretation) can be used to help protect the already depleted manatee population by providing additional scientific evidence for restricting speed limits of watercraft in manatee populated waterways...|$|R
40|$|All living {{tissues and}} cells on Earth {{are subject to}} {{gravitational}} acceleration, but no reports have verified whether acceleration mode influences bone formation and healing. Therefore, {{this study was to}} compare the effects of two acceleration modes, vibration and constant (centrifugal) accelerations, on bone formation and healing in the trunk using BMP 2 -induced ectopic bone formation (EBF) mouse model and a rib fracture healing (RFH) rat model. Additionally, we tried to verify the difference in mechanism of effect on bone formation by accelerations between these two models. Three groups (low- and high-magnitude vibration and control-VA groups) were evaluated in the vibration acceleration study, and two groups (centrifuge acceleration and control-CA groups) were used in the constant acceleration study. In each model, the intervention was applied for ten minutes per day from three days after surgery for eleven days (EBF model) or nine days (RFH model). All animals were sacrificed the day after the intervention ended. In the EBF model, ectopic bone was evaluated by macroscopic and histological observations, wet weight, radiography and microfocus computed tomography (micro-CT). In the RFH model, <b>whole</b> fracture-repaired <b>ribs</b> were excised with removal of soft tissue, and evaluated radiologically and histologically. Ectopic bones in the low-magnitude group (EBF model) had significantly greater wet weight and were significantly larger (macroscopically and radiographically) than those in the other two groups, whereas the size and wet weight of ectopic bones in the centrifuge acceleration group showed no significant difference compared those in control-CA group. All ectopic bones showed calcified trabeculae and maturated bone marrow. Micro-CT showed that bone volume (BV) in the low-magnitude group of EBF model was significantly higher than those in the other two groups (3. 1 ± 1. 2 mm 3 v. s. 1. 8 ± 1. 2 mm 3 in high-magnitude group and 1. 3 ± 0. 9 mm 3 in control-VA group), but BV in the centrifuge acceleration group had no significant difference compared those in control-CA group. Union rate and BV in the low-magnitude group of RFH model were also significantly higher than those in the other groups (Union rate: 60 % v. s. 0 % in the high-magnitude group and 10 % in the control-VA group, BV: 0. 69 ± 0. 30 mm 3 v. s. 0. 15 ± 0. 09 mm 3 in high-magnitude group and 0. 22 ± 0. 17 mm 3 in control-VA group). BV/TV in the low-magnitude group of RFH model was significantly higher than that in control-VA group (59. 4 ± 14. 9 % v. s. 35. 8 ± 13. 5 %). On the other hand, radiographic union rate (10 % in centrifuge acceleration group v. s. 20 % in control-CA group) and micro-CT parameters in RFH model were not significantly different between two groups in the constant acceleration studies. Radiographic images of non-union rib fractures showed cartilage at the fracture site and poor new bone formation, whereas union samples showed only new bone. In conclusion, low-magnitude vibration acceleration promoted bone formation at the trunk in both BMP-induced ectopic bone formation and rib fracture healing models. However, the micro-CT parameters were not similar between two models, which suggested that there might be difference in the mechanism of effect by vibration between two models...|$|R
