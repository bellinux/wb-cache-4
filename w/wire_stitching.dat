A customer named Henry Whitaker brought a manually driven, hand-cranked Berliner Gramophone, developed by Emile Berliner, into Johnson’s shop and asked Johnson to design a spring driven motor for it. Johnson did so, but Whitaker found the result unsatisfactory.|$|E
50|$|In Zimbabwean Shona music, a deze is a halved {{calabash}} gourd {{in which}} an mbira is placed in order to amplify its sound. It is typically round in shape and has bottle caps, shells or other objects strung around its perimeter which vibrate with the mbira, creating a buzzing sound. Cracked deze frequently are repaired by <b>wire</b> <b>stitching.</b> Modern deze are often constructed out of fiberglass and epoxy for increased durability.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 11). My sculptures {{bring to}} the surface the extremes {{people are willing to}} undergo in order to attain societal notions of "ideal beauty". Popular culture and the media play a large role in perpetuating these ideas. Magazines, reality TV, advertising, and radio are society's primary source of information, which contain images and vocabulary that lead us to believe that we must some how achieve the standards society has set for beauty. In my work, distorted torsos of the female body reflect the ideal that America has put forth for its citizens. The skin on my sculptures is stretched and pulled to the limit, much like a plastic surgeon would stretch and stitch the skin of a patient in order to sculpt the body to fit a specific mold. I stuff nylon to near bursting to achieve a distorted view. The <b>wire</b> <b>stitching</b> around the abdomen and breast of each figure is representative of extreme measures people take to maintain or achieve idealized bodies. I use found objects or objects that I have made myself such as jewelry boxes, display cases, picture frames, furniture and on a few occasions some children's toys as a means of display. Utilizing display strategies (museum display, retail, etc) allows me to convey a message about vanity and culture...|$|E

40|$|Insulated Cu wire {{technology}} offers potential solutions for fine and ultra-fine pitch wire bonding as the insulator coating {{on the bare}} wire prevents wires shorting problem. Most previous works focused on insulated <b>wire</b> <b>stitch</b> bonding. This paper presents a comparison study between insulated Cu and bare Cu wire ball-bonding process characterisation in the standpoints of free air ball formation, Al splash, hardness, ball bond strength and intermetallic growth at the bond interface study. Spherical and clean free air ball was formed using lower electric flame off energy compared to bare Cu wire. The study shows that insulated Cu bonding demonstrated comparable equivalent ball bond strength to bare Cu wire bonding at T- 0 and even after subjected to isothermal aging 175 degrees C up to 1008 hours. Intermetallic formation was uniform at the bond interface for both wires. Insulated Cu wire demonstrates good bondability and reliability performance, suitable for fine pitch wire bonding in large-scale integration applications...|$|R

40|$|Future {{generations of}} robots will include systems {{constructed}} from soft, conformable materials with embedded function for wearable and/or human-robot interaction applications. In particular, active textiles may {{be employed in}} applications, such as wearable computing, proprioceptive feedback, or load augmentation while potentially exploiting many textile manufacturing processes that are already widespread. In this discussion, a preliminary prototype of a robotic fabric with embedded actuation and sensing will be presented. By attaching the same robotic fabric to a soft body in different configurations, unique motions (such as compression and bending) have been demonstrated. The prototype incorporates shape-memory alloy (SMA) <b>wires</b> <b>stitched</b> onto a fabric base to actuate the fabric. Custom-designed hyperelastic strain sensors, stitched alongside the SMA wire, {{were used to determine}} the displacement of the fabric and to qualitatively differentiate between the compressive and bending motions demonstrated. In addition, a parametric study was performed to better understand SMA-fabric interactions. Parameters that were studied include elasticity of the fabric base, stitch length, stitch thread elasticity, and programmed coil diameter. Empirical trends for each parameter will be presented in the context of end-to-end displacement and force generation, as well as resulting design guidelines for tailoring robotic fabrics towards various applications. Finally, this discussion will highlight the manufacturability of robotic fabrics that employ thread-like actuators and sensors via common techniques such as sewing and stitching...|$|R
40|$|Purpose A new {{technique}} is demonstrated for extensive high-resolution intra-operative atrial mapping that will facilitate the localization of atrial fibrillation (AF) sources and identifica-tion of the substrate perpetuating AF. Methods Prior {{to the start}} of extra-corporal circulation, a 8 × 24 -electrode array (2 -mm inter-electrode distance) is placed subsequently on all the right and left epicardial atrial sites, including Bachmann’s bundle, for recording of unipolar elec-trograms during sinus rhythm and (induced) AF. AF is in-duced by high-frequency pacing at the right atrial free wall. A pacemaker <b>wire</b> <b>stitched</b> to the right atrium serves as a reference signal. The indifferent pole is connected to a steal wire fixed to subcutaneous tissue. Electrograms are recorded by a computerized mapping system and, after amplification (gain 1000), filtering (bandwidth 0. 5 – 400 Hz), sampling (1 kHz) and analogue to digital conversion (16 bits), automatically stored on hard disk. During the mapping proce-dure, real-time visualization secures electrogram quality. Analysis will be performed offline. Results This technique was performed in 168 patients of 18 years and older, with coronary and/or structural heart disease, with or without AF, electively scheduled for cardiac surgery and a ventricular ejection fraction above 40 %. The mean duration of the entire mapping proce-dure including preparation time was 9 ± 2 min. Complications related to the mapping procedure during or after cardiac surgery were not observed. Conclusions We introduce the first epicardial atrial map-ping approach with a high resolution of ≥ 1728 record-ing sites which can be performed in a procedure time of only 9 ± 2 mins. This mapping technique can potentially identify areas responsible for initiation and persistence of AF and hopefully can individualize both diagnosis and therapy of AF...|$|R
40|$|This report investigates {{adaptations of}} {{electronic}} packaging {{methods used to}} create stacks of these sensors. Four methods were developed and tested {{to determine the best}} option in terms of mechanical stability and electrical conductivity of the system. For the first method, a stack is created by way of through paper vias (TPVs), a hole that is cut in the pads of the sensors and then filled with electrically conductive adhesive through the openings on the two sensors to be joined. The second method is called mechanical caulking and connects sensors through pads which have been lined with copper tape backed with conductive adhesive. The connection is created with a small copper rivet which is flattened in place by compressive force. The third method is the stitching method which is inspired by sewing of fabric. A pattern of thin copper <b>wire</b> is <b>stitched</b> on the pad of a sensor that is lined with copper tape backed with conductive adhesive. The <b>wire</b> is then <b>stitched</b> through a second sensor that is treated similarly with copper tape and the stack receives the same pattern through the two layers as was applied to the first sensor alone. The final method is the collapsed daisy chain which is the linear connection of sensors to their neighboring sensors via copper tape backed with conductive adhesive. The row of sensors is then collapsed in an alternating orientation into a single stack...|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: The {{posterior}} {{soft tissue}} repair is 1 of the preventing factors for dislocation after {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA). The aim of our study was to analyse THA patients with posterior soft tissue repair in terms of suture durability, time of suture failure and correlate the changes in leg length and offset postoperatively to suture durability. Methods: A total of 37 consecutive THA patients operated for osteoarthritis {{were included in the}} study. The posterior repair included reattaching the piriformis, conjoined tendons and posterior capsule to the greater trochanter through 2, 2 mm drill holes with 2 grasping stitches. A metal indicator <b>wire</b> was <b>stitched</b> into the piriformis tendon at distance of 1 cm from the greater trochanter after the prosthesis had been implanted and the joint reduced. Anteroposterior radiographs were taken immediately after the patients returned from the operating theatre to the intensive care unit, the next day after mobilisation, and at the 5 th day of stay and at 3 months postoperatively. Results: Out of 37 THA hips, 6 (16 %) had failed immediately after surgery, 25 (68 %) at the 1 st postoperative day after mobilisation, 2 (5 %) at the 5 th postoperative day, and 1 (3 %) repairs had failed at 3 months after THA. In the remaining 3 hips no failure occurred. Interpretation: We conclude that posterior soft tissue repair in THA often fails and suggest that new posterior soft tissue repair methods be developed...|$|R
40|$|Polymeric {{composites}} {{that are}} stitched reinforced show dissimilar behaviours {{with respect to}} regular ones. In this paper the mechanical characteristics and different behaviours of stitched reinforced polymeric composites after impact tests are investigated using an alternative approach. Several factors such as grid size, stitching scheme and voids content modify the composite performances and the interlaminar delaminating processes. If, on the one hand, the stitching technique is used to prevent delaminating damage phenomena, then, on the other hand, the process itself introduces a sort of damage into the layers during the assembled preform, {{that has to be}} taken into account. Delaminating processes due to impact loads are considered and the post-impact behaviours and damage tolerance are investigated. Impact tests were performed at several energy levels known to have an appreciable damage on the specimens. Damage evaluation analysis was performed on post-impacted specimens using different techniques: as a first step, using a digitalised image technique, the damaged area was measured and different zone shape was evaluated, further compression tests were done to evaluate the material residual properties after impact. The results coming from compression tests do not reveal the better awaited behaviour of the stitched composites with respect to regular ones. On the other hand, the acoustic emission technique is capable of evidencing the different aspects of the <b>stitching</b> <b>wire.</b> The image acquisition technique represents a new experimental method able to fully characterise damage zones and gives more information on the interlaminar behaviour of composite material. This new technique joined to acoustic emission measurements allows important results on the residual life prediction of materials mechanical properties to be obtained...|$|R
