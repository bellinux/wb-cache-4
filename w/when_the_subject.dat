5|$|Proto-Mayan {{is thought}} to have had a basic verb–object–subject word order with {{possibilities}} of switching to VSO in certain circumstances, such as complex sentences, sentences where object and subject were of equal animacy and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> was definite. Today Yucatecan, Tzotzil and Tojolab'al have a basic fixed VOS word order. Mamean, Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek and one dialect of Chuj have a fixed VSO one. Only Ch'orti' has a basic SVO word order. Other Mayan languages allow both VSO and VOS word orders.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{slavery was}} to be {{regulated}} under the new Constitution {{was a matter of}} such intense conflict between the North and South that several Southern states refused to join the Union if slavery were not to be allowed. Delegates opposed to slavery were forced to yield in their demands that slavery practiced {{within the confines of the}} new nation be completely outlawed. However, they continued to argue that the Constitution should prohibit the states from participating in the international slave trade, including in the importation of new slaves from Africa and the export of slaves to other countries. The Convention postponed making a final decision on the international slave trade until late in the deliberations because of the contentious nature of the issue. During the Convention's late July recess, the Committee of Detail had inserted language that would prohibit the federal government from attempting to ban international slave trading and from imposing taxes on the purchase or sale of slaves. The Convention could not agree on these provisions <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> came up again in late August, so they referred the matter to an eleven-member committee for further discussion. This committee helped work out a compromise: Congress would have the power to ban the international slave trade, but not for another twenty years (that is, not until 1808). In exchange for this concession, the federal government's power to regulate foreign commerce would be strengthened by provisions that allowed for taxation of slave trades in the international market and that reduced the requirement for passage of navigation acts from two-thirds majorities of both houses of Congress to simple majorities.|$|E

40|$|Lateral {{differences}} in arm positioning movements were examined for 15 right-handed male {{students with a}} short-term memory paradigm. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> used <b>the</b> same arm for both standard and reproduction movements, no lateral difference was found. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> used <b>the</b> different arms for standard and reproduction movements, significant lateral differences were found with the left arm performance being superior to the right.

25|$|The subject pronominals are all {{incorporated}} into the verb. Thus <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> is represented as a pronominal, the subject position of the sentence is empty.|$|E
25|$|When the infinitive has {{a subject}} of its own (that is, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of the infinitive is not co-referential either with the subject or {{the object of the}} {{governing}} verb form), then this word stands in the accusative case. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of the infinitive {{is the same as the}} subject of the main verb (when the subjects are co-referential), then it is usually neither expressed nor repeated within the infinitival clause. This omission is noticed also <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of the infinitive, although not the subject of the governing verb, is constructed in a higher syntactic level, e.g. as (any) object of the governing verb in any oblique case, or as a dative of interest with an impersonal verb or verbal expression. But even in this case an accusative may be present or—more usually—understood by a predicate adjective, participle etc. in the accusative. These three main constructions available are desctribed in some detail in the sections below.|$|E
25|$|The DOF {{beyond the}} subject is always greater than the DOF {{in front of the}} subject. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> is at the hyperfocal {{distance}} or beyond, the far DOF is infinite, so the ratio is 1:∞; as the subject distance decreases, near:far DOF ratio increases, approaching unity at high magnification. For large apertures at typical portrait distances, the ratio is still close to 1:1. The oft-cited rule that 1/3 of the DOF is in front of the subject and 2/3 is beyond (a 1:2 ratio) is true only <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> distance is 1/3 the hyperfocal distance.|$|E

It found that Internet surfing uses much more brain activity than reading does. Lead researcher Professor Gary Small said: [...] "The study results are encouraging, that emerging computerized technologies may have physiological effects and potential benefits for middle-aged and older adults. Internet searching engages complicated brain activity, which may help exercise and improve brain function." ...|$|R

50|$|Subjects read essays for {{and against}} Fidel Castro, {{and were asked to}} rate the pro-Castro attitudes of <b>the</b> writers. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> {{believed}} that <b>the</b> writers freely chose positions for or against Castro, they naturally rated the people who spoke in favor of Castro as having a more positive attitude towards Castro. However, contradicting Jones and Harris' initial hypothesis, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> were told that the writer's positions were determined by a coin toss, they still rated writers who spoke in favor of Castro as having, on average, a more positive attitude towards Castro than those who spoke against him. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> were unable to properly see the influence of the situational constraints placed upon the writers; they could not refrain from attributing sincere belief to the writers. Therefore, the experimental group provided more internal attributions towards the writer.|$|R
30|$|Two {{circumstances}} can {{be treated}} as errors of manual word segmentation; firstly, if a ridiculous segment appears in segmentation results, it {{can be treated}} as an error (type I error); and secondly, if an indivisible segment is divided in segmentation results, {{it can also be}} treated as an error (type II error). These two circumstances are not compatible with our general word intuition even to the least extent because they are simply incomprehensible, and they cannot be explained by variations of word intuition among speakers; normally, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> do word segmentation tasks carefully according to their word intuition, these would not occur and thus we can treat them as errors. Human word segmentation errors will occur <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> try to cheat by segmenting randomly or make accidental mistakes.|$|R

50|$|It {{was found}} in another study that empathic {{orientation}} to the suffering increased one’s personal sadness.

25|$|A tonal {{answer is}} usually called for <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> {{begins with a}} {{prominent}} dominant note, or {{where there is a}} prominent dominant note very close {{to the beginning of the}} subject.
