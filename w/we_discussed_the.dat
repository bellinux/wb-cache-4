25|$|I {{knew that}} the end of September was the last period (of time) before the explosion, but when Sharon reached the al-Aqsa Mosque, this was the most {{appropriate}} moment for the outbreak of the intifada.... The night prior to Sharon's visit, I participated in a panel on a local television station and I seized the opportunity to call on the public to go to the al-Aqsa Mosque in the morning, for it was not possible that Sharon would reach al-Haram al-Sharif just so, and walk away peacefully. I finished and went to al-Aqsa in the morning.... We tried to create clashes without success because of the differences of opinion that emerged with others in the al-Aqsa compound at the time.... After Sharon left, I remained for two hours in the presence of other people, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>the</b> manner of response and how it was possible to react in all the cities (bilad) and not just in Jerusalem. We contacted all (the Palestinian) factions.|$|E
25|$|Head faced his {{debilitating}} illness with a {{great degree}} of heroism. As Dr.George Riddoch wrote:When his final work on aphasia was finished <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>the</b> situation together. With his practical philosophy he accepted it at once, and his amazing power of adaptation enabled him to plan the rearrangement of his life. With his excellent general health he well knew {{what he had to}} face — long years of steadily increasing physical disablement, with his mind unimpaired except in its capacity for continuous effort; {{in the grip of a}} relentless foe which medical science could not restrain. Without a word of self-pity, with distress only for his devoted wife's heavy burden, he set himself in his methodical way to make his plans, and nothing was omitted. It was as if he was dealing with one of his own patients. His attitude of mind, as always, was constructive and never defeatist. Essentially an individualist, whilst dependent upon friends and kindred spirits, he succeeded in keeping alive his wide interests and, through the attraction of his personality, the contacts which were necessary to him. Science, literature, music, human affairs, all retained their accustomed importance, although in a increasingly restricted sense as the enemy, whom he could not conquer, but who never defeated his active mind, encircled him ever more tightly. Each outpost lost led to new adjustments, every cold or minor ailment added to the rate of downward progress without hope of improvement. But his courage, tenacity and constructiveness remained unimpaired.|$|E
500|$|Sridhar used {{to spend}} his evenings with Gopu, driving along Marina Beach. Gopu asked Sridhar whether {{he would like to}} work on a comedy film. Sridhar, who was known for {{dramatic}} films, thought the audience would not accept a comedy from him. He agreed reluctantly upon Gopu's insistence, and decided to produce a full-length comedy and originated the title, Kadhalikka Neramillai, which translates as [...] "No time for love". The entire story and screenplay were conceived on Marina Beach; according to Gopu, [...] "itting in Sridhar’s open Herald, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>the</b> script for days on end".|$|E

500|$|Koechlin {{played a}} {{supporting}} role in the black comedy The Film Emotional Atyachar, her only film appearance of 2010. Co-starred Ranvir Shorey, Mohit Ahlawat, Abhimanyu Singh, Vinay Pathak, and Ravi Kishan, the film opened to mixed reviews. Her performance in the film as Sophie, a manipulative woman who is abducted by two corrupt policemen, garnered mixed reviews from critics. Komal Nahta of Koimoi labeled her performance as [...] "average", while Blessyy Chettiar of Daily News and Analysis {{felt that she was}} [...] "underused". Koechlin had committed to star in I am Afia, one of the four short films of Onir's anthology I Am, but the film went into production with a modified plot for the segment. In an interview with The Telegraph Onir said, [...] "as <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>the</b> subject more and more, both Kalki and me felt that the narrative was becoming too hurried in the 25-minute limit". Koechlin, who was {{to play the role of}} an NGO worker in the film was ultimately replaced by Nandita Das, after the change of plot.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{extending}} the ISS, on 15 November 2016 General Director Vladimir Solntsev of RSC Energia stated [...] "Maybe the ISS will receive continued resources.
