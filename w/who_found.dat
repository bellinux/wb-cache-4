500|$|The early form of {{training}} under Ueshiba was noticeably different from later forms of aikido. It had a larger curriculum, {{increased use of}} strikes to vital points (atemi) and a greater use of weapons.

These students included Kenji Tomiki (<b>who</b> <b>founded</b> the Shodokan Aikido sometimes called Tomiki-ryū), Noriaki Inoue (<b>who</b> <b>founded</b> Shin'ei Taidō), Minoru Mochizuki (<b>who</b> <b>founded</b> Yoseikan Budo) and Gozo Shioda (<b>who</b> <b>founded</b> Yoshinkan Aikido).

5|$|After {{nearly twenty}} years as a major, Berryman was {{promoted}} to brevet lieutenant colonel on 12 May 1935.
