5|$|In 1963, Felling was twinned with Saint-Ã‰tienne-du-Rouvray, France. When it <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Gateshead in 1974, the {{twinning}} arrangement {{was transferred to}} Gateshead.|$|E
5|$|The Society's medical {{collections}} were {{donated to}} the Warren Anatomical Museum around 1870, while its library <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the Boston Medical Library in 1875.|$|E
50|$|Although 95% {{of medium}} chain {{triglycerides}} <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> through the portal vein, only 25-30% of lauric acid <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> through the portal vein.|$|R
50|$|In clear open waters, {{visible light}} <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> at the longest {{wavelengths}} first. Thus, red, orange, and yellow wavelengths <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> at higher water depths, {{and blue and}} violet wavelengths reach the deepest in the water column. Because the blue and violet wavelengths <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> last {{compared to the other}} wavelengths, open ocean waters appear deep-blue to the eye.|$|R
50|$|When an EUV photon <b>is</b> <b>absorbed,</b> photoelectrons and {{secondary}} electrons are generated by ionization, much like {{what happens when}} X-rays or electron beams <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> by matter.|$|R
5|$|The {{entire class}} <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by British Railways in 1948, {{and was given}} the Power {{classification}} 4P3F, denoting a mixed traffic locomotive.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 the L <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> {{into the}} Southern Railway, and began an upgrade programme. All locos & coaches were repainted in Southern Maunsell Green livery, the wagons were repainted in Southern Umber livery and track and {{buildings}} were improved. A fifth locomotive, Lew was purchased in 1925, with {{improvements to the}} original Manning Wardle design.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, the {{bankrupt}} Hudson & Manhattan Railroad <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the Port Authority, the Hudson Tubes restyled PATH (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) and Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (Hudson Terminal) razed {{for the future}} World Trade Center.|$|E
5000|$|When {{an object}} <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the PC version, it disappears {{abruptly}} and generates {{a number of}} [...] "energy rings" [...] which quickly disappear. In the PS1 version, it disassembles into rotating polygons, while a seed (when a tree <b>is</b> <b>absorbed)</b> or 2/3 [...] "energy clusters" [...] (when a boulder, a synthoid or a sentry <b>is</b> <b>absorbed)</b> fly to the player's POV.|$|R
5000|$|Many of {{the older}} factions have <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into their larger Houses or Clans, {{starting}} with the Firepower expansion in May 2005. For example, the Swordsworn <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> by House Davion, and the Stormhammers <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> by House Steiner. The Steel Wolves faction [...] "evolved" [...] into their own mercenary group known as Wolf Hunters {{with the introduction of}} Clan Wolf into the game.|$|R
50|$|A part of {{ethyl alcohol}} is {{hydrophobic}}. This hydrophobic or lipophilic end can diffuse across cells {{that line the}} stomach wall. In fact, alcohol {{is one of the}} rare substances that can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the stomach. Most food substances <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the small intestine. However, even though alcohol can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the stomach, it <b>is</b> mostly <b>absorbed</b> in the small intestine because the small intestine has a large surface area that promotes absorption. Once alcohol <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the small intestine, it delays the release of stomach contents from emptying into the small intestine. Thus, alcohol can delay the rate of absorption of nutrients. After absorption, alcohol reaches the liver where it is metabolized.|$|R
5|$|In September 1623, {{a second}} colony led by Governor-General Robert Gorges {{was created in}} the {{abandoned}} site at Wessagusset. This colony was rechristened as Weymouth and was also unsuccessful, and Governor Gorges returned to England the following year. Despite that, some settlers remained in the village and it <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630.|$|E
5|$|No.80 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing of World War II. The {{unit was}} formed on 15May 1944 and {{eventually}} comprised three squadrons equipped with Spitfire fighter aircraft. The wing's headquarters <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into {{the newly formed}} No. 11 Group on 30July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{north of}} the Hawaiian Islands, the {{remnants}} of the hurricane later began to revive, and had re-developed into a tropical depression on August30. Additional re-intensification was not significant, although Fausto managed to become a tropical storm again on September1. Remaining a minimal tropical storm, no further intensification occurred, and by September3, Fausto <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by a frontal system.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} July 1941, the Fourth Army {{began to}} dissolve. The Fourth Army's staff members <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the general staff of the Central Front, and the troops <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> into other armies.|$|R
50|$|Besides the conglomoration {{of minor}} clans {{that makes up}} the Mantis, there are other minor clans that have <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> by great clans. The Falcon Clan has <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the Crab (as Toritaka family).|$|R
50|$|In the Storyteller System, Backgrounds are {{advantages}} such as Contacts, Resources and Status. In the Storytelling System, Backgrounds have <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Merits. Furthermore, the Linguistics Knowledge, representing {{knowledge of}} specific languages, has also <b>been</b> <b>absorbed.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} preparatory school, Hillstone, {{opened in}} 1883. When the college went coeducational, Hillstone <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Malvern to become its prep department. The prep school merged with The Downs, a Quaker school founded in 1900, {{and the new}} school {{is now known as}} The Downs Malvern.|$|E
5|$|A Red Cross shelter at Seldon Park, Brunswick, Georgia, {{opened for}} two days {{following}} the storm to temporarily house those whose houses were flooded. Tammy's remnant low <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> a larger extratropical low which tracked north {{and contributed to the}} Northeast U.S. flooding of October 2005, which killed ten people and caused significant damage. As a result of the flooding, the Federal Emergency Management Agency paid $44million in losses.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area moved to the west off the Burmese coast on July 5 and developed into a depression {{the next day in}} the north central Bay of Bengal. The depression intensified as it moved to the northwest, becoming a deep depression on July 7. The system made landfall on the Orissa coast during the morning of July 8 and rapidly degenerated into a broad area of {{low pressure}} overland. The remnant low moved north over western Bihar and it persisted there until July 12 when it <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the monsoon trough.|$|E
50|$|Sound may <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> by {{losses at}} the fluid boundaries. Near {{the surface of}} the sea losses can occur in a bubble layer or in ice, while at the bottom sound can {{penetrate}} into the sediment and <b>be</b> <b>absorbed.</b>|$|R
25|$|Earth {{receives}} {{energy from}} the Sun {{in the form of}} ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared radiation. Of the total amount of solar energy available {{at the top of the}} atmosphere, about 26% is reflected to space by the atmosphere and clouds and 19% <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the atmosphere and clouds. Most of the remaining energy <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> at the surface of Earth. Because the Earth's surface is colder than the photosphere of the Sun, it radiates at wavelengths that are much longer than the wavelengths that <b>were</b> <b>absorbed.</b> Most of this thermal radiation <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the atmosphere, thereby warming it. In addition to the absorption of solar and thermal radiation, the atmosphere gains heat by sensible and latent heat fluxes from the surface. The atmosphere radiates energy both upwards and downwards; the part radiated downwards <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the surface of Earth. This leads to a higher equilibrium temperature than if the atmosphere were absent.|$|R
2500|$|A state i <b>is</b> called <b>absorbing</b> if it <b>is</b> {{impossible}} {{to leave this}} state. Therefore, the state i <b>is</b> <b>absorbing</b> {{if and only if}} ...|$|R
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{organized into}} Tropical Depression Twenty-five {{in the eastern}} Caribbean on October 22. Later that day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Alpha as it moved west-northwestward. On the morning of October 23, it made landfall with 50mph (85km/h) winds {{near the city of}} Barahona in the Dominican Republic, then moved over Haiti. Alpha weakened to a tropical depression over Hispaniola's steep mountains. Alpha reentered the Atlantic Ocean where it <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by Hurricane Wilma.|$|E
5|$|After {{the school}} closed in 1953, the larger, {{original}} room was {{converted into a}} bus garage by the Chana School District. A large garage door was cut into {{the building and the}} floor completely removed. The smaller, 1893 room became a storage area. In 1962, the Chana School District ran out of room and used the building as an overflow classroom. By the mid-1960s, the Chana District folded and <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the Oregon School District. Residents were allowed to remove any items from the school after the district shut down.|$|E
5|$|Binghamton University was {{established}} in 1946 as Triple Cities College, to {{serve the needs of}} local veterans of the Binghamton, New York area, who were returning from World War II. Established in Endicott, New York, the college was a branch of Syracuse University. Triple Cities College offered local students {{the first two years of}} their education, while the following two were spent at Syracuse University. In 1946, students could earn their degrees entirely at the Binghamton campus. In 1950, it <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the State University of New York and renamed Harpur College.|$|E
50|$|Black-body {{radiation}} diffuses {{thermal energy}} throughout a substance as the photons <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> by neighboring atoms, transferring {{momentum in the}} process. Black-body photons also easily escape from a substance and can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the ambient environment; kinetic energy is lost in the process.|$|R
50|$|The optical {{microcavity}} allows {{building up}} an optical field inside the optical cavity. In compare to conventional detector, where light <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> {{in a single}} pass through the absorption region, for RCE detectors trapped light <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> each time it traverses through the absorption region.|$|R
5000|$|Assuming {{that the}} Higgs sector {{consists}} of electroweak doublet(s) H, the effective action term [...] only contributes to S {{and not to}} T or U. (The contribution of [...] can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> into g1 and the contribution of [...] can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> into g2).|$|R
5|$|By 1771, {{there were}} 32 {{companies}} of the Royal Artillery in four battalions, {{as well as}} two Invalid Companies comprising older and unfit men employed in garrison duties. In January 1793, two troops of Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) were raised to provide fire support for the cavalry, joined by two more in November 1793. All RHA personnel were mounted. The Royal Irish Artillery <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> in 1801.|$|E
5|$|By 1882, Castle {{contained}} some 79 undergraduates out of 205 at {{the university}} as a whole. Despite the university largely failing to gain recognition and prestige, {{a number of other}} colleges had opened {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century. Of these, Cosin's Hall failed to become financially viable and <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into University College in 1864. Enrolment numbers continued to fluctuate.|$|E
5|$|However, cooler waters {{eventually}} {{caught up}} to Humberto and it began to weaken once again early on August 31 as it tracked into the north Atlantic. That afternoon, Humberto weakened to a tropical storm as its circulation became embedded into a circulation of a nearby extratropical low in a high-shear environment. It continued to weaken that evening, and early on September 1, the tropical storm <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the larger system.|$|E
5000|$|Exposure to decaBDE {{is thought}} to occur by means of ingestion. Humans and animals do not absorb decaBDE well; at most, perhaps 2% of an oral dose <b>is</b> <b>absorbed.</b> It <b>is</b> {{believed}} that [...] "the small amount of decaBDE that <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> can <b>be</b> metabolized".|$|R
50|$|Solubility {{is a very}} {{important}} factor affecting the amount of a pollutant that can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed.</b> Solubility governs the amount of liquid required (liquid-to-gas ratio) and the necessary contact time. More soluble gases require less liquid. Also, more soluble gases will <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> faster.|$|R
