5|$|George Schwab was a German {{shoemaker}} {{who died}} in 1924. German anarchist Carl Nold claimed he learned Schwab was the bomber through correspondence with other activists but no proof ever emerged. Historian Paul Avrich also suspected him but noted that while Schwab <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chicago,</b> he had only arrived days before. This contradicted statements by others that the bomber was a well-known figure in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|After {{military}} service, Jarrell {{moved to}} Chicago where his sister Nellie attended Northwestern University. It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chicago</b> where Jarrell {{would have his}} first museum experiences. Growing in up Georgia, African Americans {{were not allowed to}} visit museums until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, therefore these early museum visits made a major impression on him. A year later he enrolled at the Art Institute of Chicago for advertising art and graphic design, where he attended night classes. His days were spent working at the International Paint company where he mixed paint. He also took classes at the Ray Vogue School for Commercial Arts. He began attending the Art Institute full-time in 1954. Jarrell eventually lost interest in commercial art and focused on classes about painting and drawing, gaining inspiration from instructor Laura McKinnon and her ideas about spatial relationship theory. In 1958, he graduated with his original major(s), retaining a strong desire to pursue the life of a fine artist. At this time he also met artist Jeff Donaldson, who became a friend who influenced his career. In 1959, the year of his first marriage, he became an advertising photographer, taking photos of type and lettering styles. The couple would divorce shortly after the marriage.|$|E

25|$|Immigrants in {{all three}} waves were {{attracted}} by the high wages and ample job opportunities for unskilled manual labor in the United States, and were driven to jobs in American mining, meatpacking, construction, steelwork, and heavy industry—in many cases dominating these fields until the mid-20th century. Over 90% of Poles arrived and settled in communities with other Polish immigrants. These communities are called Polonia and the largest such community historically <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chicago,</b> Illinois. A key feature of Polish life in the Old World had been religion, and in the United States, Catholicism often became {{an integral part of}} Polish identity.

25|$|The {{influence}} of Sun Ra {{can be seen}} throughout many aspects of black music. He grounded his practice of Afrofuturism in a musical tradition of performing blackness that remains relevant today. Sun Ra lived out his beliefs of Afrofuturism in his daily life by embodying the movement not only in his music, but also in his clothes and actions. This embodiment of the narrative allowed him to demonstrate black nationalism as a counternarrative to the present culture. It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chicago,</b> as well, in the mid-fifties, that Ra began experimenting with extraterrestriality in his stage show, sometimes playing regular cocktail lounges dressed in space suits and ancient Egyptian regalia. By placing his band and performances in space and extraterrestrial environments Sun Ra built a world that was his own view of how the African diaspora connected.|$|E

In May, Taft <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chicago</b> at the Blackstone Hotel, and when he heard that Roosevelt and his party were dining there, walked in on them.

500|$|According to Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot, Yeezus is a [...] "hostile, {{abrasive}} and intentionally off-putting" [...] {{album that}} combines [...] "the worlds of" [...] 1980s Chicago acid-house and 2013 Chicago drill music, 1990s industrial music, and the [...] "avant-rap" [...] of Saul Williams, Death Grips and Odd Future. The Independent, [...] Mass Appeal, and The Village Voice {{described it as}} an experimental release. Rolling Stone described it as [...] "an extravagantly abrasive album full of grinding electro, pummeling minimalist hip-hop, drone-y wooz and industrial gear-grind." [...] Slant Magazine critic Ted Scheinman described the album as [...] "built on alien, angular beats, slowly morphing drones and sirens, abrupt periods of silence, and a pulse-quickening style of delivery from Yeezy himself," [...] writing that West reconceives the [...] "notion {{of what kind of}} music (or noise) can underpin hip-hop." [...] According to Charles Aaron of Spin, Yeezus is [...] "a hip hop album, not a rap album", because of how its sounds and subject matter are assembled together, and although listeners can hear [...] "'punk' or 'post-punk' or 'industrial'" [...] throughout, [...] "hip-hop has always been about noise and dissonance and dance music as agitation". The album also incorporates elements of industrial and trap music. The record [...] "most closely resembles" [...] 1990s industrial rock, during which the genre had a significant pop culture impact, with artists such as Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, and Marilyn Manson gaining success. The industrial scene created a [...] "vast global underground community," [...] and Esquire notes that one of its epicenters <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chicago,</b> where West was raised. Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club characterized its opening series of songs as electro and industrial hip hop. West, himself would later go onto describe the sound of the album as [...] "a protest to music" ...|$|E
