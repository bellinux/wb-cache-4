5000|$|The phrase [...] "over the transom" [...] {{refers to}} works {{submitted}} for publication without being solicited. The image evoked is {{of a writer}} tossing a manuscript through the open <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door</b> of the publisher's office.|$|R
6000|$|Everywhere {{there were}} the flags of the Allies; in shop <b>windows,</b> <b>over</b> <b>doors,</b> on the bonnets of automobiles, on people's breasts, {{and there was a}} great {{quantity}} of recruiting posters on the hoardings and in windows: [...] "Your King and Country Need You" [...] was the chief text, and they still called for [...] "A Hundred Thousand Men" [...] although the demand of Lord Kitchener had risen to half a million. There were also placards calling for men on nearly all the taxicabs. The big windows of the offices of the Norddeutscher Lloyd in Cockspur Street were boarded up, and plastered thickly with recruiting appeals.|$|R

5000|$|The fieldstone Methodist Episcopal Church {{building}} {{was built in}} 1826 with a simple pedimented roof and round arched windows. [...] The building is made of Manhattan schist from a quarry on nearby Pitt Street. The exterior is marked by three <b>windows</b> <b>over</b> three <b>doors</b> framed with round arches, a low flight of brownstone steps, a low pitched pediment roof with a lunette window and a wooden cornice.|$|R

I determined to let him alarm the neighborhood, and to see if the neighborhood would step between us. I went up stairs and waited at the open staircase <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|The cannon {{were placed}} in casemates. Some {{of them had been}} withdrawn, the casemates fitted with massive shutters, and {{converted}} into prisons for the use of officers. Two captains were lodged in the same casemate with Fergus. No light came from without, but there was a low semicircular <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door.</b> This was very strongly barred, but admitted sufficient light, in the daytime.|$|R
5000|$|Built from March 1950. Upper grille {{started out}} horizontal, as in early Phase I; from March 1951, some {{locomotives}} were built with vertical-slotted [...] "Farr-Air" [...] grilles, and by October 1951, all had them. Cab doors became round-cornered, and the kick plates were deleted. The wing windows became taller, with round corners. Two drip strips; one <b>over</b> cab <b>windows,</b> second <b>over</b> <b>door.</b> The end door window became round after November 1950.|$|R
5|$|St. Stephen's College was re-opened in 1945 {{after the}} war. St. Stephen's Chapel {{was built on}} the grounds of the school in 1950; the {{memorial}} <b>window</b> <b>over</b> its west <b>door</b> was a donation, serving to remember the suffering at Stanley Internment Camp.|$|R
60|$|In an hour {{one of the}} sentries at {{the upper}} window brought news {{that a large number}} of men were approaching. Terence at once gave some orders that he and the {{lieutenant}} had agreed upon to the two soldiers, and four of the Portuguese troopers, and then went up with the lieutenant to the <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door.</b> He threw it open just as a crowd of men poured into the garden in front.|$|R
50|$|The Museum is {{situated}} within a former Presbyterian church, {{also known as}} Dr. John Harrison Memorial Hall. The building itself dates from 1863, and sits on The Square in the town. The most distinctive element of the building is the wheel <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door</b> which featured a ‘Star of David’ to commemorate its Welsh Builders. The Museum is run {{on a voluntary basis}} by the County Roscommon Historical and Archaeological Society, and had been housed in the church since the early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|The windows have {{segmental}} brick arches and limestone sills. The central front bay {{is distinguished}} by a semicircular fantail <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the main <b>doors,</b> semicircular arches <b>over</b> {{the second story}} windows, and an oculus window illuminating the attic. In the interior, both floors have two rooms with a hall across the front.|$|R
2500|$|The pointed {{tympanum}} of {{the twin}} <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door</b> is decorated with a unique relief representation of the large-headed and bearded [...] God the Father with large almond shaped eyes blessing the Crucifix {{with his right hand}} and holding in his left hand the head of Adam, with a dove — the Holy Spirit — above it. In the right corner of the tympanum there is a seraph dove; the space between it and the figure of the Father is filled with an inscription.|$|R
60|$|The {{stream of}} water came from a small hose that was being played through a transom <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door</b> of the room. A lad was holding the hose, and {{in the dim light}} Dick {{recognized}} the face of a youth named Bart Larkspur, a sophomore who did not bear a very good reputation. Larkspur was poor and Dick had heard that he was used by Flockley, Koswell and others to do all sorts of odd jobs, for which the richer lads paid him well.|$|R
50|$|The three bay {{frame house}} is {{distinguished}} by a center gable and lancet style window. Side elevations have cornice returns and six-over-six windows. The front elevation has two-over-two {{lights on the}} first floor and a transom <b>window</b> <b>over</b> front <b>door.</b> Other details include small circular attic vents in the side gables and a front porch added later. The roof is covered in ribbed metal. Foundation material is rubble limestone. James W. Weldon was listed as the owner of record in 1877. W.T. Fields acquired the property by 1884.|$|R
5000|$|Gwydyr House is the {{location}} of the fictional Department for Administrative Affairs in the BBC sitcom Yes Minister. In the pilot episode [...] "Open Government", protagonist and Minister for Administrative Affairs, Jim Hacker MP, can be clearly seen entering the oak doors opposite Dover House on Whitehall. The minister's office features a large Palladian window which offers a view of the chimneys of a Georgian home. This window is a copy of the Palladian <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door</b> of Gwydyr House and offers a comparable view of the chimneys of the listed Georgian mansion Dover House opposite.|$|R
60|$|The misfortunes of the evening, however, {{did not end}} here. The {{road was}} rather rough, {{and there were many}} ruts and joltings; and {{one or two of the}} {{passengers}} seemed to feel some fear lest the stage should upset. One, who sat near the door, put his arm out at the <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door,</b> so as to get his hand upon the handle of the catch, in order, as he said, to be ready to open the door and spring out, at a moment's warning. The gentleman on the back seat advised him not to do it.|$|R
50|$|Work {{began in}} 1994 to {{renovate}} the synagogue {{for use as a}} culture center which will also have an exhibition on local Jewish history in the women's gallery. The only original interior decorative elements remaining in the building are six fluted cast iron pillars supporting a rebuilt gallery, plus stairway railings and a small niche in the stairwell. The one-time circular (rose) <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the Ark has been changed into an arched window, and two of the arched side windows (which exist on the south side only) have been lengthened and enlarged. The third (left hand) window on the south side has been left at apparently its original shape and size. There is also an arched <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door</b> in the West side.|$|R
5000|$|County Museum and Tourism Office {{is located}} next to Harrison {{hall in the}} town square. It was {{originally}} a small Presbyterian church built in 1863. The building is of cut limestone with a large recessed door, circular headed windows and fenestration on the wheel <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door</b> {{is in the form}} of the 'Star of David' to commemorate its Welsh Builders. The building was renovated in 1991 and now contains many exhibits and artifacts illustrating and interpreting the history of Roscommon. Among the artifacts on display are a 9th-century grave slab from St Comans Abbey and a Sheela na Gig from Rahara church.|$|R
50|$|The {{south end}} of the {{building}} has a projecting gabled vestibule with a porch over the centered entrance. There is a pair of three-pane transom <b>windows</b> <b>over</b> the front <b>door,</b> and four tiny windows near the apex of the main gable which light the attic space. Perched atop the porch roof for most of the building's history but no longer extant was a small room serving as the projection booth.|$|R
60|$|There was {{one room}} we got into, I scarce know how. It was a long, high gallery, plainly {{finished}} for a palace, {{and it seemed}} to be lighted from an interior court, or well; for one was completely caged when in it. This was the celebrated Bull's Eye (oeil de boeuf), where the courtiers danced attendance before they were received. It got its name from an oval <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the principal <b>door.</b>|$|R
50|$|The two-story wood {{frame house}} is {{arranged}} as a compact rectangular mass, with a hipped rof. The entrance {{is centered on}} the front facade with an arched porch framing an arched transom <b>over</b> the front <b>door,</b> which is flanked by sidelights. The front (south) comprises three bays with wide sash windows in a 15-over-1 pattern and a centered projecting bay <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the front <b>door.</b> The roof features two hipped dormers. The house is sheathed in narrow clapboards and rests on a brick foundation. An extension on the east houses a sun room.|$|R
25|$|In {{the north}} {{transept}} stands {{a statue of}} Our Mother of Good Counsel in a niche topped by a pediment and flanked by two pilasters – each pilaster on a pedestal {{on either side of}} it. The north transept is where the Baptistery is located. The statue of Our Mother of Good Counsel and the stained-glass <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door</b> hints to its previous designation as the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary. On the walls are memorial plaques to early personalities of the church, notably, John Connolly and Bishop Michel-Esther Le Turdu. The relics of Saint Laurent-Marie-Joseph Imbert can be found enshrined in the wall at {{the right side of the}} door.|$|R
50|$|St. Clement Eastcheap has an {{irregular}} plan. The nave is approximately rectangular, but the south aisle is severely tapered. The ceiling {{is divided into}} panels, the centre one being a large oval band of fruit and flowers. The main façade is on the west, on Clement's Lane, and comprises four bays. The main bay has a blocked pedimented round-headed <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door.</b> This is flanked by matching bays with two levels of windows. The tower to the south west forms the fourth bay. This is a simple square tower, with a parapet, but no spire. Each bay has stone quoins and is stuccoed, except for the upper levels of the tower where the brick is exposed.|$|R
5000|$|The new {{building}} was designed in an Italian Romanesque style by the architect Thomas Roger Smith and constructed in 1873. The four-storey building has five bays, and was built of brown and yellow stock brocks with buff banding and stucco details around the <b>door</b> and <b>windows.</b> <b>Over</b> the <b>door</b> is the motto [...] "Facts not Opinions". The heavy machine was {{installed on the}} ground floor, supported by brick piers in the basement. The testing room retains many of its original features, including fitted shelving and matchboard dado, with a ceiling held up by cast iron beams supported by four iron pillars. The basement houses a Denison machine for testing marine chains, acquired by Kirkaldy in 1906.|$|R
5000|$|The Crucifixion of Christ, <b>over</b> the <b>door,</b> is {{in memory}} of William C. Harris, the Chapel's architect, and was the last {{painting}} to be installed in the Chapel. Appropriately, it is placed under a window showing Christ's Resurrection. The painting and the <b>window</b> placed <b>over</b> the <b>door</b> {{suggest that it is}} [...] "through the grave and gate of death" [...] that we pass to our joyful resurrection. Inside the door, in the small porch, is a statue of St. Peter holding the keys [...] "to the Kingdom of Heaven" [...] (see St. Matt. 16: 18-19).|$|R
50|$|The House at 306 Broadway in Methuen, Massachusetts is a well-preserved {{example of}} a modest Greek Revival house built c. 1830. It is of a type that was {{somewhat}} common in Methuen from the 1830s to the 1850s. It is a -story wood frame structure with its gable end facing the street, but its entry centered on the long side wall. The front was originally three asymmetrically located windows, but this has since {{been replaced by a}} virtual wall of five windows. The corners of the house are pilastered in typical Greek Revival fashion, and the gable end has a deep cornice. The main entrance is centered on the five-bay side wall, and features a transom <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|We {{were now}} near the house, which, unlike the {{ordinary}} {{houses of the}} country, was built of hewn stone and very solid. Stone, too, was its foundation, stone its background. Not a blade of grass sprouted among the broken mineral about the walls, not a flower adorned the <b>windows.</b> <b>Over</b> the <b>door,</b> by way of sole adornment, the Mormon Eye was rudely sculptured; I had been brought up to view that emblem from my childhood; but since the night of our escape, it had acquired a new significance, and set me shrinking. The smoke rolled voluminously from the chimney-top, its edges ruddy with the fire; and from {{the far corner of}} the building, near the ground, angry puffs of steam shone snow-white in the moon and vanished.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{faces the}} intersection with two closely matched elevations and a curved corner entrance. Four giant order columns with Corinthian capitals dominate the front; the central two are freestanding and frame the entry; {{the others are}} engaged to brick pillars. The main entrance is framed by small columns and has a curved entablature over the lintel. A leadlight <b>window</b> sits <b>over</b> the <b>door,</b> which is now a modern one of glazed aluminium.|$|R
50|$|The {{east and}} west {{elevations}} each have three four over four lights {{on the first floor}} with shorter six over six lights above on the second floor. In the late 19th century bay windows were added, though they were subsequently removed {{toward the end of the}} 20th century. The second floor has a six over six light on each side of the porch roof just inside of the bay windows. There is small nine light <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the north <b>door.</b>|$|R
50|$|St. Mary's Church is an {{historic}} Catholic {{church in the}} eastern United States, at Fairfax Station, Virginia, a suburb southwest of Washington, D.C. Built in 1858, it is a rectangular, one-story, gable-front, frame structure in the Gothic Revival style. It has a steeple at the entrance and a large Gothic arched <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the entrance <b>door.</b> St. Mary's was the first Catholic church built within Fairfax County, and its early parishioners were primarily Irish immigrants employed by the Orange and Alexandria Railroad.|$|R
50|$|Mahogany Hall was {{originally}} called the Hall of Mirrors and was built of solid marble with a stained glass fan <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the entrance <b>door.</b> It had four floors, five different parlours, and fifteen bedrooms with attached bathrooms. The rooms were furnished with chandeliers, potted ferns, and elegant furniture. The house was steam-heated, and each bathroom was supplied with {{hot and cold}} water. The interiors of the rooms of Mahogany Hall filled the ads in Blue Books and other advertising pamphlets of the period.|$|R
2500|$|Black, gold-veined onyx {{is used in}} the Darling Street foyer, {{the ceiling}} of which is over 15 metres high and {{finished}} with gold leaf, laid by Italian workmen. The view of the glass <b>window</b> <b>over</b> the <b>door</b> to the banking hall (above) shows the iconic ziggurat shape of the building etched into the glass. Visitors must climb 17 steps {{to gain access to the}} banking hall, and towards the top they are met by the original [...] "pill box" [...] where security staff can observe who (and what) is entering and leaving the building. On either side of the pill box are the entrances to the main lifts [...] two on the left and two on the right (there are two [...] "staff" [...] lifts and one [...] "service" [...] lift elsewhere in the building).|$|R
