25|$|Distasteful {{though we}} find the whole idea, we think that some {{deliberate}} limitation {{of the volume of}} motor traffic is quite unavoidable. The need for it just can't be escaped.

25|$|In 1986, the Silverstone 1000km run on 5 May was a {{round of}} the World Endurance Championship, which Silk Cut Jaguar (Tom Walkinshaw Racing) won in a year <b>when</b> <b>everything</b> did not exactly go their way.

The Stuck/Bell Porsche 962C was two laps down in second place, with a 962C a further three laps adrift {{in the hands of}} Jo Gartner and Tiff Needell.|$|E
25|$|I had {{not seen}} an Englishman bowl either faster or better than Snow at Sydney since Tyson...In a fast bowler rhythm and {{accuracy}} generally go hand in hand. <b>When</b> <b>everything</b> is absolutely ticking, so to speak, a strong fellow like Snow finds not only an extra yard of pace but seems able to keep an unerring eye on the target. The merit of Snow is that in this form is not only that that high arm and loose wrist get the utmost life and lift from the pitch but that he is so extraordinarily straight.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Peter Kuppens (2008) showed that extraverts and introverts engage in {{different}} behaviors when feeling pleasant, {{which may explain}} underestimation of the frequency and intensity of happiness exhibited by introverts. Specifically, Kuppens (2008) found that arousal and pleasantness are positively correlated for extraverts, which means that pleasant feelings {{are more likely to}} be accompanied by high arousal for extraverts. On the other hand, arousal and pleasantness are negatively correlated for introverts, resulting in introverts exhibiting low arousal when feeling pleasant. In other words, if everything is going well in an extravert's life, which is a source of pleasant feelings, extraverts see such situation as an opportunity to engage in active behavior and goal pursuit, which brings about an active, aroused pleasant state. <b>When</b> <b>everything</b> is going well for introverts, they see it as an opportunity to let down their guard, resulting in them feeling relaxed and content.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{pilot-operated}} relief valve indicator light was fundamentally flawed. The bulb was simply connected in parallel with the valve solenoid, thus implying that the pilot-operated relief valve was shut when it went dark, without actually verifying the real position of the valve. <b>When</b> <b>everything</b> was operating correctly, the indication was true and the operators became habituated to rely on it. However, when things went wrong and the main relief valve stuck open, the unlighted lamp was actually misleading the operators by implying that the valve was shut. This caused the operators considerable confusion, because the pressure, temperature and coolant levels in the primary circuit, so far as they could observe them via their instruments, were not behaving {{as they would have}} if the pilot-operated relief valve were shut. This confusion contributed to the severity of the accident because the operators were unable to break out of a cycle of assumptions that conflicted with what their instruments were telling them. The problem was not correctly diagnosed until a fresh shift came in who did not have the mindset of the first shift of operators. By this time major damage had occurred.|$|E

[...] Greg Prato of AllMusic called Love It to Death [...] "an incredibly consistent listen from beginning to end" [...] and [...] "the release <b>when</b> <b>everything</b> began to come together for the band".

"Biko" [...] means [...] "Please" [...] (or more {{accurately}} [...] "I implore you") in Igbo—a language spoken in Nigeria, the homeland of Okereke's parents—and is used [...] "when you're beseeching {{someone to do}} something". Okereke denied that {{it is about the}} murdered South African anti-apartheid protester Steve Biko. The lyrics of [...] "One Month Off" [...] reference feelings of anger and are about being in love with someone younger and unfaithful, while [...] "Zephyrus" [...] concerns an apology following neglect. The lyrics in the chorus of [...] "Ion Square", the last track on the original download release, are based on E. E. Cummings' poem [...] "I Carry Your Heart with Me".

500|$|According to Lo, {{the songs}} on her {{extended}} play Truth Serum are about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship. She stated, [...] "In its entirety, [...] a love story from beginning to end. The song 'Love Ballad' is about the moment you decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens <b>when</b> <b>everything</b> is screwed up and {{you just want to}} freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". In an interview with Klap Magazine, Lo said, [...] "'Love Ballad' is actually supposed to be a way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him. He's worth the pain. A bit exaggerated but that's what it feels like when you're so into someone".|$|E
500|$|Kills {{revealed}} to Elle that the songwriting process for [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was difficult, {{as she had}} to confront memories and feelings.

This song was deemed by Kills as her life's soundtrack: [...] "When I was almost 14, I left home, got a job, and thought I {{was going to be a}} big TV star. I was determined to prove myself. I kept telling myself, 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't even believe it. The song is about carrying on, even though you feel like you can't. It's about feeling OK <b>when</b> <b>everything</b> is not." [...] She later reiterated those sentiments with website Digital Spy, and stated that it would show people what she truly was and what she had gone through over the years.|$|E

500|$|Nineteenth century {{historian}} John Palfrey {{wrote of}} Dudley that he [...] "united rich intellectual attributes with a groveling soul", forging political connections and relationships {{in his early}} years {{for the purpose of}} furthering his own advancement. [...] He capitalized on his favorable family connections to the Puritan leadership of Massachusetts to establish connections in England, but then betrayed those Massachusetts connections when it became necessary to further his quest for power. [...] Thomas Hutchinson, who later also served as provincial governor, and wrote an extensive history of Massachusetts, wrote of Dudley that [...] "he had as many virtues as can consist with so great a thirst for honour and power." [...] Biographer Everett Kimball wrote of Dudley, [...] "... in spite of his failings of temper he possessed a good deal of tact and personal charm, by which, <b>when</b> <b>everything</b> else failed, he could sometimes transform an enemy into a friend." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Daddy's Girl", {{which was}} denoted by Kills as her {{favorite}} from the album, places {{a sample of}} American music duo Hall & Oates' single [...] "Rich Girl" [...] over a [...] "thumping beat". Described as a [...] "love song", it discusses her mother's support and [...] "devotion" [...] towards Kills' father when he was incarcerated. Second single [...] "Saturday Night" [...] employs synthesizers on a new wave-based instrumental. The track was described as autobiographical and discusses {{growing up in a}} house where domestic abuse occurs; Kills also deemed it a song about [...] "feeling OK <b>when</b> <b>everything</b> is not". The sole ballads found on the album are [...] "Devils Don't Fly" [...] and [...] "Marlboro Lights". The main instrument utilized in the latter is piano, while the former displays more instrumentation, including the organ and keyboards. Writing on behalf of MuchMusic, journalist Allison observed Motown influences on [...] "Outta Time", a melancholic love song.|$|E
500|$|His 1985 film Revolution about a fur trapper {{during the}} American Revolutionary War, was a {{commercial}} and critical failure, which Pacino blamed on a rushed production, {{resulting in a}} four-year hiatus from films. At this time Pacino returned to the stage. He mounted workshop productions of Crystal Clear, National Anthems and other plays; he appeared in Julius Caesar in 1988 in producer Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival. Pacino remarked on his hiatus from film: [...] "I remember back <b>when</b> <b>everything</b> was happening, '74, '75, doing The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui on stage and reading that the reason I'd {{gone back to the}} stage was that my movie career was waning! That's been the kind of ethos, the way in which theater's perceived, unfortunately." [...] Pacino returned to film in 1989's Sea of Love, when he portrayed a detective hunting a serial killer who finds victims through the singles column in a newspaper. The film earned solid reviews.|$|E
