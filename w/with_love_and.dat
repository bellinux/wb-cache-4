5|$|Musically, glam metal {{combines}} a traditional heavy metal sound with elements of hard rock and punk rock, adding pop-influenced catchy hooks and guitar riffs.

These {{were among the most}} commercially successful singles in the genre and opened it up to a wider audience {{that would not have been}} attracted to traditional heavy metal.
