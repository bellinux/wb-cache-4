5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{intended}} {{the show to}} have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted Star Trek to show humanity <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> develop into, if it would learn from {{the lessons of the}} past, most specifically by ending violence. An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations. His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that Enterprise have a racially diverse crew.|$|E
5|$|The priory {{may also}} have owned a cell at Scarth Wood at Whorlton. A grant issued by Stephen de Meynell in the reign of Henry I records the {{donation}} of the hamlet of Scarth to enable the priory to establish a cell for habitation by a single monk or canon. It is unclear whether the cell was built as Scarth is {{not mentioned in the}} priory's deeds or in Henry VIII's commissioners' valuation of its property. Fragmentary building remains at Scarth are recorded as existing in the mid-18th century. They were cleared by the start of the 19th century so there is no trace of whatever might once have stood there or indication of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been used for.|$|E

25|$|In 1895 Wells was an {{established}} writer and he married his second wife, Catherine Robbins, moving {{with her to}} the town of Woking in Surrey. Here he spent his mornings walking or cycling in the surrounding countryside, and his afternoons writing. The original idea for The War of the Worlds came from his brother during one of these walks, pondering on <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be like if alien beings were suddenly to descend on the scene and start attacking its inhabitants.|$|E

Some definitions of geobiology even push the boundaries of this time frame - to understanding the origin of life and to the role that man has played and will continue to play in shaping the Earth in the Anthropocene.|$|E

Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> mean and, in line with the American philosopher of science, Paul Feyerabend, accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.|$|E

25|$|Tolkien's {{publisher}} was George Allen & Unwin Ltd. of London (A). Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York {{arranged to}} publish Tolkien's {{books in the}} United States. Houghton Mifflin did not set their own type; rather they printed sheets for the first edition from plates etched from a photo-enlargement of the Allen & Unwin first edition. For the second edition they imported sheets directly from A However, they bound their own volumes, usually distinctly from their British counterparts. The American versions differed from the British in one respect crucial to the collectibles market: beyond the first printing, most of Houghton Mifflin's impressions did not identify which printing run {{they came out of}} or even a copyright date. This failure has led to intense confusion in the collectibles market. Very few people can identify the Houghton Mifflin second editions, which were extant from 1951 to 1966. Hence people cannot be sure what they have or might be buying and therefore <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be worth.|$|E
25|$|Penniman {{had more}} than the {{ordinary}} intellectual endowment; bold, striking, and original in her conceptions, and of singular facility and clearness in her expression. She was educated from early life to disbelieve in the capacity or general intelligence of the masses for efficient self-government. All her prejudices were nurtured {{in favor of the}} British Constitution as developed by Magna Charta, and administered by a king and ministers responsible to the nation; which form of government she believed to be above all comparison the best in the world. Yet, in spite of all these deeply-rooted prejudices, with a grasp of thought that could look at and examine questions of inherent right, on their original basis—with the abiding principles of the Christian faith to serve as a guide in judging of human duty in governments, and with the daily recurring practical examples of the conflicts of opinion between the Colonies and the mother country, which the American Revolution presented, she saw and acknowledged the wrongs inflicted on the Colonies—the justice of that cause in which they had, at length, banded for a higher measure of liberty, and the growing capacity of the people to maintain those rights. She was thus made an intellectual convert to the doctrines of the Revolution, and became a most useful and capable counsellor to Allen, in the subsequent critical periods of his life. Her mind was, indeed, a counterpart, in its boldness and originality, to that of her husband, whose intuitive mode of reaching conclusions enabled him to put into the shape of acts, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have sorely puzzled him sometimes to reason out; and what, indeed, if he could have reasoned ever so well, his bold and fiery zeal, and crushing rapidity of action, put him out of all temper to submit to the slow process of ratiocination. He also felt the happy influences of manners, opinions, and sentiments at once dignified and frank, yet mild and persuasive.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1977, [...] "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker" [...] was {{released}} as a single, being an outtake from the band's previous release, Leave Home. This period was extremely significant to the punk rock genre, {{as it was the}} initial wave of New York City's underground punk bands receiving recording contracts. New York-based clubs CBGB and Max's Kansas City began to see bigger audiences crowd in to hear these bands. Punk fans commonly believed that this musical style would soon top the market, to which author Tom Carson explains: [...] "To be in New York that summer was to have some sense of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been like to live in San Francisco in 1966 or '67, or in London when the Beatles and the [...] Stones first hit." ...|$|E

While addressing the issue after at the Toronto International Film Festival, Soderbergh remarked {{that he was trying to}} avoid what he felt were typical scenes for a biographical film and that he would tell screenwriter Peter Buchman, that he was [...] "trying to find the scenes that would happen before or after the scene that you would typically see in a movie like this". Soderbergh was not interested in depicting Guevara's personal life because he felt that [...] "everybody on these campaigns has a personal life, they all left families behind, that doesn't make him special and why should I go into his personal life and nobody else's?" ...|$|E
500|$|Suzuki {{described}} Miyazaki as {{a feminist}} {{in reference to}} his attitude to female workers. Miyazaki has described his female characters as [...] "brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe in with all their heart", stating that they may [...] "need a friend, or a supporter, but never a saviour" [...] and that [...] "any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man". Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly the protagonist Nausicaä. Schellhase noted that the female characters in Miyazaki's films are not objectified or sexualized, and possess complex and individual characteristics absent from Hollywood productions. Schellhase also identified a [...] "coming of age" [...] element for the heroines in Miyazaki's films, as they each discover [...] "individual personality and strengths". Gabrielle Bellot of The Atlantic wrote that, in his films, Miyazaki [...] "shows a keen understanding of the complexities of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> mean to be a woman". In particular, Bellot cites Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, praising the film's challenging of gender expectations, and the strong and independent nature of Nausicaä. Bellot also noted that Princess Mononokes San represents the [...] "conflict between selfhood and expression".|$|E

500|$|Thief: The Dark Project {{has been}} {{declared}} {{one of the greatest}} games of all time by several publications. Inducting it into its hall of fame, GameSpy writer Rich Carlson wrote: [...] "With a tactical philosophy contrary to nearly every [...] action game at that time, Thief rewarded stealth and sneaking over brazen frontal assault," [...] continuing: [...] "While inadvertently undermining the notion that all action games need be shooters, it carved a completely new niche in the same already glutted genre." [...] GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin argued that, while Metal Gear Solid, [...] and Thief all defined the stealth action genre, it was Thief that displayed [...] "the purest depiction of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be like to slip from shadow to shadow" [...] and [...] "largely remains an unsurpassed achievement in gaming." [...] In 2009, Thief was added to IGN's hall of fame. Sid Shuman, writing for GamePro, asserted that Thief [...] "pioneered its own genre ... the stealth-action title." [...] John Walker of Eurogamer wrote in a retrospective review: [...] "Thief is an embarrassment to modern stealth games, each of which produces only a faded parody of this masterful original." [...] In 2012, Mike Fahey of Kotaku called Thief [...] "the best stealth game I've ever played", superior to modern games in the genre. That same year, Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time.|$|E
