5|$|Growing {{the star}} will {{increase}} its gravitational force, {{which increases the}} number of planets the solar system can have. They will {{also be able to}} attract solar systems composed of stars with lower mass than that of the player, or being attracted to stars with bigger mass. If both stars collide, they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> to a lesser size within the same type of object. For example, if the player controls a small star and collides against a medium star, the player will be disintegrated while the AI-controlled star <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> to a small star. Being reduced from small star to life planet is not possible, as well as being reduced from small planet to asteroid. In these cases, the player is respawned, with random mass, close to the place where they collided.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the action is fully implemented, the EPA {{estimates}} that 2.6million tons of smog-causing nitrogen oxide emissions will be eliminated each year. Soot or particulate matter <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> by an estimated 110,000tons a year. The reduction in sulfur will also prevent an estimated 8,300premature deaths, 5,500cases of chronic bronchitis and 17,600cases of acute bronchitis in children. In addition, an estimated 360,000asthma attacks and 386,000cases of respiratory symptoms in asthmatic children will also be avoided every year.|$|E

5|$|The Committee to Review Ministerial Salaries {{recommended}} that pensions for political appointment holders be abolished {{in favour of}} Central Provident Fund payments. Appointment holders appointed on and after 21 May 2011 will not receive any pension, while those appointed before that date will only be eligible for pensions accrued up to that date. Such pensions will be paid after they step down or retire from office. If the removal of pensions is taken into account, the Prime Minister's annual salary <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> from the 2010 figure by 36%, and that of MR4-grade ministers by 37%.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{constructing}} {{the network has}} been covered by the ministry. The costs of operating and maintaining the network are covered by the users, who also purchase their own terminals. Payment to the directorate is by an annual subscription fee per terminal, based on the terminal's use. For a terminal only used for stand-by, the annual subscription cost is NOK1,700 per year (2016), while that for a terminal in a control room is NOK45,000 (2016). As the cost of running the network is fixed independently {{of the amount of}} traffic, there is no cost for using the network. As additional users start implementing the system, the costs per subscriber <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the new line is to allow {{regional}} and express trains to run directly between Asker Station, Sandvika Station and Lysaker Station, without being slowed and delayed by commuter trains that make frequent stops at intermediate stations. The Asker Line will improve regularity, and capacity will increase from 12 to 26 trains per hour in each direction. Travel time from Asker to Skøyen Station <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> from 20 to 13 minutes. The line has received criticism for not being a true high-speed line, and for Lysaker Station not being in compliance with accessibility requirements. Similar parallel, high-speed lines have been or will be built northeast and southeast of Oslo.|$|E
30|$|To reduce carbon emissions, {{developed}} countries attach {{great importance to}} the utilization of renewable energy. Chinese policy is that by 2020, the coal utilization proportion <b>will</b> <b>be</b> substantially <b>reduced,</b> coal consumption will peak by 2030, and clean coal technology <b>will</b> <b>be</b> well developed. External cost of coal utilization <b>will</b> <b>be</b> consequently <b>reduced,</b> ensuring sustainable growth of the economy [7, 8].|$|R
50|$|One {{advantage}} of a repayment mortgage is that it removes {{the risk of having}} an investment (as exists in an endowment mortgage), the performance of which is dependent on the stockmarket. The borrower is also less likely to suffer from negative equity because the mortgage balance <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>reducing</b> month on month.|$|R

5|$|One {{important}} element {{for the formation}} of skeletal material in marine animals is calcium, but calcium carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below its compensation depth. Calcium carbonate also becomes more soluble at lower pH, so ocean acidification is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, and corals, because their ability to form shells <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced,</b> and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface. Affected planktonic organisms will include the snail-like molluscs known as pteropods, and single-celled algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera. All of these are important parts of the food chain and a diminution in their numbers will have significant consequences. In tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as it becomes more difficult to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers.|$|E
5|$|The Follo Line {{will allow}} the {{capacity}} in the South Corridor from Oslo to increase from about twelve to forty trains per hour. Local and freight trains will use the Østfold Line, while regional and express trains will use the Follo Line. Travel time <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> from 22 to 11 minutes. With a new line, there will be 11,000 more public transport trips through the corridor; this includes a 67% increase during rush-hour and 43% {{the rest of the}} day. This allows a reduction of 5,800 car trips per day and reduces carbon dioxide emissions of 5,474 tonnes. Rush hour capacity would be eight trains per hour to Kolbotn, with four continuing to Ski along the old line. The new line would be served by four trains to Moss, two to Mysen and two to Halden. There would be half the frequency during off-peak hours.|$|E
25|$|The travel time, {{currently}} over 120 {{minutes from}} Williamson to Bluefield, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> to 87 minutes. South of Ikes Fork, a two-hour trip to Bluefield <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> to 44 minutes.|$|E

50|$|An {{additional}} area {{of ongoing}} study is converting waste into plant nutrients {{by way of}} composting. In this way, not only <b>will</b> waste <b>be</b> <b>reduced,</b> but there <b>is</b> {{the added benefit of}} reducing the amount of chemical fertilizers necessary to grow crops. As a result, chemical toxicity of soil <b>will</b> also <b>be</b> <b>reduced.</b> Thus one program has the potential to address many of the waste management issues prevalent in Tanzania today.|$|R

25|$|The {{experience}} gained {{in designing the}} Project 17 Shivalik-class frigates will {{be applied to the}} Project 17A (P17A). The Project 17A frigates will improve upon the Project 17 (P17) in terms of stealth. They will have covered mooring deck and the number of antennae on the ship <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> by using a AESA radar. The P17A will also feature better roll stabilisation and a discreet visual profile. The weapon platform in the P17A ships will be compact and they will be armed with the Barak 8 (missile) surface-to-air missile developed jointly by India and Israel, and the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile. The weapon systems will be flush deck mounted allowing vertical launch of missiles from under the deck. The crew complement <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> from the existing 257 (including 35 officers) to about 150 by using high levels of automation, which will reduce the operational costs by around 20 per cent and result in higher operational availability of the warships.
