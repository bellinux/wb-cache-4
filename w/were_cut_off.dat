50|$|In {{the years}} after Dauphin County was established, the {{township}} was slowly divided. Hanover Township <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> to the east in 1736, and Upper Paxton Township <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> to the north in 1767. What remained in 1767 was then renamed Lower Paxton Township. The divisions continued. Harrisburg Borough (now the city of Harrisburg) was formed in 1791, and Swatara Township was created in 1799. In 1878 more land <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the north and became Middle Paxton Township.|$|R

5|$|Paul Wasansky, who in 1570 was {{executed}} in Ivančice, in present-day Czech Republic, {{on account of}} 124 confessed murders (he was a roaming highwayman), underwent a particularly gruelling execution procedure: First, his limbs <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> and his nipples were ripped off with glowing pincers. He was then flayed, afterwards impaled and finally roasted alive. The pamphlet, which purports to give Wasansky's verbatim confession, does not record how Wasansky was apprehended, nor what means of torture was used to extract his confessions.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Hitler {{purchased}} a small holiday {{home on the}} mountain at Obersalzberg. Renovations began in 1934 and were completed by 1936. A large wing was added onto the original house and several additional buildings were constructed. The entire area was fenced off, and remaining houses on the mountain were purchased by the Nazi Party and demolished.

5|$|The {{crossing}} of the Saint Lawrence by the American troops was observed by Quebec militia, who alerted British troops at Trois-Rivières. A local farmer led the Americans into a swamp, enabling the British to land additional forces in the village, and to establish positions behind the American army. After a brief exchange between an established British line and American troops emerging from the swamp, the Americans broke into a somewhat disorganized retreat. As some avenues of retreat <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off,</b> the British took a sizable number of prisoners, including General Thompson and much of his staff.|$|E
5|$|A {{more complex}} {{situation}} reigned in Russia. As early as April 1918, some Romanian volunteer groups joined {{up with the}} Bolshevik Red Army, taking their orders from Commissar Béla Kun, but some of their members continued to serve the nationalist cause. In June 1918, a number of Romanian prisoners who had {{signed up for the}} Volunteer Corps <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> from Romania by the Russian Civil War and left to fend for themselves. Some crossed into Bolshevik Russia hoping to be repatriated together with the Romanian consulate, while others took to areas controlled by the White movement, reaching Irkutsk; still others escaped through northern routes into Sweden. The various groups were monitored by French public opinion, and plans were drafted to merge them into the Romanian Legion on the Western Front, or even to have them open up a new Eastern Front.|$|E

5|$|Beginning on 21January 1947, the UK {{experienced}} several cold spells {{that brought}} large drifts of snow to the country, blocking roads and railways, which caused problems transporting coal {{to the electric}} power stations. Many had to shut down, forcing severe restrictions to cut power consumption, including restricting domestic electricity to 19 hours per day and cutting some industrial supplies completely. In addition, radio broadcasts were limited, television services were suspended, some magazines were ordered to stop publishing, and newspapers were reduced in size. These measures, {{on top of the}} low temperatures, badly affected public morale and the Minister of Fuel and Power, Emanuel Shinwell, became a scapegoat; he received death threats and had to be placed under police guard. Towards the end of February, there were also fears of a food shortage as supplies <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> and vegetables were frozen into the ground.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, silk {{supplies}} from Japan <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off,</b> so western countries {{were forced to}} find substitutes. Synthetic fibres such as nylon were used in products such as parachutes and stockings, replacing silk. Even after the war, silk {{was not able to}} regain many of the markets lost, though it remained an expensive luxury product. Postwar Japan, through improvements in technology and a protectionist market policy, became the world's foremost exporter of raw silk, a position it held until the 1970s. The continued rise in importance of synthetic fibres and loosening of the protectionist economy contributed to the decline of Japan's silk industry, and by 1975 it was no longer a net exporter of silk.|$|E
5|$|Edward now {{seized the}} initiative, and moved northwards. Lancaster convened one final meeting at Doncaster in November, and also entered into an {{alliance}} with Robert I of Scotland to strengthen his hand against the King. In January 1322 Edward crossed the River Severn, and secured the surrender {{of several of the}} marcher lords while Lancaster remained passive. As the royal army crossed the River Trent after the Battle of Burton Bridge, Lancaster was forced to flee north. On 16 March Lancaster and his army had reached Boroughbridge by the River Ure where they were joined by the Earl's Secretary Sir Robert de Holland and the force he had raised in Lancashire. There they <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> by the forces of Sir Andrew Harclay, a veteran from the Scottish wars, who had gathered the levies from the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.|$|E

5|$|Oldham's {{townscape}} {{was dominated}} by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills. Oldham was hit hard by the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–1865, when supplies of raw cotton from the United States <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off.</b> Wholly reliant upon the textile industry, the cotton famine created chronic unemployment in the town. By 1863 a committee had been formed, and with aid from central government, land was purchased {{with the intention of}} employing local cotton workers to construct Alexandra Park, which opened on 28 August 1865. Said to have over-relied upon the textile sector, as the importation of cheaper foreign yarns grew during the 20th century, Oldham's economy declined into a depression, although it was not until 1964 that Oldham ceased to be the largest centre of cotton spinning. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton spun in the town was in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese navy {{expanded}} their military facilities from 1937 onwards. More labourers from Japan and Korea {{were employed to}} construct the facilities to complete the facilities within {{a short period of}} time. The number of indentured labourers rose to more than 10,000 throughout Micronesia, and placed a heavy strain on the islands' scarce resources. Many Okinawan and Japanese labourers and permanent settlers were repartriated back to their homeland. Japanese men were conscripted into regular services, and Palauans who held administrative posts in the police force were reallocated jobs in the agricultural sector. The Japanese civilians {{played an important role in}} the islands' propaganda activities. As food resources <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> from Japan, many Japanese encountered greater difficulties in dealing with starvation than their Palauan counterparts, who were more knowledgeable with tropical survival skills.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} ripe for {{redevelopment}} by the landholding elite, {{who wished to}} have suitably grand townhouses to occupy while attending Parliament and the court. The vestiges of the Privy Garden became {{the site of a}} new street. In 1808 a row of houses called Whitehall Gardens was constructed on the site. Behind each house, long grassy gardens planted with rows of trees led directly down to the river, until they <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> by the construction of the Victoria Embankment along the river bank between 1865 and 1870. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli lived in one of the houses between 1873 and 1875, while Sir Robert Peel lived in another (and died there in 1850 after falling from his horse on Constitution Hill). The trees outside the front entrance to Whitehall Gardens were the last survivors of the original Privy Garden, and stood until as recently as the late 1930s.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} of the New Road in 1756 bisected the Angel Inn site and the stable buildings <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> on the southern side. The inn was on the northern side, {{on the corner of}} what is now the junction of Islington High Street and Pentonville Road, while the stables were now on what is St John Street, adjacent to the New Inn, which had been established in 1744. The Angel benefited from the extra traffic brought by the New Road, and in addition to accommodation provided a number of assembly rooms for public meetings. The author and political activist Thomas Paine is believed to have begun writing Rights of Man at the Angel in 1790, and there is a monument on Islington High Street commemorating this.|$|E
5|$|The {{island of}} Dominica {{suffered}} severe damage from Hurricane Omar.

All barge access for hauling sand and stones were destroyed. The airport also sustained some damage. Seven boats ran aground during the storm. Minor damage was reported in Anguilla. Two hotels sustained roof damage, downed treed knocked down power lines causing scattered power outages, and the rough seas caused severe beach erosion. Three cargo ships and seven boats ran aground and two other boats sank.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the roller}} coaster comes from the story of Hercules in Greek Mythology. According to the story, Hercules had to perform twelve labours. After {{defeating}} the Nemean lion for the first labour, the second was to defeat the Hydra, a nine-headed creature with eight serpentine heads that would regrow each time they <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off,</b> including one that was immortal. Dorney Park altered {{the remainder of the}} story- after Hercules managed to defeat the Hydra initially, he buried the immortal head stuck under a stone, with the intention of sealing it for all time. Years later however, the head slowly grew back, resurrecting the Hydra and taking its revenge on Hercules by killing him; hence why the Hydra roller coaster sits where Hercules once did.|$|E
