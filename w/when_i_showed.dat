However, he could not find financing. Domalpalli decided to select non-professionals and train them in a year. In the United States, producers voiced similar concerns over the marketability of the film and what they referred to as [...] "its lack of cohesion." [...] Beside this, Domalpalli's inexperience in filmmaking added to their concerns. Recalling initial hurdles, Domalpalli later said, [...] "it was only <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> my professors a rough cut of the film, and they approved, that purse strings finally came loose." [...] It eventually constituted the thesis for his master's degree.|$|E
2500|$|In The Other Hollywood, Boreman {{said she}} felt [...] "used" [...] by the anti-pornography movement. [...] "Between Andrea Dworkin and Kitty MacKinnon, they've written so many books, and they mention my name and all that, but financially they've never helped me out. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> up with them for {{speaking}} engagements, I'd always get five hundred dollars or so. But I know they made a few bucks off me, just like everybody else." [...] Thus Tom Leonard, writing for the London Daily Mail on March 26, 2012, alleged that both the porn industry and the anti-pornography movement had taken advantage of her.|$|E
2500|$|Later in November 1974 at the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association {{held at the}} University of Notre Dame, Michael W. Friedlander, {{professor}} of physics at Washington University in St. Louis, confronted Velikovsky in the symposium [...] "Velikovsky and the Politics of Science" [...] with examples of his [...] "substandard scholarship" [...] involving the [...] "distortion of the published scientific literature in quotations that he used to support his theses". For example, contrary to Velikovsky, R.A. Lyttleton did not write [...] "the terrestrial planets, Venus included, must [...] have originated from the giant planets…" [...] Rather, Lyttleton wrote [...] "…it is even possible…" [...] As Friedlander recounts, [...] "When I gave each example, [...] response was 'Where did I write that?'; <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> a photo copy of the quoted pages, he simply switched to a different topic." ...|$|E

5000|$|Hill did {{not view}} her prints as {{representations}} nor reproductions of physical objects, but she instead considered her prints as objects {{in and of}} themselves. On photocopies, Hill said, [...] "A photocopy seems to me much more truthful to detail than a photograph." [...] She never enlarged nor shrank {{the scale of the}} objects she copied. Hill's work with the photocopier led her to treat the process of photocopying as a conversation with the photocopier. She presented the machine with a degree of autonomy, explaining, This stocky, unrevealing box stands 3 ft. high without stockings or feet and lights up like a Xmas tree no matter what <b>I</b> <b>show</b> it.It repeats my words perfectly as many times as I ask it to, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>show</b> it a hair curler it hands me back a space ship, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>show</b> it the inside of a straw hat it describes the eerie joys of a descent into a volcano.|$|R
