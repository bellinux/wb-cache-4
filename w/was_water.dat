5|$|In 1894, American {{astronomer}} William W. Campbell {{found that}} the spectrum of Mars was identical to the spectrum of the Moon, throwing doubt on the burgeoning theory that the atmosphere of Mars {{is similar to that}} of the Earth. Previous detections of water in the atmosphere of Mars were explained by unfavorable conditions, and Campbell determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth's atmosphere. Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there <b>was</b> <b>water</b> in the atmosphere, he did not believe the caps were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected. At the time, Campbell's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community, but they were confirmed by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1925.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Cade was {{approached}} by Dewayne Douglas, an assistant coach for the Florida Gators football team, about the extreme dehydration faced by Gator football players practicing in the high temperatures and humidity of the Deep South in late summer and early fall. Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not urinate during practice and games. Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that football players were losing water through perspiration and failing to replace fluid during practice and games. Cade's research team discovered that football players were losing up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) during the three hours of a college football game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss <b>was</b> <b>water.</b> A player's plasma volume could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in the sweat.|$|E

While the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered {{that they did not know}} of the existence of the Holy Spirit and had only received John the Baptist’s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus’ name, Paul laid his hands on them, and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} band {{received}} its record deal, the band underwent {{a series of}} misfortunes when Olander, Johnson, and Williams came down with health problems. On August 9, 1990, Johnson was injured in a carpentry accident in Arkansas a day before his 41st birthday, severely cutting his left thumb. Robert Bolin substituted for Johnson during the band's tour in Brazil with Kevin Welch and Jann Browne. On September 6, four weeks after Johnson's accident, Williams <b>was</b> <b>water</b> skiing {{with his family in}} Cookeville, Tennessee as his boat came forward at high speed when his wife was picking him up. The propellor slashed Williams' legs and he was rushed to a hospital for his injuries. Brian Helgos and Paul Gregg (Danny Gregg's brother, and a member of Restless Heart) substituted for Williams. Meanwhile, Olander discovered that he had a lemon-sized tumor that was pressing against his esophagus. The tumor was never successfully diagnosed, although it ultimately vanished.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings in the past. As {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order to make sure it <b>was</b> <b>water</b> resistant.

25|$|The {{presence}} of dissolved magnesium chloride {{in the well}} water (bore water) used in locomotive boilers on the Trans-Australian Railway caused serious and expensive maintenance problems during the steam era. At no point along its route does the line cross a permanent fresh water watercourse, so bore water had to be relied on. No inexpensive treatment for the highly mineralised water was available and locomotive boilers were lasting {{less than a quarter}} of the time normally expected. In the days of steam locomotion, about half the total train load <b>was</b> <b>water</b> for the engine.

25|$|These {{represent}} three 'leading sectors', {{in which}} there were key innovations, which allowed the economic take off by which the Industrial Revolution is usually defined. This is not to belittle many other inventions, particularly in the textile industry. Without earlier ones, such as the spinning jenny and flying shuttle in the textile industry and the smelting of pig iron with coke, these achievements might have been impossible. Later inventions such as the power loom and Richard Trevithick's high pressure steam engine were also important in the growing industrialisation of Britain. The application of steam engines to powering cotton mills and ironworks enabled these {{to be built in}} places that were most convenient because other resources were available, rather than where there <b>was</b> <b>water</b> to power a watermill.|$|E
25|$|Another major area {{of concern}} for the DFG <b>was</b> <b>water</b> flow. By mid-July each year, snowpack in the {{mountains}} (the major source of water for the Smith River) had completely melted away. Combined with irrigation in the upper Smith River, this meant that water levels on the Smith were too low by mid-summer to support recreational boating or floating. Low water levels also hurt the sport fishery, but although DFG attempted to secure additional water rights these efforts largely failed over the next 20 years. In 1974, DFG abandoned its attempt to manage the Smith River as a sport fishery, and instead began implementing a wild trout fishery management plan. This meant stocking only native fish, as needed, and no more stocking of nonnative sport fish.|$|E

25|$|The Apocalypse of Abraham {{told that}} Abraham argued {{to his father}} Terah that fire is more worthy of honor than idols, because its flames mock {{perishable}} things. Even more worthy of honor <b>was</b> <b>water,</b> because it conquers the fire and satisfies the earth. He called the earth more worthy of honor, because it overpowers {{the nature of the}} water. He called the sun more worthy of honor, because its rays illumine the whole world. But even the sun Abraham did not call god, because at night and by clouds it is obscured. Nor did Abraham call the moon or the stars god, because they also in their season obscure their light. Abraham argued to his father that they should worship the God who made everything, including the heavens, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the earth. And while Abraham thus spoke to his father in the court of his house, the voice of God came down from heaven in a fiery cloudburst, crying to Abraham to leave his father's house so that he would not also die in his father's sins.|$|E
25|$|It <b>was</b> <b>water</b> hammer {{that caused}} the {{physical}} damage to the reactor, the deaths of personnel who stood atop and nearby, {{and the release of}} radioactive isotopes to the environment. One of the lessons learned from SL-1 was that there is an extreme water hammer hazard whenever a shutdown reactor is cooled to room temperature and there is an air gap between the top of the water and the reactor vessel head. One of the recommendations in the analysis of the incident was that shutdown reactors be filled to the top with water so that a power excursion could not induce such a powerful water hammer. Air is not dense enough to appreciably slow water, while water (being nearly incompressible) is able to distribute explosive forces and limit peak pressure. The extra water is also a very effective radiation shield for those who are directly above the vessel. Written procedures at SL-1 had included a directive to pump down the level of water in the reactor prior to the maintenance procedure that destroyed it.|$|E
25|$|Sandbed wheel {{was built}} in 1723, and by 1794, there were three water wheels {{supplying}} 52 grinding troughs. A steam engine was supplementing the wheels by 1886, but the wheels remained in use until at least 1907. The weir and the shuttles controlling the flow in the head goit remain. Below this, Morton wheels {{are known to have}} existed in 1581. The works became the Philadelphia Works around 1807, and a claim for £6,204 was made and received for damage caused by the 1864 flood. Next came Kelham Wheel, which was used as a cutlers wheel, a silk mill, and a cotton mill. Following fires in 1792 and 1810, the mill was rebuilt to use steam power, and became the Britannia Corn Mills after 1864. The buildings were demolished in 1975, but the weir remains in good order, {{and is one of the}} largest in Sheffield. Below this were the Town Corn Mill and wheel, which <b>was</b> <b>water</b> powered until 1877, and was the subject of an archaeological investigation in 1999, which uncovered the remains of the wheel pits.|$|E
