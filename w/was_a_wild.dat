In autumn the woodland hosts over 300 species of fungi. Bilberry, a scarce plant in the Bristol area, is found in Leigh Woods, as is the parasitic plant yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys).

25|$|In 1853, the Blacket {{family moved}} to a rented house in Glebe. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> place {{at that time and}} Sarah feared for Edmund's safety as he walked home. The family had {{expanded}} to six children: Edith, was born in 1844, Alice in 1846, Arthur in 1848, Marian in 1850, Owen in 1851 and Hilda in 1854. The cost of living greatly increased owing to the gold rush and with six children to support and earning £300 a year, Blacket left the Public Service in September 1854, to be succeeded by William Weaver.|$|E

25|$|When The Decline of the West was {{published}} in the summer of 1918, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> success. The national humiliation of the Treaty of Versailles (1919) and the ensuing economic depression, caused by World War I reparations, seemed to prove Spengler right. The book comforted Germans by rationalizing their downfall as part of larger world-historical processes. It met with wide success outside of Germany as well, and by 1919 had been translated into several other languages. Spengler rejected a subsequent offer to become Professor of Philosophy at the University of Göttingen, saying he needed time to focus on writing.|$|E

He is most {{famous for his}} work on the large kites known as Cody War-Kites, that were used by the British in World War I as a smaller {{alternative}} to balloons for artillery spotting. He was also the first man to fly an aeroplane in Britain, on 16 October 1908. A flamboyant showman, he was often confused with Buffalo Bill Cody, whose surname he took when young.|$|E

25|$|On 15 December 1986, Dreamworld {{unveiled}} Gold Rush Country (later the Town of Gold Rush), its eighth themed area. The {{area was}} located {{to the left}} of Central Plaza and featured two attractions. The first <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> mouse roller coaster named the Eureka Mountain Mine Ride. Built by Brisbane company HyFab, the roller coaster was enclosed within a mountain with selected track segments venturing outside the mountain. The area's second attraction was a river rafting ride called Thunder River Rapids Ride. The ride's channel weaved around Gold Rush Country and under the Eureka Mountain Mine Ride. Also in 1986, the park opened the Music Bowl (later Dreamworld Amphitheatre and Dreamworld Studios) and had its first after-dark opening.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Griffin had {{an ambitious}} but {{unsuccessful}} attempt at adapting the venerable board game Monopoly {{into a game}} show of the same name. His last game show <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> game show called Ruckus, which emanated from the Resorts International Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City, which he owned at the time. Involving slapstick stunts and a somewhat truncated version of his old Reach for the Stars, the show initially aired locally in New York, {{with the intent of}} national syndication early the following year. The Amazing Johnathan left the show after 65 episodes because of a contract dispute and the show was scrapped before it was to be nationally syndicated. A national audience did get a look at it, via reruns that aired for a time on GSN.|$|E

25|$|Belgium {{was short}} {{of people with}} {{tropical}} experience but Leopold was adept at recruiting other European nationalities for his schemes. Central Africa <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> frontier attracting mercenaries for hire. At the recommendation of British-American explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who had already acted for Leopold in the Congo, the 27 years old Swahili speaking Captain William Stairs was appointed to lead the expedition, {{on the basis of}} his experience on the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition on which he had become Stanley's second in command. He had a reputation of someone who would obey orders and get the job done. That previous expedition had been marked by violence and brutality against any Africans who stood in its way as well as against its own African members. Canadian born at a time when it was part of the British Empire, Stairs had been educated partly in Britain and had joined a British regiment. He was considered to be and considered himself English or British.|$|E
25|$|At the time, much of Calabria <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> place. The 1783 Calabrian {{earthquakes}} killed 100,000 people. Parts of Reggio {{still lay}} in ruins {{as late as}} 1813 and many churches had not been rebuilt in 1806. The hardy Calabrians had a strong independent streak and practiced the vendetta against neighboring families and villages. Plundering French troops and greedy French civil authorities quickly ignited a revolt by the proud Calabrian peasants. However, {{the people of the}} major towns hated the Neapolitan royal administration and generally favored the French. The rebellion flared up after individual events. At Scigliano the French left a detail of 50 soldiers. A woman was raped, the villagers rose up, and most of the Frenchmen were slaughtered. The French commanders had only one answer to such incidents, to attack, plunder, and burn down the offending village. This led to a vicious cycle of atrocity and counter-atrocity. For his part, Joseph Bonaparte tried to be fair, even ordering French soldiers to be shot for criminal offenses and French officials to be tried for malfeasance.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Elai said in {{the name}} of Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish (Resh Lakish) that Rabbi Meir used to {{maintain}} that the , techashim (sometimes translated [...] "sealskins" [...] or [...] "dolphin skins") listed in [...] came from an animal called a tachash that lived in the time of Moses. It was a separate species, and the Sages could not decide whether it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> beast or a domestic animal. It had one horn on its forehead, and it came to Moses providentially just for the occasion. Moses made the Tabernacle's covering, and then the tachash disappeared. The Gemara taught that the tachash was multicolored.|$|E
2500|$|Not all {{fiction of}} the first half of the 17th century <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> flight of fancy in far-flung lands and rarefied, adventurous love stories.

[...] Other important satirical models were provided by Fernando de Rojas' La Celestina and John Barclay's (1582–1621) two satirical Latin works, Euphormio sive Satiricon (1602) and Argenis (1621).|$|E

2500|$|Boca Raton was {{the site}} of two now {{vanished}} amusement parks, Africa U.S.A. (1953–61) and Ancient America (1953–59).

It is now the Camino Gardens subdivision one mile west of the Boca Raton Hotel. A red wooden bridge and remnants from the Watusi Geyser and Zambezi Falls, a 30-foot waterfall, from Africa USA can still be seen at the entrance to Camino Gardens. Ancient America was built surrounding a real Native American burial mound. Today, the mound is still visible within the Boca Marina & Yacht Club neighborhood on U.S. 1 near Yamato Road.|$|E
2500|$|The date {{estimated}} for {{the evolutionary}} divergence {{of a domestic}} lineage from a wild one does not necessarily indicate {{the start of the}} domestication process but it does provide an upper boundary. The divergence of the domestic horse from the lineage that led to the modern Przewalski’s horse is estimated at 45,000 YBP but the archaeological record indicates 5,500 YBP. The variance could be due to the modern wild population not being the direct ancestor of the domestic one, or the impact of a split due to climate, topography, or other environmental changes. The divergence time does not imply domestication during this specific period. Some [...] researchers propose that the [...] "dog was the dog before it was domesticated" [...] and that the ancestor of Canis familiaris <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> Canis familiaris, which had diverged from a common ancestor along with the gray wolf.|$|E
