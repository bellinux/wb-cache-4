500|$|Impressed by Graham's {{performances}} in Northwestern's wins over the Ohio State in 1941 and 1943, Paul Brown came and {{offered him a}} contract worth $7,500 per year ($ in [...] dollars) in 1945 {{to play for a}} professional team he was coaching in Cleveland in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Graham would not receive his salary until he started playing, however, and Brown added a monthly stipend of $250 ($ in [...] ) {{until the end of the}} war. It was a large amount of money at the time. [...] "All I asked was, <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> sign?" [...] Graham said later. [...] "Some of the other navy men said I was rooting for the war to last forever." [...] Graham was also drafted by the National Football League's Detroit Lions, but he did not sign a contract or play a game with the team as the war wore on.|$|E
500|$|The role of {{the player}} {{character}} in the main quest was to be changed as well. In contrast to past games, where the player character would play a type of [...] "chosen one", Oblivion would have the player character [...] "find him, protect him, and help him." [...] Aside from that, {{in the opinion of}} Hines, [...] "the main quest has similar themes and tones as in past Elder Scrolls games", and should still feel [...] "epic", simply {{because of the way the}} gamespace is designed: with openness in mind. Improving that aspect of the experience, said Hines, came mostly in the form of improved information presentation. The system would not intrude on the experience when the player merely wishes to [...] "walk around and explore the world and do whatever he/she wants", but given the scenario where the player asks [...] "'OK, I'm ready to do the next part of the main quest, <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> go?'", the game would provide a ready answer, so as to avoid [...] "confusion" [...] and [...] "downtime".|$|E
500|$|... "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] was {{produced}} by Eric Foster White. Described by Spears as a [...] "soulful" [...] ballad, it draws influence from teen pop and lasts for five minutes and ten seconds. Chuck Taylor of Billboard noted that the singer [...] "turn toward the sad side" [...] on the track, with its lyrics talking {{about the loss of}} a first love and how breaking up can be hard. As the song begins, Spears declares, [...] "'Never look back', we said / How was I to know I'd miss you so? / Loneliness up ahead, emptyness behind / <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> go?" [...] During the chorus, she realizes that she has lost her true love, stating, [...] "From the bottom of my broken heart, even though time may find me somebody new / You were my real love, I never knew love, till there was you." [...] According to sheet music published at musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] is composed in the key of G major and is set in time signature of common time with a slowly tempo of 76 beats per minute.|$|E

500|$|Bruce Campbell {{went through}} five {{audition}}s {{for the role}} of Brisco before he was hired. In his first audition with the casting director, Campbell spontaneously did a standing flip. The stunt impressed the casting director so much that during each subsequent audition, Campbell was asked to do the flip again. In his final audition, Campbell assured the network executives that if hired for the role, he would work hard to make the show a success. In an interview, Campbell said, [...] "It's every actor's dream to play a cowboy, so when this opportunity came up, I mean, yeah, <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> sign?" [...] He added that working on Brisco provided him with acting opportunities he would not have otherwise had. Cuse said getting Campbell [...] "was just one of those collisions between an actor and a script that was just perfect... I can't imagine Brisco having ever existed without him." [...] Writing in Auxiliary Magazine, Luke Copping claimed that Brisco was Campbell's [...] "last great" [...] role before the actor fell into [...] "a period of self-parody and overt camp that he did not redeem himself from until joining the cast of Burn Notice".|$|E
2500|$|Cook {{became a}} {{favourite}} of the chat show circuit {{but his own}} effort at hosting one for the BBC in 1971, <b>Where</b> <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> Sit?, was said by the critics {{to have been a}} disappointment. He was replaced after only two episodes by Michael Parkinson, the start of Parkinson's career as a chat show host. Parkinson later asked Cook what his ambitions were, Cook replied jocularly [...] " [...] in fact, my ambition is to shut you up altogether you see!" ...|$|E
