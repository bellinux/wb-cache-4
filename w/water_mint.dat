5|$|The tansy beetle has a Palearctic distribution. Evidence from archaeological {{excavation}} {{has shown}} that its presence in western Europe is confirmed at least {{as early as the}} Neolithic period. The beetles may be found on tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) and <b>water</b> <b>mint</b> (Mentha aquatica) in fen land and the banks of rivers with broad floodplains in Britain. Larvae are also recorded from other host plants: Achillea ptarmica (sneezewort) in France and various plants of the genus Artemisia in Russia. Adults and larvae feed on the leaves of their host plants.|$|E
25|$|A {{continuous}} area {{of approximately}} 400 hectares (988 acres) {{is covered with}} woodland or plantation. The forest is managed for timber by United Utilities, using a continuous cover policy (rather than clear felling and restocking). Macclesfield Borough Council plans to increase {{the area of the}} former royal forest that is covered by woodland. The predominant species are Sitka spruce and Japanese Larch, with some Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Corsican pine and Norway Spruce. There are also areas of semi-natural mixed and broadleaved woodland, mainly oak, sycamore and beech; in 2004, broadleaved species made up 23% of the total, although current forestry management aims to increase the proportion. The woodland supports mosses and thirty species of fungi, including fly agaric, stinkhorns, honey fungus and the sickener. The area also includes areas of acidic unimproved upland grassland, including approximately a hectare within the Trentabank nature reserve; this supports species including bluebell, tormentil, pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser knapweed, while the reservoir margins support aquatic plants including amphibious bistort, <b>water</b> <b>mint,</b> Water Horsetail and common spikerush.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, a mojito is a {{cocktail}} {{that consists of}} five ingredients: white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, soda <b>water,</b> and <b>mint.</b> The original Cuban recipe uses spearmint or yerba buena, a mint variety very popular on the island. Its combination of sweetness, refreshing citrus, and mint flavors is intended to complement the potent kick of the rum, and has made this clear highball a popular summer drink.

The ginger and pear give two distinct flavour stages.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of aqueous extracts of dried mint (Mentha piperita L.) in concentrations of 2 %, 5 % and 10 %, and fresh parts of this plant, in concentrations of 10 %, 20 % and 30 % on feeding of pea leaf weevil (Sitona lineatus L.) and survival of black bean aphid (Aphis fabae Scop.) on the leaves of broad bean (Vicia faba L.) variety "Bartek". In the studies of the effects of aqueous extracts of mint on the dynamics of Sitona lineatus feeding on the beans leaves, 9 laboratoryâ€™s observations in 12 -hour intervals was made. Leaves injuries on their edge surface caused by adult individuals were measured. Observations were carried out in 6 replicates divided into males and females. In these researches on impact of <b>water</b> extracts from <b>mint</b> on mortality of wingless females and larvae of black bean aphids, 14 laboratoryâ€™s observations in the 8 -hour intervals was made. Aqueous extracts of dry and fresh peppermint significantly limited the feeding of pea leaf weevil females, and the extracts from dried material were more effective. Extracts from peppermint to a greater extent caused mortality of black bean aphid larvae compared to wingless females, and the higher the concentration of the extract the more beneficial effect was observed. An extract from dried material at a concentration of 2 % was too weak to effectively combat the larvae of A. fabae, while in the case of aphid females, an effectiveness was only demonstrated for the extracts at the highest concentrations, i. e., 10 % of dried and 30 % of fresh peppermint...|$|R
40|$|The {{validation}} of hypotheses {{in order to}} explain natural phenomena requires data. Many biological phenomena have been discovered and explained {{on the basis of}} qualitative analyses, but new insights often follow when they are revisited in quantitative terms. Without a quantitative description, there is no discovery at all. A parameter variation due to changes on environmental conditions is usually detected by measurements on apparatus developed according to certain physical-chemical principles. The knowledge of fundamental principles underlying the techniques used is essential for good understanding of the phenomenon in question and so it is necessary to insist on basic concepts consolidation. Recalling the properties of <b>water</b> and using <b>mint</b> leaves as biological material, spectrophotometry and tensiometry are two measurement techniques that allow us easily gathering a lot of data. The analysis of the information obtained by these two methods on similar samples may promote internalization of natural phenomena, related to the frequent mixtures of living or dead organic matter in water. In this work it is proposed an experimental activity addressed to pre-university and first year graduate students. The first step of the activity is to prepare three batches of mint leaves (biological material easy to obtain) to make an infusion, a suspension and an extract of chlorophyll from their leaves. The preparations are analysed by spectrophotometry and tensiometry. The results obtained by each technique allow us to compare some properties of the three types of samples. Although not being related a-priori, the combined analysis of the parameters measured by the two techniques provides some insight on natural mechanisms. The main goal of this activity is that students recognize the importance of elementary concepts from different scientific areas, enhancing the relevance of interdisciplinary towards the consolidation of scientific knowledge...|$|R
5000|$|In addition, Professors Donald White and Gerald Schaus have {{discussed}} {{in detail the}} question of ritual feasting or dining at the Sanctuary, but Corinthian pottery does not supply conclusive evidence for or against the rituals. However, of the imported pottery vases, minimal observations of two exclusive types may provide some insight concerning this ongoing issue: vases associated with personal use (perfumed-oil containers, small boxes, etc.) and those with wine, its preparation, serving and consumption (kraters, cups, and oinochoai). The pottery vases categorized as having a personal use may have served as dedicationsto Persephone and her divine mother (Demeter). Moreover, one-third of all finds unearthed at the Sanctuary, namely kotylai and black-glazed hydriai (both are known to possess cultic associations with Demeter), serve {{in some form or}} fashion as votive objects. In short, {{more than half of all}} the Corinthian pottery imports appear to have almost certainly functioned as dedicatory gifts to the mother-daughter deities. In contrast to these vases, the vases directly related to the consumption of wine could have also served a practical purpose. Half of all the whole-sized pottery finds, particularly those in association with wine mixing and pouring vases, suggest ritual drinking. On a rather different note, these finds, i.e. the artifacts specifically concerned with the preparation and consumption of wine, also have an immediate literary relevance. For example, in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, a celebratory song hymned in honor of the grain goddess (Demeter), Demeter expresses her unwillingness to drink wine until it has been [...] "mixed" [...] with a concoction of <b>mint,</b> <b>water</b> and barley (II.205-210). [...] Thus, although there exists a lack of indisputable evidence proving ritual drinking took place at the Sanctuary, it is nonetheless highly plausible that cups and like vases were left as dedicatory votives after the ritual feast.|$|R
