5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble <b>without</b> <b>meaning</b> to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E

25|$|These {{results show}} that {{at the age of}} 6 months infants are {{sensitive}} to how often certain sounds occur in the language they are exposed to and they can learn which cues are important to pay attention to from these differences in frequency of occurrence. In natural language exposure this means typical sounds in a language (such as prevoiced /d/ in Spanish) occur often and infants can learn them from mere exposure to them in the speech they hear. All of this occurs before infants are aware of the meaning of any of the words they are exposed to, and therefore the phenomenon of statistical learning has been used to argue for the fact that infants can learn sound contrasts <b>without</b> <b>meaning</b> being attached to them.|$|E
25|$|The {{conception}} that {{an action}} for conversion lies only for tangible property {{capable of being}} identified and taken into actual possession {{is based on a}} fiction by which the action of trover was founded, namely, that the defendant had found the property of another, which was lost. This conception has become, in the progress of the law, something <b>without</b> <b>meaning</b> which has been discarded by most courts. Therefore, it has been generally accepted that an action for conversion lies for every species of personal property which is the subject of private ownership, whether animate or inanimate. Intangible property can be the subject of a conversion in the United States. There cannot be an action in conversion for choses in action or mere debt. Computer software can be the subject of a conversion.|$|E

Recognizing such a distinction among constructions enabled FrameNet-style linguistic resources to have a proper division of labor between frame annotations and construction annotations. Moreover, in addition to the three kinds of "meaningless" constructions which have been proposed already, this research project suggested that there is yet another subtype of constructions <b>without</b> <b>meanings.</b> Furthermore, the research project adds supported to the claim that there may be constructions <b>without</b> <b>meanings</b> (Fillmore, Lee-Goldman & Rhomieux, 2012) in a current debate concerning whether all constructions should be seen as meaning-bearing (Goldberg, 2006 : 166 - 182) ...|$|R

On the basis of analyses of Japanese constructions {{for the purpose of}} building a constructicon in the Japanese FrameNet project, this paper argues that constructions can be classified based on whether they evoke frames or not. By recognizing such a distinction among constructions, it becomes possible for FrameNet-style linguistic resources to have a proper division of labor between frame annotations and construction annotations.

25|$|Beauty is a Wound is a {{novel by}} Indonesian author Eka Kurniawan, {{published}} in 2002. The novel weaves history into satire, tragedy and the supernatural to depict {{the state of the}} nation before, during and after the 1965 incidents. There is less focus on the military aspect of the coup, but a good deal of focus on the communists themselves through the form of interpersonal relationships and communist ghosts who could not find peace. <b>Without</b> <b>meaning</b> to, perhaps, the novel also gives readers a glimpse of the economy of Indonesia at the time using the example of a flourishing prostitute business and a temporary swimsuit business, among others. Kurniawan projects his feelings about the revolution and coup by constructing a story of theatrical characters around it and delivers a history of the nation all the way from Dutch occupation to Suharto.|$|E

Fáfnir says that the island is called Óskópnir, that all of the gods shall go there bearing spears, and that on their way there the bridge Bifröst will break beneath them, causing their horses to [...] "flounder in the great river". The late Eddic poem Fjölsvinnsmál, stanza 24, {{contains}} the line [...] "Surtur sinn mautu" [...] or [...] "surtur sinn mantu" [...] according to the best manuscripts. The last two words, which are otherwise <b>without</b> <b>meaning,</b> are sometimes emended to [...] "Sinmöru" [...] and the entire phrase is taken to mean that Surtr has a female companion named Sinmara.

500|$|After leaving Geneva on 8 February, the Hański family {{spent several}} months visiting {{the major cities}} of Italy. In Florence the {{sculptor}} Lorenzo Bartolini started work on a bust of Hańska. In the summer of 1834 they returned to Vienna, where they would stay for another year. During this time Balzac continued writing to Hańska, and by accident two especially amorous letters fell {{into the hands of}} her husband. He wrote to the French author, furious, and demanded an explanation. Balzac wrote to Hański claiming that it {{was nothing more than a}} game: [...] "One evening, in jest, she said to me that she would like to know what a love-letter was. This was said wholly <b>without</b> <b>meaning....</b> I wrote those two unfortunate letters to Vienna, supposing that she remembered our joke...." [...] Hański apparently accepted the explanation, and invited Balzac to visit them in Vienna, which he did in May 1835.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} edition of The Theatre of the Absurd, Esslin saw the work of these playwrights as giving artistic meaning to Albert Camus's {{philosophy}} that life is inherently <b>without</b> <b>meaning,</b> as illustrated in his work The Myth of Sisyphus. In the first (1961) edition, Esslin presented the four defining playwrights of the movement as Samuel Beckett, Arthur Adamov, Eugène Ionesco, and Jean Genet, and in subsequent editions he added a fifth playwright, Harold Pinter—although each of these writers has unique preoccupations and characteristics that go beyond the term [...] "absurd." [...] Other writers associated with this group by Esslin and other critics include Tom Stoppard, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Fernando Arrabal, Edward Albee, Boris Vian, and Jean Tardieu.|$|E

For the logical positivists and adherents of similar schools of thought, {{statements}} about religious or other transcendent experiences {{can not have a}} truth value, and are deemed to be <b>without</b> <b>meaning,</b> because such statements do not have any clear verification criteria. As the Christian biologist Scott C. Todd put it [...] "Even if all the data pointed to an intelligent designer, such a hypothesis is excluded from science because it is not naturalistic."
