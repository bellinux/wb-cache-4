500|$|By about 00:20, 40minutes {{after the}} collision, the loading of the {{lifeboats}} was under way. Second Officer Lightoller recalled afterwards that he noticed Smith {{standing near the}} bridge {{looking out at the}} ocean in a trance-like daze. According to Lightoller, [...] "I yelled {{at the top of my}} voice, 'Hadn't <b>we</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> the women and children into the boats, sir?' He heard me and nodded reply." [...] Smith then ordered Lightoller and Murdoch to [...] "put the women and children in and lower away". Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took charge of those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the [...] "women and children" [...] evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children first, while Lightoller took it to mean women and children only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked. Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and they both erred on the side of caution by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people, especially with the highly favourable weather and sea conditions. Had this been done, an extra 500 people could have been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats vacant.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] {{said the}} lady in the back seat, rising with a half hysterical laugh, [...] "hadn't <b>we</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> out before they come?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, General," [...] said Jonas. [...] "Though, stop a moment, Oliver; perhaps <b>we</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> out and walk, or the sleigh may upset." ...|$|R

6000|$|Fisher moved abruptly, as if waking from a {{momentary}} trance, and said, {{in a new}} and more vigorous voice, [...] "But look here, hadn't <b>we</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> outside and see if anything has happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|Campbell; [...] "Waddled, I {{should have}} said. But {{this is pretty}} serious, Roberts. She may be a {{relation}} of John L. Sullivan's. I guess <b>we</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> out of here; or, no, we can't! We've got to wait for Amy and Agnes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{leave you}} {{to deal with}} Norton if he hears about the matter. Now you have had your amusement, <b>we</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We said {{we would}} meet as strangers, and we do. We never have known each other. Don't you think <b>we</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> acquainted?' he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>we</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> {{back and}} pitch some {{water on the}} roof," [...] he suggested. [...] "I {{was too busy to}} think of that before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{remember}} {{anything about a}} tumble," [...] said Tom, slowly. [...] "I--I--thought I was in our room at Brill, old number twenty-five. And it wasn't winter either.

Their words came jerkily between gasps and their faces were as white as--a newly washed and very hungry pig.|$|E
50|$|Riders then enter a {{barn and}} pass the stables engulfed in flames. (At this point, the trains are going up a slight incline, but to riders they do not realize it.) The next scene's {{narration}} does not match what we see. A fireman has a hose shooting water over the track towards the outhouse which Stan comes out of. (No water is currently used). Fireman: Hey Stan, the stables are on fire.Stan: On fire! Somebody get a hose over here, quick!Fireman: We ain't got no hose, Stan. <b>We</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> a bucket.|$|E
6000|$|... "Phew! {{listen to}} that, {{and look at}} the lightning!" [...] cried Phil. [...] "Say, if you are ready, Roger, <b>we</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> out of here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Positive! Say, {{the water}} is rising to beat the band! I guess <b>we</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> out! If <b>we</b> don't we'll have to swim for it!" ...|$|R

40|$|Translation begins] ARMY AIR FORCES Thursday 1500 My Darling, The list came {{up today}} as you already know. Gosh I can’t believe I made Lieutenant. 34 % of 45 -A made F/O here, that’s {{a little better}} than 44 -K. I’m C. Q. again today so I’m taking it easy. Honey, why didn’t you tell me your mother was so sick? I couldn’t {{understand}} why you couldn’t get here Wednsday [sic] but now I do, and feel like a heel for the things I said to you. But darling I didn’t know that she was that ill, if I had I would never have asked you to come down {{in the first place and}} now that I am pretty sure of getting fifteen days I think <b>we</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> married at home. Darling all I was thinking about was myself, and seeing you a few days sooner. I had no idea what the situation was, and it wasn’t be fair of you not to tell me. It’s my own fault though, I should have known that there was a good reason but I guess I’m just stupid or very selfish. But honey, I wasn’t being thoughtless I just didn’t know. If your mother makes that trip, and then with all the excitement, there’s no telling what might happen, and I would be responsible for it. Darling we have to consider others as you said and you’re so right. So I’ll call you tonight and explain. If you had only told me honey. You see,- it will never pay to keep anything from each other, no matter how trivial or important it may seem at the time. If I seemed thoughtless or selfish darling, it’s only because I love you so much and wanted us to be together sooner, these days away from you are just an existence to me, there’s something missing. And that something is the most important thing in my life, you. I love you darling and I wouldn’t hurt you or your very sweet mother for anything. You have all my love- Always, Judd [Translation ends...|$|E
