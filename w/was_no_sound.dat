500|$|The {{eruption}} {{was heard}} {{hundreds of miles}} away, but {{some of those who}} survived the eruption declared that the landslide and pyroclastic flows were silent as they raced down the mountain. Krau Kilpatrick, an employee of the United States Forest Service, recalled, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> to it, not a sound. It was like a silent movie and we were all in it." [...] The reason for this discrepancy is a [...] "quiet zone", created {{as a result of the}} motion and temperature of air and, to a lesser extent, upon local topography.|$|E
500|$|In his 1997 book Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema, Randor Guy {{described}} Kalidas as a [...] "crude experiment" [...] {{that had}} poor lip sync; when characters opened their mouths there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound,</b> and when dialogue or song was heard, artistes remained silent. He said the public {{did not care}} about technical niceties and flocked to see the film. Film critic and journalist Kalki Krishnamurthy, in his review of the film for Ananda Vikatan, noted that he was awestruck by the costumes used. He praised Rajalakshmi's performance and her dancing but criticised her singing, saying {{that she had to}} go see a doctor to get her vocal chords fixed. The Tamil newspaper Swadesamitran printed a favourable review for Kalidas on 29 October 1931, two days prior to its theatrical release, where the reviewer, in contrast to Krishnamurthy's comments, appreciated Rajalakshmi's singing.|$|E
500|$|Katy Stevens {{notes that}} the {{dialogue}} in [...] "The Body" [...] was recorded with microphones {{very close to the}} actors, making variations in their voices—cracks, rises, and whispers—more prominent to the audience, to close the distance between the actors and the viewer. Conversely, the scene in which Dawn is told of Joyce's death was shot through a large classroom window, muffling Dawn's emotional reaction, to isolate Buffy and Dawn from the class and the audience. Several moments of silence follow this scene. Whedon shot the conversation up close several times, filming over-the-shoulder and reaction shots, but eventually went with a more distanced point of view. Michelle Trachtenberg later said of this effect, [...] "obviously you know in the end result there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> and I thought that was actually one of the most brilliant ideas [...] ever had because it allows everyone to sort of attach their own emotional plug into whatever might have happened in your life. I think it allowed the audience to really connect with Dawn for the first time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1953, British {{psychiatrist}} Harold Bourne {{published a}} paper entitled [...] "The insulin myth" [...] in the Lancet, {{in which he}} argued that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> basis for believing that insulin coma therapy counteracted the schizophrenic process in a specific way. If treatment worked, he said, it was because patients were chosen for their good prognosis and were given special treatment: [...] "insulin patients tend to be an elite group sharing common privileges and perils". Prior to publishing [...] "The insulin myth" [...] in The Lancet, Bourne had tried to submit the article to the Journal of Mental Science; after a 12-month delay, the Journal informed Bourne they had rejected the article, telling him to [...] "get more experience".|$|E
60|$|I suppose {{five minutes}} might have elapsed, and the hush {{remained}} unbroken; ten--and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
60|$|But {{a quarter}} of an hour passed, and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> to break the stillness of the evening.|$|E
5000|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound.</b> Instead, {{flashing}} {{text messages}} appear {{every now and}} then saying things like [...] "Get Set!", [...] "Get Ready!" [...] or [...] "Go for it!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Here [...] is the {{characteristic}} impedance, and [...] and [...] are the density {{and speed of}} sound in the unperturbed medium (i.e. when there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> waves travelling in it).|$|R
2500|$|In Swahili, an {{apostrophe}} after ng {{shows that}} there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> of [...] after the [...] sound; that is, that the ng is pronounced as in English singer, not as in English finger.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} he stood without, {{listening}} intently. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound,</b> and he glided into the semi-darkness of the interior.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> in {{the room}} but the violent sobbing of the landlady. The men, one and all, were overcome.|$|E
60|$|We {{listened with}} all our ears, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound,</b> save the gentle wash of the unseen waves against our sides.|$|E
6000|$|Somewhere in the {{darkness}} a clock strikes two: [...] And there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> in the sad old house, [...] But the long veranda dripping with dew, [...] And in the wainscot a mouse.|$|R
50|$|Unlike in {{the case}} of {{functional}} dependencies, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> and complete axiomatization for join dependencies, though axiomatization exist for more expressive dependency languages such as full typed dependencies. However, implication of join dependencies is decidable.|$|R
6000|$|Endowed with {{enlarged}} {{powers of}} audition as of vision, we are struck [...] by the mournful taciturnity that prevails. Nature is mute. Save [...] for the incessant flogging of the wind-broken and lacerated horses [...] there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>sounds.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{waited a}} space, {{but he did}} not stir. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound,</b> save the song of Coniston Water under the {{shattered}} ice.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a long}} pause, {{during which}} there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> in the room except the ticking of the clock and the munching of shrimps by the ex-champion.|$|E
6000|$|I dragged myself {{trembling}} to {{the window}} of the cottage and looked out. The moon was glittering across the bay and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> anywhere on the island.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Washington-state-based {{wilderness}} conservatory Northwest Trek used a shortened form of {{the quote}} in its mid-1970s television advertisement, as such: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> unless someone <b>is</b> {{there to see it}} or hear it. Experience it at Northwest Trek." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{explains}} why there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> when the flame is heating the gauze: all air {{flowing through the}} tube is heated by the flame, so when it reaches the gauze, it is already hot and no pressure increase takes place.|$|R
60|$|All was peace. The place <b>was</b> empty. <b>No</b> <b>sound</b> {{disturbed}} the stillness.|$|R
60|$|I bowed my head. I {{could not}} answer that. And {{for a while}} there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> save that of the singing of the frogs in the distant marsh.|$|E
60|$|Forgetting all precaution, {{he pressed}} eagerly forward, and stopped before the gate. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> from within; there had evidently been no {{challenge}} nor interruption. She was safe.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> {{in answer}} but the loud ticking of Mr Dombey's watch and Doctor Parker Peps's watch, which seemed {{in the silence}} to be running a race.|$|E
50|$|In a {{flashback}} to an undetermined previous time, two Marines {{go to her}} house. Although there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> in this scene, it’s obvious they are there {{to tell her that}} Rusty died in the war. She lashes out at them, and the movie ends.|$|R
5000|$|The NBCC {{denies the}} {{scientific}} consensus on climate change, stating on their website that [...] "...there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> science {{to support the}} claims of Global Warming."

6000|$|... "Still, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> of any musical instrument," [...] he said, {{listening}} at the corner, [...] "and yet I saw {{the performing}} hands again as I came by.

50|$|The {{priority}} of the species H. rogersii has been debated, however there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> basis for the recognition {{of more than one}} species from North America.
