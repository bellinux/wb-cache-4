25|$|The {{material}} properties of FRP or GRP bars differ markedly from steel, {{so there are}} differences in the design considerations. FRP or GRP bars have relatively higher tensile strength but lower stiffness, so that deflections are likely to be higher than for equivalent steel-reinforced units. Structures with internal FRP reinforcement typically have an elastic deformability comparable to the plastic deformability (ductility) of steel reinforced structures. Failure in either case is more likely to occur by compression of the concrete than by rupture of the reinforcement. Deflection is always a major design consideration for reinforced concrete. Deflection limits are set to ensure that crack widths in steel-reinforced concrete are controlled to prevent water, air or other aggressive substances reaching the steel and causing corrosion. For FRP-reinforced concrete, aesthetics and possibly <b>water-tightness</b> will be the limiting criteria for crack width control. FRP rods also have relatively lower compressive strengths than steel rebar, and accordingly require different design approaches for reinforced concrete columns.|$|E

50|$|An {{indication}} of the test pressure in terms of water depth does not mean a water-resistant watch was designed for repeated long-term use in such water depths. For example, a watch marked 30 metres water resistant cannot be expected to withstand activity for longer time periods in a swimming pool, let alone continue to function at 30 metres under water. This is because the test is conducted only once using static pressure on a sample of newly manufactured watches.The test for qualifying a diving watch for repeated usage in a given depth includes safety margins to take factors into account like aging of the seals, the properties of water and seawater, rapidly changing water pressure and temperature, as well as dynamic mechanical stresses encountered by a watch.

50|$|The {{standards}} and features for diving watches are {{regulated by the}} ISO 6425 - Divers watches international standard. This standard was introduced in 1996.

Diving watches are tested in static or still water under 125% of the rated (water) pressure, thus a watch with a 200-metre rating will be water resistant if it is stationary and under 250 metres of static water. ISO 6425 testing of the water resistance or <b>water-tightness</b> and resistance at a water overpressure as it is officially defined is fundamentally different from non-dive watches, because every single watch has to be tested. Testing diving watches for ISO 6425 compliance is voluntary and involves costs, so not every manufacturer present their watches for certification according to this standard.|$|E

Briefly, after the drainage of associated collections, the insertion of a self-expandable esophageal stent across the leakage region enables diversion of the esophageal contents from the wound cavity. When the stent allows <b>water-tightness,</b> the leak closes by second intention. Some weeks later, the stent is removed. The global sealing rate and clinical success reaches 79 % and 76 %, respectively, in pooled data analysis of available published cohorts. Reported mortality is approximately 11 %.

40|$|Cracking is a {{major concern}} in {{building}} applications. Cracks may arise from shrinkage, freeze/thawing and/or structural stresses, amongst others. Several solutions can be found but superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) seem to be interesting to counteract these problems.

The swelling upon water ingress may seal a crack from intruding fluids and may regain the overall <b>water-tightness.</b> The latter water may promote autogenous healing. The use of superabsorbent polymers is thus very interesting.

40|$|The {{influence}} of discrete and randomly distributed polyester (PET) fibers {{in improving the}} crack resistance and <b>water-tightness</b> of clay barriers was studied by conducting a series of centrifuge model tests at 40 gravities using a large beam centrifuge available at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. Model clay barriers with and without fibers were subjected to flexural distress by inducing differential settlements using a settlement simulator. Two types of clay barriers were prepared by using {{two different types of}} soil, namely bentonite amended silty soil (Soil A) and kaolin clay-sand mixture (Soil B). Digital image cross-correlation (DIC) technique was used for analyzing the images captured by a digital photo camera and a charged couple device (CCD) camera, mounted along with the model. Unreinforced soil barriers (URSB) were found to lose their <b>water-tightness</b> and integrity at relatively lower distortion levels compared to identical fiber reinforced soil barriers (FRSB). Also, the performance of URSB and FRSB was found to be superior for Soil A compared to Soil B. The capability of PET fibers on preservation of existing unreinforced soil barriers was also demonstrated. The strain at crack initiation, epsilon(c), for FRSB is 2. 90 and 2. 36 times higher than identical URSB for Soil A and Soil B, respectively. Similarly, the strain at the onset of water breakthrough, epsilon(b), for FRSB is 2. 14 and 2. 79 times higher than identical URSB for Soil A and Soil B, respectively. There is a significant {{influence of}} fiber inclusion in retarding the crack initiation and water breakthrough at the onset of flexural distress for both the soil types. Thus, FRSB can withstand more distortion and strain while maintaining the integrity of the clay barrier. This observed behaviour of restraining cracks and improved performance of FRSB is primarily due to the reinforcement effect achieved due to soil-fiber interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|International audienceThe {{healing of}} cracks plays an {{important}} role with regard to the air- and <b>water-tightness</b> of concrete structures and the durability of cement based materials in general. This paper aims at further characterization and better comprehension of the healing phenomenon induced by the precipitation of calcite in localized cracks. The experimental program consisted in generating a localized crack in a cement paste or concrete specimen and healing the crack created by percolation tests with carbonated water or gas (CO 2 -air mixture). For tests with liquid, results show that the healing process depends on physical parameters like crack width, pressure gradient and carbonate content in the percolating fluid. For tests with gas, the supply of the crack with Ca 2 + ions to form calcite depends on the moisture transport mode on the crack edges, conditioned by the relative humidity of the percolating gas mixture. A simplified model of the leakage rate evolution is proposed. It provides indications concerning the effect of each test parameter on the healing process and allows the experimental results to be reproduced. Application of the model to other tests from the literature shows its limits and gives guidance for future investigations...|$|E

To evaluate the likelihood of pressure equalization for a generic wall assembly during rain events an experimental setup was fabricated and subjected to a sinusoidal pressure loading with varying test parameters. A semi-implicit numerical model was developed and thereafter validated against the results for dry condi-tions. Results derived from simulations of pressure equalization under dry conditions may significantly overestimate the degree of pressure equalization of a wall assembly during rain events. In addition, the significance of pressure equalization in respect to fa-Ã§ade design was evaluated based on 6 case-studies. An analysis of several faÃ§ade components indicates that current construction practice and guidelines are inadequate to achieve good pressure equalization of these assemblies.

Pore water pressure interpretation is supported by the representation of the evolution of the measured seepage flows. The work shows that pore water pressure may differ strongly from the nominal distribution during the first stages of the dam's life, when, if nearly undrained conditions take place, pore water pressures are discontinuous {{as a result of their}} dependency on total stresses. Pore water pressure may also assume other than expected distributions after some decades of operation, this time as a result of suffusion phenomena induced by seepage processes within the dam embankment.
