60|$|I {{had not yet}} sat down, and I {{went first}} to see who it was. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door Madame Fosco confronted me with my {{handkerchief}} in her hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had an idea}} I {{should find}} her here <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door," [...] he answered. [...] "You were {{standing}} in the shadow. It seemed to be just what I had expected." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Easy," [...] commented Billy, relieved. [...] "Get {{ready to}} beat it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door. <b>I</b> got a pony south o' town that'll {{have to carry}} double for a little way tonight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But s'pose,' said Joey, after a glassy look at {{his future}} {{appearance}} in the position alluded to, 'that any of your gentle-people come to see ye, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> door and lets 'em in a swinging big lodger stalks downstairs. What will 'em think? Up will go their eye-glasses at one another till they glares each other into holes. My gracious!' ...|$|R
60|$|Whenever I {{leave the}} room to go to bed, I look back, and there is my brother sitting in the chair. And then I cannot sleep because of {{thinking}} of him sitting through all the long night-hours. And in <b>the</b> morning, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> study door, there he is, and I know he has sat there the night long.|$|R
6000|$|Minna left us, {{with her}} {{pretty little head}} carried high in the air. [...] "Mrs. Wagner is a person entirely without sentiment!" [...] she indignantly whispered to me in passing, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door for her.|$|E
60|$|I {{think it}} did good. Anyhow, after {{that he used to}} grin <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door, instead of {{greeting}} me as formerly with a face the picture of despair. But to return to our inexperienced friend.|$|E
6000|$|She was not mistaken, for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door a {{neighbor}} said, [...] "I've brought you Mrs. Fletcher. Met her walking to Fairmead across the prairie. No; I guess I'm in a hurry, and won't get down." ...|$|E
60|$|MAN (coolly, but attentively). Never mind: {{this sort}} of thing is all in my day's work. I'm bound to take my chance. (Decisively.) Now do what I tell you. Put out the candles, so that they shan't see <b>the</b> light <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> shutters. And keep away from the window, {{whatever}} you do. If they see me, they're sure to have a shot at me.|$|R
60|$|I {{could hardly}} believe that. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> had <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> office and swept it {{everything}} appeared all right.|$|R
500|$|Tarantino {{attempted}} to cast both Kal Penn and Sylvester Stallone in Death Proof, but both {{were unable to}} work due to prior commitments. In an interview, Tarantino revealed {{that he decided to}} cast Kurt Russell as the killer stunt driver because [...] "for people of my generation, he's a true hero...but now, there's a whole audience out there that doesn't know what Kurt Russell can do. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> newspaper and see an ad that says 'Kurt Russell in Dreamer,' or 'Kurt Russell in Miracle,' I'm not disparaging these movies, but I'm thinking: When is Kurt Russell going to be a badass again?" ...|$|R
60|$|Fortune {{once again}} favored {{me by the}} {{slightest}} of margins, for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door in the prospector's outer jacket I saw that we had missed coming up through {{the bottom of an}} ocean by but a few hundred yards.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't take you, sir, if you're {{not going}} towards Tottenham Court Road," [...] said the driver civilly, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> cab door. [...] "My horse is dead beat, and I can't get him {{no further than}} the stable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am, quite sure," [...] she returned, indignant {{at having}} her sacred word doubted. [...] "He {{was with her}} on the steps <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door, and shook hands with her just like an old friend when he went away; and she was quite dry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{next morning}} I {{was back on}} time. 'Well, Mr. Riddle,' says <b>I,</b> <b>when</b> he <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> bedroom door, 'and how is uncle this morning?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Tarantino {{attempted}} to cast John Travolta, Willem Dafoe, John Malkovich, Mickey Rourke, Ron Perlman, Bruce Willis, Kal Penn and Sylvester Stallone in Death Proof, but none {{were able to}} work due to prior commitments. In an interview, Tarantino revealed that he cast Kurt Russell as the killer stunt driver because [...] "for people of my generation, he's a true hero…but now, there's a whole audience out there that doesn't know what Kurt Russell can do. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> newspaper and see an ad that says 'Kurt Russell in Dreamer,' or 'Kurt Russell in Miracle,' I'm not disparaging these movies, but I'm thinking: When is Kurt Russell {{going to be a}} badass again?” Eli Roth, Planet Terror leading actress Rose McGowan, and Tarantino himself appear in the film. Roth flew in from Europe, where he was filming , to film his scenes, which took one day.|$|R
40|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> {{checked my}} e-mail that day, one address (avi@thebard. com) caught my eye, though I didn 2 ̆ 7 t grasp its {{significance}} right away. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> it, <b>the</b> message just said 2 ̆ 2 Twelfth Night, Act I, Scene V, Clown 2 ̆ 7 s 13 th speech, 2 nd sentence 2 ̆ 2. I quickly pulled {{a copy of}} Shakespeare from the shelf and checked the reference, to find the admonishment...|$|R
60|$|It {{was just}} getting dark when there came a ring at the gate-bell, and afore I could answer it arf-a-dozen more, {{as fast as the}} bell could go. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> wicket Sam Small and Ginger and Peter Russet all tried to get in at once.|$|E
60|$|It came at last, {{a lovely}} {{morning with a}} {{beautiful}} sunrise; and that woman sitting up wide awake, waiting to foller me 'ome. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> gate at six o'clock she was there with the mate and the skipper, waiting, and when I left at five minutes past she was trotting along beside me.|$|E
60|$|I {{said not}} a word, {{hoping that the}} unlooked-for sight of Owen would break down her resolution. I just held out my hand to her, and led her downstairs. She clung to me and her hands were as cold as snow. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> parlor door I stood back, and pushed her in before me.|$|E
60|$|And {{then the}} spikes did their work. Happily {{the end was}} quick, for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{wrenched}} <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door they had pierced so deep that they had locked in {{the bones of the}} skull through which they had crushed, and actually tore him--it--out of his iron prison till, bound as he was, he fell at full length with a sickly thud upon the floor, the face turning upward as he fell.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, but he {{was trying}} to get in," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "When I woke up {{he was trying to}} put a key in the lock. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> started to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door, thinking it might be dad, the fellow ran away." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{this island}} {{are also found}} certain trees, the leaves of which, when they fall, are animated, and walk. They are like {{the leaves of the}} {{mulberry}} tree, but not so long; they have the leaf stalk short and pointed, and near the leaf stalk they have on each side two feet. If they are touched they escape, but if crushed they do not give out blood. I kept one for nine days in a box. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> it <b>the</b> leaf went round the box. I believe they live upon air.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> {{gate and}} see the {{landlord}} of the Bear's Head standing there I turned quite dizzy, {{and there was a}} noise in my ears like the roaring of the sea. I should think I stood there for a couple o' minutes without being able to say a word. I could think of 'em.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. 'Twas a dark dawn," [...] said Mrs. Oliver. [...] "Even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door, so late as I was, you couldn't {{have told}} poor men from gentlemen, or John from a reasonable-sized object. And I don't think maister's slept at all well to-night. He's anxious about his daughter; and I {{know what that}} is, for I've cried bucketfuls for my own." ...|$|E
60|$|I hesitated, {{fearing that}} my {{presence}} {{might be considered}} an intrusion. I attempted to represent this to her ladyship, but she was deaf to me. She held my arm fast enough to force me to go downstairs with her, and she still clung to me with all the little strength she had at the moment <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> dining-room door.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did my best, {{honestly}} did my best, {{to profit}} by the suggestions that were offered to me--not because I {{believed in the}} wisdom of my friends, but because I dreaded the effect of self-imposed solitude on my nature. Since the fatal day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> sealed packet, <b>I</b> was on my guard against the inherited evil lying dormant, for all I knew to the contrary, in my father's son. Impelled by that horrid dread, I suffered my daily martyrdom with a courage that astonishes me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> think of it now.|$|R
5000|$|Barry {{teamed up}} with lyricist Don Black and wrote [...] "Thunderball" [...] in a rush. Tom Jones, who sang the new theme song, fainted in the {{recording}} booth after singing the songs final, high note. Jones said of the final note, [...] "I {{closed my eyes and}} I held the note for so long <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> my eyes <b>the</b> room was spinning." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had evidently}} {{forgotten}} all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of. I don't like this lapsing into forgetfulness. It may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must not ask him, for fear I shall {{do more harm than}} good, but I must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, <b>I</b> fear, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> must <b>open</b> <b>the</b> parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will, I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.|$|R
60|$|I {{think that}} our arrival at Number 4, Earl's Crescent, created quite as much {{sensation}} as I had anticipated. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door of the large, barely-furnished room, which we called our workshop, Arthur sprang from the table on {{which he had been}} lounging, and Mabane, who was still working, dropped his brush in sheer amazement. I turned towards the girl.|$|E
60|$|It was {{ten o'clock}} afore I heard the bell go, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> wicket {{and looked out}} I was {{surprised}} to see that she 'ad got the skipper with 'er. And of all the miserable-looking objects I ever saw in my life he was the worst. She 'ad him tight by the arm, and there was a look on 'er face that a'most scared me.|$|E
6000|$|Arthur sighed quietly. 'No,' he answered, with {{a curious}} {{look at the}} Progenitor; 'you were engaged <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door, and I didn't like to disturb you. You were--you were {{speaking}} with poor little Mrs. Le Breton. But I'm so much obliged to you for your kindness to them, Lady Hilda; so very much obliged to you for your great kindness to them.' ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} I grew faint and shut my eyes. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> them again, <b>the</b> Prince had gone. Six more days went by before I {{was allowed to}} leave my bed, and during this time I saw much of Merapi. She was very sad and lived in fear of being killed by the Hebrews. Also she was troubled in her heart because {{she thought she had}} betrayed her faith and people.|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAREST FRIEND,--Your letter {{yesterday}} did {{me so much}} good, {{and though}} I answered it at once, yet here I am again. A kind woman {{from the other side}} has sent me the loveliest group of drooping and very tender ferns, soft as of some velvet belonging to the fairies, and of the most exquisite green, and primroses, and a slender stalked white flower, and so arranged, that they continually remind me of that enchanting group of yours in Vol. 3, which you said I might cut out. What would you have thought of me if I had? Oh, that you would and could sketch this group--or even that your eye could rest upon it! Now you will laugh if I ask you whether harpies[49] ever increase in number? or whether they are only the [...] "old original." [...] They quite torment me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> window, and blow chaff at me. I suppose at this moment, dearest Joanie is steaming away to Liverpool; one always wants to know now whether people accomplish a journey safely. When the blackbirds come for soaked bread, they generally eat a nice little lot themselves, before carrying any away from the window for their little ones; but Bobbie, [...] "our little English Robin," [...] has just been twice, took none for himself, but carries beak-load after beak-load for his speckled infants. How curious the universal love of bread is; so many things like and eat it--even flies and snails! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> {{shall have}} <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> second scene of his peculation, {{and his new}} {{principles}} of it, {{when you see him}} either treading in old corruptions, and excelling the examples he imitated, or exhibiting new ones of his own, in which of the two his conduct is the most iniquitous, and attended with most evil to the Company, I must leave your Lordships to judge.|$|R
