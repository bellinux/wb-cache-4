40|$|In Chapter 1 ，I {{introduce}} the viewpoint {{and the purpose}} of this study. This is a study of the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration system which is really the substance of labor management in modern enterprise. In this paper. <b>Wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system is taken up as the central problem domain from the viewpoint of business management. And then this study' s purpose is to consider that <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system based on the seniority-oriented system should be corrected for what kind of it in the times of aging of population composition, internationalization of labor movement, and the computerization in our country. Moreover. it considers about the rule by which <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary,</b> <b>and</b> the principles of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration which are not established as yet in Japanese enterprise. Chapter 2 is the preceding chapter before the main subject. The <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system which is the central problem domain of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration system is surrounded by various laws, theories <b>and</b> influences on <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration. I considered the surrounding four positions. The first is the legal theory on subjects of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> (labor standard law of our country, collective agreement and office regulations of enterprise of our country). The second is the theory of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> as economic theory (the wage fund theory, the marginal productivity theory and the labor value theory). The third is the social theory of the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> as the factor which should be taken into consideration in the case of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> determination (the market rate, the laborer' s living expenses level, change of prices, labor productivity, the ability of enterprise to pay) Finally，it is the business management theory of the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary.</b> Although such theory and influence are not the direct requirements for the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration or <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system, it's effect is never small Therein is clarified the basic meaning of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary,</b> the positioning <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration in labor management，and the domain of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration. That is to say, the article about <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> is taken up from five laws, including the labor standard law of our country. And then，it is clarified that <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> is the compensation of labor between laborer <b>and</b> employer. <b>Wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration is positioned with one basic domain of labor management that is divided to seven domains of labor management (Employment Management, Educational Training and Capability Development Management. Working Environmental Management. <b>Wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Salary</b> Administration， Health <b>and</b> Welfare Management, Management of Human Relations，Management of lndustrial Relations). Also, the main domain of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration is divided into two <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system <b>and</b> the amount of money for <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary.</b> These two points are occupying the important positions in this study. In Chapter 3, I discussed the trend of the actuality in the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration system in enterprise of our country. The first <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system in our country is a Den-san type wage structure, this wage structure had the deep color of living wages. Next. the seniority-oriented <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system appeared around from 1960, subsequently, job performance abilities evaluation wage rate system appear around from 1975. But the color of living <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> seniority-oriented <b>wages</b> remained in this <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system. However, in our country, aging of population composition and internationalization of labor movement progress around from 1980. It becomes increase of personnel expenses (labor cost) and it becomes the big burden of business management in enterprise. Moreover, in the times of the computerization which spreads quickly, the correspondence to change of the job contents is needed by business management in enterprise. In this way， adoption of a new <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system come to be seen in after 1990. Here, I touch the annual <b>salary</b> system <b>and</b> profit or added value sharing plan that draws public attention as new <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system. It is decided how the result (profit or added value) is shared among both based on recognition as the result of collaboration of laborer and employer (Profit Sharing Plan, Rucker Plan, Scanlon Plan, American Mortor's Plan, Kaiser Plan). The annual salary plan is the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system that is adopted as the managerial position of the company of our country on the pretext of restructuring in after 1990. This plan can say it is correction of the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system from living serious-consideration wages to job serious-consideration wages. Also，this plan has the strong character of reward, <b>and</b> the <b>wage</b> rate in this plan, can be called single job rate. Therefore, it is necessary for us to give feed back on job evaluation research. By the way, the seniority-oriented system and the custom of lifelong things completely, but however, have a close relation in fact. Merely，the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system does not give any answer about the amount of money for <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary.</b> Therefore another principle is required. When the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary,</b> the separate principle is necessary. That is to say, the purpose of business management is the upkeep and the development of enterprise, and improvement in the laborer' s living standard. What business management should think important is two subjects of cost (labor cost) and laborer' s life (living expenses). From here, business management does not use mind only for the cost reduction, but should adopt “the laborer' s living standard" as the separate principle for the determination of the amount of money. Moreover，I {{introduce the}} principles of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration which should be thought important. In case the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> salary，it is very important. That is, conditions on the side of business management is the requirement of management. nature and objective of the organization, integration in administration. And conditions on the side of labor is satisfy the public interest, locality requirement, and reactions of the labor union. These principles are advocated by Prof. Y. Shimabukuro as basic theory of “Consensus Management". This “Consensus Management" is the important principle in that the determination of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> should be reached by consensus among both laborer and employer. These six principles of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration must be taken notice of as what functions on the “consensus" formation among business management and laborer. In addition，the incentive nature of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> <b>and</b> the dissatisfied concentration nature of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> are taken up as important matters in enforcement of the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration system. Chapter 6 is conclusions of what so far has been described. That is to say <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system which is main content of the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration system in the modern enterprises has been studied center in this paper. First, as a direction of the ecdysis by aging and internationalization from the seniority-oriented <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system, it was asserted that the correction to job evaluation wage rate system was concretely appropriate to the work(job) center <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system. Secondly， the adoption of the Paterson method (the job evaluation method) is asserted as the correspondence to change of the job contents by the computerization. Thirdly, when the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system is combined with actual amount of money, the principle to be emphasized is no except for “living standard of the worker". Therefore, it should be sufficiently regarded on this principle in the business administration side. And, I would advocate that it should be equal agreement determination by the “consensus" formation among business management and laborers on the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration system. まえがき　Abstract　基本用語　第 1 章 序　第 2 章 賃金管理に影響を与える理論 第 1 節 賃金管理といくつかの立場 第 2 節 賃金問題に関する理論 第 1 項 賃金の法律理論(賃金問題への法の介入) 第 2 項 賃金の経済理論(労働市場における賃金水準の存在) 第 3 項 賃金の社会理論(賃金決定の際に考慮されるべき要因) 第 4 項 賃金の経営理論(労務管理の実体としての賃金管理) 第 3 節 賃金管理と賃金支払制度 第 3 章 我国企業の賃金管理制度における現実の動向 第 1 節 年功序列型賃金支払制度からの脱却 第 2 節 我国企業における新しい賃金支払制度の採用 第 1 項 成果分配制度 〈成果分配制度導入企業の実例〉 第 2 項 年俸制 〈年俸制導入企業の実例〉 第 3 節 職務給制度採用の妥当性 第 1 項 高齢化・国際化が要請する年功序列型賃金支払制度からの脱皮の試み 第 2 項 職務評価と職務給制度 第 4 章 賃金支払制度と職務給制度 第 1 節 賃金問題と賃金支払制度 第 2 節 賃金支払制度の形態 第 3 節 職務給制度の発展 第 1 項 職務給制度の前身としての計測日給制度 第 2 項 職務給制度と労働能力 第 3 項 職務給制度における賃金体系 第 4 項 賃金規程の実例および職務給制度導入企業の実例 第 4 節 “意思決定"要素による職務評価(バターソン法) 第 1 項 評価要素および評価尺度 第 2 項 職務評価手続き 第 3 項 パターソン法による職務評価の事例(化学工業会社の場合) 第 4 項 パターソン法についてのまとめ 第 5 章 賃金支払制度と賃金額 第 1 節 賃金支払制度の賃金額への結合 第 2 節 賃金管理の原理 第 3 節 賃金管理制度の実施における留意点 第 1 項 賃金の刺激性 第 2 項 賃金とその不満集約性 第 6 章 結 ※注釈 ※参考文献 ※資料①～...|$|R

The right tail of the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> income distribution is the distribution of earners over large <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> incomes. See figure 1. The metaphor of regenerating a tail that has been cut off suggests the name of this paper’s model: the Salamander. The model is in need of a name more compact than “a mixture of gamma probability density functions (pdfs) with parameters quite restricted in a particular way”. The U. S.

Employee compensation includes the <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>salaries</b> paid to anyone whose income is subject to income tax withholding. Since <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>salaries</b> affect more individuals and families directly than the other sources of income, it has by far the largest value.|$|R
30|$|When {{researchers}} estimate formal-informal {{wage differentials}} separately for informal sector employees and self-employed workers, they typically find different {{results for the}} two groups. Compared to formal sector <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> employees, Arias <b>and</b> Khamis (2009) find an earnings penalty for informal <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> employees but an earnings premium for self-employed workers in Argentina. Nguyen et al. (2013) find the same result in Vietnam. Using quantile regressions, Nguyen et al. (2013) further find that both informal employees and the self-employed are likely to face an earnings penalty {{at the bottom of}} the earnings distribution and an earnings premium at the top. In Peru, Saavedra and Chong (1999) find an earnings penalty for informal sector employees, but no difference between the wages of informal self-employed workers and formal sector employees. Maloney (1999) finds that workers who transition from <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> employment into self-employment in Mexico benefit from higher earnings, while workers who transition into informal sector <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> employment experience a decline in earnings.|$|R

50|$|Most {{progressive}} tax {{systems are not}} adjusted for inflation. As <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>salaries</b> rise in nominal terms {{under the influence of}} inflation they become more highly taxed, even though in real terms the value of the <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>salaries</b> has not increased at all. The net effect is that in real terms taxes rise unless the tax rates or brackets are adjusted to compensate.|$|R
