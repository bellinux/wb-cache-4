Doc is unhappy, and Hazel decides {{something has to be done}} ("Thinkin' "). He is unable to come up <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> and eventually forgets the question. Some weeks pass, and Joe the Mexican woos Suzy. He has no success, and his attempts irritate Doc. The next day, Doc himself approaches the pipe with flowers in hand ("How Long?"), still uncertain as to why he is seeking a girl like Suzy. Suzy lets him in the boiler, which she has fitted up in a homelike manner. She is doing well at the burger joint, but is grateful to Fauna for giving her confidence. She is confident enough, indeed, to reject Doc, who is unhappy, but philosophical ("The Next Time It Happens").|$|E
25|$|Examining Kuhn's use of {{the word}} {{solution}} more closely, Stove notes that Kuhn sometimes uses it in the ordinary way regarding practical knowledge, but at other times in a weaker sense, specific to Kuhn's theory, that a solution is relative to a paradigm, people, place and time. This equivocation on solution actually provides Stove <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> of exactly the type he was looking for. All his authors, with many similar words, show similar equivocation. Stove lists knowledge, discovery, facts, verified, understanding, explanation and notes the list is far from complete. Idiosyncratic weak senses of these words are a characteristic of the writing of his subjects that explains clearly how a reader, presuming ordinary use of language, might believe them to be expressing something more orthodox than is, in fact, their intention.|$|E
500|$|Bo Diddley {{modified}} the song's signature riff for his March 1955 song [...] "I'm a Man". He reworked it as a four-note figure, which is repeated {{for the entire}} song without a progression to other chords. [...] Music critic and writer Cub Koda calls it [...] "the most recognizable blues lick in the world". [...] Waters, not to be outdone, responded two months later <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> song to [...] "I'm a Man", titled [...] "Mannish Boy". [...] "Bo Diddley, he was tracking me down with my beat when he made 'I'm a Man'. [...] That's from 'Hoochie Coochie Man.' [...] Then I got on it with 'Mannish Boy' and just drove him out of my way", Waters recalled. [...] Emphasizing the origin of Bo Diddley's song, Waters sticks to the original first eight-bar phrase from [...] "Hoochie Coochie Man" [...] and includes some of the hoodoo references.|$|E

She also sent a first French mission to Suleiman the Magnificent requesting assistance, but the mission was lost on its way in Bosnia. In December 1525 a second mission was sent, led by John Frangipani, which managed to reach Constantinople, the Ottoman capital, with secret letters asking for the deliverance of king Francis I and {{an attack on the}} Habsburg. Frangipani returned <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> from Suleiman, on 6 February 1526, initiating the first steps of a Franco-Ottoman alliance. [...] Suleiman eventually wrote an ultimatum to Charles, asking for the immediate release of Francis—and demanding a yearly tax from the Holy Roman Empire; when this was not forthcoming, the Ottomans launched an invasion of Hungary in the summer of 1526, aiming to reach Vienna.|$|E
500|$|Asser's {{response}} to Alfred's request {{was to ask}} for time to consider the offer, as he felt {{it would be unfair}} to abandon his current position in favour of worldly recognition. Alfred agreed but also suggested that he should spend half his time at St David's and half with Alfred. Asser again asked for time to consider, but ultimately agreed to return to Alfred <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> in six months. On his return to Wales, however, Asser fell ill with a fever and was confined to the monastery of Caerwent for twelve months and a week. Alfred wrote to find out the cause of the delay, and Asser responded that he would keep his promise when he recovered. When he did recover, in 886, he agreed to divide his time between Wales and Alfred's court, as Alfred had suggested. Others at St David's supported this, since they hoped Asser's influence with Alfred would avoid [...] "damaging afflictions and injuries at the hands of King Hyfaidd (who often assaulted that monastery and the jurisdiction of St David)".|$|E
500|$|J. C. Jenkins, who interprets Pepper {{as making}} {{the jobs of}} {{parliamentary}} draftsmen much easier in some ways, also foresees it as making the job more difficult. Because of the added resources courts can draw on, there is now increased pressure to produce statutes which will not be interpreted in the wrong way. Departments sponsoring legislation normally prepare briefings for their ministers when talking in Parliament; draftsmen may now be expected to vet these, a time-consuming process. The draftsmen may also {{have to look at}} material produced by these departments other than the statutes, as it may be discussed in court; in Pepper, Lord Browne-Wilkinson considered a press release produced by the Inland Revenue. The decision also changes parliamentary practice. Under previous practice, if a minister was asked a question publicly and could not immediately reply <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> or publicly made a statement that later turned out to be incorrect, he would privately write a letter explaining or correcting himself. As a result of Pepper, such private replies may have to be made publicly. In addition, Members of Parliament are more aware that their statements, and those statements they induct Ministers to make, may be looked at by the courts. As a result, these statements and inducements may be structured differently, and MPs may be more concerned that their issues be dealt with [...] "at length and on the record", making parliamentary proceedings [...] "more formal, more cluttered, and more protracted".|$|E

500|$|When Greenfield {{was asked}} a {{difficult}} question in the legislature, he often leaned over to Brownlee, his seatmate, who supplied him <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> {{in full view of}} the legislature. Many UFA members found this practice humiliating. [...] Brownlee's importance to the government in the legislature was illustrated by an incident in 1922. Brownlee was on vacation in Victoria during a special sitting of the legislature. While his presence was usually considered crucial, the only item of business scheduled for the session was uncontroversial, and passed by a large margin. However, once this item was dispensed with, some members complained that the C$100 payment that they were to receive for the special session was too low. Greenfield brought a motion to double it; the amount was increased to $250 in committee. At a time when many farmers earned less than $250 per year, the move cost the UFA dearly in the eyes of its supporters. [...] Many UFA MLAs privately suggested that the incident would have been avoided had Brownlee been present. [...] On another occasion, in 1924, Brownlee was absent from the legislature due to illness. Boyle called him to assure him that he could rest easy, since the Liberals would not raise any difficult issues in his absence. While Brownlee appreciated the gesture, all involved recognized it as an admission that the government was helpless in the legislature without its strongman.|$|E

Dimineața daily, which had anti-German and pro-Entente sentiments, reported with pleasure that the Germans could not convince Fleva to take over as Searas editorial manager; its claims were partly backed by Fleva's own note, published in Dreptatea (November–December 1914). Fleva reportedly received such offers from two German propagandists, Hilmar von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen and Josef B. Brociner.

At this time the opposing dikir barat group’s tukang karut must reply <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> more clever than the original question, and after the second awok-awok sings it back, the first tukang karut must take the dialogue another step higher.

2500|$|No responsa {{are known}} to exist from before the Mishnah (200 CE); it is {{doubtful}} whether any were written before this period. A tradition held that no halakha (law) should be written down (see Oral Torah). Even when reluctance to write down rulings became obsolete, letters of a legal nature might be written only in cases where laws might likewise be reduced to writing. While the rule prevailed that no laws should be written, no communications of legal content were made by means of letters. Questions were usually communicated orally, or proposed to the academy by a teacher, who transmitted the answer and decision by word of mouth. The rarity of letters on legal problems in the Tannaitic era (the period the Mishnah covers) may be seen from a passage in the Tosefta (Ter. ii. 13 [...] ), which states that Rabbi Gamliel secretly dispatched a messenger <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> to a question; for if he desired to keep his decision secret, he would probably have sent a letter had such replies been customary at that time.|$|E
