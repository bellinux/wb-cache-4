Despite routine use for nearly forty years uncertainty remains regarding the most appropriate PZA dosage for children. In view of this uncertainty literature relating to the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of PZA in children treated for tuberculosis and in adult volunteers and patients was reviewed. Making use of the PZA maximum concentration (Cmax) following various PZA dosages in different groups straight line regression of concentration on dosage was fitted through the origin by least squares and weighted for the numbers of subjects.

Since ACTD is known to affect transcription of DNA within hours of administration, the first decrease may have reflected the effect of ACTD on the synthesis of enzyme mRNA. The lowest dosage, 0. 05 μg/g, said to affect the synthesis of rRNA only, gave decreased enzymatic activities from 1 - 3 days after injection, suggesting that rRNA synthesis was involved, primarily. There were variable effects of ACTD on the enzymatic levels of regenerating pancreas after ethionine. When given for a single day early in the regeneration period, the injection of the 0. 5 μg/g dosage, believed to affect both mRNA and rRNA synthesis, decreased considerably the levels of enzymatic activity on the fifth day of regeneration. Injection on multiple day early in regeneration, however, gave a paradoxic effect—higher levels than control values. The lowest dosage, 0. 05 μg/g, affecting primarily rRNA, caused, even with multiple doses, a considerable decrease of enzymatic values to well below control levels. The paradoxic effect of the higher concentration of ACTD when given on multiple days may have been related to a decreased synthesis of the repressor of the mRNA for the enzyme, thereby making more mRNA available for synthesis of the enzyme...|$|R

Forty one acutely manic andd 76 epileptic patients entered thispprospective study. CBZ apparent oral clearance (CL/F) values were calculated in both groups and were compared with each other. CBZ clearance is affected by different factors such as age, body <b>weight,</b> <b>dosage</b> and the use of concurrent medications. However, since these factors were similar between the two groups, our results could not be affected by these confounding factors. Comparison between epileptic and manic patients showed that CL/F values in acutely manic patients were significantly higher than epileptic patients (0. 128 ± 0. 016 vs. 0. 112 ± 0. 0147 L/hr/kg, p< 0. 0001). As a result, acutely manic patients require more CBZ dosages to achieve serum concentrations comparable with those found in epileptic patients. Increased CBZ clearance in acutely manic patients may be related to increase of catecholamine and sympathetic activity in these patients. This results in increased hepatic blood flow which may affect the hepatic clearance of drug. Besides, due to the abnormalities in membrane transport of acutely manic patients, it may be suggested that cellular uptake of the drug and its volume of distribution may be affected. Since our study is a preliminary investigation in this field, further detailed pharmacokinetic study in acutely manic patients are warranted to confirm results of this study...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Cystic {{fibrosis}} is {{a common}} recessive disorder primarily affecting the lungs and often resulting in pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tobramycin is currently used to prevent the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, it has a narrow therapeutic index and requires extensive monitoring. The {{aim of this study}} was to review the current practice in administration and monitoring of once daily tobramycin in paediatric cystic fibrosis patients at Birmingham Children’s Hospital (BCH). Materials & Methods Design: Analysis of forty-nine once daily tobramycin courses in fifteen patients (five male; ten female) during 2010. Setting: Birmingham Children’s Hospital, UK. Main outcome measures: Patient height and <b>weight,</b> <b>dosage</b> and time of administration, drug plasma levels, urea and electrolyte levels. Results: Once daily tobramycin was administered at a mean dose of 9. 94 mg/kg (n = 49, range 8. 8 – 11. 0 mg/kg) which is consistent with current BCH guidelines. At least one trough level was observed for every course (mean = 1. 33; n = 49). Trough levels greater than 1 mg/L were found in 17 % (n = 11 / 65) of samples. Tobramycin was administered between 15 : 00 and 21 : 00 in 75 % (n = 30 / 40) of courses, with a further 23 % (n = 9 / 40) of courses being administered after 21 : 00. Only 39 % (n = 19 / 49) of courses had urea and electrolyte levels monitored conflicting with current practice elsewhere in the UK. Furthermore, no patients underwent any routine monitoring for ototoxicity. Discussions, Conclusion: The use and associated monitoring of once daily tobramycin varies within the UK. Current practice at BCH with regard to the dosing of once daily tobramycin and the timing of the first trough level are consistent with available guidelines. However an increase in the frequency of renal monitoring is recommended considering national practice as urea and creatinine levels should be taken at least once within a fourteen day course. Furthermore, a proportion of courses were administered after 21 : 00 which, due to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, may result in an increased risk of toxic effects.

40|$|Background: The in vivo {{recovery}} of recombinant factor IX (rFIX) {{is reported to}} be lower than that of plasma-derived products, with potential clinical implications for dosing. In clinical practice, a conversion (augmentation) factor is suggested to calculate the necessary doses of rFIX. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the range of values for the conversion factor in usual clinical practice in Italy. Materials and methods: The study was questionnaire-based and proposed to all Italian Haemophilia centres treating patients with haemophilia B. Age, <b>weight,</b> <b>dosage</b> used in the last effective infusion, treatment regimen (prophylaxis versus on-demand), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) status, and years of previous therapy with rFIX were recorded for patients with severe haemophilia B treated with rFIX. Mean, standard deviation, median and range were calculated for demographic and treatment data for the overall population and for subgroups. The conversion factor for the theoretical dosage of 40 IU/Kg was calculated. Results: Among 207 patients with severe haemophilia B being followed in 24 centres, 138 (66. 7 %) were being treated with rFIX. The sample of 207 patients represents 83. 1 % of the population of Italian patients with severe haemophilia B. The age range of the studied patients was 0 - 72 years (mean, 24 years) and the weight range was 3 - 108 kg (mean, 60 kg). Nineteen patients (14. 4 %) were positive for HIV and 51 (42. 9 %) were positive for HCV. The mean dosage of rFIX was 44 IU/Kg, with no significant difference between those receiving the product as prophylaxis or on-demand. A reduction in dosage was observed with increasing age (0. 23 IU/kg/year). The mean value for the conversion factor was 1. 10 ± 0. 36 (median 1. 00, range 0. 51 - 2. 08), when estimated for the whole population. No effect of HIV and HCV status was found on the dose prescribed. No evident correlation was found with the underlying genetic mutation. Discussion: We found that dosing of rFIX in clinical practice is very close to that of plasmaderived FIX concentrates. As a consequence, dosing in the non-surgical setting should be started using the same criteria as those for plasma-derived FIX and treatment effectiveness verified on a clinical basis rather than relying on in vivo recovery assessments...|$|E

40|$|Objective(s) The {{purpose of}} this study was {{assessment}} of the influence of acute manic phase on the steady state pharmacokinetics of valproic acid (VPA) in bipolar patients in comparison with those of epileptic patients. Materials and Methods Ninteen acutely manic and 25 epileptic patients who fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria were entered in this prospective study. Blood samples were collected at trough time in steady state and plasma concentrations were determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). VPA apparent oral clearance (CL/F) values were calculated in each patient and were compared between groups. As VPA clearance is affected by different factors such as age, total body <b>weight,</b> VPA <b>dosage</b> and the use of concurrent medications, all of these confounding factors were made similar in both groups.

It {{is necessary to}} let clinicians know of {{the latest developments in}} this respect and the correct circumstances in which weight-based dosing is of clinical relevance. Methods: A literature search was conducted using PubMed. Results: Clinical indications, physiological factors, and types of medication may determine the applicability of weight-based dosing. In some cases, the weight effect may be minimal or the proper dosage can only be determined when weight is combined with other factors. Medications within similar therapeutic or structural class (eg, anticoagulants, antitumor necrosis factor medications, P 2 Y 12 -receptor antagonists, and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies) may exhibit differences in requirements on weight-based dosing. In some cases, weight-based dosing is superior to currently recommended fixed-dose regimen in adult patients (eg, hydrocortisone, vancomycin, linezolid, and aprotinin). On the contrary, fixed dosing is noninferior to or even better than currently recommended weight-based regimen in adult patients in some cases (eg, cyclosporine microemulsion, recombinant activated Factor VII, and epoetin α). Ideal body-weight-based dosing may be superior to the currently recommended total body-weight-based regimen (eg, atracurium and rocuronium). For dosing in pediatrics, whether weight-based dosing is better than body surface-area-based dosing is dependent on the particular medication (eg, methotrexate, prednisone, prednisolone, zidovudine, didanosine, growth hormone, and 13 -cis-retinoic acid). Age-based dosing {{strategy is}} better than weight-based dosing in some cases (eg, intravenous busulfan and dalteparin). Dosing guided by pharmacogenetic testing did not show pharmacoeconomic advantage over weight-adjusted dosing of 6 -mercaptopurine. The common viewpoint (ie, pediatric patients should be dosed on the basis of body weight) is not always correct. Effective weight-based dosing interventions include standardization of weight estimation, documentation and dosing determination, dosing chart, dosing protocol, order set, pharmacist participation, technological information, and educational measures. Conclusion: Although dosing methods are specified in prescribing information for each drug and there are no principal pros and cons to be elaborated, this review of weight-based dosing strategy will enrich the knowledge of medication administration from the perspectives of safety, efficacy, and pharmacoeconomics, and will also provide research opportunities in clinical practice. Clinicians should be familiar with dosage and administration of the medication to be prescribed as well as the latest developments.

40|$|Improving {{pediatric}} patient safety by preventing medication errors {{that may result}} in adverse drug events and consequent healthcare expenditure,is a worldwide challenge to healthcare. In pediatrics, reported medication error rates in general, and prescribing error rates in particular, vary between studies, depending on the definitions and study methods used, and the setting studied. This thesis focuses on prescribing errors in {{pediatric patient}}s {{and the use of}} electronic prescribing systems to prevent them. The nature, frequency and determinants of medication prescribing errors in pediatric inpatients were determined and the effect of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) and clinical decision support (CDS) on these errors were studied in the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital, Utrecht. Extra attention was paid to pediatric and neonatal intensive care unit (PICU and NICU) patients as these offer extra challenges due to their several complex health problems and multi-drug treatments. Approximately 1 % of electronic medication orders in the children’s hospital had to be intervened by the clinical pharmacy due to an error: about 80 % concerned a correction and about 20 % a completion. The majority of the corrections concerned a wrong dose or a wrong drug formulation. The majority of the completions concerned absent body <b>weight,</b> <b>dosage</b> form or strength/concentration of the prescribed drug. Free-text entry, the youngest of age and the oral dosage form and -route of administration were associated with prescribing errors. Focusing on the PICU, both handwritten and electronic medication orders were examined: 18 % contained administrative errors, 53 % omissions and 12 % dosing errors. Additionally, in almost 20 % of patients at least one potential drug-drug interaction (pDDI) was identified during PICU admission. Writing by hand, alterations in existing medication orders, intermittent dosing and ‘on demand use’ were identified as most important risk factors for prescribing errors. The effects of CPOE /CDS systems on medication prescribing errors, ADEs, and mortality in inpatient pediatric care and neonatal and pediatric intensive care settings were reviewed. Overall, CPOE/CDS systems clearly reduced medication prescribingerrors, if well-designed and -implemented. However, effect on clinically relevant outcomes could notbe demonstrated, possibly due to a limited set of outcome data restricted to pediatric and neonatal data. In an attempt to contribute to the evidence base, the effects of advanced CPOE/CDS for glucose control in NICU patients were studied, focusing on hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes (a clinically relevant outcome for this population) and prescribing time efficiency. The studied computerized prescribing and calculating CDS tool proved to preserve accuracy for calculation and control of glucose intake and decrease time needed to prescribe. To optimally prevent prescribing errors using CPOE/CDS in children, the systems need to be more advanced and better tailored to pediatric care, preferably based on clinical experience and scientific evidence. System requirements and design of an electronic prescribing system for PICU and NICU is presented, including testing of the underlying model. The developed system aims to be integrated, safe by default and efficient and has the potential to solve several of the main problems related to the medication process in such specific patients...|$|E

40|$|Injection of bimetal (Pd/Fe) {{nanoparticles}} was evidenced as {{a promising}} treatment to remediate trichloroethene (TCE) polluted groundwater. However, the particles usually aggregate rapidly {{and result in}} a very limited migration distance. This study employed poly acrylic acid (PAA) for the synthesis of stable bimetal nanoparticles (SBN) by selecting appropriate PAA molecular <b>weight</b> and <b>dosage</b> to reduce particle aggregation. In addition, this study elucidated the SBN stabilization mechanism by analyzing morphology and characteristics. The results of TCE dechlorination and SBN stabilization experiments indicate that the bimetal nanoparticles modified with PAA 250 K exhibit better reactivity and stability characteristics than did other such nanoparticles. The SBN bind chemically onto PAA 250 K via the carboxylic group and bidentate pattern bridging, which could provide both electrostatic and steric repulsion to prevent particle aggregation. Therefore, the SBN exhibited a higher dechlorination effect than did bare bimetal. The morphology of SBN shown in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images exhibits capsule-like and wire-like structures instead of a single particle dispersed in the slurry. The results of this work can preliminarily elucidate the SBN's morphology, dispersion, and size distribution. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
