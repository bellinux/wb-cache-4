They are almost always {{an important component of}} aquatic ecosystems, often acting as mesograzers. Most species in the suborder Gammaridea are epibenthic, although they are often collected in plankton samples. Members of the Hyperiidea are all planktonic and marine. Many are symbionts of gelatinous animals, including salps, medusae, siphonophores, colonial radiolarians and ctenophores, and most hyperiids are associated with gelatinous animals during some part of their life cycle. Some 1,900 species, or 20% of the total amphipod diversity, live in fresh water or other non-marine waters. Notably rich endemic amphipod faunas {{are found in}} the ancient Lake Baikal and waters of the Caspian Sea basin.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Street {{was very}} busy with his telegraphic matters--and {{considering}} {{that he had}} eight or nine hundred miles of rugged, snowy, uninhabited mountains, and waterless, treeless, melancholy deserts to traverse with his wire, it was natural and needful {{that he should be}} as busy as possible. He could not go comfortably along and cut his poles by the road-side, either, but they had to be hauled by ox teams across those exhausting deserts--and it was two days' journey from <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>water,</b> in one or two of them. Mr. Street's contract was a vast work, every way one looked at it; and yet to comprehend what the vague words [...] "eight hundred miles of rugged mountains and dismal deserts" [...] mean, one must go over the ground in person--pen and ink descriptions cannot convey the dreary reality to the reader. And after all, Mr. S.'s mightiest difficulty {{turned out to be one}} which he had never taken into the account at all. Unto Mormons he had sub-let the hardest and heaviest half of his great undertaking, and all of a sudden they concluded that they were going to make little or nothing, and so they tranquilly threw their poles overboard in mountain or desert, just as it happened when they took the notion, and drove home and went about their customary business! They were under written contract to Mr. Street, but they did not care anything for that. They said they would [...] "admire" [...] to see a [...] "Gentile" [...] force a Mormon to fulfil a losing contract in Utah! And they made themselves very merry over the matter. Street said--for it was he that told us these things: ...|$|E

[...] (Eccles. ii. 2-26). And then he gave himself to wine and revelling, and after that to riches, and pomp, and glory, and music, and the [...] "fine arts," [...] as we call them. [...] "I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits: I made me pools of <b>water,</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: I got me {{servants}} and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me: I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts. So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me." [...] And what was the end? [...] "Then I looked on all the works that my hand had done, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit, {{and there was no}} profit under the sun." [...] Therefore, he says, that he hated all the labour he had taken under the sun, because he must leave it to the men who came after him, and found out at last, after years of labour and sorrow, trying to make himself happy with this and that, and finding no rest with any of them, that the conclusion of the whole matter was to [...] "Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or evil" [...] (Eccles. xii. 13).|$|E

50|$|The lack {{of water}} {{resources}} management during the drought caused the water quality to become poor and contaminated.

The health risks were undeniable as people were beginning to drink contaminated water and falling ill with diseases such as kidney stones and E-coli.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{evaporative}} cooling (open circuit) {{is used to}} lower the temperature and increase the humidity of air by using latent heat of evaporation, changing liquid <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> vapor. In this process, the energy in the air does not change. Warm dry air is changed to cool moist air. The heat of the outside air is used to evaporate water. The RH increases to 70 to 90% which reduces the cooling effect of human perspiration. The moist air has to be continually released to outside or else the air becomes saturated and evaporation stops.|$|E

Outbreaks can be reduced by operating multiple independent systems with the same building and isolating <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> contact between systems by cleaning equipment and personnel that move between systems. Also {{the use of a}} Ultra Violet (UV) or ozone water treatment system reduces the number of free floating virus and bacteria in the system water. These treatment systems reduce the disease loading that occurs on stressed fish and thus reduce the chance of an outbreak.|$|E
50|$|An {{evaporative}} cooler (also swamp cooler, desert cooler and wet air cooler) is {{a device that}} cools air through the evaporation of water. Evaporative cooling differs from typical air conditioning systems, which use vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycles. Evaporative cooling works by exploiting water's large enthalpy of vaporization. The temperature of dry air can be dropped significantly through the phase transition of liquid <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> vapor (evaporation). This can cool air using much less energy than refrigeration. In extremely dry climates, evaporative cooling of air has {{the added benefit of}} conditioning the air with more moisture for the comfort of building occupants.|$|E
