40|$|First and {{foremost}} I thank my supervisor Thanasis Fokas. It {{has been a}} pleasure and a privilege to be his student. His energy and enthusiasm are infectious (and I hope his mathematical talent is too!). I was supported by an EPSRC studentship, I hope they are happy with their investment. George Dassios, Arieh Iserles and Stephen Cowley shared their knowledge and advice with me, both mathematical and non-mathematical, and I am very grateful. I thank the members of “the Fokas group”: Kostas Kalimeris, Anthony Ashton, Sheila Smitheman, Jonatan Lenells, Paolo Barbano, and in particular my office mates Michail Dimakos, Eleftherios Garyfallidis, and Dionyssios Mantzavinos. I have enjoyed all our interactions and adventures! I frequently burst into the offices of Chris Taylor, Alexander Frolkin, Darren Kenneally, and especially Ben Adcock, demanding answers left, right and centre {{and they had the}} patience to send me out each time a little more enlightened than when I came in. If this thesis, or any of my papers, is easy to read and understand then Marj Batchelor deserves much credit (if not, then I should have listened to her more). I thank my fellow students and colleagues in the ACA “super-group”. During my time in Cambridge the Applied and Computational Analysis community has become much more vibrant, and I hope this will continue. I thank my friends Claude Warnick, Kate Marvel, Clare Burrage, Chris Taylor, Toby <b>Wood,</b> Mark <b>Rosin</b> and John Fletcher, for good times in the central core, Cambridge and elsewhere. Many thanks are due to Alfredo Deaño and Mojo Rathbone for their last minute assistance the day before my submission deadline. I thank Graeme Spence and particularly Maxine von Eye for travelling with me on the rollercoaster rides of both my research and life in general. Finally I thank my parents: undertaking this PhD {{is the latest in a}} long list of opportu-nities that I would not have had without their many sacrifices on my behalf...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} types of rosin: gum rosin (from pine tree oleoresin), <b>wood</b> <b>rosin</b> (obtained by {{extraction}} of tree stumps), and tall oil rosin (obtained from tall oil, a byproduct of kraft paper process). Gum rosin has a milder odor and lower tendency to crystallize from solutions than <b>wood</b> <b>rosin,</b> and is therefore preferred for flux applications. Tall oil rosin finds increased use due to its higher thermal stability and therefore lower tendency to form insoluble thermal decomposition residues. The composition and quality of rosin differs by the tree type, and also by location and even by year. In Europe, rosin for fluxes is usually obtained from {{a specific type of}} Portuguese pine, in America a North Carolina variant is used.|$|E
5000|$|When {{pine trees}} are {{harvested}} [...] "the resinous portions of fallen or felled trees like longleaf and slash pines, when {{allowed to remain}} upon the ground, resist decay indefinitely." [...] This [...] "stump waste", {{through the use of}} destructive distillation or solvent processes, {{can be used to make}} products including rosin. This type of rosin is typically called <b>wood</b> <b>rosin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Glycerol ester of <b>wood</b> <b>rosin,</b> {{also known}} as glyceryl abietate or ester gum, is an {{oil-soluble}} food additive (E number E445). The food-grade material is used in foods, beverages, and cosmetics to keep oils in suspension in water. It is also used as an ingredient {{in the production of}} chewing-gum and ice cream. Similar, less pure materials (glycerol ester of gum rosin) are used as a component of certain low-cost adhesives.|$|E
5000|$|Because the {{turpentine}} {{and pine}} oil from destructive distillation [...] "become somewhat contaminated with other distillation products", solvent processes are commonly used. In this process, stumps and roots are chipped and soaked {{in the light}} end of the heavy naphtha fraction (boiling between 90 °C and 115 °C) from a crude oil refinery. Multi-stage counter-current extraction is commonly used so fresh naphtha first contacts wood leached in intermediate stages and naphtha laden with rosin from intermediate stages contacts unleached wood before vacuum distillation to recover naphtha from the rosin, fatty acids, turpentine, and other constituents later separated through steam distillation. Leached wood is steamed for additional naphtha recovery prior to burning for energy recovery. After the solvent has been recovered, [...] "the terpene oils are separated by fractional distillation and recovered mainly as refined turpentine, dipentene, and pine oil. The nonvolatitle residue from the extract is <b>wood</b> <b>rosin</b> of rather dark color. Upgrading of the rosin is carried out by clarification methods that generally may include bed-filtering or furfural-treatment of rosin-solvent solution." ...|$|E
