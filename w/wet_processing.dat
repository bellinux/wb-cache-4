25|$|Processing {{of coffee}} in India is {{accomplished}} using two methods, dry processing and <b>wet</b> <b>processing.</b> Dry processing is the traditional method of drying in the sun which is favoured for its flavour producing characteristics. In the <b>wet</b> <b>processing</b> method, coffee beans are fermented and washed, which is the preferred method for improved yields. As to the <b>wet</b> <b>processing,</b> the beans are subject to cleaning to segregate defective seeds. The beans of different varieties and sizes are then blended to derive the best flavour. The next procedure is to roast either through roasters or individual roasters. Then the roasted coffee is ground to appropriate sizes.|$|E
25|$|The {{consumption}} {{of energy in}} form of water and electricity is relatively high, especially in processes like washing, de-sizing, bleaching, rinsing, dyeing, printing, coating and finishing. Processing is time consuming. The major portion of water in textile industry is used for <b>wet</b> <b>processing</b> of textile (70 per cent). Approximately 25 per cent {{of energy in the}} total textile production like fibre production, spinning, twisting, weaving, knitting, clothing manufacturing etc. is used in dyeing. About 34 per cent of energy is consumed in spinning, 23 per cent in weaving, 38 per cent in chemical <b>wet</b> <b>processing</b> and five per cent in miscellaneous processes.

40|$|A {{sustainable}} {{recycling of}} photovoltaic (PV) thin film modules gains in importance {{due to the}} considerable growing of the PV market and the increasing scarcity of the resources for semiconductor materials. The paper presents the development of two strategies for thin film PV recycling based on (<b>wet)</b> mechanical <b>processing</b> for broken modules, and combined thermal and mechanical methods for end-of-life modules. The feasibility of the processing steps was demonstrated in laboratory scale {{as well as in}} semi-technical scale using the example of CdTe and CIS modules. Pre-concentrated valuables In and Te from <b>wet</b> mechanical <b>processing</b> can be purified to the appropriate grade for the production of new modules. An advantage of the <b>wet</b> mechanical <b>processing</b> in comparison to the conventional procedure might be the usage of no or a small amount of chemicals during the several steps. Some measures are necessary in order to increase the efficiency of the <b>wet</b> mechanical <b>processing</b> regarding the improvement of the valuable yield and the related enrichment of the semiconductor material. The investigation of the environmental impacts of both recycling strategies indicates that the strategy, which includes wet mechanical separation, has clear advantages in comparison to the thermal treatment or disposal on landfills. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract. Laser {{patterning}} {{technology of}} {{indium tin oxide}} thin films has been studied in this research. ITO thin films, which usually coat on the glass and the plastic substrate, have been adopted in the flat panel displays (FPDs) and the plasma display planes. The conventional method of the ITO patterning usually uses the <b>wet</b> chemical etching <b>processing.</b> However, the <b>wet</b> etching <b>processing</b> is not adopted in the plastic materials because the chemical fluid usually damages the plastic substrate. The laser direct writing processing has been developed and replaces the <b>wet</b> etching <b>processing.</b> This investigation {{is interested in the}} laser patterning used the third-harmonic Nd:YAG laser (355 nm) to ablate the ITO films of glass substrate. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) measures the characterization of the ablated grooves used the different parameters, including the laser energy, the repetition rate and the feeding speed of the table. Finally, the effect parameters of laser ablating ITO film will be presented in this paper...|$|R

The present study aimed {{to identify the}} prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler flocks and meat contamination at retail shops, and {{determine the influence of}} semi-automated and <b>wet</b> market <b>processing</b> on Campylobacter contamination of neck skin samples. Samples were collected from semi-automated plants (n = 102) and wet markets (n = 25). From each batch of broilers, pooled caecal samples and neck skin samples were tested for Campylobacter. Broiler meat purchased from retail outlets (n = 37) was also tested. The prevalence of Campylobacter colonized broiler flocks was 67 %. The contamination of meat at retail was 59 %. Both semi-automated and <b>wet</b> market <b>processing</b> resulted to contaminate the broiler neck skins to the levels of 27. 4 % and 48 %, respectively. When Campylobacter-free broiler flocks were processed in semi-automated facilities 15 % (5 / 33) of neck skin samples became contaminated by the end of processing whereas 25 % (2 / 8) became contaminated after <b>wet</b> market <b>processing.</b> Characterization of isolates revealed a higher proportion of C. coli compared to C. jejuni.
