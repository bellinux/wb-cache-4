5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} <b>welding,</b> {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for <b>welding</b> dissimilar materials, such as the <b>welding</b> of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state <b>welding</b> processes include friction <b>welding</b> (including friction stir <b>welding),</b> magnetic pulse <b>welding,</b> co-extrusion <b>welding,</b> cold <b>welding,</b> diffusion bonding, exothermic <b>welding,</b> high frequency <b>welding,</b> hot pressure <b>welding,</b> induction <b>welding,</b> and roll <b>welding.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the middle}} of the century, many new <b>welding</b> methods were invented. In 1930, Kyle Taylor was {{responsible}} for the release of stud <b>welding,</b> which soon became popular in shipbuilding and construction. Submerged arc <b>welding</b> was invented the same year and continues to be popular today. In 1932 a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov successfully implemented the first underwater electric arc <b>welding.</b> Gas tungsten arc <b>welding,</b> after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941, and gas metal arc <b>welding</b> followed in 1948, allowing for fast <b>welding</b> of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Shielded metal arc <b>welding</b> was developed during the 1950s, using a flux-coated consumable electrode, and it quickly became the most popular metal arc <b>welding</b> process. In 1957, the flux-cored arc <b>welding</b> process debuted, in which the self-shielded wire electrode could be used with automatic equipment, resulting in greatly increased <b>welding</b> speeds, and that same year, plasma arc <b>welding</b> was invented. Electroslag <b>welding</b> was introduced in 1958, and it was followed by its cousin, electrogas <b>welding,</b> in 1961. In 1953, the Soviet scientist N. F. Kazakov proposed the diffusion bonding method.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} {{applications}} gas metal arc <b>welding</b> is {{a fairly}} simple <b>welding</b> process to learn requiring {{no more than a}} week or two to master basic <b>welding</b> technique. Even when <b>welding</b> is performed by well-trained operators weld quality can fluctuate since it depends on a number of external factors.

5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular <b>welding</b> methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot <b>welding,</b> thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot <b>welding.</b> It is also popular for automated <b>welding,</b> in which robots handle the workpieces and the <b>welding</b> gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc <b>welding</b> is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater <b>welding,</b> which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc <b>welding,</b> flux cored arc <b>welding,</b> or gas tungsten arc <b>welding.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like spot <b>welding,</b> seam <b>welding</b> {{relies on}} two {{electrodes}} to apply pressure and current to join metal sheets. However, instead of pointed electrodes, wheel-shaped electrodes roll along and often feed the workpiece, {{making it possible}} to make long continuous welds. In the past, this process was used in the manufacture of beverage cans, but now its uses are more limited. Other resistance <b>welding</b> methods include butt <b>welding,</b> flash <b>welding,</b> projection <b>welding,</b> and upset <b>welding.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many <b>welding</b> {{processes}} {{require the}} use of a particular joint design; for example, resistance spot <b>welding,</b> laser beam <b>welding,</b> and electron beam <b>welding</b> are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other <b>welding</b> methods, like shielded metal arc <b>welding,</b> are extremely versatile and can weld virtually any type of joint. Some processes {{can also be used to}} make multipass welds, in which one weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed on top of it. This allows for the <b>welding</b> of thick sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.|$|E

Friction stir <b>welding</b> was invented in 1991 by Wayne Thomas at The <b>Welding</b> Institute (TWI, UK) and found high-quality applications all over the world.

5|$|Shielded metal arc <b>welding</b> (SMAW), {{also known}} as manual metal arc <b>welding</b> (MMA or MMAW), flux {{shielded}} arc <b>welding</b> or informally as stick <b>welding,</b> is a manual arc <b>welding</b> process that uses a consumable electrode covered with a flux to lay the weld.|$|E
5|$|Shielded metal arc <b>welding</b> {{equipment}} typically {{consists of}} a constant current <b>welding</b> power supply and an electrode, with an electrode holder, a 'ground' clamp, and <b>welding</b> cables (also known as <b>welding</b> leads) connecting the two.|$|E
40|$|Tensile {{properties}} and microhardness of electron beam <b>welded</b> thick damage-tolerant Ti- 6 Al- 4 V joints with the <b>weld</b> cross-section of parallel shaped and taper shaped configurations were examined.

The {{results indicate that}} for both the shaped joints, the <b>weld</b> metal exhibits increased strength and microhardness, while decreased ductility and toughness {{as compared with the}} base metal. The mechanical properties of the <b>weld</b> metal are heterogeneous along the <b>weld</b> depth. With the increase of <b>weld</b> depth, the strength and microhardness increase. The <b>weld</b> middle position has smaller mechanical heterogeneity than the <b>weld</b> top and <b>weld</b> root. Moreover, the heterogeneity of parallel shaped <b>welds</b> along the <b>weld</b> depth is lower than that of taper shaped <b>welds.</b> It is also found that the change of mechanical properties such as strength and microhardness has microstructure dependent trend.

5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the only}} <b>welding</b> process was forge <b>welding,</b> which blacksmiths had used for millenia to join iron and steel by heating and hammering.

5|$|While many <b>welding</b> {{applications}} {{are done in}} controlled environments such as factories and repair shops, some <b>welding</b> processes are commonly used {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, such as open air, underwater, and vacuums (such as space). In open-air applications, such as construction and outdoors repair, shielded metal arc <b>welding</b> is the most common process. Processes that employ inert gases to protect the weld cannot be readily used in such situations, because unpredictable atmospheric movements can result in a faulty weld. Shielded metal arc <b>welding</b> is also often used in underwater <b>welding</b> in the construction and repair of ships, offshore platforms, and pipelines, but others, such as flux cored arc <b>welding</b> and gas tungsten arc <b>welding,</b> are also common. <b>Welding</b> in space is also possible—it was first attempted in 1969 by Russian cosmonauts, when they performed experiments to test shielded metal arc <b>welding,</b> plasma arc <b>welding,</b> and electron beam <b>welding</b> in a depressurized environment. Further testing of these methods was done in the following decades, and today researchers continue to develop methods for using other <b>welding</b> processes in space, such as laser beam <b>welding,</b> resistance <b>welding,</b> and friction <b>welding.</b> Advances in these areas may be useful for future endeavours similar to the construction of the International Space Station, which could rely on <b>welding</b> for joining in space the parts that were manufactured on Earth.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of the short pulsed electric arc in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, arc <b>welding</b> developed slowly. C. L. Coffin had the idea of <b>welding</b> in an inert gas atmosphere in 1890, but even in the early 20th century, <b>welding</b> non-ferrous materials such as aluminum and magnesium remained difficult because these metals react rapidly with the air and result in porous, dross-filled welds. Processes using flux-covered electrodes did not satisfactorily protect the weld area from contamination. To solve the problem, bottled inert gases were used {{in the beginning of the}} 1930s. A few years later, a direct current, gas-shielded <b>welding</b> process emerged in the aircraft industry for <b>welding</b> magnesium.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Geometrical {{parameters}} of <b>welded</b> joint affect the stress concentration coefficient seriously.

5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} <b>welding</b> {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc <b>welding</b> and oxyfuel <b>welding,</b> to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam <b>welding</b> and electron beam <b>welding.</b> Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of <b>welding),</b> the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, <b>welding,</b> and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and <b>welding</b> power demand.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} <b>welding</b> {{processes}} such as gas metal arc <b>welding,</b> shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the <b>welding</b> area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the <b>welding</b> metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of {{the process}} and the simplicity of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc <b>welding</b> is one of the world's first and most popular <b>welding</b> processes. It dominates other <b>welding</b> processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc <b>welding</b> is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E
40|$|The {{critical}} issue during {{finite element analysis}} of tailor <b>welded</b> blank is {{the handling of the}} <b>weld</b> region either the <b>weld</b> may be treated just as a <b>weld</b> line (without imposing mechanical properties) or as a <b>weld</b> zone (by imposing separate mechanical properties to the <b>weld</b> zone).

In LDH simulations, samples deforming near plane strain and balanced biaxial stretching will be modeled. Load-progression behavior will be monitored. Throughout this study, simulations will be performed by finite element analysis. By analyzing the simulation results, the specific conditions where the <b>weld</b> zone assumption should be followed will be identified.
