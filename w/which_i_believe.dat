Collingwood summed the situation up {{in a letter to}} his sister, stating [...] "Though I think him a stupid man I was in hope he might have gone on in the ship I put him in, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> was the only chance he had of being in a ship".|$|E

Landsat 2 was originally designated as ERTS-B (Earth Resources Technology Satellite-B) and was renamed prior to launch. The satellite was designed to operate {{for a minimum of}} one year. The primary objective of the MSS was to acquire global, seasonal data in medium resolution from a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit. NASA administrator James C.

After the election, Keyes {{declined}} to congratulate Obama, explaining that {{his refusal to}} congratulate Obama was [...] "not anything personal", but was meant {{to make a statement}} against [...] "extend false congratulations to the triumph of what we have declared to be across the line" [...] of reasonable propriety. He said that Obama's position on moral issues regarding life and the family had crossed that line.

Topping continued to visit Hindley in prison, along with her solicitor Michael Fisher and her spiritual counsellor, the Reverend Peter Timms, {{who had been a}} prison governor before resigning to become a minister in the Methodist Church. She made a formal confession to police on 10 February 1987, admitting her involvement in all five murders, but news of her confession was not made public for more than a month. The tape recording of her statement was over 17hours long; Topping described it as a [...] "very well worked out performance in <b>which,</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> she told me just as much as she wanted me to know, and no more". He also commented that he [...] "was {{struck by the fact that}} she was never there when the killings took place. She was in the car, over the brow of the hill, in the bathroom and even, in the case of the Evans murder, in the kitchen". Topping concluded that he felt he [...] "had witnessed a great performance rather than a genuine confession".|$|E
500|$|Myrie-Williams joined League Two side Port Vale on loan on 24 November, {{joining the}} club until January 2012. A day later, on 25 November, {{he made his}} debut for Port Vale in a 0–0 home draw against Torquay United, playing the whole match. During the game, he {{impressed}} manager Micky Adams— [...] "He (Myrie-Williams) lifted me, as I'm asking people to be positive and show character, because the fans are disappointed {{with the way things}} have gone recently, and we need to give them something to shout about, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> he did. I thought he was outstanding, he looked exciting on the ball and he got crosses into the box". In his next appearance for the club, he scored the equalising goal in a 2–1 win at Dagenham & Redbridge, when he [...] "blasted in" [...] a [...] "25-yard blockbuster"– fellow Stevenage loanee Madjo went on to score the winning goal. Myrie-Williams' effort was Vale's first goal in 502 minutes (more than five games) of football. He won a penalty in his fourth game for the club, which was converted by Marc Richards to give Vale a 2–1 win at Hereford United. He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored one goal in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his initial}} success, Duncan {{was unable to}} retain control {{in the face of}} a more {{widespread}} revolt on 15 May among the ships based at the Nore, which became known as the Nore Mutiny. Led by a sailor named Richard Parker, the Nore mutineers quickly organised and became a significant threat to water traffic in the Thames Estuary. Duncan was informed that his fleet at Yarmouth might be ordered to attack the mutineers and, although reluctant, responded, [...] "I do not shrink from the business if it cannot otherwise be got the better of". When rumours of the plan reached the fleet at Yarmouth, the crew of Venerable also expressed their distaste with the plan, but reaffirmed their promise of loyalty to their admiral whatever the circumstances. News then arrived that the Dutch fleet under De Winter was preparing to sail, and Duncan's fleet was ordered by Lord Spencer to blockade the Dutch coast. Duncan issued orders for the fleet to weigh anchor, but the men disobeyed and ship after ship overthrew their officers and joined the mutineers at the Nore. Eventually Duncan was left with only his own Venerable and Hotham's Adamant to contain the entire Dutch fleet. Duncan later wrote that, [...] "To be deserted by my own fleet in the face of the enemy is a disgrace <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> never before happened to a British admiral, nor could I have supposed it possible." ...|$|E

McGregor said she objects to the program as she believes it is underpinned by a political ideology with which she does not agree, saying that the program [...] "teaches a derivative of queer theory, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> leads trans people into a blind alley".

2500|$|The {{success of}} Ingres's {{painting}} led in 1826 {{to a major}} new commission, The Apotheosis of Homer, a giant canvas which celebrated all the great artists of history, intended to decorate the ceiling {{of one of the}} halls of the Museum Charles X at the Louvre. Ingres was unable to finish the work in time for the 1827 Salon, but displayed the painting in grisaille. The 1827 Salon became a confrontation between the neoclassicism of Ingres's Apotheosis and a new manifesto of romanticism by Delacroix, The Death of Sardanapalus. Ingres joined the battle with enthusiasm; he called Delacroix [...] "the apostle of ugliness" [...] and told friends that he recognized [...] "the talent, the honorable character and distinguished spirit" [...] of Delacroix, but that [...] "he has tendencies <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> are dangerous and which I must push back." ...|$|E

Russell had agreed to write an introduction to explain why it was important, because it was otherwise unlikely to have been published: it was difficult if not impossible to understand, and Wittgenstein was unknown in philosophy. In a letter to Russell, Wittgenstein wrote [...] "The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by props—i.e. by language—(and, which comes to the same thing, what can be thought) and what can not be expressed by pros, but only shown (gezeigt); <b>which,</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> is the cardinal problem of philosophy."
