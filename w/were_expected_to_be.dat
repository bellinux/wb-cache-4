5|$|In November 2009, the European Union {{announced}} {{its intention to}} train two Somali battalions (around 2,000 troops), which would complement other training missions and bring {{the total number of}} better-trained Somalian soldiers to 6,000. The two battalions <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ready by August 2011. In April 2011, 1,000 recruits completed training in Uganda {{as a part of the}} agreement with the EU.|$|E
50|$|Since {{gradients}} <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{very low}} and turning radii <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very high, otoyols have many {{bridges and tunnels}} which makes them very expensive.|$|R

5|$|South Stoneham House was acquired, with South Hill (some {{two miles}} to the northwest), in 1920 to house male {{students}} at University College Southampton. The salmon pool at South Stoneham was retained by the Montagu family, {{becoming part of the}} Townhill Park estate. Tradition prevailed in the house, with a collegiate atmosphere as gowns <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worn to dinner and lectures and curfews were enforced.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 13th century, {{women of}} the court <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to sing, play instruments, and write jocs partis, or partimen (a debate or {{dialogue}} {{in the form of}} a poem). The cultivation of these womanly skills may have led to the writings of the trobairitz.|$|E
5|$|A cube-shaped {{concrete}} {{building was}} constructed {{on the top}} of the hill, next to the dome. This was intended to be used as the bomb-proof outlet for a ventilation and air conditioning shaft. It was an essential component of a facility where dangerous and explosive gases <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that the ventilation shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.|$|E

5|$|Although in {{operational}} use the Vulcan typically carried various nuclear armaments, {{the type}} {{also had a}} secondary conventional role. While performing conventional combat missions, the Vulcan could carry up to 21 bombs inside its bomb bay. From the 1960s, the various Vulcan squadrons would routinely conduct conventional training missions; the aircrews <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to perform conventional bombing missions {{in addition to the}} critical nuclear strike mission the Vulcan normally performed.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{inadequacy}} of bureaucracy in Austria, and wishing to improve it, Maria Theresa reformed education in 1775. In a new school system based on the Prussian one, all children of both genders from the ages of six to twelve were required to attend school. Education reform was met with hostility from many villages; Maria Theresa crushed the dissent by ordering the arrest of all those opposed. Although the idea had merit, the reforms were not as successful as they <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> since no funding was offered from the state; {{in some parts of}} Austria, half of the population was illiterate well into the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Both roadways <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{completed}} by January1, 1935. They were ultimately completed in October 1934, six months ahead of schedule. The Long Beach Loop Causeway was opened to extreme fanfare on October27, 1934, {{as was the}} Meadowbrook State Parkway with parades celebrating the event were held in Freeport and Rockville Centre, and they were attended by Robert Moses, {{at the time a}} candidate for Governor of New York, and Fiorello LaGuardia, the Mayor of New York City.|$|E

5|$|By September6, {{farmers in}} {{southern}} {{areas of the}} country requested aid from the government. In South Jeolla Province, ₩35billion (US$31.1million) was allocated for post-storm recovery. Of this, about half went to repairing public facilities. Across the province, repairs <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completed by October or November 2012. On September11, the Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister announced that residents severely affected by the typhoon were eligible for up to ₩50million (US$44,000) in construction assistance. Economically, Typhoons Bolaven and Tembin contributed to a 6.6% decrease in construction investment, the largest drop since January 2003.|$|E
5|$|Following Irma, many {{survivors}} in Benagaspasan demanded {{for an emergency}} airlift of food, medicine, and clothing. These <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> provided by air force authorities. Provençal governments asked the president to declare Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur provinces disaster areas. Marcos also toured over the devastated area, noting that damage was less than initially feared. On December1, President Marcos {{declared a state of}} emergency in 17Philippines provinces. Following a meeting, Marcos ordered the release of $278,750 to help subsidize rice to farmers. Moreover, $250,000 was ordered to be released for other relief operations.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th century, Newcastle upon Tyne had a {{population}} of around 4,000; and {{it was difficult for}} the four parish churches to care for the needs of such a large population. The priests <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> educators, doctors and counsellors, as well as meeting the spiritual needs of their parishioners. Therefore, in 1291 land was donated by William Baron of Wark on Tweed to found an Augustinian friary on the land on which the museum now stands.|$|E

5|$|Local {{residents}} said that {{fire safety requirements}} at the high-rise were lax, and that workers often tossed used cigarettes into the building's hallways. Week-long safety inspections were done on the two other buildings of the apartment complex, {{both of which were}} unharmed. The several hundred people living in those buildings <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allowed to move back on 20 December 2010. Until then, the survivors would live in 17 nearby hotels.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the storm, the National Park Service closed visitor centers and campgrounds along the Outer Banks. For about 12hours, the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was closed. North Carolina Governor Mike Easley put rescue teams and the National Guard on standby. Residents and {{tourists}} were advised to secure loose objects, and to remain indoors. As the storm's effects <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> minor, no evacuations were ordered. On Ocracoke Island, boats were hauled out. The threat of the storm forced the cancellation of a fishing tournament at Atlantic Beach, which resulted in effects to the local economy.|$|E
5|$|Task Group 111.2 sailed from Manus Island on 12 June. While {{en route}} to Truk, its orders were broadened to also include a cruiser {{bombardment}} of Japanese positions at Truk. This change was made as the cruisers <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used against shore targets during future operations. In preparation for these bombardments, the Task Group conducted gunnery exercises during its voyage north. Ahead of the attacks on Truk, a US Navy submarine took up position near the atoll to rescue any British airmen who crashed into the sea.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} plan includes a new hospital with 167 beds, an expanded emergency room, a new medical office building with outpatient surgery facilities and a four-story parking garage.

5|$|The JINR team {{sought to}} use {{berkelium}} because calcium-48, the isotope of calcium {{used in the}} beam, has 20 protons and 28 neutrons, making a neutron–proton ratio of 1.4; {{and it is the}} lightest stable or near-stable nucleus with such a large neutron excess. The second-lightest such nucleus, palladium-110 (46 protons, 64 neutrons, neutron–proton ratio of 1.391), is much heavier. Thanks to the neutron excess, the resulting nuclei <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heavier and closer to the sought-after island of stability. Of the aimed for 117 protons, calcium has 20, and thus they needed to use berkelium, which has 97 protons in its nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint {{received}} the models from Ortmayer. On May 23 its superintendent, Edwin Dressel, sent O'Reilly a memorandum from Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, {{stating that the}} sculptor's models were in too high relief, and suggesting that Ortmayer come to the mint to discuss the matter. A letter from O'Reilly to Melish on June 18 reports that after some modification, Sinnock wrote that the coin was at the very limit of high relief that the mint could coin, and that dies for the Cincinnati piece <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tested by coining trial strikes in early July.|$|E
5|$|The laws {{of nature}} were long thought to remain the same under mirror reflection. The results of an {{experiment}} viewed via a mirror <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> identical {{to the results of}} a mirror-reflected copy of the experimental apparatus. This so-called law of parity conservation was known to be respected by classical gravitation, electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it was assumed to be a universal law. However, in the mid-1950s Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law. Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the weak interaction violates parity, earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
