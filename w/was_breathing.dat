25|$|On September 10, 2012 during Raw at the Bell Centre in Montreal, {{not long}} after {{defeating}} CM Punk and Dolph Ziggler in a tag-team match with Randy Orton, Lawler legitimately collapsed at the announcers table while Kane and Daniel Bryan competed against The Prime Time Players. Fellow commentator Michael Cole continued to call that match alone, {{as well as the}} next match, before WWE (through Cole) announced the medical situation with Lawler. The remaining matches on the show went ahead as scheduled but without commentary, and updates on Jerry's condition were provided by Cole. At the end of the broadcast, it was announced that he had received CPR, but <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> independently and reacting to stimulation. It was later confirmed on WWE.com that Lawler had suffered a heart attack. On September 11, 2012, he underwent an angioplasty to improve blood flow to his heart. On September 12, 2012, Lawler was reported to be slowly being eased off sedation, his ventilator removed. He was able to blink, nod, and squeeze with his hands, and that same day, the results of several CT scans showed no signs of brain damage. By September 17, Lawler had returned to his home in Memphis. During Lawler's hospital stay, it was determined that his heart attack was not caused by a blocked artery, but was instead an unexplained cardiac arrest. Lawler was soon medically cleared to continue wrestling.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 4 p.m. on September 18, Dannemann told Police Sergeant John Shaw: [...] "We went {{to sleep}} about 7 a.m. When I woke up at eleven his face was covered in vomit, and he <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> noisily. I sent for an ambulance, and {{he was taken to}} hospital. I also noticed that ten of my sleeping tablets were missing." [...] In a statement given to P. Weyell of the coroner's office on September 24, she said: I made a sandwich and we talked until about 7 a.m. He then said that {{he wanted to go to}} sleep. He took some tablets, and we went to bed. I woke up about 11:00 a.m., and saw that Jimi's face was covered in vomit. I tried to wake him but could not. I called an ambulance and he was taken to the hospital in Kensington... Prior to going with him to the hospital, I checked my supply of Vesparax sleeping tablets and found that nine of them were missing.|$|E
500|$|The {{physicians}} {{could not}} agree on a diagnosis. Radcliffe thought he had scarlet fever, while others thought it was smallpox. They administered [...] "cordial powders and cordial juleps". Gloucester was bled, to which Radcliffe strongly objected. He told his colleagues, [...] "you have destroyed him and you may finish him". He prescribed blistering, which was no more effective. In great pain, Gloucester passed the evening of 28 July [...] "in great sighings and dejections of spirits... towards morning, he complained very much of his blisters." [...] Anne, who had spent an entire day and night by her son's bedside, now became so distressed that she fainted. However, by midday on 29 July, Gloucester <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> more easily and his headache had diminished, leading to hopes that he would recover. The improvement was fleeting, and that evening, he was [...] "taken with a convulsing sort of breathing, a defect in swallowing and a total deprivation of all sense". Prince William died close to 1 a.m. on 30 July 1700, with his parents beside him. In the end, the physicians decided {{the cause of death}} was [...] "a malignant fever". An autopsy revealed severe swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck and an abnormal amount of fluid in the ventricles of his brain: [...] "four and a half ounces of a limpid humour were taken out." [...] A modern diagnosis is that Gloucester died of acute bacterial pharyngitis, with associated pneumonia. Had he lived, though, it is almost certain the prince would have succumbed to complications of his hydrocephalus.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} round Ali began {{to take control of}} the fight. At about 30 seconds into the round he hit Liston with several combinations, causing a bruise under Liston's right eye and a cut under his left, which {{eventually}} required eight stitches to close. It was the first time in his career that Liston had been cut. At one point in this attack, Liston's knees buckled and he almost went down as he was driven to the ropes. A clearly angered Liston rallied at the end of the round, as Ali seemed tired, and delivered punishing shots to Ali's body. It was probably Liston's best moment in the entire fight. [...] Sitting on his stool between rounds, Liston <b>was</b> <b>breathing</b> heavily as his cornermen worked on his cut.|$|E
