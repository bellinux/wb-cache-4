500|$|Shirley {{replaced}} {{thousands of}} cymbal and drum hits with those used on previous recordings; the process took {{several days to}} complete. After recording the DVD, the band used a sprinkler system with diluted water rather than a bucket with blood that was like tar when recording the DVD. King later remarked, [...] "My guitar didn’t like it, that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> played it," [...] and he donated it to the Hard Rock Cafe after the show. Vocalist Tom Araya felt the same and admitted; [...] "It was messy. I couldn't play because the initial dump {{at the beginning of}} the song got all over me. I couldn't hold my pick. I was slapping my bass trying to get sound out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown had a {{difficult}} childhood; after her divorce, his working mother received welfare benefits. Brown experienced sexual abuse from a camp counselor who threatened to kill the 10-year-old boy if he told anyone– {{which he did not}} disclose, even to his family, until his autobiography Against All Odds (2011)– and physical abuse from his stepfathers. During various periods of his childhood, Brown lived with his grandparents and his aunt. He shoplifted many times, and was arrested for stealing record albums and brought before Judge Samuel Zoll in Salem, Massachusetts at the age of 12. Zoll asked Brown if his siblings would like seeing him play basketball in jail and required Brown to write a 1,500-word essay on that question as his punishment. Brown later said, [...] "that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever stole." ...|$|E
500|$|The 3rd Battalion began {{landing on}} Gavutu at 10:00 on 8 August and {{assisted}} in destroying the remaining Japanese defenses on that islet, which {{was completed by}} 12:00. Then the 3rd Battalion prepared to assault Tanambogo. The Marines on Gavutu provided covering fire for the attack. In preparation for the assault, U.S. carrier-based dive bombers and naval gunfire bombardment were requested. After the carrier aircraft twice accidentally dropped bombs on the U.S. Marines on Gavutu, killing four of them, further carrier aircraft support was canceled. San Juan, however, placed its shells on the correct island and shelled Tanambogo for 30 minutes. The Marine assault began at 16:15, both by landing craft and across the causeway, and, with assistance from two marine Stuart light tanks, began making headway against the Japanese defenses. One of the tanks which became stuck on a stump and isolated from its infantry support {{was surrounded by a}} [...] "frenzied mob" [...] of about 50 Japanese airmen. [...] The Japanese set fire to the tank, killing two of its crew and severely beat the other two crewmembers before most of them were killed by Marine rifle fire. The Marines later counted 42 Japanese bodies around the burned-out hulk of the tank, including the corpses of the Yokohama executive officer and several of the seaplane pilots. One of the Japanese survivors of the attack on the tank reported, [...] "I recall seeing my officer, Lieutenant Commander Saburo Katsuta of the Yokohama Air Group, on top of the tank. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> saw him". The overall commander of troops on Tanambogo was Captain (naval rank) Miyazaki-san who blew himself up inside his dugout on the late afternoon of 8 August.|$|E

60|$|While {{the ship}} was lying off the Battery, on her return from this voyage, and before she had hauled in, a boat came {{alongside}} with {{a young man in}} her in naval uniform. This was Cooper, who, in pulling across to go aboard his own vessel, had recognised our mast-heads, and now came to look at us. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> met him, until the year 1843; or, for thirty-four years.|$|E

60|$|In {{the summer}} of 1842 I was {{stronger}} than I had been for some time, and took a little tour by myself in North Wales, {{for the sake of}} observing the effects of the old glaciers which formerly filled all the larger valleys. I published a short account of what I saw in the 'Philosophical Magazine.' ('Philosophical Magazine,' 1842.) This excursion interested me greatly, and it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was ever strong enough to climb mountains or to take long walks such as are necessary for geological work.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Sir Henry. That {{she could}} not do. From doing that she is utterly debarred. But I tell you once for all that I have no battle. You shall know more--if the {{knowledge}} will do you any good. Not very long since my uncle offered to settle on me half his fortune if I would oblige him in one particular. But I could not do the thing he wanted; and when we parted, I had his positive assurance that he would leave me nothing. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> saw him."

On {{arriving at the}} Straits I found cable messages which made it necessary for me to throw up my employment at a moment's notice and go home at once. I had a desperate scramble to catch the mailboat which was due to leave next day, but I found time to write two short notes, one to Freya, the other to Jasper. Later on I wrote at length, this time to Allen alone. I got no answer. I hunted up then his brother, or, rather, half-brother, a solicitor in the city, a sallow, calm, little man who looked at me over his spectacles thoughtfully.|$|E

60|$|When I {{was about}} this last ship a letter {{came from the}} count, my son, full of tender {{expressions}} of his duty to me, in which I was informed {{that he was going}} again to the university at Paris, where he should remain four years; after that he intended to make the tour of Europe, and then come and settle at The Hague. I returned him thanks in a letter for his compliment, wished him all happiness, and a safe return to Holland, and desired that he would write to me from time to time that I might hear of his welfare, which was all I could now expect of him. But this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> heard from him, or he from me.|$|E
