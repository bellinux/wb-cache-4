5|$|George Pullman and William Halliday {{familiarized}} {{themselves with}} their industrial operations, giving {{attention to the}} minutest details. Their labor forces, tempered by the demands of industry in America, expected to work hard {{in exchange for the}} necessities of life. Cooperation between managers and workers created a higher standard of living, which in turn, encouraged better working conditions.Good housing also helped promote good <b>work</b> <b>habits.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reformers {{reasoned}} that adequate housing could counter the drinking problems. George Pullman adhered to this idea. He {{believed that a}} good residential surrounding would benefit the workers and that beauty in the town would breed good character in the residents. Pullman hoped the comfortable, beautiful environment of his town would encourage cleanliness, industriousness and sobriety in the work force. Attractive housing with adequate living space did create good <b>work</b> <b>habits</b> in the towns.|$|E
5|$|Balzac's <b>work</b> <b>habits</b> are legendary, {{he wrote}} from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; {{he claimed to have}} once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|E

5|$|On July 5, 1861, at {{nineteen}} Myers {{became a}} teller and cashier at the Mohawk Valley Bank. General Francis E. Spinner was the {{treasurer of the}} bank at the time. His first year as a trainee was without pay. Myers then received a salary of $100 per year, being higher than normal since he put in extra attention to his <b>work</b> <b>habits.</b> He opened his own little telegraph office in July 1863 within the counting office of the bank. This was the first telegraph office for the town of Mohawk, New York. He constructed all the necessary telegraph equipment needed and taught himself Morse code. Myers' income from this bank telegraph business was one-half of his total income. He eventually {{had to give up}} being a part-time telegraph operator within the bank, as his bank responsibilities took up most of his time. He turned over the telegraph business to the local post office with Austin Shall as the operator.|$|E

25|$|The {{greatest}} literary influence upon Kafka was Flaubert's. Flaubert who loathed pretty-pretty prose {{would have}} applauded Kafka's attitude towards his tool.

The legacy of his <b>work</b> <b>habits</b> can best be described, therefore, as paving the way towards a slower and more introspective manner of writing.|$|E

These include blogs, RSS, and social bookmarking. The courses stress immersion in the tools and instructors encourage participants to work on a specific project in Intellipedia.

25|$|The {{decline of}} the Fauvist {{movement}} after 1906 {{did not affect the}} career of Matisse; many of his finest works were created between 1906 and 1917, when he was an active part of the great gathering of artistic talent in Montparnasse, even though he did not quite fit in, with his conservative appearance and strict bourgeois <b>work</b> <b>habits.</b> He continued to absorb new influences. He travelled to Algeria in 1906 studying African art and Primitivism. After viewing a large exhibition of Islamic art in Munich in 1910, he spent two months in Spain studying Moorish art. He visited Morocco in 1912 and again in 1913 and while painting in Tangiers he made several changes to his work, including his use of black as a colour. The effect on Matisse's art was a new boldness in the use of intense, unmodulated colour, as in L'Atelier Rouge (1911).|$|E

40|$|We {{examine a}} model where {{households}} develop external habits by following norms and therefore have multiple habits in both consumption and labour supply. In doing so, {{they contribute to}} habit formation and hence pose an externality effect on others. Our findings are: first, that consumption and <b>work</b> <b>habit</b> (‘work ethic’) drive us towards a 24 / 7 society; both forms of habit increase the labour supply of households. Second, the two externalities involved in external <b>habit</b> <b>work</b> in opposite directions. For consumption, external habit is a negative externality as it reduces the utility {{of others in the}} economy. By contrast work ethic reduces the disutility and is therefore a positive externality. Third, {{as a result of our}} second finding, multiple habits can involve both a consumption tax and subsidy to correct for these externalities. Fourth, with plausible parameter values, the welfare consequences of multiple habits are far greater where there are long-run inefficiencies compared with only transitional inefficiency.

500|$|Napoleon {{maintained}} strict, efficient <b>work</b> <b>habits,</b> prioritizing {{what needed}} to be done. He cheated at cards, but repaid the losses; he had to win at everything he attempted. He kept relays of staff and secretaries at work. Unlike many generals, Napoleon did not examine history to ask what Hannibal or Alexander or anyone else did in a similar situation. Critics said he won many battles simply because of luck; Napoleon responded, [...] "Give me lucky generals", aware that [...] "luck" [...] comes to leaders who recognize opportunity, and seize it. Dwyer states that Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz and Jena in 1805–06 heightened his sense of self-grandiosity, leaving him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility.|$|E

According to a 1999 Chicago Tribune profile, in the state House [...] "Hastert quickly staked out {{a place on the}} far right of the {{political}} spectrum, once earning a place on the 'Moral Majority Honor Roll.' Yet, he also displayed yeoman-like <b>work</b> <b>habits</b> and an ability to put aside partisanship." [...] He gained a reputation as a dealmaker and party leader known for [...] "asking his colleagues to write their spending requests on a notepad so he could carry them into negotiating sessions" [...] and holding early-morning pre-meetings to organize talking points. One of his first moves in the House was to help block passage of the Equal Rights Amendment; the state House Speaker George Ryan appointed Hastert to a committee that worked to prevent the ERA from coming to the House floor. In the state House, Hastert opposed bills barring discrimination against gays; supported (unsuccessfully) proposals to raise the driving age to 18; and voted for a mandatory seat belt law, although he later voted to repeal it.|$|E
500|$|As a ruler, Justinian showed great energy. He {{was known}} as [...] "the emperor who never sleeps" [...] {{on account of his}} <b>work</b> <b>habits.</b> Nevertheless, he seems to have been amiable and easy to approach. Around 525, he married his mistress, Theodora, in Constantinople. She was by {{profession}} a courtesan and some twenty years his junior. In earlier times, Justinian could not have married her because of her class, but his uncle, Emperor Justin I, had passed a law allowing intermarriage between social classes. Theodora would become very influential in the politics of the Empire, and later emperors would follow Justinian's precedent in marrying outside the aristocratic class. The marriage caused a scandal, but Theodora would prove to be a shrewd judge of character and Justinian's greatest supporter. Other talented individuals included Tribonian, his legal adviser; Peter the Patrician, the diplomat and longtime head of the palace bureaucracy; Justinian's finance ministers John the Cappadocian and Peter Barsymes, who managed to collect taxes more efficiently than any before, thereby funding Justinian's wars; and finally, his prodigiously talented generals, Belisarius and Narses.|$|E
