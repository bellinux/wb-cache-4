It is part of the compulsory education, and it lasts at least seven years, Primary education is provided by 51 Fólkaskúli and 3 Free Schools; some of these Fólkaskúli also provide optional preschool education.

5|$|While RAD {{is likely}} to occur {{following}} neglectful and abusive childcare, {{there should be no}} automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. Experiences of abuse are associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds to that person in an unpredictable and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment disorganization is a risk factor but not in itself an attachment disorder. Further although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.|$|E

5|$|The law courts' {{jurisdiction}} over the guardianship of children {{is said to have}} come from the King's prerogative of parens patriae. The Chancery had administered this area of law from an early period, since it primarily concerned the holding of land– a form of trust. Since these were mainly dealt with orally there are few early records; the first reference comes from 1582, when a curator was appointed to deal with the property of an infant. While the common law courts regularly appointed guardians, the Chancery had the right to remove them, replace them or create them in the first place. Similarly, while there were actions against guardians <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> could undertake in the common law courts, these were regularly undertaken in the Court of Chancery. This jurisdiction was first regularly recognised from 1696 onwards, and its main focus was the welfare of the child. As such, wards of the court had certain principles: their estates had to be administered {{under the supervision of the}} Court, they had to be educated under the same supervision, and any marriage had to be sanctioned by the Court.|$|E

25|$|Mary is {{described}} by scholars as an Eleusa icon because of the tender manner in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> is nestled against her cheek, setting the image as an intimate portrayal of the bond between mother and child. Her head is tilted towards her son and embraces his forehead and cheek almost {{as if in a}} kiss, while her arms warmly cradle him. He has one leg bent and another extended towards her, while his right arm is held upright and intimately holds her chin from below. This closeness and engagement of mother and child is a departure from Byzantine tradition, where they were often shown almost at arms length, and was in tune with the ideals of the Italian Quattrocento.|$|E
25|$|Ainsworth's {{narrative}} records {{showed that}} infants avoided the caregiver in the stressful Strange Situation Procedure {{when they had}} a history of experiencing rebuff of attachment behaviour. The child's needs are frequently not met and the child comes to believe that communication of needs has no influence on the caregiver. Ainsworth's student Mary Main theorised that avoidant behaviour in the Strange Situational Procedure should be regarded as 'a conditional strategy, which paradoxically permits whatever proximity is possible under conditions of maternal rejection' by de-emphasising attachment needs. Main proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver – avoiding a situation in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> is overwhelmed with emotion ('disorganised distress'), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.|$|E
25|$|Ivy City {{became the}} {{location}} of the District of Columbia Receiving Home for Children in 1949. The city began operating a facility for the temporary housing of mentally ill, violent, abandoned, addicted, or criminal children in 1928. The Receiving Home was charged with taking temporary care of individuals under the age of 18 who had become wards of the state. Long-term housing and care, defined as anything longer than a few weeks, was provided by the agency to <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> was assigned (such as St. Elizabeths Psychiatric Hospital, the city youth detention center, or a foster home). Originally located on the 800 block of Potomac Avenue SE, the Receiving Home moved several times over the next two decades. The agency generally leased former homes, office buildings, or warehouses for use, renovating them as needed, but the city recognized that such efforts were only temporary and that a custom-built structure, with good security as well as treatment facilities, was needed for children assigned temporarily to the Receiving Home.|$|E

500|$|The {{state of}} affairs in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> did not have this {{relationship}} he termed [...] "maternal deprivation". This term covered a range from almost complete deprivation, not uncommon in institutions, residential nurseries and hospitals, to partial deprivation where the mother, or mother substitute, was unable to give the loving care a small child needs, to mild deprivation where the child {{was removed from the}} mother's care but was looked after by someone familiar whom he trusted. Complete or almost complete deprivation could [...] "entirely cripple the capacity to make relationships". Partial deprivation could result in acute anxiety, depression, neediness and powerful emotions <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> could not regulate. The end product of such psychic disturbance could be neurosis and instability of character. However, the main focus of the monograph was on the more extreme forms of deprivation. The focus was the child's developing relationships with his mother and father and disturbed parent–child relationships in the context of almost complete deprivation rather than the earlier concept of the [...] "broken home" [...] as such.|$|E

[...] Angelou's themes of the individual's strength and ability to overcome appeared throughout Angelou's autobiographies as well. The women Angelou presented in her autobiographies, especially Caged Bird, influenced the woman Angelou became. According to Manora, three characters in Caged Bird, Angelou's mother Vivian, her grandmother Annie Henderson, and Mrs. Flowers (who helps Angelou find her voice again after her rape), collaborated to [...] "form a triad which serves as the critical matrix in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> is nurtured and sustained during her journey through Southern Black girlhood".|$|E
500|$|Treatment {{of acute}} {{rotavirus}} infection is nonspecific and involves management of symptoms and, most importantly, management of dehydration. If untreated, children can {{die from the}} resulting severe dehydration. [...] Depending on the severity of diarrhoea, treatment consists of oral rehydration therapy, during <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> is given extra water to drink that contains small amounts of salt and sugar. In 2004, the WHO and UNICEF recommended the use of low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution and zinc supplementation as a two-pronged treatment of acute diarrhoea. Some infections are serious enough to warrant hospitalisation where fluids are given by intravenous therapy or nasogastric intubation, and the child's electrolytes and blood sugar are monitored. Probiotics {{have been shown to}} reduce the duration of rotavirus diarrhoea, and according to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology [...] "effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii, diosmectite or racecadotril." [...] Rotavirus infections rarely cause other complications and for a well managed child the prognosis is excellent.|$|E

[...] Recorded on July 3, 1991 in Los Angeles, it premiered on July 30, 1991, two weeks before the release of the album. The plot of the music video directly relates to the theme of the song, combining images of a child having nightmares and images of an old man (R. G. Armstrong) with shots of the band playing the song. The child dreams that he is drowning, falling from the top of a building, covered in snakes, being chased by a truck and finally falling from a mountain while escaping the truck. During the part of the song in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> recites a prayer, he is being watched by the Sandman. Throughout the video, the picture flickers continuously.

500|$|Psychoanalytic {{concepts}} influenced Bowlby's view of attachment, in particular, {{the observations}} by Anna Freud and Dorothy Burlingham {{of young children}} separated from familiar caregivers during World War II. However, Bowlby rejected psychoanalytical explanations for early infant bonds including [...] "drive theory" [...] in which the motivation for attachment derives from gratification of hunger and libidinal drives. He called this the [...] "cupboard-love" [...] theory of relationships. In his view it failed to see attachment as a psychological bond {{in its own right}} rather than an instinct derived from feeding or sexuality. Based on ideas of primary attachment and Neo-Darwinism, Bowlby identified what he saw as fundamental flaws in psychoanalysis: the overemphasis of internal dangers rather than external threat, and the view of the development of personality via linear phases with regression to fixed points accounting for psychological distress. Bowlby instead posited that several lines of development were possible, the outcome of which depended on the interaction between the organism and the environment. In attachment this would mean that although a developing child has a propensity to form attachments, the nature of those attachments depends on the environment to <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> is exposed.|$|E
500|$|A year later, on 6 November 2007, Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{unveiled}} the government's plans in his Queen's Speech. The plans included the duty {{for parents to}} assist their children in education or training participation until the date of their 18th birthday, as well as detailing proposed moves to reform the apprenticeship system and to improve achievement for children in care. The Education and Skills Act 2008, when it came into force in the 2013 academic year, initially required participation {{in some form of}} education or training until the school year in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> turned 17, followed by the age being raised to the young person's 18th birthday in 2015. This was referred to as raising the [...] "participation age" [...] to distinguish it from the school leaving age which remains at 16. To qualify as participation the young person must be in education or training for the equivalent of one day a week (at a minimum). The local council is responsible for ensuring that a suitable place is available. The Act makes similar powers available to the National Assembly for Wales. A spokesperson for the Welsh Assembly indicated that it would want to encourage more young people to stay in education, but without compulsion, so school leavers there are not required to continue with any education or training.|$|E
