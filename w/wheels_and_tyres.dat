5|$|Initial {{testing of}} the {{prototype}} QF 25-pounder Short was completed in early December 1942. The 2/1st Field Regiment also trialled the gun in New Guinea during early 1943. Large-scale production began in early 1943, after minor modifications {{were made to the}} design, and the Army placed an initial order for 112 guns. A second order was later placed for 100 more. This lot incorporated the Mark II carriage, which had larger <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> <b>tyres</b> to prevent the problem with wheel bounce encountered by the first lot. Altogether, 213 guns were manufactured by the time production ceased in 1944. As completed, the gun's full designation was Ordnance QF 25-pounder Short (Aust) Mark I, but it was nicknamed the 'snort' by Australian soldiers.|$|E

25|$|In February 2015, Toyota Australia {{announced}} a Pro-Am series with races exclusively during that country's V8 Supercars events from 2016. Its inceptor was long-time Toyota racing driver, Neal Bates. The race cars {{are based on}} manual production models with key specifications (such as engine management, extractors and exhaust, suspension, brakes, oil cooler, <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> <b>tyres)</b> controlled to ensure their suitability and reliability while keeping costs as low as possible.|$|E
25|$|Mechanically {{the changes}} to the car had {{focussed}} on improving the traction, rather than increasing the already generous power. Double <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> <b>tyres</b> were fitted to the rear axle, to improve grip. The final drive was also split into separate drives to each side. This reduced the load on each drive, allowed the driver position to be lowered, but required the wheelbase to be shortened asymmetrically on one side by 1½"(37mm). Airbrakes were fitted, actuated by a large air cylinder. For extra streamlining the radiator air intake could be closed by a movable flap, {{for a brief period}} during the record itself.|$|E
25|$|At {{its first}} race in Brazil, the F2002 was victorious, {{being driven by}} Michael Schumacher and {{continuing}} Ferrari's trend since 1999 for its cars to win on their debut. Michael Schumacher clinched second on the grid and after a first lap altercation with Juan Pablo Montoya, took a somewhat easy win from his brother Ralf's Williams. There was some controversy surrounding tyre allocation because the team only had one F2002 chassis at the race. Therefore, Schumacher's spare car was an F2001 chassis and because the two chassis used different wheel rim designs each required separate <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> <b>tyres.</b> It was thus argued that Schumacher had in-effect twice the allocation of tyres as any other driver. The controversy was managed by Ferrari agreeing to aggregate their tyre usage between the two cars, ensuring that Schumacher used the same total number of tyres as all the other drivers.|$|E

500|$|Every year {{we change}} fewer wheels, because the <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> <b>tyres</b> {{are getting better}} and better. We changed about 20 wheels today. Five years ago, it was much worse— we'd be {{choosing}} about a hundred. Tyres are becoming much better than before. So, yes, our job is easier— except that the race generally goes faster now, so we're under a bit more pressure. Every year, there's new types of gears, new aluminium frames, new titanium frames, so it's getting more complex for us to offer neutral service. We have a list in the car of who is riding Mavic or Shimano or Campagnolo; the moment someone gets a flat tyre {{we need to think}} of a lot of things at once. Is it a titanium frame or a carbon frame or a steel frame? ...|$|E
500|$|Michelin, Dunlop and Continental {{supplied}} tyres for the race. In the Grand Prix's {{one major}} technical innovation, Michelin introduced the jante amovible: a detachable rim with a tyre already affixed, {{which could be}} quickly swapped onto {{the car in the}} event of a puncture. Unlike in the Gordon Bennett races, only the driver and his riding mechanic were allowed to work on the car during the race, hence carrying the detachable rims could save time and confer a large advantage. The conventional method of changing a tyre, which involved slicing off the old tyre with a knife, and forcing the new tyre onto the rim, generally took around fifteen minutes; replacing Michelin's rims took less than four. The FIATs each used a full set, while the Renaults and two of the Clément-Bayards used them on the rear wheels of their cars. As carrying each rim added [...] to the weight of the car over conventional <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> <b>tyres,</b> some teams—such as Itala and Panhard—could not carry them without exceeding the weight limit.|$|E
500|$|The final {{took place}} on the third day of racing. The Australians came to the {{conclusion}} that their <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> <b>tyres</b> were too heavy, so they sought to buy better cycling equipment from the defeated Germans. The Germans agreed, saying [...] "Have ours and you will win the gold medal." [...] Australia were again pitted against the Czechoslovak Vaclav Machek and Ladislav Foucek. One of the reasons behind Australia's return to form had been the return of Guyatt to a mentoring role. Guyatt had assisted them at the national championships, but they were assigned to another coach at the Olympics. Guyatt was regarded as a marketing-style motivator and he attempted to give Browne and Marchant a psychological boost. Equipped with their new machines, Browne and Marchant employed a tactical trick devised by Guyatt. The Australian staff had noticed that the Czechoslovaks had always made their final burst from a certain point from the finish. During the final, Australian team manager Bill Young stood at the said point as the Australian led out. When Browne came to the point, he pulled upwards and pre-emptively blocked the expected Czechoslovakian attack. This helped to stifle the attack and Australia went on to win the gold medal.|$|E
