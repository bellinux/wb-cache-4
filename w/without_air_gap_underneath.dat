Experiments are conducted in impedance tube {{to validate the}} analytical outcomes for three samples having different thickness. Increasing the thickness of coir fiber enhances sound absorption and shifts noise absorption peak towards low frequency. Moreover, effect of <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> on sound absorption performance of coir fiber has also been investigated. Increasing <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> thickness usually shifts the peak of absorption coefficient towards lower frequency.

Effcient particle identification {{for a wide}} momentum range and the full solid angle is required for successful reconstruction of the benchmark channels of the broad PANDA physics program. For this purpose a compact ring imaging Cherenkov detector is being developed for the barrel region of the PANDA detector. The concept and the baseline design of the PANDA Barrel DIRC were inspired by the BABAR DIRC and improved with important modifications, like fast photon timing, a compact expansion volume, and focusing optics. The required detector resolution was defined based on the PANDA PID specifications using the phase space distributions of the final state kaons produced in selected benchmark channels. To optimize the PANDA Barrel DIRC design in terms of performance and cost the baseline detector geometry {{and a number of}} design options were implemented in the simulation. The key options include the radiator dimensions, two types of expansion volume shapes, and a variety of focusing systems. The performance of the detector designs was quantified in terms of single photon Cherenkov angle resolution and photon yield. It was found that the number of radiators can be reduced by about 40 % without loss in performance. A compound spherical lens <b>without</b> <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> was found to be a promising focusing system. An optimized Barrel DIRC design meeting the PID requirements includes three radiator bars per at section, the compound lens <b>without</b> <b>air</b> <b>gap,</b> a compact prism-shaped EV, and a total of 192 Microchannel-Plate PMTs as photosensors.

The rules are that the oscillation frequency should be at least 15 kHz and that the oscillation amplitude be as large as possible to ensure a greater film thickness and to allow the bearing to reach its stable equilibrium quickly. The proposed journal bearing is made from AL 2024 -T 3, of 20. 02 mm outer diameter, 600 mm length and 2 mm thickness.

This could enable laser welding of sheet metals with lighter fastening solutions and less time-consuming tack welding alternatives. A feasibility study was carried out to study four different corner joint types for 2 mm thick cold-rolled steel sheet by using filler-free laser welding. The aim of the research was to get more experimental knowledge about the laser welding of corner joints. Also possible benefits concerning faster manufacturing times and smaller costs by developing fastening applications for small batch laser welding was to be studied in practice. The 170 mm long joints were welded <b>without</b> <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> or pressing. All corner joint types proved to be weldable with a continuous wave Yb:YAG diode-pumped disk laser. It was also found during the experiment that laser welding enables the use of light and inexpensive fasteners such as magnetic holders instead of traditional clamps and fixturing. With some joint types, the insufficient fastening power of magnetic fasteners against distortions was compensated by making a spot-like laser tack weld {{at the end of the}} weld before welding the actual seam.

40|$|Moisture induced {{damages to}} {{building}} envelopes {{can result in}} microbial growth possibly affecting the health and wellbeing of occupants. Recent failing structures and damaged buildings indicate a lack of tools to estimate risk of mould growth and moisture damage. In this work a so-called mould resistance design (MRD) model has been applied for mapping the risk for mould growth {{on a number of}} wood-containing wall structures. The MRD model introduces an engineering approach to moisture safety design in a similar way as for structural design, where load and resistance is compared. The MRD model introduces and quantifies the concepts of climatic exposure and material resistance and compares them through an MRD index. This MRD index incorporates a limit state, which gives the critical dose of exposure for a given resistance to initiate onset of mould growth.   Three conceptual wall structures were evaluated and analyzed in terms of MRD index: two wall systems with an <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> and one wall system without. A parametric study investigating the effect of parameter variation on MRD index was conducted. Evaluated parameters were: climate (geographic location), orientation, air changes per hour in the <b>air</b> <b>gap,</b> driving rain penetrating the facade layer, exterior plaster properties and wood type. The simulations were performed using the hygrothermal calculation software WUFI. The results indicate that the wall systems with a ventilated <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> performs better in terms of MRD index i. e. suggests a lower risk of initiation of mould growth than the wall system <b>without</b> <b>air</b> <b>gap.</b> The results of orientation variation show that wall systems perform differently dependent on layering structure. The inherent water sorption properties of the exterior plaster are shown to have a large effect on the results. In addition, uncertainties were found on how to accurately include hydrophobicity as a parameter in the model. The report concludes that geographical location and its specific climate is the most important parameter to consider when designing for moisture safety. The MRD model is recommended to be used in combination with traditional moisture safety evaluation...|$|R
40|$|With the {{anticipation}} of increasing system demands, the need to integrate multiple functions (e. g. digital, analog, high voltage, etc.) on a single chip has become apparent. Power integrated circuits (PICs) combining high-voltage, high-current output devices with low-voltage logic and control elements have improved performance and reliability, and reduced cost and system size compared to the discrete approach. A major issue {{for the design of}} this kind of circuits is the substrate cross-talk between adjacent devices that prevents normal operation through latch-up mechanism. Some basic solutions for isolation in PICs, such as the traditional p-n junction isolation (JI) and the dielectric isolation (DI), have been proposed. Among the two, JI requires large silicon area and suffers from large leakage current at severe conditions. Although the superiority of DI offered by silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology results in a much smaller chip area and minimum leakage currents, the higher wafer cost and lower heat dissipation capability limit its use only to niche applications. In this thesis, a novel isolation structure with ultra-deep trench and backside etching is proposed. It can achieve complete isolation with low wafer cost, reduced isolation area, and high heat dissipation capability. First, the design and operation of the novel isolation structure as well as the 2 -D device and thermal simulation results is discussed. Then, the layout design and fabrication process for experimental characterization of the novel isolation structure are presented. Finally, experimental techniques for characterizing the electrical and thermal performance of the devices in both the novel isolation structure and SOl are presented. The simulation and experimental results show that the novel isolation structure can provide complete isolation as that of the SOl isolation structure, but with an average of 26 % improvement on heat capability during the power device turn-off transient with short gate pulse duration. After the system is heated more, the heat capability of the novel isolation structure is not as good as that of the SOI isolation structure due to the low thermal conductivity of the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> <b>underneath</b> the power device.

Impact initiation of explosives {{is one of the}} more frequent referred to topics of Prof (Dr) Manfred Held, an internationally renown ballistician, who passed away in 2011. This thesis includes a cross-referenced bibliography of most of his published papers and patents and focuses on one of his more frequently referred topics, the impact of initiation of explosives. Experimental data from impacts against bare explosives, covered and confined with and <b>without</b> <b>air</b> <b>gaps,</b> and explosive and projectile dimensions are first used to validate finite difference computations required to extend and properly evaluate the database. The analyses include explosives (PBX 9404, Comp. B (65 / 35), Octol (70 / 30), H 6, TNT) and projectiles (aluminum, steel, copper, tantalum) of much varied properties and sensitivities. Assuming that close examination of the experimental data proposed by Held and others to rate the relative threshold sensitivity of explosives to impact (incl., (v 2 d), (u 2 d), (ρv 2 d) and (ρ 1 / 2 v 2 d)) deviate significantly from constancy, in some cases greater than 50 percent. It is found that the product of interfacial impact pressure and well-defined projectile diameter is a much more reliable predictor of the impact sensitivity of a bare explosive based on the smaller deviation from mean values relative to the aforementioned terms.

PURPOSE The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing this information notice (IN) to inform addressees {{of the results of}} Hemyc electrical raceway fire barrier system (ERFBS) full-scale fire tests. The Hemyc ERFBS did not perform for one hour as designed because shrinkage of the Hemyc ERFBS occurred during the testing. It is expected that recipients will review the information for applicability to their facilities and consider actions as appropriate to avoid similar problems. However, suggestions contained in this information notice are not NRC requirements; therefore, no specific action or written response is required. BACKGROUND The Hemyc ERFBS, manufactured by Promatec, Inc., has been installed at nuclear power plants (NPPs) to protect circuits in accordance with regulatory requirements (Reference 1) and plant-specific commitments. As a result of fire protection inspections, unresolved items (URIs) were opened at some nuclear power stations due to questions raised regarding the fire resistance capability of the Hemyc ERFBS (Reference 2). The Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) performed a review of the Hemyc ERFBS (Reference 3) and requested the NRC’s Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) to perform confirmatory testing of this ERFBS. RES performed the testing at the Omega Point Laboratories in Elmendorf, Texas.

The authors have developed a poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) hollow fiber membrane scaffold that will provide support for cell culture, allow pseudovascularisation in vitro and provide channels for angiogenesis in vivo. The authors produced PDLLGA flat sheet membranes using 1, 4 -dioxane and 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (NMP) as solvents and water as the nonsolvent, and hollow fiber membranes, using NMP and water, by dry/wet- and wet-spinning. The resulting fibers had an outer diam. of 700 micro m and an inner diam. of 250 micro m with 0. 2 - 1. 0 micro m pores on the culture surface. It was shown that varying the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> and temp. when spinning changed the morphol. of the fibers. The introduction of a 50 mm <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> caused a dense skin of 5 micro m thick to form, compared to a skin of 0. 5 micro m thick <b>without</b> an <b>air</b> <b>gap.</b> Spinning at 40 DegC produced fibers with a more open central section in the wall that contained more, larger macrovoids compared to fibers spun at 20 DegC. Culture of the immortalized osteogenic cell line 560 pZIPv. neo (pZIP) was carried out on the PDLLGA flat sheets in static-culture and in a PDLLGA hollow fiber bioreactor under counter-current flow conditions. Attachment and proliferation was statistically similar to tissue culture polystyrene on the flat sheets and was also successful in the hollow fiber bioreactor.

Thus, our structure is based on a thermal actuator that exploits the Joule heating effect and has been improved using the springy length properties of MEMS chevron beams. The Joule heating effect results in a difference in temperature and therefore displacement in the beams (actuators). Simulation results show that a maximum force of 4. 4 mN and a maximum flow rate of 16 μL/min can be obtained by applying an AC voltage as low as 8 V at different frequencies ranging from 1 to 32 Hz. The maximum temperature was a problem at the chevron beams and the center shaft. Thus, to locally increase the temperature of the chevron beams alone and not that of the pumping diaphragm: (1) The <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> 2 μm <b>underneath</b> and above the device layer were optimized for heat transfer. (2) Release holes and providing fins were created at the center shaft and actuator, respectively, to decrease the temperature by approximately 10 °C. (3) We inserted and used a polymer tube to serve as an insulator and eliminate leakage problems in the fluidic channel...|$|R

As a result different <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> for designing Dual Rotor Hybrid Excitation Machine (DRHEFSM) are being investigated. 0. 4 mm <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> has been chosen because of the influence of the existing Hybrid Excitation Flux Switching Machine (HEFSM) that used total 0. 8 mm <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> and successful in performing the machine operating principle. Furthermore, the machine also successfully obtaining good result in motor torque and speed. Total 0. 8 mm <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> are being used for the new design, 0. 4 mm for the outer rotor <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> and 0. 4 mm for the inner rotor <b>air</b> <b>gap.</b> Besides that, 0. 3 mm and 0. 5 mm <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> are being investigated in order to analyse the optimum <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> for the design machine.
