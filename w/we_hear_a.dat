25|$|In {{the second}} sketch, the {{shortest}} of the three, {{we hear the}} TARDIS materialise and the Doctor inquiring where they are. Then <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> scream, as a woman runs out of a building. The Doctor apologises, just as the camera focuses on a sign for ladies toilets.|$|E
25|$|When <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> car honk, {{we would}} {{determine}} which car triggers the honk by which car {{we see is}} the spatially closest to the honk. It's a spatial congruent example by combining visual and auditory stimuli. On the other hand, {{the sound and the}} pictures of a TV program would be integrated as structural congruent by combining visual and auditory stimuli. However, if the sound and the pictures were not meaningfully fit, we would segregate the two stimuli. Therefore, whether spatial or structural congruent should not only combine the stimuli but also be determined by understanding.|$|E

[...] "Every day <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> song that we produced on the radio, me and Ari call each other up at 2 o'clock in the morning: 'We should have left that snare in.' 'We should've took that snare out,'" [...] Mars said. [...] "It's just a sickness that we have." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Pam came up {{with the}} title 'Irresistible', and as she started talking about the whole concept we {{immediately}} became inspired and began working on the music. You know, when <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> concept or a title that we like—no matter if it's ours or somebody else's—both Anders and I {{get a feel for the}} song's vibe; a feel for whether a keyboard or guitar should be used to give it a certain character, be it upbeat or melancholic. So, when Pam mentioned the title, we immediately {{came up with}} the tempo and the whole feeling of the song, and then she {{came up with the}} lyrics. There was a really good flow to that song. We played around with the melody, put down the demo, and it was done." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{budgetary}} constraints, {{both the}} on-set and post-production sound was poorly recorded. Anderegg wrote that this, {{in combination with}} Welles' fast-paced camera movements and editing, makes the Shakespearean dialogue more difficult to understand. Many scenes are shot in long shots or with character's backs facing the camera, most likely for practical purposes when actors were not present, creating more sound problems. [...] "In effect," [...] Anderegg writes, [...] "Welles generates a constant tension between what we see and what <b>we</b> <b>hear,</b> <b>a</b> tension that points to the ambiguous status of language in its relation to action." [...] During the Battle of Shrewsbury sequence Welles used a complex and layered soundtrack that included the sounds of swords and armor clanking, soldiers grunting and screaming, bones breaking, boots {{in the mud and}} the film's musical score to add to the chaos of the scene.|$|E
500|$|At {{the hinge}} {{of the film}} is a scene in an unusual late night theater called Club Silencio where a {{performer}} announces [...] "No hay banda (there is no band)... but yet <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> band", variated between English, Spanish and French. Described as [...] "the most original and stunning sequence in an original and stunning film", Rebekah del Rio's Spanish a cappella rendition of [...] "Crying", named [...] "Llorando", is praised as [...] "show-stopping... except that there's no show to stop" [...] in the sparsely attended Club Silencio. Lynch wanted to use Roy Orbison's version of [...] "Crying" [...] in Blue Velvet, but changed his mind when he heard Orbison's [...] "In Dreams". Del Rio, who popularized the Spanish version and who received her first recording contract {{on the basis of the}} song, stated that Lynch flew to Nashville where she was living, and she sang the song for him once and did not know he was recording her. Lynch wrote a part for her in the film and used the version she sang for him in Nashville. The song tragically serenades the lovers Betty and Rita, who sit spellbound and weeping, moments before their relationship disappears and is replaced by Diane and Camilla's dysfunction. According to one film scholar, the song and the entire theater scene marks the disintegration of Betty's and Rita's personalities, as well as their relationship. With the use of multiple languages and a song to portray such primal emotions, one film analyst states that Lynch exhibits his distrust of intellectual discourse and chooses to make sense through images and sounds. The disorienting effect of the music playing although del Rio is no longer there is described as [...] "the musical version of Magritte's painting Ceci n'est pas une pipe".|$|E

The heavens, which were to the psalmist but a witness of God's greatness, were to the Mesopotamians the very majesty of godhead, the highest ruler, Anu.
