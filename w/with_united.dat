5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, No.1 and No.6 Squadrons were {{scheduled}} to be re-equipped with General Dynamics F-111C strike aircraft from 1968. Mechanical problems <b>with</b> <b>United</b> States Air Force (USAF) F-111s caused the RAAF to postpone its acceptance of these aircraft, however, leading for a requirement for an interim aircraft to equip both squadrons. McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs were leased from the USAF, and No.6 Squadron was re-equipped with these aircraft between September and October 1970. The Phantoms proved highly successful, though one was severely damaged on its first flight at Amberley when it attempted an emergency landing and the arrester cable failed.

5|$|Fame was {{the last}} musical film to be {{produced}} by MGM, before the studio merged <b>with</b> <b>United</b> Artists in 1981.

Its presentation of musical numbers {{in the style of}} a music video—through the use of quick cuts with multiple angles and crowded, kinetic frames—was a major influence on other 1980s films in the dance film genre, such as Flashdance (1983), Footloose (1984) and Dirty Dancing (1987).
