5|$|In 1908, Charles F. Brown, {{who entered}} the laundry {{business}} in the Midwest in 1892, moved to Portland to build the Yale Laundry Building, and to operate an industrial power laundry on its premises. The building's basement contained boilers to heat <b>wash</b> <b>water,</b> and {{the main part of}} the first floor had beams capable of supporting heavy washing machines. The first and second floors had large windows to admit light and to release heat and steam. At the time of the building's construction, Portland had 68 commercial laundries of varied types and sizes. By 1916, the Yale Laundry, one of the larger laundries, employed 125 people, many of whom were women.|$|E
5|$|While the {{question}} of whether Fermi's experiment had produced element 93 was stalemated, two additional claims of the discovery of the element appeared, although unlike Fermi, they both claimed to have observed it in nature. The first of these claims was by Czech engineer Odolen Koblic in 1934 when he extracted a small amount of material from the <b>wash</b> <b>water</b> of heated pitchblende. He proposed the name bohemium for the element, but after being analyzed {{it turned out that the}} sample was a mixture of tungsten and vanadium. The other claim, in 1938 by Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and French chemist Yvette Cauchois, claimed to have discovered the new element via spectroscopy in minerals. They named their element sequanium, but the claim was discounted because the prevailing theory at the time was that if it existed at all, element 93 would not exist naturally. However, as neptunium does in fact occur in nature in trace amounts, as demonstrated when it was found in uranium ore in 1952, it is possible that Hulubei and Cauchois did in fact observe neptunium.|$|E

The Regulation of Ministry of Health no. 1908 year of 2003 mentions that the <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> used to <b>wash</b> utensils should not contain germ counted > 100 colonies/ml and it should not contain E. coli.

The study was observational, with cross sectional study design. Study subjects were 46 food vendors. There was a significant relation between the handling of washing dishes (p= 0. 022) with the presence of E. coli in the <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> of utensil. There was no significant relation between the physical condition of the source of water (p= 1. 000), the handling of washing dishes (p= 0. 543), personal hygiene condition handlers (p= 1. 000), and the type of <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> used to clean the utensil (p= 1. 000) with the number of colonies of bacteria in the <b>washing</b> <b>water.</b> There was no significant relation between the physical condition of the source of water (p= 0. 247), condition handlers personal hygiene (p= 0. 900), and types of <b>water</b> used to <b>wash</b> the utensil (p= 0. 247) with the presence of E. coli in the <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> of utensil.

This experiment aim to determine addition of rice <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> effect, optimal volume and time interval on growth and yield of white {{oyster mushroom}} (Pleurotus ostreatus). This experiment is carried out at mushroomâ€™s house Maduraya Agro Kamal. The research design used was factorial completely randomized design with two factors. First factor is addition rice <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> volume with 4 level, that is without addition rice <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> (A 0), addition rice <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> as much as 20 ml/ 1000 g substrat (A 1), 40 ml/ 1000 g substrat (A 2) and 60 ml/ 1000 g substrat (A 3). Second factor is addition time interval that consists of 2 level, that is 2 days (B 1) and 4 days (B 2). Experiment result shows that interaction between volume treatment and addition time interval give effect on fruit body total. Addition rice <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> volume treatment give real effect on maximal pileus fruit width.

25|$|The V-fold belt {{is similar}} to the belt filter press with the main {{difference}} being that only a single belt, folded along the centreline is used. The technology has not been widely proven. A final dry weight solids content of 9-13% can usually be achieved; this is smaller than competing technologies. Currently this technology is suited to small-scale applications (up to approximately 3000 L of slurry per hour as the maximum belt size is 0.75 m). V-fold belts have a small footprint, low energy and <b>wash</b> <b>water</b> consumption and low capital and operating costs. They are self-tracking and can process sludge of varying composition, reducing operator involvement.|$|E
25|$|Storage of {{butadiene}} as a compressed, liquified gas {{carries a}} specific and unusual hazard. Over time, polymerization can begin, creating a crust of solidified material (popcorn polymer, {{named for its}} appearance) inside the vapor space of the cylinder. If the cylinder is then disturbed, the crust can contact the liquid and initiate an auto-catalytic polymerization. The heat released accelerates the reaction, possibly leading to cylinder rupture. Inhibitors are typically added to reduce this hazard, but butadiene cylinders should still be considered short-shelf life items. The hazard presented by popcorn polymer is also present in bulk commercial storage tanks. It {{is important to keep}} the oxygen concentration in the tanks and any process <b>wash</b> <b>water</b> low {{in order to reduce the}} rate of polymerization.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{immersion}} freezing behavior of birch pollen, i. e. its ice nucleating active (INA) macromolecules, was investigated at the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS). For that, <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> {{of two different}} birch pollen samples with different regional origin (Northern birch and Southern birch) were used. The immersion freezing of droplets generated from the pollen <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> was already observed at temperatures higher than &minus; 20 &deg;C, for both samples. Main differences between the Northern birch pollen and the Southern birch pollen were obvious in a temperature range, between &minus; 18 &deg;C and &minus; 24 &deg;C, where the ice fraction increased with decreasing temperature. There, the Northern birch pollen <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> featured two different slopes, with one being steeper and one being similar to {{the slope of the}} Southern birch pollen <b>washing</b> <b>water.</b> As we assume single INA macromolecules being the reason for the ice nucleation, we concluded that the Northern birch pollen are able to produce at least two different types of INA macromolecules.

40|$|Despite {{the overall}} high {{efficacy}} of cyclodextrins {{to accelerate the}} treatment of soil aquifer remediation by in-situ soil flushing, the use in practice remains limited {{because of the high}} costs of cyclodextrin and high concentrations needed to significantly reduce the treatment time. The current study tested the potential of activated carbon to treat <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> originating from soil flushing in order to selectively separate hydrocarbon contaminants from <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> containing cyclodextrin and subsequently reuse the cyclodextrin solution for reinfiltration. A high recovery of the cyclodextrin from the <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> would reduce the costs and would make the technique economically feasible for soil remediation. This study aimed to investigate whether cyclodextrin can pass through the activated carbon filter without reducing the cyclodextrin concentration when the contaminated <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> is treated and whether the presence of cyclodextrin negatively affects the purification potential of activated carbon to remove the organic pollutants from the pumped soil water. Lab-scale column experiments showed that with the appropriate activated carbon 100 % of cyclodextrin (randomly-methylated-Î²-cyclodextrin) can be recovered from the <b>washing</b> <b>water</b> and that the effect on the efficiency of activated carbon to remove the hydrocarbon contaminants remains limited. These results show that additional field tests are useful to make in-situ soil flushing with cyclodextrin both a technical and an economical interesting technique.
