5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>period</b> typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E

25|$|The {{withdrawal}} symptoms associated with morphine addiction are usually experienced {{shortly before the}} time of the next scheduled dose, sometimes within as early as a few hours (usually 6h to 12h) after the last administration. Early symptoms include watery eyes, insomnia, diarrhea, runny nose, yawning, dysphoria, sweating, and in some cases a strong drug craving. Severe headache, restlessness, irritability, loss of appetite, body aches, severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, tremors, and even stronger and more intense drug craving appear as the syndrome progresses. Severe depression and vomiting are very common. During the acute <b>withdrawal</b> <b>period,</b> systolic and diastolic blood pressures increase, usually beyond premorphine levels, and heart rate increases, which have potential to cause a heart attack, blood clot, or stroke.|$|E

40|$|Based on the 'endogenous {{dopamine}} sensitization' {{hypothesis of}} schizophrenia {{the present study}} employed a repeated amphetamine administration regime in order to investigate the behavioral, neurochemical and neuroanatomical consequences following short- and long-term <b>withdrawal</b> <b>periods.</b> The escalating amphetamine administration schedule consisted of three injections per day over a 6 -day period with the dosage ranging from 1 to 8 mg/kg. It was demonstrated that following both short- (4 days) and long-term (66 days) <b>withdrawal</b> <b>periods</b> latent inhibition (LI) and prepulse inhibition (PPI), two translational paradigms highly relevant to schizophrenia, were disrupted. A challenge injection verified sensitization in two different cohorts of animals at 40 and 70 days following cessation of treatment. Neurochemical evaluation demonstrated a reduction in dopamine levels in the caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens core and shell {{as well as an}} enhanced utilization ratio in the caudate-putamen after both <b>withdrawal</b> <b>periods.</b> Similar to the findings from post-mortem studies of brains of schizophrenic patients, a downregulation of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD 67) immunoreactivity was found in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and amygdala in amphetamine pretreated animals following longer <b>withdrawal</b> <b>periods.</b> This was not accompanied by enhanced neurotoxicity or reactive gliosis as demonstrated by the immunohistological analysis using the apoptotic marker activated Caspase- 3 and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein; a marker for astrocytes) following both short- and long-term <b>withdrawal</b> <b>periods.</b> In conclusion, it is suggested that these findings constitute a highly reliable and valid animal model of schizophrenia...|$|R

The birds fed furazolidone-medicated feed were housed in isolated pens {{in a manner}} to prevent any cross contamination from an adjoining treatment. Furazolidone-medicated feed was supplied to the ration for 14 days prior to withdrawal with two exceptions; the controls were not fed medicated feed, and a 400 g/ton treatment was fed for 24 hr prior to processing.

40|$|Background: Use of {{antimicrobials}} like sulfonamides {{in production}} of layers {{is a public}} health risk since it inevitably results in sulfonamide residues in eggs. The presence of the residues {{may be influenced by}} knowledge, attitudes and practices of farmers regarding use of sulfonamides (and other antimicrobials) in poultry. Objective: The study aimed at assessing the possible contribution of the knowledge, attitudes and practices of poultry farmers to the presence/levels of sulfonamide residues in hen eggs. Methods: A descriptive cross sectional study was done in the 5 political divisions (and surroundings) of Kampala district. Sixty farmers were systematically sampled from a list of poultry farmers in Kampala and a semi-structured questionnaire administered. Each farmer provided sixty eggs for analysis of sulfadiazine and sulfamethazine residues. Whole eggs were homogenized in acetonitrile and centrifuged twice, extracts evaporated and residues dissolved in mobile phase (32 : 68, methanol: potassium di-hydrogen phosphate). Fats were removed using hexane while anhydrous sodium chloride was added to break emulsions. Extracts were analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector. Results: Ninety-five percent of the farmers never observed <b>withdrawal</b> <b>periods</b> although 80 % of them knew the importance of <b>withdrawal</b> <b>periods.</b> However, farmers noted that they play a great role in ensuring a safe food supply.

40|$|Rationale: It has {{previously}} been shown that drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that inhibit seizure activity during ethanol withdrawal, fail to alleviate the potentiated withdrawal seen following repeated episodes of withdrawal when administered during each withdrawal episode. Acute administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor competitive antagonist, CGP 39551, {{has been shown to}} inhibit seizure activity during ethanol withdrawal, and, when administered during the periods of repeated diazepam withdrawal, it blocked the reduction in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizure threshold seen following a final, untreated withdrawal. Objectives: The aim of the current study was to determine if CGP 39551 could alter final ethanol-withdrawal symptoms when administered during the acute intermittent <b>withdrawal</b> <b>periods.</b> Methods: Mice were chronically treated with ethanol-containing liquid diet for either 30 days continuously (single withdrawal) or with 8 -h <b>withdrawal</b> <b>periods</b> on day 16 and day 23 of treatment (repeated withdrawal). Control animals received a control diet for the same period of time. On the final withdrawal animals were tested for behavioural signs of withdrawal. The effect of CGP 39551 administered acutely on withdrawal [up to 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i. p.) ] or during the intermittent <b>withdrawal</b> <b>periods</b> (10 mg/kg, i. p.) was examined. Results: Acute administration of CGP 39551 failed to inhibit handling-induced convulsions in the single-withdrawal or repeated-withdrawal group and had no effect on either decreased exploration or increased sensitivity to PTZ seen in withdrawal. Surprisingly, when CGP 39551 was administered during periods of repeated ethanol withdrawal a potentiation of seizure activity was seen in the final, untreated withdrawal. This potentiation of seizure activity, compared with vehicle-treated animals, was not seen when CGP 39551 was given whilst animals had access to ethanol (single-withdrawal group and repeated-withdrawal group where CGP 39551 treatment was non-contingent with withdrawal episodes). However, the decrease in exploration seen during withdrawal was potentiated in repeated-withdrawal animals treated with CGP 39551 irrespective of the time at which the CGP 39551 was administered. Conclusions: Treatment with an NMDA receptor-competitive antagonist potentiated the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome in animals with previous experience of ethanol withdrawal...|$|R

40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that many veterinarians may not use analgesics in livestock for routine surgical procedures or painful disease states. To investigate this, we conducted a national mail survey of {{a random sample of}} 1431 Canadian veterinarians (response rate, 50. 1 %). Questions primarily concerned veterinarians' analgesic usage for common surgeries and medical conditions in beef and dairy cattle, pigs, and horses, and attitudes toward pain management. More than 90 % of veterinarians used analgesic drugs for equine surgeries, for cesarean section in sows and cows, and for bovine claw amputation and omentopexy. However, in these and other categories, the analgesics used were often inadequate, and many veterinarians did not give analgesics to young animals. When castrated, 6 mo of age, and 95. 8 % of horses. Respondents largely agreed that there are no long-acting, cost-effective analgesics available for use in livestock (median rating 8 / 10; interquartile range 4 - 9), and that the long or unknown <b>withdrawal</b> <b>periods</b> of some drugs outweighed the benefits of using them (median rating 7 / 10; interquartile range 4 - 9).

40|$|Lidocaine is {{a topical}} {{anaesthetic}} drug used in dairy cows for laparotomy (caesarean section, abomasal displacement). Because {{there are no}} registered drugs for this indication, it can be applied under the so-called Cascade rules (off-label use), with the restriction that the off-label <b>withdrawal</b> <b>periods</b> of 7 days for milk and 28 days for meat are taken into account. In animals, lidocaine is rapidly metabolised into various metabolites, one being 2, 6 -dimethylaniline (DMA) which is reported to possess carcinogenic and mutagenic properties and detected also in milk. To investigate whether the off-label <b>withdrawal</b> <b>periods</b> are long enough to exclude the presence of lidocaine and DMA, and potential other metabolites, in edible products, a study was performed with eight dairy cows treated with lidocaine by injection in the abdominal muscles. At various time points blood samples, milk and urine were collected. Four animals were slaughtered 3. 5 h after treatment, the other four after 48. 5 h. The injection site, meat, liver and kidney were analysed for levels of lidocaine, DMA, monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and 3 -OH-lidocaine. It was shown that DMA is an important metabolite in dairy cows and can be detected in both meat and milk. In addition, also MEGX, 3 -OH-lidocaine and three other metabolites were identified {{and to some extent}} quantified. These metabolites were 4 -OH-lidocaine, lidocaine-N-oxide and 4 -hydroxy-DMA. The latter compound was the most important metabolite in urine. However, levels in milk and meat decreased rapidly after the application. Overall, it can be concluded that the off-label withdrawal times of 7 and 28 days for milk and meat, respectively, guarantee the absence of detectable levels of lidocaine and metabolites...|$|R
