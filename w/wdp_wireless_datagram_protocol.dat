50|$|WAP Push was {{specified}} {{on top of}} <b>Wireless</b> <b>Datagram</b> <b>Protocol</b> (WDP); as such, it can {{be delivered}} over any WDP-supported bearer, such as GPRS or SMS. Most GSM networks have {{a wide range of}} modified processors, but GPRS activation from the network is not generally supported, so WAP Push messages have to be delivered on top of the SMS bearer.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Wireless</b> <b>Datagram</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>WDP),</b> a {{protocol}} in WAP architecture, covers the Transport Layer Protocols in the Internet model. As a general transport service, WDP offers {{to the upper}} layers an invisible interface independent of the underlying network technology used. In consequence of the interface common to transport protocols, the upper layer protocols of the WAP architecture can operate independent of the underlying wireless network. By letting only the transport layer deal with physical network-dependent issues, global interoperability can be acquired using mediating gateways.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} Harvard User-Level Metricom Radio driver (HUMR), a {{substrate}} {{for development of}} <b>wireless</b> <b>datagram</b> routing <b>protocols,</b> and Any-Path Routing without Loops (APRL), a distance-vector, <b>wireless</b> <b>datagram</b> routing <b>protocol</b> developed on HUMR that provably does not acquire routes that contain loops. Reachability between hosts changes constantly on a wireless, mobile network. HUMR, our radio IP implementation, uses link-level neighbor acquisition and loss reports from Metricom spreadspectrum radios to perform truly dynamic discovery of a host's radio neighbors and their IP-to-MAC address mappings, without requiring any statically configured state in hosts. Unlike almost all IP packet drivers, HUMR is implemented entirely at application level, and is therefore portable, simple, and extensible. APRL's loop- [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The bottom-most {{protocol}} in the suite, the <b>Wireless</b> <b>Datagram</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>WDP),</b> {{functions as}} an adaptation layer that makes every data network {{look a bit}} like UDP to the upper layers by providing unreliable transport of data with two 16-bit port numbers (origin and destination). All the upper layers view WDP as {{one and the same}} protocol, which has several [...] "technical realizations" [...] on top of other [...] "data bearers" [...] such as SMS, USSD, etc. On native IP bearers such as GPRS, UMTS packet-radio service, or PPP on top of a circuit-switched data connection, WDP is in fact exactly UDP.|$|R

2500|$|The User <b>Datagram</b> <b>Protocol</b> is a {{connectionless}} <b>datagram</b> <b>protocol.</b> Like IP, it is a best effort, [...] "unreliable" [...] protocol. Reliability {{is addressed}} through error detection using a weak checksum algorithm. UDP is typically used for {{applications such as}} streaming media (audio, video, Voice over IP etc.) where on-time arrival {{is more important than}} reliability, or for simple query/response applications like DNS lookups, where the overhead of setting up a reliable connection is disproportionately large. Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a <b>datagram</b> <b>protocol</b> that is designed for real-time data such as streaming audio and video.|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. Electrical EngineeringIn recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in real-time and delay sensitive applications. This is partly due to the increase in the use of video and audio streaming services. Most of these services depend on the User <b>Datagram</b> <b>Protocol</b> which is known as a fast and best effort protocol. However, {{there is no guarantee that}} packets sent via User <b>Datagram</b> <b>Protocol</b> will be received in their entirety. This is due to the absence of any packet error recovery mechanism in User <b>Datagram</b> <b>Protocol.</b> The purpose of this dissertation is therefore to investigate and evaluate the performance of raptor codes in packet based wireless networks...|$|R
