5|$|The native Mesolithic {{populations were}} slow in {{gradually}} assimilating the agricultural way of life, beginning <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> use of ceramics. It took {{a thousand years}} into the Neolithic period before they adopted animal husbandry (which became especially important to them) and plant cultivation to any appreciable degree. When they eventually developed interest in the more fertile areas utilized by the late Danubian cultures, they became the threat that compelled the Danubian farmers to fortify their settlements. The native post-Mesolithic groups expanded beyond the traditional Danubian areas of agricultural development, moving also into ecologically less favorable environments, which included utilization of sandy soils.|$|E

Along with providing guitar work to The Mars Volta's studio albums, The Bedlam In Goliath and Octahedron, and Rodríguez-López's solo albums Se Dice Bisonte, No Búfalo and Calibration (Is Pushing Luck and Key Too Far), he functioned as executive producer for Rodríguez-López's directorial film debut, The Sentimental Engine Slayer. The film debuted at the Rotterdam Film Festival in February 2010. Along with work on the film, Frusciante and Rodríguez-López have released two collaborative records in May 2010. The first is the album Omar Rodriguez-Lopez & John Frusciante, an album <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> two of them, the other a quartet record, Sepulcros de Miel, consisting of Rodríguez-López, Frusciante, Juan Alderete and Marcel Rodríguez-López.|$|E
5|$|Madonna has {{embarked}} on four promotional tours {{for the release of}} her studio albums Music (2000), American Life (2003), Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005) and Hard Candy (2008). She appeared at charity concerts like Live Aid (1985), Live 8 (2005) and Live Earth (2007), and headlined the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show in 2012, which at that time was the most-watched halftime show in history. Madonna remains the highest-grossing solo touring artist of all time, with over $1.4 billion earned from her concert tours throughout her career. Since Billboard Boxscore began reporting in 1990, Madonna has grossed over $1.31 billion in concert ticket sales; she first crossed a billion gross with The MDNA Tour. Overall, Madonna ranks third, <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>The</b> Rolling Stones ($1.84 billion) and U2 ($1.67 billion) ahead of her. During the London stop of her 2006 Confessions Tour, Madonna became the first performer to be inducted into the Wembley Arena Square of Fame.|$|E

5|$|The {{metric system}} was first {{implemented}} during the French Revolution (1790s) <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> metre and kilogram as standards of length and mass respectively. In the 1830s Carl Friedrich Gauss laid {{the foundations for}} a coherent system based on length, mass, and time. In the 1860s a group working {{under the auspices of}} the British Association for the Advancement of Science formulated the requirement for a coherent system of units with base units and derived units. The inclusion of electrical units into the system was hampered by the customary use of more than one set of units, until 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi identified the need to define one single electrical quantity as a fourth base quantity alongside the original three base quantities.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to competition, the 200 m {{remained}} Bolt's primary event, beating Justin Gatlin's meet record in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Bolt had aspired to run under twenty seconds to claim a season's best but, {{despite the fact that}} bad weather had impaired his run, he was happy to end the meeting <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> victory. However, a sub-20-second finish was soon his, as he set a new personal best of 19.88 s at the 2006 Athletissima Grand Prix in Lausanne, Switzerland, finishing behind Xavier Carter and Tyson Gay to earn a bronze medal. Bolt had focused his athletics aims, stating that 2006 was a year to gain experience. Also, he was more keen on competing over longer distances, setting his sights on running regularly in both 200 m and 400 m events within the next two years.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> right amount of ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E

25|$|The {{thrusting}} swords {{such as the}} rapier {{and eventually}} the smallsword were designed to impale their targets quickly and inflict deep stab wounds.
