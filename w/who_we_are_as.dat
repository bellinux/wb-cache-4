[...] The song is seen as representing the emotion of his campaign effort.

[...] The Native American Journalists Association issued a statement calling {{the publication of the}} poll, and the reporting of its significance, as not only inaccurate and misleading but unethical. [...] "The reporters and editors behind this story must have known that it would be used as justification for the continued use of these harmful, racist mascots.

[...] The NCAN and NARW requested sympathetic religious women {{to take part in}} a protest on Pentecost Sunday, May 22, 1983, [...] "as a visible witness to the arrogant use of power in a male dominated church." [...] Small protests were organized at cathedrals in Chicago and Washington, D.C. Ms. magazine reported that Sister Donna Quinn, president of NCAN, said that the Pope's demand for obedience [...] "tramples on <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> women religious in the United States". Ms. writer Mary Kay Blakely added that she thought Mansour was correct in saying that [...] "the Pope doesn't understand the American people, and he doesn't understand the American nun". Divided over the Mansour affair, the Catholic Theological Society of America passed an unsuccessful resolution asking for dialog rather than simple administrative decisions which [...] "violate both the theological meaning of authority in the church and the sacredness of conscience of church members".|$|E

Farage has characterised his party's growth as [...] "a very English rebellion", and has described UKIP as [...] "unashamedly patriotic, proud to be <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> a nation". The political scientist Richard Hayton argued that UKIP's British unionism reflects [...] "Anglo-Britishness", a perspective that blurs the distinction between Britain and England. With Mycock, Hayton argued that in conflating Englishness with Britishness, UKIP exhibited an [...] "inherent Anglocentrism" [...] that negates the distinct culture of the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish peoples of the United Kingdom. Hayton suggests that UKIP tap into [...] "a vein of nostalgic cultural nationalism" [...] within England, {{and it has been}} noted that UKIP's discourse frames the image of Englishness in a nostalgic manner, harking back to the years before the collapse of the British Empire.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the continued controversy, the team owner Dan Snyder sent {{an open letter to}} fans that was published in The Washington Post on October 9, 2013. In the letter Snyder states that the most important meaning of the name Redskins is the association that fans have to memories of their personal history with the team. Snyder also states that the name was chosen in 1933 to honor Native Americans in general and the coach and four players at that time who were Native American; and that in 1971 the then coach George Allen consulted with the Red Cloud Athletic Fund on the Pine Ridge reservation when designing the logo. Supporters also assert that a majority of Native Americans themselves are not offended, based upon a public opinion poll in 2004 in which 90% of those who identified as American Indians answered that they were [...] "not bothered" [...] by the name [...] "Redskins" [...] being used for the Washington football team. However, in a commentary published soon after that poll, fifteen Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of [...] "white privilege" [...] and colonialism. In May 2016, the Washington Post released a poll of self-identified Native Americans that produced the same results as Annenberg poll, in which 90% of the 504 respondents were [...] "not bothered" [...] by the team's name. Native American groups responded with many of the same criticisms. NCAI Executive Director Jacqueline Pata stated [...] "The survey doesn't recognize the psychological impacts these racist names and imagery have on American Indian and Alaska Natives.

2500|$|The {{three main}} issues were RCA {{position}} on homosexuality, {{the adoption of}} the Belhar confession and complementarianism. Beyond the three reasons University Reformed Church mentioned: [...] "We have a deep desire to belong to a family of churches where <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> a congregation fits squarely with what our denomination does and believes." [...] "We want to raise up pastors who do not fear that the ordination process is against them"."We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "We {{want to be in a}} denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, notsome extreme right flank". [...] "The denomination(RCA) has moved away from churches like ours." [...] "We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "In practice, the RCA is already well down this path [...] and that given the way our classical structure works those who stand for biblical orthodoxy can do little to stop it. We believe laboring in such a mixed denomination undermines the true nature of biblical unity, hinders our witness for Christ, and does not represent the most effective avenue for ministry for URC in the years and decades ahead." [...] "URC would be able to serve with greater integrity and disciple our people (especially ministerial candidates) more effectively if we were in a denomination that shares our complementarian convictions, rather than in one that is moving full speed ahead in the other direction." [...] "We(URC) are troubled by the weak form of confessional subscription in the RCA, the process for examining ministerial candidates, and our formal ecumenical ties with liberal denominations like the UCC, ELCA and PCUSA". [...] "We have often heard from visitors that though they lived in Lansing for years they never thought to visit URC because it was an RCA church or because of things they had heard about liberal leanings in the RCA. How many others might be staying away because our denominational affiliation gives them the wrong idea about who we are and what we believe?"We do not recommend our RCA seminaries. [...] "We want to be in a denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, not some extreme right flank". [...] "The RCA connection inhibits interest in planting churches, the vision for training up pastors, and placement for new pastors." [...] "we also feel a measure of distance between us and most churches in the denomination".|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{integrity}} of personhood {{refers to the}} wholeness or intactness of the self in all its diverse aspects. Life threatening illness can compromise the intactness of the self in many ways, four of which are examined here; the resultant suffering can <b>be</b> understood <b>as</b> spiritual pain, since spirituality and {{the integration of the}} self are closely connected. The needs of persons faced with the threat of dis-integration of the self are examined, and it is suggested that such needs may be best met by carers in four ways:- by Seeing, Listening, Loving, Respecting the Mystery. To do this requires not so much professional expertise as a way of being, a quality of presence which depends upon <b>who</b> <b>we</b> really <b>are,</b> <b>as</b> persons...|$|R

In an interview for Digital Spy, Buchanan said that the response to the song was great, saying: [...] "From the beginning there's been a real buzz about the track. It's had a great response from so many people, even if they say, 'Forget about the rest of them, this one I love'."

Music critics often note the irony of their subsequent rise from guitar-based rock devotees to [...] "one {{of the most successful}} chart groups of the '80s with their slickly produced synth pop". In his book Music: What Happened?, Scott Miller names [...] "The Real World" [...] {{as one of the top}} songs of the 1980s, and remarks of the EP: [...] "Those who know only 'Eternal Flame' might be amazed at how inventive and together they were in their relative infancy". The Bangles themselves consider the early material, lesser-known though it was, to be vital to their own story: as Susanna Hoffs told Billboard in 2014, [...] "I think it's as representative of <b>who</b> <b>we</b> really <b>are</b> and <b>as</b> authentic as anything the Bangles have ever done. There's a kind of architecture to those songs - three-part harmonies, guitar-driven, jangly over a kind of garage rock rhythm <b>is</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now, still, <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> back then." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2009, Foer {{published}} his third book, Eating Animals. A New York Times bestseller, Eating Animals provides a morally dense discussion {{of some of}} the ramifications that followed the proliferation of factory farms. It attempts to explain why and how humans can be so loving to our companion animals while simultaneously being indifferent to others, and explores what this inconsistency tells us about ourselves―what kinds of stories emerge from this selectivity. The book offers a significant focus on “storytelling”―the title of both the first and the last chapters of the book. Storytelling is Foer’s way of recognizing and dealing with the complexity of the subject that is eating animals, and suggests that, ultimately, our food choices tell stories about <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> or, <b>as</b> Foer has it in his book, “stories about food are stories about us―our history and our values.” ...|$|R
