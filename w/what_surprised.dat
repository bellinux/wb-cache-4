5|$|For North Vietnamese field {{commanders of}} the Tay Nguyen Front, the {{withdrawal}} of South Vietnamese military forces from II Corps Tactical Zone came as a surprise, {{but it was not}} totally unexpected. <b>What</b> <b>surprised</b> the North Vietnamese the most was the speed of the withdrawal. Indeed, {{it was not until the}} evening of March 15, when the ARVN 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron reached Cheo Reo, that the North Vietnamese began to receive information of Saigonâ€™s decision to abandon the Central Highlands. At 8pm on March 16, the Tay Nguyen Front Command issued the first orders to pursue the South Vietnamese. The North Vietnamese 9th Battalion, 64th Regiment, part of the 320A Infantry Division, was the first unit to be mobilised to intercept the South Vietnamese column south of Cheo Reo district. Subsequently, the entire North Vietnamese 320A Infantry Division was sent to destroy the South Vietnamese column along Route 7, with the 2nd Tank Battalion of the 273rd Armoured Regiment, the 675th Regiment, and the 593rd Anti-Aircraft Regiment in support. By the early hours of March 17, tanks from the ARVN 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron and the 6th Ranger Battalion clashed with the North Vietnamese 9th Battalion, 64th Regiment at Tuna Pass, about 4kilometres away from the district of Cheo Reo.|$|E
500|$|Enderlin {{based his}} {{allegation}} that the IDF had shot {{the boy on}} {{the report of the}} cameraman, Talal Abu Rahma. Abu Rahma was clear in interviews that the Israelis had fired the shots. For example, he told The Guardian: [...] "They were cleaning the area. Of course they saw the father. They were aiming at the boy, and that is <b>what</b> <b>surprised</b> me, yes, because they were shooting at him, not only one time, but many times." [...] Abu Rahma said shooting was also coming from the Palestinian National Security Forces outpost, but that they were not shooting when Muhammad was hit. The Israeli fire was being directed at this Palestinian outpost, he said. He told National Public Radio: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>What</b> <b>surprised</b> the archeologists was {{the highly}} {{individual}} {{nature of these}} life-sized depictions, whose individual character {{has been compared to}} portrait heads of classic and modern times. For private works, Ancient Egyptian sculptors tended to capture an idealized version of a face, often eliminating individual traits in a way that, as one writer put it: [...] "approached architectural impersonality". In contrast the reserve heads seem to depict unique individuals, with one early researcher ascribing family relationships between the reserve heads he found. With few exceptions they are of high artistic quality, and were very probably the product of the royal workshops.|$|E

6000|$|A {{friend of}} mine {{returning}} from Italy had talked with a lady there who {{did not like the}} book. I regretted that, of course, but <b>what</b> <b>surprised</b> me was the ground of her dislike. 'You know,' she said, 'it is all so morbid.' ...|$|E

60|$|<b>What</b> <b>surprised</b> Sola most in me {{was that}} while I could catch telepathic {{messages}} easily from others, and often {{when they were not}} intended for me, no one could read a jot from my mind under any circumstances. At first this vexed me, but later I was very glad of it, as it gave me an undoubted advantage over the Martians.|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>surprised</b> the Professor himself, {{when he came}} {{to think}} of it, was that, left alone with Malvina, and {{in spite of all the}} circumstances, he felt neither embarrassment nor perplexity. It was as if, so far as they two were concerned, the whole thing was quite simple--almost humorous. It would be the other people who would have to worry.|$|E

60|$|But <b>what</b> <b>surprised</b> Eva {{most was}} {{the sight of}} a common dandelion, a tuft of clover, a faded mignonette-plant, with several other humble flowers, set in a little plot by {{themselves}} as if newly come, and about them gathered a crowd of beautiful spirits, so bright, so small, so perfect that Eva could hardly see them, and winked as if dazzled by the sunshine of this garden among the clouds.|$|E
60|$|There {{was much}} relief and comfort in that visit of Mr. Audley's. For one thing, Geraldine {{was able to}} pour out all her troubles, {{as she had been}} used to do ever since her father had left her in his charge --her repentance for the stirrings of her {{naturally}} fretful, plaintive temper, for her fits of impatience and her hard judgments, and, <b>what</b> <b>surprised</b> him chiefly, for jealousy.|$|E
60|$|After Billy was {{released}} for duty following his imprisonment, he several times passed the girl upon deck. He {{noticed that she}} shrank from him in disgust and terror; but <b>what</b> <b>surprised</b> him was that instead of the thrill of pride which he formerly would have felt at this acknowledgment of his toughness, for Billy prided himself on being a tough, he now felt a singular resentment against the girl for her attitude, so that he came to hate her even {{more than he had}} before hated. Formerly he had hated her for the things she stood for, now he hated her for herself.|$|E
60|$|I {{look back}} at those words {{by the light of}} later events; and I {{pronounce}} them, as you will soon pronounce them, to be the words of an essentially rash man, whose hasty judgment never stopped to consider <b>what</b> <b>surprises</b> time and chance together might have in store for him.|$|R

60|$|As {{their poor}} vitals warmed to the food, {{they began to}} expand and wax boastful, and to talk {{politics}}. I {{can only say that}} they talked politics as well as the average middle-class man, and a great deal better than some of the middle-class men I have heard. <b>What</b> <b>surprised</b> me was the hold they had on the world, its geography and peoples, and on recent and contemporaneous history. As I say, they were not fools, these two men. They were merely old, and their children had undutifully failed to grow up and give them a place by the fire.|$|E
60|$|Venters {{pushed on}} more heedfully than ever. Toward {{the center of}} this circle the sage-brush grew smaller and farther apart He was about to sheer off to the right, where {{thickets}} and jumbles of fallen rock would afford him cover, when he ran right upon a broad cattle trail. Like a road it was, more than a trail, and the cattle tracks were fresh. <b>What</b> <b>surprised</b> him more, they were wet! He pondered over this feature. It had not rained. The only solution to this puzzle was that the cattle had been driven through water, and water deep enough to wet their legs.|$|E
60|$|It {{was perhaps}} a month later, {{when the people}} of the place arrived--the fill of six great boats. They were a fine race of men, and spoke a tongue that sounded very {{different}} from the tongue of Hawaii, but so many of the words were the same that it was not difficult to understand. The men besides were very courteous, and the women very towardly; and they made Keola welcome, and built him a house, and gave him a wife; and, <b>what</b> <b>surprised</b> him the most, he was never sent to work with the young men.|$|E
60|$|MRS. ROBERTS (briskly, {{as if she}} {{had often}} tried it and failed). Oh, not the least in the world.

6000|$|But he had {{reckoned}} {{without the}} power of the privileged orders over the proud Austrian queen, and her power over the obese, phlegmatic, irresolute monarch. That the privileged orders should deliver battle in defence of their privileges, Andre-Louis could understand. Man being what he is, and labouring under his curse of acquisitiveness, will never willingly surrender possessions, whether they be justly or unjustly held. But <b>what</b> <b>surprised</b> Andre-Louis was the unutterable crassness of the methods by which the Privileged ranged themselves for battle. They opposed brute force to reason and philosophy, and battalions of foreign mercenaries to ideas. As if ideas were to be impaled on bayonets! ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{could say}} no more. The dreadful thought arose {{that the place}} might pass away from us. We were {{not yet ready to}} buy it. But I did not put the thought in words. There was a field next to our lot, and I got over the fence and helped Euphemia over. Then we climbed our side-fence. This was more difficult, but we {{accomplished}} it without thinking much about its difficulties; our hearts were too full of painful apprehensions. I hurried to the front door; it was locked. All the lower windows were shut. We went around to the kitchen. <b>What</b> <b>surprised</b> us more than anything else was the absence of Lord Edward. Had HE been sold? ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were seated}} at a table, {{glittering}} with silver and dainty chinaware, to which the red wine in Venetian goblets, the varied fruit and flowers, gave colour. The room, furnished too gorgeously for taste, they judged to be a private cabinet {{in one of the}} great restaurants. Of such interiors they had occasionally caught glimpses through open windows on summer nights. It was softly illuminated by shaded lamps. The Stranger's face was still in shadow. But <b>what</b> <b>surprised</b> each of the three most was to observe opposite him two more or less bald-headed gentlemen of somewhat flabby appearance, whose features, however, in some mysterious way appeared familiar. The Stranger had his wine-glass raised in his hand.|$|E
