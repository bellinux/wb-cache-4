5|$|The film's idea {{originated}} in the late 1990s in screenwriter K. V. Vijayendra Prasad mind. At that time, he <b>was</b> <b>joking</b> about a housefly seeking revenge on a human {{in a conversation with}} his son S. S. Rajamouli. Prasad later developed the idea as a script for an English-language film set in 1830s America, in which an African-American boy dies in an attempt to free his family from slavery and is reincarnated as a fly. After completing Maryada Ramanna (2010), Rajamouli reconsidered the concept after thinking of directing a film that was distinct from any other. He decided to make Eega a bilingual film in Telugu and Tamil– each scene including speech was filmed twice, once for each language. The Tamil version, titled Naan Ee, was Rajamouli's directorial debut in Tamil cinema. The film was presented by Daggubati Suresh Babu of Suresh Productions.|$|E

25|$|Double Fine has {{received}} financial investment from Steven Dengler's investment company, Dracogen. The investment {{started as a}} result of a Twitter conversation between Dengler and Schafer in March 2011, where Schafer commented that the cost of bringing Double Fine's games to personal computers would be high. Dengler asked Schafer for a monetary value, though at the time Schafer believed Dengler <b>was</b> <b>joking</b> around and offered a value of around $300,000. However, as more formal conversations ensued, the company worked with Dengler to set an amount, signing an initial deal to bring Psychonauts to the OS X and to bring Costume Quest and Stacking to Microsoft Windows.|$|E

25|$|Donald (Stephen Merchant) and Emily (Halle Berry) {{are on a}} date {{together}} at a Mexican restaurant. Tired of typical first dates, Emily challenges Donald to a game of truth or dare. She dares him to grab a man's buttocks, and he follows with daring her to blow out the birthday candles on a blind boy's cake. The game rapidly escalates to extremes, in which both of them get plastic surgery and tattoos, and humiliate themselves. When Donald and Emily arrive back at Emily's apartment, they praise their date. Donald tries to kiss her, but she rejects him, claiming she's not attracted to Asian men (which he was surgically altered to resemble). It is revealed that she <b>was</b> <b>joking</b> and invites him {{to have sex with}} her as she shows him her enlarged breasts.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversy}} {{arose in}} 1989 following an address by Yusuf {{to students at}} London's Kingston University, where {{he was asked about}} the fatwa calling for the killing of Salman Rushdie, author of the novel The Satanic Verses. Yusuf made a series of comments that appeared to show his support for the fatwa. He released a statement the following day denying that he supported vigilantism, and claiming that he had merely recounted the legal Islamic punishment for blasphemy. In a 2006 BBC interview, he displayed a newspaper clipping from that period, with quotes from his statement. Subsequent comments made by him in 1989 on a British television programme were also seen as being in support of the fatwa. In a statement in the FAQ section of one of his websites, Yusuf asserted that while he regretted the comments, he <b>was</b> <b>joking</b> and that the show was improperly edited. In the years since these comments, he has repeatedly denied ever calling for the death of Rushdie or supporting the fatwa.|$|E

By May 2013, Keenan stated that he had actively joined the writing process as enough instrumental material had been written. On March 6, 2014, Crave Online reported that Jones had said the new album was complete and on track for a 2014 release. The following day, Tool released an official statement to Rolling Stone, explaining that Jones <b>was</b> <b>joking.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Durst {{announced}} that the band's third studio album would be titled Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water. The press thought he <b>was</b> <b>joking</b> about this title. The album title is intended {{to sound like a}} fictional band; the phrase [...] "Chocolate Starfish" [...] refers to the human anus, and Durst himself, who has frequently been called an [...] "asshole". Borland contributed {{the other half of the}} album's title when the band was standing around at a truck stop, looking at bottles of flavored water, and Borland joked that the truck stop didn't have hot dog or meat-flavored water.|$|E

[...] Adams thought the Colonel <b>was</b> <b>joking,</b> but [...] "went to music school after {{graduation}} just in case he wasn't". After music school, he joined the army and put his musical skills to rest {{for the duration of}} the war, with one exception: while on regimental staff during the retreat ceremony at the end of the day, the assigned bugler had no experience and couldn't play a single note, so Adams stepped out of formation, took the bugle from the bugler's hands, blew the appropriate calls, handed the bugle back, and marched back into his spot in the formation.|$|E

500|$|Before Yao's {{first meeting}} with Shaquille O'Neal on January 17, 2003, O'Neal said, [...] "Tell Yao Ming, Ching chong-yang-wah-ah-soh", {{prompting}} accusations of racism. O'Neal denied that his comments were racist, {{and said he was}} only joking. Yao also said he believed O'Neal <b>was</b> <b>joking,</b> but he said a lot of Asians would not see the humor. In the game, Yao scored the Rockets' first six points of the game and blocked O'Neal twice in the opening minutes as well as altering two other shots by O'neal, all 4 of those attempts coming right at the rim, and made a game-sealing dunk with 10seconds left in overtime. Yao finished with 10points, 10rebounds, and 6blocks; O'Neal recorded 31points, 13rebounds, and 0blocks. O'Neal later admitted that he regretted how he hazed Yao early in his career.|$|E
500|$|Once Vig {{learned about}} the analog project, at first he {{considered}} Grohl <b>was</b> <b>joking,</b> but then replied that [...] "You guys have to play really well, because nothing is gonna be fixed" [...] since mistakes are not as easily correctable as in a digital recording. With that in mind, the band spent three weeks doing pre-production and rehearsals at Studio 606, where the composition was completed, going [...] "from forty songs to fourteen", and said songs were rehearsed to be recorded live, while in previous records, as put by Mendel, [...] "we'd often come up with parts in the studio, and the songs would evolve". Smear added that the band committed to not change what would end recorded: [...] "Whatever we did, we didn’t change it. If a distorted vocal went through a pedal, that’s what {{it was going to}} be.” ...|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, Kemper has {{continued}} to display potentially threatening behavior. [...] On one occasion, when Douglas' colleague Robert Ressler was in a cell alone with Kemper, Kemper—who at the time weighed —noticed the apprehension in Ressler after he had pressed a hidden button repeatedly to call a guard to open the cell yet not received a response and told him [...] "Relax. They're changing the shift," [...] but remarked: [...] "If I went apeshit in here, you'd be {{in a lot of}} trouble, wouldn't you? I could screw your head off and place it on the table to greet the guard." [...] Ressler verbally sparred with Kemper until the guard arrived, ultimately leaving unharmed with Kemper displaying no physical aggression. Kemper also stated afterwards that he <b>was</b> <b>joking,</b> but Ressler never entered a cell alone again with Kemper and it became FBI policy to interview serial killers in pairs.|$|E

500|$|Evidence of the {{overlapping}} subject matter between the shows, {{as well as}} the conflict between them, arose when Aaron Sorkin, the creator of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, asked Lorne Michaels to allow him to observe Saturday Night Live for a week, a request Michaels denied. Despite this, Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series, and wished her luck with 30 Rock. Fey said, [...] "it's just bad luck for me that in my first attempt at prime time I'm going up against the most powerful writer on television. I <b>was</b> <b>joking</b> that this would be the best pilot ever aired on Trio. And then Trio got canceled." [...] Fey wound up [...] "beating" [...] Sorkin when Studio 60 was canceled after one season and 30 Rock was renewed for a second. Though 30 Rocks first-season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of Studio 60, Studio 60 was more expensive to produce.|$|E
500|$|The couple put {{together}} an act and began booking it at small midwestern theaters. When an offer came for an engagement in Harwich Port, Massachusetts, some 2,000 miles from Kansas City, they were pleased to get it because of its proximity to their ultimate goal, the vaudeville houses of New York City. [...] To get to Massachusetts they bought a used car and borrowed five dollars from Edna's mother, {{but by the time}} they arrived in St. Louis they had only fifty cents. [...] Skelton asked Edna to collect empty cigarette packs; she thought he <b>was</b> <b>joking,</b> but did as he asked. [...] He then spent their fifty cents on bars of soap, which they cut into small cubes and wrapped with the tinfoil from the cigarette packs.

Blanchard {{was placed in}} custody {{despite the fact that}} no evidence surfaced that he planned to go through with an assassination attempt. Later that same month in Florida, Raymond H. Geisel was charged with making threatening statements against Obama during a bail-bonds training class on July 31. Geisel also threatened to put a bullet in the head of then-President Bush, although Geisel later claimed he <b>was</b> <b>joking.</b> He was found to be in possession of ammunition, body armor, a combat-style hatchet, tear gas, a loaded 9mm handgun and four loaded magazines. Geisel said he collected firearms, and was only using the gun for his bail-bonds course. Geisel remained in custody for a month.|$|E

500|$|After the 1941 season, {{with his}} batting in decline, Oana {{worked as a}} pitcher during a barnstorming tour of Mexico. [...] Rogers Hornsby took over as the manager at Fort Worth in 1942, and Oana badgered Hornsby for a chance as a pitcher. [...] According to one account, Hornsby was {{reportedly}} prepared to release Oana, who was not hitting well, and said to Oana, [...] "Hank, you hit like a pitcher," [...] to which Oana replied, [...] "I am a good pitcher." [...] Hornsby initially thought that Oana <b>was</b> <b>joking</b> about being a pitcher, but finally relented and allowed him to pitch in relief one day in Houston. [...] In Oana's first 76 innings as a pitcher in 1942, he compiled a 0.76 earned run average (ERA), threw 50 consecutive innings without an earned run, and pitched a no-hitter. [...] In mid-July 1942, Oana's scoreless streak became national news, and resulted in a feature story in The Sporting News. In a total of 25 games as a pitcher during the 1942 season, Oana compiled a 16–5 record with a 1.72 ERA.|$|E
500|$|On November 26, 2010, Nelson {{was arrested}} in Sierra Blanca, Texas, for {{possession}} of six ounces of marijuana found in his tour bus while traveling from Los Angeles back to Texas. He was released after paying bail of US$2,500. Prosecutor Kit Bramblett supported not sentencing Nelson to jail due to {{the small amount of}} marijuana involved, but suggested instead a US$100 fine and told Nelson that he would have him sing [...] "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain" [...] for the court. Judge Becky Dean-Walker said that Nelson would have to pay the fine but not to perform the song, explaining that the prosecutor <b>was</b> <b>joking.</b> Nelson's lawyer Joe Turner reached an agreement with the prosecutor. Nelson was set to pay a US$500 fine to avoid a two-year jail sentence with a 30-day review period, which in case of another incident would end the agreement. The judge later rejected the agreement, claiming that Nelson was receiving preferential treatment for his celebrity status; the offense normally carried a one-year jail sentence. Bramblett declared that the case would remain open until it was either dismissed or the judge changed her opinion.|$|E

Beverley said of Rhoads that [...] "he was just a damned fool, ... a good doctor, but not very strong mentally on anything else." [...] Rhoads, already back in New York, released an official response to the media and the governor. He insisted that he <b>was</b> <b>joking</b> in his letter, which was intended to be confidential, calling it a [...] "fantastic and playful composition written entirely for my own diversion and intended as a parody on supposed attitudes of some American minds in Porto Rico," [...] explaining that nothing [...] "was ever intended to mean other than the opposite of what was stated." [...] Rhoads offered to return to clear things up, but never did. The governor's inquiry concluded that Rhoads did not commit the acts included in his letter, nor any other crimes.|$|E
