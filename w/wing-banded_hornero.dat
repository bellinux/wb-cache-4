50|$|<b>Wing-banded</b> <b>hornero</b> {{exists in}} two ranges, {{separated}} by 1000 km, each population representing a subspecies. The largest range occurs in Atlantic northeastern and eastern Brazil, the Northeast Region, Brazil and Caatinga, {{as well as}} into continental regions inland, (part of the Cerrado). In recent years, this population has expanded southwards {{at least as far}} as SÃ£o Paulo. The second population ranges upstream in a strip along the Amazon River for about 1700 km as well as southwards to the upstream reaches of the Araguaia River in the adjacent Tocantins-Araguaia River drainage. This southerly strip ranges between two river systems in a strip approximately 2400 km long; the western portion is the downstream half of the Xingu River.|$|E
