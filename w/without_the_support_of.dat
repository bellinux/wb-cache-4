5|$|After several {{diplomatic}} {{failures and}} military defeats in the 1730s, Austria {{seemed to be}} declining, or even {{on the verge of}} collapse. After her forty years reign, Maria Theresa left a revitalised empire that influenced the rest of Europe throughout the 19thcentury. She gave the Habsburg dominions an efficient administrative system that allowed it to remain a great power in its own right, <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the Holy Roman Empire. Her descendants followed her example and continued reforming the empire. The acquisition of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria gave the empire an even more multinational character that would ultimately lead to its destruction. Her introduction of compulsory schooling, as a means of Germanisation, eventually triggered the revival of Czech culture.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the smoke}} the commanders of the second line of Polish {{outposts}} {{could not see the}} approaching Russians and did not open fire. Contrary to the battle plan, the second line did not send reinforcements to the first. This was particularly important in the case of Forts 54 and 56, as they had to face the enemy alone, <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> Forts 21, 22 and 23 behind them. The most important positions in the suburb of Wola received only token reinforcements from the main reserve and were forced to fight in isolation.|$|E

5|$|Due to the lord's {{presence}} in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> his more powerful tenants a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately below them on the social scale, but absentees could expect to find their influence weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, {{and it would be}} impractical for a lord to visit all his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar's {{relationship}} with Spain {{continued to be}} a sensitive subject. By 2002, Britain and Spain had proposed an agreement to share sovereignty over Gibraltar. However, it was opposed by the government of Gibraltar, which put it to a referendum in November 2002. The agreement was rejected by 17,000 votes to 187– a majority of 98.97%. Although both governments dismissed the outcome as having no legal weight, the outcome of the referendum caused the talks to stall and the British government accepted that it would be unrealistic to try to reach an agreement <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the people of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|Leiva wrote a {{constitutional}} code {{to regulate the}} actions of the Junta.

The commanders of the armed forces, including Saavedra and Pedro Andrés García, agreed to this code. The Junta swore the oath of office that afternoon.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the reason}} for the inefficacy of the 1914 session was that McCreary was engaged in a {{three-way}} primary race for the Democratic nomination to the U.S. Senate. The other major candidates were former Governor Beckham and Augustus O. Stanley; a fourth candidate, David H. Smith, withdrew early from the race. McCreary ran a mostly positive campaign, touting his own accomplishments and speaking cordially about his opponents. Beckham and Stanley, however, were bitter political and personal enemies, and the campaign reflected their animosity. <b>Without</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> Beckham's political machine that had helped him in the gubernatorial contest, McCreary never had a realistic chance to win the nomination. Beckham secured the nomination with 72,677 votes to Stanley's 65,871 and McCreary's 20,257.|$|E
5|$|The assassins are killed, but {{not before}} they inflict heavy damage on the Akashi forces. Eventually, Naritsugu and Hanbei are cornered by Shinzaemon and Shinrokurō. After Shinzaemon kills Hanbei, Naritsugu kicks his loyal retainer's head away, {{insulting}} the older samurai. Contemptuously, Naritsugu announces that both {{the people and the}} samurai have only one purpose and that is to serve their lords. Shinzaemon counters by telling Naritsugu that lords cannot live <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the people and that, if a lord abuses his power, the people will always rise against him. Naritsugu and Shinzaemon mortally wound each other. As the lord crawls away in mud crying and experiencing fear and pain for the first time, he thanks Shinzaemon for showing him excitement before Shinzaemon chops his head off.|$|E
5|$|A Company {{attacked}} the ridgeline {{to the north}} of the road to Chonju just prior to dusk, this time <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the Sherman tanks. The Australians again came under heavy fire from the North Koreans, however they quickly overcame the defenders and the ridge was secured by 17:30. During the fighting for the northern position, three North Korean T-34 tanks dug-in on the ridgeline had been destroyed by the Australians at short range with new M20 3.5-inch bazookas, which now proved to be effective anti-armour weapons despite difficulties experienced in their use at Kujin several days before. During the day's fighting, a total of 11 T-34 tanks and two SU-76 self-propelled guns had been destroyed by the Australian infantry and American tanks, contrary to the reports of their destruction by USAF airstrikes earlier in the day. Expecting a counter-attack, Green then ordered B Company forward to occupy positions along the road in between the positions held by D and A Companies, while Battalion headquarters moved in behind B Company, with C Company held in reserve at the rear with Support Company. After conducting a limited resupply of the forward companies, the Australians hastily began to dig in.|$|E

5|$|According to the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters, he {{had secured}} the {{cooperation}} of Dublin, and perhaps gained the kingship of the town itself, through a stipend of 4,000 cows. In consequence, Dubliners formed part of Ua Conchobair's forces when he marched to Drogheda and Leinster, where he forced the submissions of the kings of Airgialla and Leinster respectively. In fact, Dublin appears to have formed {{a key part of}} Ua Conchobair's arsenal, and it is apparent that Mac Murchada was doomed <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> this coastal-kingdom. Certainly, the twelfth–thirteenth-century La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande relates that Ascall ("MacTurkyl de Diveline") had abandoned his former overlord, and the eleventh–fourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen specify that Mac Murchada was only expulsed from Ireland after the Leinstermen and Dubliners had turned against him. Although Ua Conchobair appears to have allowed Mac Murchada to retain his patrimonial lordship of Uí Chennselaig, the Annals of the Four Masters reveals that the Leinstermen and Dubliners assisted Tigernán Ua Ruairc, King of Bréifne (died 1172) in forcing Mac Murchada from this final vestige of authority and into exile.|$|E
5|$|Beckham {{attempted}} {{to return to}} the Senate in 1936. The head of the Jockey Club, James B. Brown, had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in 1930. In 1933 Beckham's ally, Robert Bingham, had been appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James's, increasing his prominence and influence. Beckham also enjoyed the support of the United Mine Workers and Louisville mayor Neville Miller. The race was complicated, though, by the entry of John Y. Brown, a Democrat who was a U.S. Representative and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives. He had agreed to support Chandler's bid for the governorship in exchange for Chandler's support in his run for the Senate. However, Chandler threw his support to Beckham, and while Brown was not able to win the seat <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> Bingham and Chandler, he did garner 85,000 votes, most of them at Beckham's expense. Democratic incumbent M. M. Logan retained the seat by 2,385 votes.|$|E

With no command structure, they were attached to the 1st Parachute Battalion to help defend the bridge. To the north, the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the 10th Arditi Regiment had been informed of the parachute landings. Many of the 372nd Battalion had disappeared, while the Arditi mounted the first of a number of attacks on the British positions. <b>Without</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> any heavy weapons, they were easily fought off.|$|E

5|$|In the 2008 general election, BN was {{returned}} to power {{for the first time}} without its customary 2/3 supermajority in the Dewan Rakyat, meaning it could no longer pass constitutional amendments <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> opposition parties. The election results were widely seen as reflecting discontent {{about the state of the}} country's economy and increasing ethnic tensions within the country; the three main opposition parties had campaigned on a platform condemning the NEP and the government's response to widening economic disparities. The month after, the Crown Prince of Kelantan Tengku Faris Petra said during an assembly organised by the newly formed Malay Unity Action Front that since the Malays had given in to granting the non-Malays citizenship, the latter should not seek equality or special treatment. In his speech, the prince also called for Malay unity to ensure that Malay sovereignty and supremacy was preserved.|$|E
5|$|Knowing that {{he could}} not fight on <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the army, Jacobo Árbenz {{resigned}} on 27 June 1954, handing over power to Colonel Carlos Enrique Diaz. US ambassador John Peurifoy then mediated negotiations held in El Salvador between the army leadership and Castillo Armas which led to Armas being included in the ruling military junta on 7 July 1954, and was named provisional president a few days later. The US recognized the new government on 13 July. Elections were held in early October, from which all political parties were barred from participating, and Castillo Armas was the only candidate, winning the election with 99% of the vote. Among the outcomes of the meeting in El Salvador was a planned new constitution, which would roll back most of the progressive reform brought by the revolution.|$|E
5|$|Partly due {{to these}} events, and {{partly due to}} the major losses in {{manpower}} Gallia suffers {{towards the end of the}} war with the Empire, the Nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the Gallian Army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force. This is short-lived, however, as following Maximilian's defeat, Dahau and Calamity Raven move to activate an ancient Valkyrian super weapon within the Empire, kept secret by their benefactor. <b>Without</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> Maximilian or the chance to prove themselves in the war with Gallia, it is Dahau's last trump card in creating a new Darcsen nation. As an armed Gallian force invading the Empire just following the two nations' cease-fire would certainly wreck their newfound peace, Kurt decides to once again make his squad the Nameless, asking Crowe to list himself and all under his command as killed-in-action. Now owing allegiance to none other than themselves, the 422nd confronts Dahau and destroys the Valkyrian weapon. Each member then goes their separate ways in order to begin their lives anew.|$|E

While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crewmembers were standing there with rifles.

5|$|When {{the commune}} {{elections}} {{were held in}} February 2002, FUNCINPEC performed poorly, winning control over 10 {{out of a total}} of 1,621 communes across Cambodia. Subsequently, rifts within the party boiled into the open as Khan Savoeun, a Deputy Commander-in-chief of the RCAF, accused its co-Minister of the Interior, You Hockry of practising nepotism and corruption. At the same time, Hang Dara and Norodom Chakrapong – the latter had returned to FUNCINPEC in March 1999 – formed their own splinter parties and took along a large number of FUNCINPEC party members. A year later in July 2003, The general elections were held, and took 20.8% of the votes, which entitled them to 26 seats in the National Assembly.

These hopes were soon squashed. Field Marshal Carl Mannerheim, supreme commander of the Finnish forces, insisted on delaying further offensive operations, citing military and logistical reasons. On 17 November, Siilasvuo ordered an immediate stop to the Finnish III Corps' offensive, despite positive feedback from his field commanders that further ground could be taken. This sudden change in Finnish behaviour was, in some part, the result of diplomatic pressure by the United States and Britain. Finland was no longer interested in spearheading such an offensive. With the Finnish refusal to be involved in further offensive operations, Arctic Fox came to an end in November and both sides dug in.|$|E
