50|$|Those {{who support}} {{prohibition}} or abolition of prostitution argue that keeping prostitution illegal {{is the best}} way to prevent abusive and dangerous activities (child prostitution, human trafficking etc.). They argue that a system which allows legalized and regulated prostitution has very negative effects and does not improve the situation of the prostitutes; such legal systems only lead to crime and abuse: many women who work in licensed brothels are still controlled by outside pimps; many brothel owners are criminals themselves; the creation of a legal and regulated prostitution industry only leads to another parallel illegal industry, as many women do not want to register and work legally (since this would rob them of their anonymity) and other <b>women</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be hired by legal brothels because of underlying problems (e.g., drug abuse); legalizing prostitution makes it more socially acceptable to buy sex, creating a huge demand for prostitutes (both by local men and by foreigners engaging in sex tourism) and, as a result, human trafficking and underage prostitution increase in order to satisfy this demand.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{research}} on this topic {{has found that the}} degree of femininity a women possesses may have a major effect on the way a woman of political power is perceived. Gervais and Hillard (2011) cite the case studies of Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin to prove their point. Gervais and Hillard suggest that Clinton and Palin may be perceived negatively by viewers because they are women in roles of power and leadership in the government, which violates the stereotypical gender norm that <b>women</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be leaders. Because of this contradictory notion, they will be viewed less favorably. Gervais and Hillard then go on to argue that both Clinton and Palin [...] "violate gender norms" [...] in different ways, perhaps leading to different evaluations of their warmth and competence. Hillary Clinton presents herself in a more masculine way and this is viewed as congruent with the leadership role, but not with the feminine archetype. This type of woman who violates feminine gender roles is typically seen as competent, but harsh. Sarah Palin, on the other hand, presents herself with a very feminine attitude that falls in line with her gender role but not with the leadership role. A woman in this position is typically seen as warm, but incompetent. Due to the implications of this finding, Gervais and Hillard hypothesized that Clinton would be rated as more competent but less warm and Palin would be rated as less competent but more warm.|$|E

5000|$|The Bororo {{are a small}} {{people in}} the Amazon {{rainforest}} living in the southwest of the Brazilian region of Mato Grosso.The literal translation of the word [...] "boror" [...] is [...] "village courtyard". It's no coincidence that Bororo's homes are traditionally arranged circularly to form a circle {{that will be a}} kind of spatiotis or patio for them, which will act as the main space of Bororo's life. This square, if so called, is so important that it has given the same name to this group of people as it is within that typical courtyard that the Bororo people concentrates most of the social phenomena and spirit-Religious. In the complex social organization of Bororo, the classification of individuals is governed by a number of factors including clan membership, blood descent, and group of residence (referring to where a family lives in the village).This last detail is important because in the spatial distribution of homes each clan occupies a precise role. The aldeia (village) is divided into two exogamical half-Exerae and Tugarége-each divided into four clans, consisting of several families.A curious aspect for a people that may sometimes seem primitive is that woman has a very particular role in the concept of Bororo society, and indeed the rule of the offspring predicts that this is matriarchal, and that the infant then receives a name that Join the mother clan.The importance of these rules is also noted in marriage. After a Bororo wedding, the man will have to live in the house of his bride and will also have obligations to his family, such as fishing, hunting, working and, if necessary, making ornamental items for his bride's brother.Although it seems that man is totally devoted and devoted entirely to his wife after marriage, it is this complexity of conjugal relationships that is the cause of frequent separations, making it possible for a man to live in multiple homes throughout his life [...]In spite of everything that has so far been explained, it may lead to thinking that the husband's obligations to his wife are {{at the top of the}} pyramid because of the importance, another truth of the Bororo culture is that a man always maintains a bond with his much more important family Of what binds her to her bride. It is true that an adult male, although married, maintains a number of obligations to the women of his family, namely his sisters. For example, it is their costume that a man is more concerned with his grandchildren, [...] "iwagedu" [...] in Bororo, than his own children; The only obligation of a father to his children is to banish them, a physical and non-cultural obligation.The complex organization of their lives also reflects on how one lives in the homes. In fact, despite the fact that two families of different nuclei (having blood ties even outside that exact space) live under the same roof, they can divide the interior spaces of the house; It is not by chance that the ends of the house are more private areas where you can put this division into practice, and the center of the house is a shared space devoted to visits, small daily rituals, and eating meals.The Bororo home is usually left with doors and windows open to allow it to be able to control what is inside (in the center), except when rituals are held inside which <b>women</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> attend or during mourning.One last interesting thing to consider is that, in mourning, the house becomes a space between the domestic domain and the public-legal domain (as Sylvia Caiuby Novaes observes) since the end of funerals must be destroyed after it has been completely empty throughout the mourning period.|$|E
