25|$|In 1876 work {{started on}} the {{construction}} of a dock in the protected harbor of Horta. As time progressed, Faial's importance expanded through this dock, as a <b>way-point</b> to trans-Atlantic traffic. Charles William Dabney, the American entrepreneur was responsible for the growth of the industry of the islands with whaling, wine and orange exports predominating. A philanthropic figure, Dabney was responsible for cultivating the economy of the island and supporting its population, aid to agriculture and generating markets abroad for their goods. The growth of industry and trans-Atlantic sail traffic also expanded Horta's importance, as a safe harbor and coal storage base. In 1919, the first airplane to cross the Atlantic stopped at Horta. Horta's exceptional situation also led to Pan American establishing a Clipper base there. Similarly, British, American, French, German and Italian intercontinental submarine cable stations were based in Horta. During World War Two, Horta was also an important naval base, giving shelter to some Allied ships that took part in the Normandy invasion.|$|E

This chapter describes work using the ADAM neural network that was aimed at finding <b>way-points,</b> roads, towns and rural areas in Infra Red Line Scan images of the ground. The network is capable of on-line, single pass training and simple computer implementation, making it particularly applicable in image processing tasks. In addition, no image pre-processing is needed, and images may be very large which makes the approach particularly simple to adopt. G 1. 6. 1 Project overview.

40|$|One {{main problem}} {{in the field of}} robotic {{grasping}} is to teach a robot how to grasp a particular object; in fact, this depends not only on the object geometry, but also on the end-effector properties. Different methods to generate grasp trajectories (<b>way-points</b> made by end-effector positions and its joint values) have been investigated such as kinaesthetic teaching, grasp recording using motion capture systems, and others. Although these method could potentially lead to a good trajectory, usually they are only able to give a good initial guess for a successful grasp: in fact, obtained trajectories seldom transfer well to the robot without further processing. In this work, we propose a ROS/Gazebo based interactive framework to create and modify grasping trajectories for different robotic end-effectors. This tool allows to shape the various <b>way-points</b> of a considered trajectory, and test it in a simulated environment, leading to a trial-and-error procedure and eventually to the real hardware application...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for reactive goal-directed navigation without global positioning facilities in unknown dynamic environments. A mobile sensor network is used for localizing regions of interest for path planning of an autonomous mobile robot. The underlying theory {{is an extension of}} a generalized gossip algorithm that has been recently developed in a language-measure-theoretic setting. The algorithm has been used to propagate local decisions of target detection over a mobile sensor network and thus, it generates a belief map for the detected target over the network. In this setting, an autonomous mobile robot may communicate only with a few mobile sensing nodes in its own neighborhood and localize itself relative to the communicating nodes with bounded uncertainties. The robot makes use of the knowledge based on the belief of the mobile sensors to generate a sequence of <b>way-points,</b> leading to a possible goal. The estimated <b>way-points</b> are used by a sampling-based motion planning algorithm to generate feasible trajectories for the robot. The proposed concept has been validated by numerical simulation on a mobile sensor network test-bed and a Dubin’s car-like robot. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The SRO {{project is}} using the 25 kg solar powered SR 2 rover to explore rover {{solutions}} for long distance Mars missions. The SR 2 rover is autonomous rover prototype that {{has been involved in}} a number of extended field tests involving Mars-like terrain. The four-wheeled rover uses only two motors for mobility (versus the 10 + used on the Pathfinder and MER rovers). Despite the drastic reduction in actuators, the mobility of SR 2 is, by most measures, comparable to that of the rocker-bogie designs. The few areas where it is less capable can almost always be overcome by following some simple rules which have been incorporated into the robot’s software. The reduction in actuators greatly simplifies the onboard real-time software, and can simplify operations as well. During the majority of any traverse, when the robot is on relatively clear ground, the SR 2 system is much more power efficient than a rocker-bogie, again improving range and simplifying operations. The real-time software likewise is following a simplified, highly reactive approach. The rover is left on its own to make its way between <b>way-points</b> that are spaced, on average, about 50 m apart. The rover is given 10 s of <b>way-points</b> to cover on its own between communication cycles. While the path followed by the robot between <b>way-points</b> may not be as optimal as one planned out on the ground, the increased time spent actually roving more than makes up for this. In tests at the Tule Wash field site (near Salton Sea, California), the rover would regularly make 300 m/hr of progress toward the goal (the actual distance traveled, with detours, might have been 20 % longer), allowing distances on the order of a km/day easily reachable. This rover capability enables a lower cost mission architec-ture that provides access to specific points on the surface of Mars...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} analysis result for asynchronous rendezvous control of multiagent systems with continuous-time dynamics and intermittent interactions. The protocol-designing strategies only impose weak restrictions on anticipated-way-point sets (from which the <b>way-points</b> are selected) and path-planning of each agent and {{can be applied to}} the networks of arbitrary dimensional subsystems. Explicitly, the anticipated-way-point sets are in a polytope-like form and the path between any two consecutive <b>way-points</b> is required to be included within the min-imum convex region covering the two associated anticipated-way-point sets. Under the assumption of directed and switching interaction topology and the assumption of intermittent and asynchronous interactions with time-varying delays, we perform the set-valued consensus analysis on the evolution of anticipated-way-point sets with respect to update times and provide mild sufficient conditions for the solvability of the asynchronous rendezvous problem. The proof techniques rely much on graph theory and nonnegative matrix theory. The obtained result extends greatly the existing work in the literature and several examples demonstrate its broad potential applications. Particularly, addi-tional distributed control rules, different from the circumcenter algorithm, are devised for network connectivity maintenance...|$|R
