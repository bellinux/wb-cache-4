5|$|To avoid a {{potentially}} vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal {{is kept in}} an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, static electricity, and exposure to oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Anything that may contact with barium should be electrically grounded. Anyone who works with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, goggles, and a gas mask. Smoking in the <b>working</b> <b>area</b> is forbidden. Thorough washing is required after handling barium.|$|E
5|$|Tailors {{started to}} take {{premises}} around Savile Row in the late 18th century, first in Cork Street, about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself. In 1846, Henry Poole, credited as creator of the dinner jacket or tuxedo, opened an entrance at 37 Savile Row from his late father's tailoring premises at 4 Old Burlington Street. As tailoring moved into the street, the house frontages were altered to bring natural light into the tailors' <b>working</b> <b>area</b> {{with the addition of}} glass frontages and light wells. The houses have been much altered over time; the original Burlingtonian design has been mostly lost, though No. 14 still retains much of the original external features.|$|E

40|$|The {{competition}} in the world market for iron ore has increased lately. Therefore, an improved method of estimating the ore quality in small <b>working</b> <b>areas</b> has become an attractive cost-cutting strategy in short-term mine plans. Estimated grades of different <b>working</b> <b>areas</b> of a mine {{form the basis of}} any short-term mine plan. The generally sparse exploration data obtained during the development phase is not enough to accurately estimate the grades of small <b>working</b> <b>areas.</b> Therefore, additional sample information is often required in any operating mine. The findings of this case study show that better utilization of all available exploration information at this mine would improve estimation of small <b>working</b> <b>areas</b> even without additional face samples. Through the use of kriging variance, this study also determined the optimum face sampling grid, whose spacing turned out to be approximately 100 meters as compared to 50 meters in use today.

Most {{of the students who}} participated in our study stated that the <b>working</b> <b>areas</b> of judicial nurses were forensic medicine institutions. In the study by Şentürk and Büyükaslan (2013), approximately half of the students stated that the <b>working</b> <b>areas</b> of the forensic nurses were hospitals and very few students reported that their <b>working</b> <b>areas</b> were forensic medical institutions (Table 1). In the study conducted by Kalayci et al. (2014), the students stated that the forensic case studies were not only done by forensic medicine-trained colleagues. Many participants saw forensic nurses as working in forensic medicine or hospitals, suggesting that forensic nursing was only associated with the field of healthcare according to students’ opinions.|$|R
40|$|Automatic {{classification}} of <b>working</b> <b>areas</b> in peripheral blood smears can provide objective and reproducible quality {{control for the}} evaluation of smears and smear maker devices. However, it has drawn little research attention. In this paper we study this topic using image analysis and statistical pattern recognition methods. We employ generic features without requiring the extraction of individual cells. Two new spatial distribution features across scales are defined and utilized to classify <b>working</b> <b>areas.</b> We demonstrate that the only feature and method proposed in a similar work by others is insufficient to characterize the goodness of <b>working</b> <b>areas,</b> particularly the cell distribution. However, by utilizing it together with the features developed in this paper, we can achieve much better results. Our method has been tested on about 150 labeled images acquired from three malaria-infected Giemsa-stained blood smears using an oil immersion 100 x objective lens. 1...|$|R

25|$|Higher {{fields are}} {{possible}} by optimising the spherical design {{to take account}} {{of the fact that it}} is composed of point dipoles (and not line dipoles). This results in the stretching of the sphere to an elliptical shape and having a non-uniform distribution of magnetization over the component parts of the sphere. Using this method, as well as soft pole pieces within the design, 4.5T in a working volume of 20mm3 was achieved by Bloch et al. in 1998, and this was increased further to 5T in 2002, although over a smaller working volume of 0.05mm3. As hard materials are temperature-dependent, refrigeration of the entire magnet array can increase the field within the <b>working</b> <b>area</b> further as shown by Kumada et al. This group also reported development of a 5.16T Halbach dipole cylinder in 2003.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time that S2 was built, a {{dividing}} wall, again of inferior quality, was built across S1 to create a western room. There were no molehills within the smaller building, which had suggested that, unlike its neighbour, it has a buried solid floor, and this was confirmed by excavation. This had a floor originally made of mortar, relaid at least once, but then covered with a layer of flint cobbles, suggesting that it was a <b>working</b> <b>area.</b> The old hearth was not covered, so it may have still been used. A new fireplace was also added, apparently of a domestic design, although the context makes that function improbable. A well-marked track led southwest down the slope from S1, and a large midden was close to the path. It has been suggested that a [...] "clean" [...] pit north of S1 was a well, with fresh water floating above the saltwater below, a phenomenon known from Blakeney Point and elsewhere on the Norfolk coast.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} architectural {{plan for}} Savile Row {{is believed to}} have been drawn up by Colen Campbell, with Henry Flitcroft as the main architect of the street, under the supervision of Daniel Garrett; though 1 and 22–23 Savile Row were designed by William Kent, who moved into No. 2. These architects were all under the influence of Burlington's interpretation of Palladian architecture, known as [...] "Burlingtonian", which was to have some influence on English architecture in the 16th century. As tailoring moved into the street, the house frontages were altered to bring natural light into the tailors' <b>working</b> <b>area</b> with the addition of glass frontages and light wells. The houses have been much altered over time; the original Burlingtonian design has been mostly lost, though No. 14 still retains much of the original external features.
