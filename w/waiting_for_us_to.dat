2500|$|The United States House of Representatives {{voted on}} , 2014, to pass House Resolution 608, {{entitled}} Condemning the senseless rampage and mass shooting {{that took place}} in Isla Vista, California, on Friday , 2014. Rep. Lois Capps (D-CA) said that Congress needed to take more action to stop gun violence, saying, [...] "We must not let the drumbeat fall silent. Congress has the power to act and we must." [...] Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) agreed with her, saying that [...] "Americans, outraged by our inability to get anything done on the issue, are <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> come to our senses and to act." ...|$|E
2500|$|A bronze Roman piece c. 200 BC to 200 AD {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} in the museum – it was {{discovered}} in 1960 and is a rare item that was unearthed after over 1,800 years. Wagner bought the item from Rik Gijsen, a Netherlands-based antiquities dealer. The piece was acquired by the museum in April 2006. Approximately 1,000 of the nutcrackers from the museum are highlighted in a book by Wagner, The Art and Character of Nutcrackers. The museum is open to visitors in the afternoon, from May to October; it is open to the public on weekends during the period from November to April. Arlene and George Wagner traveled the globe in search of nutcrackers for the museum: [...] "That's all we do! My husband and I have never been on a cruise. We just got back from Europe yesterday, hunting for nutcrackers. We went to the Netherlands. We attended a couple of very big European antique shows. We also had nutcrackers <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> pick up – very valuable 16th and 17th century ones." ...|$|E

60|$|No one had remarked my absence. The {{boat was}} near enough <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> make {{out that it}} was larger than any sealing boat and built on {{different}} lines. As we drew closer, the sail was taken in and the mast unstepped. Oars were shipped, and its occupants <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> heave to and take them aboard.|$|R
6000|$|Declamation {{was evidently}} more the Muse's forte than argument, but her aside was an aside, {{and that of}} the jockey friend was not. [...] "So you <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> give your part of the lecture, Miss Moy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. You'll {{sit here}} and wait," [...] said Walter, his great, splendid eyes full of strange glamour. [...] "You'll <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> come back. And we may not come--for we cannot come {{as long as the}} Piper plays. He may pipe us round the world. And still you'll {{sit here and}} wait--and WAIT." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{think with}} you {{we had better}} look at it again in the {{sunlight}} to-morrow. But here come our friends; they have probably been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> join them and go in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, all right. Mrs. Kenton is <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go to dinner. And look here," [...] {{whispered the}} colonel, [...] "don't {{you open your}} mouth, except to put {{something}} into it, till I give you the cue." ...|$|E
60|$|Soon the {{transformation}} was complete: and a noble lion stood patiently <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{come up with}} it. No thought of fear seemed to occur to the children, who patted and stroked {{it as if it}} had been a Shetland-pony.|$|E
60|$|The top of {{the divide}} gave a grand view of wooded hills to the northeast, but father did not <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> enjoy that. He started the team on the perilous {{downward}} road without regard to our wishes, and so we bumped and clattered to the bottom, all joy of the scenery swallowed up in fear of being thrown from the wagon.|$|R
6000|$|Sir John. That's as you please: However 'tis believed, his wit {{will not}} much credit your choice. Madam, do justice <b>to</b> <b>us</b> both; pay his ingratitude and folly with your scorn; my service with your love. By this time your father stays for me: I shall be {{discreet}} {{enough to keep}} this fault of yours from him; the lawyers <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> draw your jointure; and I would beg your pardon for my absence, but that my crime is punished in itself. [...] [Exit.|$|R
5000|$|Zimeray {{has stated}} [...] "We face a {{frequent}} misunderstanding. Many people place {{human rights in}} some kind of moral area and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> answer with symbols, declarations and gestures.One must have the courage to say that Human Rights are not morality, they are rights that exist or does not exist, that are applied or violated: the right to not be tortured, access to fair trial, equality between men and women. Our action does not only take place in some declaratory and narcissistic style." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{friendship}} that is lightly given is worth very much," [...] she said. [...] "I could decide better in another six months. Now {{it is perhaps}} fortunate that Colonel Barrington is <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> make up his four at whist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps Dick is at {{our house}} <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> come back," [...] put in Frank. [...] "Let us go home and see. We can come back early in the morning." [...] He looked at his watch. [...] "Do {{you know that it}} is after two o'clock? I'm afraid my father will worry about me." ...|$|E
60|$|Umslopogaas halted also, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> come up, since, cunning old warrior as he was, {{he feared}} lest should he begin the fight before that happened, the horde {{of them would}} fall on him. Thirty seconds later we arrived and found him {{standing}} still with bent body, small shield advanced and the great axe raised as though {{in the act of}} striking, a wondrous picture outlined as it was against the swiftly rising-sun.|$|E
5000|$|In many of {{the above}} uses, the implied subject of the infinitive can be marked using a prepositional phrase with for: [...] "This game is easy {{for a child to}} play", etc. However this does not {{normally}} apply when the infinitive is the complement of a verb (other than the copula, and certain verbs that allow a construction with for, such as wait: [...] "They <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> arrive"). It also does not apply in elliptical questions, or in fixed expressions such as so as to, am to, etc. (although it does apply in in order to).|$|R
500|$|Shaw {{was found}} by the Royal Navy helicopter, {{approximately}} 20 minutes after the alarm was raised, 150 metres downstream from where she had fallen in. Due to poor visibility {{as a result of}} heavy rain, the other members of her group had been unable to see her from where they were standing. There were two adults in the group. A member of the helicopter crew explained: [...] "There were two people waving their jackets and pointing into the river. Initially we thought 'Why are they not in the water helping?' what looked like a child face down in the water. Seeing the fast-flowing river, and how dangerous it would have been for them, there was no alternative <b>for</b> them <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> arrive." ...|$|R
60|$|Now we {{approached}} a log farm-house where, according to report, {{there was a}} guard of five Union soldiers. Lyman called a halt; and there, in the deep gloom of the overhanging branches, he began to whisper a plan of assault upon that house, which made the gloom more depressing than it was before. It was a crucial moment; we realised, with a cold suddenness, that here was no jest--we were standing {{face to face with}} actual war. We were equal to the occasion. In our response there was no hesitation, no indecision: we said that if Lyman wanted to meddle with those soldiers, he could go ahead and do it; but if he <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> follow him, he would wait a long time.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] Dorle said, [...] "it {{noticed the}} rock, {{as soon as}} I threw {{it up in the}} air. It's alert to {{anything}} that flies or moves above the ground level. Probably it detected us as soon as we entered the gravitational field of the planet. It probably had a bead on us from the start. We don't have a chance. It knows all about the ship. It's just <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> take off again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Our {{hearts are}} dull, and hard, and light, God forgive us! and we forget {{continually}} what an earnest, awful {{world we live}} in--a whole eternity <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be born, and a whole eternity {{waiting to see what}} we shall do now we are born. Yes, our hearts are dull, and hard, and light. And therefore Christ sends suffering on us, to teach us what we always gladly forget in comfort and prosperity--what an awful capacity of suffering we have; and more, what an awful capacity of suffering our fellow-creatures have likewise. [...] .|$|E
60|$|This {{is the sum}} and {{substance}} of some conversations held while rambling among these scenes, {{going in and out}} of arches, climbing into nooks and through loopholes, picking moss and ivy, and occasionally retreating under the shadow of some arch, while the skies were indulging in a sudden burst of emotion. The poor woman who acted as our guide, ensconcing herself in a dry corner, stood like a literal Patience on a monument, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be through; we were sorry for her, but as it was our first and last chance, and she would stay there, we could not help it.|$|E
60|$|We went on next morning, still by railroad, to Springfield. From {{that place}} to Hartford, whither we were bound, is a {{distance}} of only five-and-twenty miles, {{but at that time}} of the year the roads were so bad that the journey would probably have occupied ten or twelve hours. Fortunately, however, the winter having been unusually mild, the Connecticut River was 'open,' or, in other words, not frozen. The captain of a small steamboat was going to make his first trip for the season that day (the second February trip, I believe, within the memory of man), and only <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go on board. Accordingly, we went on board, with as little delay as might be. He was as good as his word, and started directly.|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord, that is so," [...] said Infadoos; [...] "the spring cannot {{supply the}} wants of so great a multitude, {{and it is}} failing rapidly. Before night we shall all be thirsty. Listen, Macumazahn. Thou art wise, and hast doubtless seen many wars in the lands from whence thou camest--that is if indeed they make wars in the Stars. Now tell us, what shall we do? Twala has brought up many fresh men {{to take the place}} of those who have fallen. Yet Twala has learnt his lesson; the hawk did not think to find the heron ready; but our beak has pierced his breast; he fears <b>to</b> strike at <b>us</b> again. We too are wounded, and he will <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> die; he will wind himself round us like a snake round a buck, and fight the fight of 'sit down.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} ascribe {{a great deal}} too much potency to the grave," [...] said Septimius, pausing involuntarily alone by the little hillock, whose {{contents}} he knew so well. [...] "The grave {{seems to me a}} vile pitfall, put right in our pathway, and catching most of us,--all of us,--causing <b>us</b> <b>to</b> tumble in at the most inconvenient opportunities, so that all human life is a jest and a farce, {{just for the sake of}} this inopportune death; for I observe it never <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> accomplish anything: we may have the salvation of a country in hand, but we are none the less likely to die for that. So that, being a believer, on the whole, in the wisdom and graciousness of Providence, I am convinced that dying is a mistake, and that by and by we shall overcome it. I say there is no use in the grave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There, there! Take comfort, ma'am. She is in {{the hands}} of God! All that mortal man can do is being done. And she is safer with that gallant young giant than she could be with any other man on the ship. Look, how he is {{protecting}} her! Why he knows that all that can be done is being done. He is <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> get to him, and is saving himself for it. Any other man who didn't know so much about swimming as he does would try to reach the lifebuoy; and would choke the two of them with the spindrift in the trying. Mind how he took the red cap to help us see them. He's a fine lad that; a gallant lad!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An Injin {{is always}} most {{dangerous}} {{just when you}} ain't thinking of him. You may be sure we have been watched, although we haven't seen no one, and that seeing as we are on guard they are <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> become careless again; {{or it may be}} they have fixed upon their place of attack, and if so, you may bet yer life it is a good one. Above all things you men impress upon the women and children that in case of a sudden attack they shall each take refuge at once in the waggons, in the places allotted to them, and that they shall do it with out any squealing or yelling; there's nothing bothers men and flurries them, just as they have got need to be cool and steady, as the yelping of a pack of women. Just impress on them as it does no good, and adds to the chances of their getting their throats cut and their har raised." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{is a great}} {{difference}} in boats, of course. For a long time I was on a boat that was so slow we used to forget what year it was we left port in. But of course this was at rare intervals. Ferryboats used to lose valuable trips because their passengers grew old and died, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> get by. This was at still rarer intervals. I had the documents for these occurrences, but through carelessness they have been mislaid. This boat, the 'John J. Roe,' was so slow that when she finally sunk in Madrid Bend, it was five years before the owners heard of it. That was always a confusing fact to me, but it is according to the record, any way. She was dismally slow; still, we often had pretty exciting times racing with islands, and rafts, and such things. One trip, however, we did rather well. We went to St. Louis in sixteen days. But even at this rattling gait I think we changed watches three times in Fort Adams reach, which is five miles long. A 'reach' {{is a piece of}} straight river, and of course the current drives through such a place in a pretty lively way.|$|E
60|$|NICHOLLS (glancing at him nervously). I {{wonder how}} soon she'll be back? The {{carriage}} is <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> We'll have <b>to</b> hurry {{to make that}} last train back. If we miss it--it means two hours on the damn tram.|$|R
6000|$|Then, with {{a sudden}} impulse, she looked back into the church, and {{recognised}} a black figure and slightly bald head bowed {{down in one of}} the seats. She pointed him out. 'No doubt he is <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> all <b>to</b> be gone,' said Mark in a low voice. 'You go into the Rectory, Nuttie; there's a fire in the study, and I'll bring him to you there. I'll get him to stay the night if I can.' ...|$|R
50|$|WDRT {{started as}} an Internet audio stream on 30 June 2005 while Driftless Community Radio, Inc. (DCR) was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the <b>US</b> FCC <b>to</b> accept {{applications}} for new non-commercial radio stations. radiodriftless.org (now defunct) streamed audio, both live and pre-recorded for four years.|$|R
6000|$|Sir Thomas, as {{he looked}} up at the young man, leaning back in his arm-chair and holding his glass half full of wine in his hand, could not but tell himself that the greater was the pity. This {{off-shoot}} of the Newton stock, who declared of himself that he never could be Newton of Newton, was a fine, manly fellow to look at,--not handsome as was Ralph the heir, not marked by that singular mixture of gentleness, intelligence, and sweetness which was written, not only on the countenance, but in the demeanour and very step of Gregory; but he was a bigger man than either of them, with a broad chest, and a square brow, and was not without that bright gleam of the Newton blue eye, which characterised all the family. And there was so much of the man in him;--whereas, in manhood, Ralph the heir had certainly been deficient. [...] "Ralph must lie on the bed that he has made," [...] said Sir Thomas. [...] "And you, of course, will accept the good things that come in your way. As far as I can see at present it will be best for Ralph that your father should redeem from him a portion, at least, of the property. The girls are <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go out, and perhaps you will like a cigar on the lawn." ...|$|E
60|$|Therefore, my friends, be {{not ashamed}} to have felt acutely. Be not ashamed to feel acutely still, till all danger is past, or even long after all danger is past; {{when you look}} back on what might have been, and what it might have brought, ay, must have brought, if not to you, still to your {{children}} after you. For so you will show yourselves worthy descendants of your forefathers: so you will show yourselves worthy citizens of this British empire. So you will show yourselves, as I believe, worthy Christian men and women. For Christ, the King of kings and subjects, sends all sorrow, to make us feel acutely. We do not, the great majority of us, feel enough. Our hearts are dull and hard and light, God forgive us; and we forget continually what an earnest, awful world we live in--a whole eternity <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be born, and a whole eternity waiting to see what we shall do now we are born. Yes; our hearts are dull and hard and light; and, therefore, Christ sends suffering on us to teach us what we always gladly forget in comfort and prosperity--what an awful capacity of suffering we have; and more, what an awful capacity of suffering our fellow-creatures have likewise. We sit at ease too often in a fool's paradise, till God awakens us and tortures us into pity for the torture of others. And so, if we will not acknowledge our brotherhood by any other teaching, He knits us together by the brotherhood of common suffering.|$|E
6000|$|He {{could get}} nothing. His alarm increased, {{and in the}} pauses he would dart his eyes here and there; then, loth to give up, he would branch off into feeling allusion {{to the dangers of}} his journey. The audacious Hernandez, leaving his usual haunts, had crossed the Campo of Sulaco, and was known to be lurking in the ravines of the coast range. Yesterday, when distant only a few hours from Sulaco, the hide {{merchant}} and his servants had seen three men on the road arrested suspiciously, with their horses' heads together. Two of these rode off at once and disappeared in a shallow quebrada to the left. [...] "We stopped," [...] continued the man from Esmeralda, [...] "and I tried to hide behind a small bush. But none of my mozos would go forward {{to find out what it}} meant, and the third horseman seemed to be <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> come up. It was no use. We had been seen. So we rode slowly on, trembling. He let us pass--a man on a grey horse with his hat down on his eyes--without a word of greeting; but by-and-by we heard him galloping after us. We faced about, but that did not seem to intimidate him. He rode up at speed, and touching my foot with the toe of his boot, asked me for a cigar, with a blood-curdling laugh. He did not seem armed, but when he put his hand back to reach for the matches I saw an enormous revolver strapped to his waist. I shuddered. He had very fierce whiskers, Don Carlos, and as he did not offer to go on we dared not move. At last, blowing the smoke of my cigar into the air through his nostrils, he said, 'Senor, it would be perhaps better for you if I rode behind your party. You are not very far from Sulaco now. Go you with God.' What would you? We went on. There was no resisting him. He might have been Hernandez himself; though my servant, who has been many times to Sulaco by sea, assured me that he had recognized him very well for the Capataz of the Steamship Company's Cargadores. Later, that same evening, I saw that very man at the corner of the Plaza talking to a girl, a Morenita, who stood by the stirrup with her hand on the grey horse's mane." ...|$|E
50|$|In some cases, US {{trainers}} {{have reported}} missing vehicles, weapons {{and other military}} equipment, and outright theft of fuel provided by the U.S. Death threats have also been leveled against some U.S. officers who tried to stop Afghan soldiers from stealing. Some Afghan soldiers often find improvised explosive devices and snip the command wires instead of marking them and <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>U.S.</b> forces <b>to</b> come to detonate them. The Americans say this just allows the insurgents to return and reconnect them. US trainers frequently had to remove the cell phones of Afghan soldiers hours before a mission for fear that the operation will be compromised by bragging, gossip and reciprocal warnings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pressure}} was tremendous. The popular press was blowing {{up the old}} rivalry. We knew that on the pitch the Dutch were ready and <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> We had <b>to</b> stay focused.
