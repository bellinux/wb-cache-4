Beatrice, who wore her mother's <b>wedding</b> <b>veil</b> of Honiton lace, was escorted by the Queen and Beatrice's eldest brother, the Prince of Wales. Princess Beatrice was {{attended}} by ten royal bridesmaids from among her nieces: Princess Alix and Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine; Princess Alexandra, Princess Marie, and Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh; Princess Louise, Princess Maud, and Princess Victoria of Wales; Princess Marie Louise and Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein. The bridegroom's supporters were his brothers, Prince Alexander of Bulgaria and Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg.|$|E
5|$|Victoria settled an annuity on Louise {{shortly before}} her marriage. The {{ceremony}} {{was conducted at}} St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on 21 March 1871, and the crowd outside was so large that, for the first time, policemen had to form chain barriers to keep control. Louise wore a <b>wedding</b> <b>veil</b> of Honiton lace that she designed herself, and was escorted into the Chapel by her mother, and her two eldest brothers, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh. On this occasion, the usually severe black of the Queen's mourning dress was relieved by the crimson rubies and blues of the Garter star. Following the ceremony, the Queen kissed Louise, and Lorne – {{now a member of}} the royal family, but still a subject – kissed the Queen's hand.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Victoria {{had written}} {{instructions}} for her funeral, {{which was to}} be military as befitting a soldier's daughter {{and the head of the}} army, and white instead of black. On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, helped lift her body into the coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her <b>wedding</b> <b>veil.</b> An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday 2 February, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park.|$|E

50|$|Sculptures {{of boxing}} gloves trimmed with vintage wedding dresses that {{hang from the}} ceiling {{as well as a}} {{powerful}} neon adorned with <b>wedding</b> <b>veils</b> explore the complex aggressions that women face each day and the idea that they must fight in response. Further in terms of matrimony they suggest the weight, strength, and delicacy of marriage and its impact on womanhood.|$|R
50|$|Even after that, for a period, wedding dresses {{were adapted}} to the styles of the day. For example, in the 1920s, they were {{typically}} short in the front with a longer train {{in the back and}} were worn with cloche-style <b>wedding</b> <b>veils.</b> This tendency to follow current fashions continued until the late 1960s, when it became popular to revert to long, full-skirted designs reminiscent of the Victorian era.|$|R

After closing her own salon, she continued {{to act as an}} advisor to other design houses until the mid 1990s.|$|E

Following a simple funeral, owing to the war, her remains [...] were cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 8 December. Her ashes were quietly placed in the Royal Crypt at St. George's Chapel on 12 December, with many members of the Royal and Argyll {{families}} present. Her ashes were moved to the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore near Windsor, on 13 March 1940.

2500|$|Her {{mother died}} when she was 20, and she spent the next {{fourteen}} years looking after her father who was in poor health. When her father died in 1895 she went to Minnesota to perform welfare work amongst Cornish mineworkers living there, the trip having been organised by the wife of the Archbishop of Canterbury. There she became engaged to John Carr Jackson and the couple bought a ranch in Mexico but this did not prosper and the engagement was broken off. She returned to England in 1898 after losing most of her money in a speculative venture. Her <b>wedding</b> <b>veil</b> (that she never wore) hangs in the head office of the [...] "Oranje Vrouevereniging" [...] (Orange Women's Society) in Bloemfontein, the first women's welfare organisation in the Orange Free State, as a symbol of her commitment to the uplifting of women.|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century, <b>wedding</b> <b>veils</b> came {{to symbolize}} the woman's virginity and modesty. The {{tradition}} of a veiled bride's face continues even today wherein, a virgin bride, especially in Christian or Jewish culture, enters the marriage ritual with a veiled face and head, and remains fully veiled, both head and face, until the ceremony concludes. After the full conclusion of the wedding ceremony, either the bride's father lifts the veil giving the bride to the groom who then kisses her, or the new groom lifts her face veil in order to kiss her, which symbolizes the groom's right to enter into conjugal relations with his bride.|$|R
5000|$|After {{shrouding}} {{the bride}} and groom with the <b>wedding</b> <b>veils,</b> a pair of wedding participants is assigned in placing the wedding cord around the couple, with the groom being the first to be “lassoed” or “looped” by it at the shoulder area. [...] The cord is held in place by means of pins. In other wedding ceremonies, the wedding cord is tied around the couple’s wrists. The wedding cord stays on and around the couple until the wedding mass or religious service is finished. Then, it is removed by the same pair of wedding participants who were assigned to place the loop around the couple. [...] The significance of the [...] "lassoing" [...] is to symbolize the unification of the couple in matrimony for their entire lives.|$|R

We sat there and talked until the first star lighted a white taper over the beech hill.|$|E
50|$|The bride's attire is {{typically}} a custom-made white <b>wedding</b> gown and <b>veil.</b> This {{is from the}} Anglo-American influence of dressing the woman in white on her wedding day.

5000|$|A veil called flammeum was {{the most}} {{prominent}} feature of the costume worn by the bride at Roman <b>weddings.</b> The <b>veil</b> was a deep yellow color reminiscent of a candle flame.

The Romans apparently thought of the bride as being [...] "clouded over with a veil" [...] and connected the verb nubere (to be married) with nubes, the word for cloud.|$|R
