5|$|The Stokes Mortar {{was rapidly}} {{developed}} <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> that {{some type of}} weapon was needed to provide artillery-like fire support to the infantry. The weapon was fully man-transportable yet also capable of firing reasonably powerful shells at targets beyond the range of rifle grenades.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> that Xangsane would {{approach}} the Capital, PAGASA upgraded the warning for Manila and central Luzon to Storm Signal Number 3 on September 28. All the storm signals were discontinued later that day.|$|E
5|$|Early in his reign, {{there were}} plans {{regarding}} {{a marriage of}} Władysław and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine (daughter of Frederick V, Elector Palatine). This was however unpopular, both with Catholic nobles and the Catholic Church, and <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> to Władysław that this would not convince the Swedes to elect him to their throne, this plan, with quiet support from Władysław himself, was dropped.|$|E
5000|$|Amendments {{are added}} to the 2003 US-British-Spanish Draft Resolution on Iraq, setting a {{deadline}} of 17 March. The draft is withheld <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> that the resolution will not pass.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> to Lamorak {{that neither}} side will give in, he reluctantly volunteers {{to operate the}} waste {{processing}} machinery himself. Seeing this, Ragusnik capitulates {{and goes back to}} work.|$|R
5000|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the}} young king will not live long, other plans are made for Jane. John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, gets the young Edward to {{proclaim}} Jane as his successor.|$|R
5|$|First of all, {{this was}} the 60th {{homicide}} in Newark this year, and I'm sure Congressman Tancredo has not opined {{about any of the}} other homicides, and only became interested in this one <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> that one of the six alleged perpetrators came to this country illegally at the age of 11. That's one thing.|$|E
5|$|Orders for {{the bodies}} of the previously-deceased members of the {{household}} to be exhumed were issued <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> that arsenic was the mechanism of Thomas Higgins's death. The bodies of John Flannagan, Mary Higgins, and Margaret Jennings all showed evidence of minimal deterioration – a quality associated with arsenic poisoning – and traces of arsenic were found in the remains of all three.|$|E
5|$|The entire theatre {{staff was}} laid off in December 1996 once {{it became clear that}} the Brars were seriously {{considering}} purchasing the theatre, and the theatre’s projectionists began what would be a six-month strike <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> the Brars would not respect a recently signed two-year contract with the Old Strathcona Foundation.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after Gaeta seizes {{control of}} Galactica, Zarek meets with the Quorum. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> that the Quorum will not follow Zarek {{as the new}} President, Zarek orders the entire Quorum to be executed.|$|R
50|$|A {{negative}} condition depends on {{an uncertain future}} event’s not happening. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> that an event can no longer take place, the condition is satisfied and the agreement works on that basis. Negative conditions are generally resolutive.|$|R
50|$|Alex is {{a fellow}} summer film student. Tibby finds him intriguing, talented, and attractive, and she tries to impress him.

5|$|Vick {{attempted}} {{to defuse the}} discussion when he announced on December 15 {{that he would be}} returning for his fourth year with the team. But in late December, Vick wavered on that decision <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> that if he left the team, he would be selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. Heading into the Gator Bowl, his decision was still up in the air.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the war, McClellan and his family went to Europe (not returning until 1868), during which he did not participate in politics. When he returned, the Democratic Party expressed some interest in nominating him for president again, but <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> that Ulysses S. Grant would be the Republican candidate, this interest died. McClellan worked on engineering projects in New York City and was offered the position of president of the newly formed University of California.|$|E
5|$|Drusus {{had little}} time to mourn or {{celebrate}} {{the death of his}} grandfather or the ascendance of Tiberius: the legions in the Rhine and Illyricum were in mutiny. They had not received the bonuses promised to them by Augustus, and <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. On 17 or 18 September, Drusus was sent to deal with the troops in Illyricum, and a delegation was sent to confer proconsular imperium maius upon Germanicus, who dealt with the situation on the Rhine. Drusus did not require proconsular powers because he was consul designate.|$|E
50|$|Richard Nugent (Cary Grant), a {{handsome}} and sophisticated artist, is {{a defendant in}} Margaret's courtroom, charged by ADA Tommy Chamberlain (Rudy Vallee) with starting a nightclub brawl.

50|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> {{that all}} those events are related, an {{international}} scientific task force is created under {{the lead of the}} United States.

The army of the Lower Rhine was {{stationed}} in summer quarters {{on the border of}} the Ubii. They had not gotten the bonuses promised them by Augustus, and <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. Germanicus dealt with the troops in Germania, and Tiberius' son Drusus dealt with Illyricum.|$|E
5|$|On 17 April 1555, Elizabeth was {{recalled}} {{to court}} to attend {{the final stages of}} Mary's apparent pregnancy. If Mary and her child died, Elizabeth would become queen. If, on the other hand, Mary gave birth to a healthy child, Elizabeth's chances of becoming queen would recede sharply. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> that Mary was not pregnant, no one believed any longer that she could have a child. Elizabeth's succession seemed assured.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice left Doulton's in 1948 <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> he wouldn't {{be offered}} a board {{position}} with the company, and moved to join fellow accountant Reginald Wilson at the state owned British Transport Commission (BTC). Wilson, as comptroller, offered Smallpeice the role of Director of Costs and Statistics, but within two years, Smallpeice grew to realise that the business, with 600,000 staff, was effectively unmanageable without support from government {{and he began to}} assess his options elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|Roundtable. After the {{excitement}} of exploring a new technology wears off, there is an uncomfortable moment <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> that technology is just a tool –it’s only effective when wielded well. This roundtable will explore the ways that iPads can be leveraged not just to impress, but to actually engage faculty on campus...|$|R
50|$|An anti-viral {{drug called}} Zombrex, {{that keeps the}} virus at bay, is being {{administered}} to those infected. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> that the drug is no longer effective and a zombie outbreak purges the town and infects its inhabitants, Chase, Jordan, grieving mother Maggie, and survivor Crystal battle {{their way out of}} the city before it gets firebombed.|$|R

5|$|Starting in August 1941, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> to {{some in the}} Propaganda Ministry and the Wehrmacht {{high command}} that the war would likely extend into 1942, Goebbels grew {{increasingly}} concerned about the triumphant tone of the communiques. However, a string of spectacular victories in September, especially in the Battle of Kiev, removed any restraint from the texts, making propagandists's work more difficult later on, {{when they had to}} explain the Wehrmacht's failures to the German public which was rapidly losing confidence in a swift victory.|$|E
5|$|The N1s {{compared}} favourably {{with the}} Nclass, although the type showed little improvement in performance. More {{of the class}} were built <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> that the type's smaller cylinders provided greater route availability. A total of six engines were built. The N1class was primarily used on the Eastern section of the Southern Railway network, and used by the Southern Region of British Railways (BR) from 1948. The N1s gave valuable service until they were withdrawn in 1962. None were preserved.|$|E
5|$|The first {{parliamentary}} elections after independence were held on 27 February and 8 March 1958. The {{result was a}} victory for Abd al-Rahman's Umma Party, which won 63 of the 173 seats. The Southern Sudan Federal Party competed in the election, and won 40 of the 46 seats allocated to the southern provinces. The Federal party platform represented a serious challenge to the authorities. However, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> that the party's demands for a federal structure would be ignored by the Constituent Assembly, on 16 June 1958 the southern MPs left parliament.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} {{originally}} intended to be laid down 1 September 1939, but they were delayed until November to allow improvements to the shipyards to be completed. A total of sixteen ships were planned in the August 1939 building program, but this was scaled back to four in July 1940 and two in October 1940 <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> just how unprepared the Soviets were for any large-scale naval construction program. Work on these ships ceased shortly after the German invasion.|$|E
5|$|Vizzini is {{the central}} {{character}} {{in the history of}} direct Mafia support for the Allied Forces during the invasion of Sicily in 1943. After World War II he became the personification of the reinstatement of Cosa Nostra during the Allied occupation and the subsequent restoration of democracy after the repression under Fascist rule. Initially he supported the separatist movement, but changed allegiance to the Christian Democrat party, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> that Sicilian independence was unfeasible.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> in the 1950s {{that the}} library had outgrown its {{existing}} building, the school initially hired an architect who proposed a traditional {{design for the}} new building. Deciding instead to construct a library with a contemporary design, the school gave the commission to Louis Kahn in 1965. The library was opened in 1971. In 1997 the library received the Twenty-five Year Award from the American Institute of Architects, an award that recognizes architecture of enduring significance that is given {{to no more than}} one building per year.|$|E
