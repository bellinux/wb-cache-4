But the coach can take the goalkeeper off for {{a short amount of}} time, and switch him with a field player. This can make {{advantages}} for the attacking side of the team, and disadvantages <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own defence. The team is also allowed to change players any time in the game, usually they change the whole team. Individual substitution happens sometimes, but it usually happens when a player is exhausted or is hurt.|$|E
25|$|Ae. albopictus also bites {{other mammals}} besides humans, {{as well as}} birds. The females are always on {{the search for a}} host and are {{persistent}} but cautious <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> blood meal and host location. Their blood meal is often broken off before enough blood has been ingested for the development of their eggs, so Asian tiger mosquitoes bite multiple hosts during their development cycle of the egg, making them particularly efficient at transmitting diseases. The mannerism of biting diverse host species enables the Asian tiger mosquito to be a potential bridge vector for certain pathogens that can jump species boundaries, for example the West Nile virus.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} before SSRIs are rather promiscuous {{in that they}} also bind to the homologous NET and DAT, although with much lower affinity than to their principal target SERT. The selectivity of SSRIs for SERT is really interesting where {{only one or two}} different functional group substituents are sufficient to convert an SSRI into a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) with higher affinity to NE. SSRI antidepressants all have the same mechanism of action and are at least 10-fold more selective for 5-HT re-uptake inhibition than for NE re-uptake inhibition. However, despite the sharing of the same mechanism of action, SSRIs differ in their potency and selectivity in inhibiting 5-HT re-uptake and many of them have important effects on other transporters and receptors. SSRIs are structurally diverse with clear variations in their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles, which leads to differences among them in their half-lifes, clinical activity, adverse effects and drug interactions, which explains the differences in their efficacy and tolerability among patients. However, all SSRIs are clinically equal <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> efficacy over time.|$|E

25|$|As for {{architecture}} in the city, both {{the body of}} architectural styles {{as well as the}} prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939–1945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down {{to make way for a}} large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel Börs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.|$|E

500|$|While critics {{had mixed}} {{reactions}} to the film in general, some praised it for its visuals, action-adventure elements, and its attempt to appeal to an older audience. Roger Ebert gave Atlantis three-and-half stars out of four. He praised the animation's [...] "clean bright visual look" [...] and the [...] "classic energy of the comic book style", crediting this {{to the work of}} Mike Mignola. Ebert gave particular praise to the story and the final battle scene and wrote, [...] "The story of Atlantis is rousing in an old pulp science fiction sort of way, but the climactic scene transcends the rest, and stands by itself {{as one of the great}} animated action sequences." [...] In The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell gave high praise to the film, calling it [...] "a monumental treat", and stated, [...] "Atlantis is also one of the most eye-catching Disney cartoons since Uncle Walt institutionalized the four-fingered glove." [...] Internet film critic James Berardinelli wrote a positive review of the film, giving it three out of four stars.

500|$|Pinter's last stage play, Celebration (2000), is {{a social}} satire set in an opulent restaurant, which lampoons The Ivy, a fashionable venue in London's West End theatre district, and its patrons who [...] "have just come from {{performances}} of either the ballet or the opera.

[...] gilded, foul-mouthed souls are just as myopic <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own table mates (and for that matter, their food), with conversations that usually connect only on the surface, if there." [...] On its surface the play may appear to have fewer overtly political resonances {{than some of the}} plays from the 1980s and 1990s; but its central male characters, brothers named Lambert and Matt, are members of the elite (like the men in charge in Party Time), who describe themselves as [...] "peaceful strategy consultants [...] we don't carry guns." [...] At the next table, Russell, a banker, describes himself as a [...] "totally disordered personality... a psychopath," [...] while Lambert [...] "vows to be reincarnated as ' more civilised, [...] gentler person, [...] nicer person'." [...] These characters' deceptively smooth exteriors mask their extreme viciousness. [...] Celebration evokes familiar Pinteresque political contexts: [...] "The ritzy loudmouths in 'Celebration'... and the quieter working-class mumblers of 'The Room'... have everything in common beneath the surface". [...] "Money remains in the service of entrenched power, and the brothers in the play are 'strategy consultants' whose jobs involve force and violence... It is tempting but inaccurate to equate the comic power inversions of the social behavior in Celebration with lasting change in larger political structures", according to Grimes, for whom the play indicates Pinter's pessimism about the possibility of changing the status quo. [...] Yet, as the Waiter's often comically unbelievable reminiscences about his grandfather demonstrate in Celebration, Pinter's final stage plays also extend some expressionistic aspects of his earlier [...] "memory plays", while harking back to his [...] "comedies of menace", as illustrated in the characters and in the Waiter's final speech: ...|$|E
