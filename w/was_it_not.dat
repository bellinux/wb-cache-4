25|$|My dear Miss Hamilton, What can I have to say? Not much indeed! But to {{wish you}} a good morning, in the pretty blue and white room where I had the {{pleasure}} to sit and read with you The Hermit, a poem which is such a favourite with me that I have read it twice this summer. Oh! What a blessing to keep good company! Very likely I {{should not have been}} acquainted with either poet or poem <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>not</b> for you.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the century the chances of the College gaining a royal charter seemed a distant prospect. Many on the College Council were aware of the need to {{progress}} and achieve greater financial support including Lewis Fry. They were aware that <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>not</b> for the anonymous donations made to the College (by a Mr Fenwick Richards) during the last century there would have been bankruptcy. The establishment of the University Colston Society (named after one of Bristol's great benefactors Edward Colston) was the impetus for the campaign to create a University for Bristol and the West of England. It was non-political and was aimed at shaking off the image that the College was a Liberal institution as it was recognised broad political support needed to be generated in order for the plan to become a University to succeed. The first Society Dinner was held on 7 December 1899 with the guest speaker James Byrce (later Viscount Bryce).|$|E
25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>not</b> true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E

Before killing himself, Meng Tian expressed regret for his walls: [...] "Beginning at Lintao and reaching to Liaodong, I built walls and dug moats {{for more than ten}} thousand li; <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>not</b> inevitable that I broke the earth's veins along the way?

500|$|In 1960, {{the sale}} of cars in Norway was {{deregulated}} and {{the management of the}} public transport system was changed to become that of providing services to those who could not drive their own car. The Ekeberg Line lost traffic because it did not operate to the city center, and with the 1960 decision in the city council <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>not</b> permissible to lay new tracks to Stortorvet. Therefore, locals suggested that the trams continue along the track from Jernbanetorget to Skøyen, {{on the west side of}} town.
