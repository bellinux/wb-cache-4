25|$|The Domain White List (DWL) was {{released}} in October 2010 and is a whitelist of domain names. The DWL enables automatic certification of domains with DKIM signatures. Only verified legitimate senders with clean reputations are approved for <b>whitelisting</b> and there are strict terms to keeping a whitelist account.|$|E
25|$|The Spamhaus White List (SWL) was {{released}} in October 2010 and is a whitelist of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The SWL is intended to allow mail servers to separate incoming email traffic into 3 categories: Good, Bad and Unknown. Only verified legitimate senders with clean reputations are approved for <b>whitelisting</b> and there are strict terms to keeping a Spamhaus Whitelist account.|$|E
3000|$|Independent Thread Independent thread is {{a thread}} which is {{inserted}} by our customized compiler at {{the entry of}} DSSR binary. The thread will allocate the dynamic <b>whitelist</b> and update the <b>whitelist</b> periodically. The thread calls the UCB-D function, which we will present shortly in “UCB-D algorithm” section, to “know" [...] exactly how to update the <b>whitelist.</b> Once the <b>whitelist</b> is updated, the thread will de-randomize the data structures in the previous <b>whitelist,</b> and randomize the data structures in current <b>whitelist.</b> In addition, the thread contains the canary detection (in “Canary detection” section).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Whitelist</b> (known goods): A <b>Whitelist</b> {{is a list}} of [...] "known good data". A <b>Whitelist</b> is {{basically}} a list which says [...] "A, B and C is good (and everything else is bad)".|$|R
30|$|Dynamic <b>WhiteList</b> To {{solve the}} first challenge, DSSR binary {{maintains}} a dynamic <b>whitelist.</b> A dynamic <b>whitelist</b> is a buffer which is allocated in the heap and inserted by our customized compiler. It {{consists of the}} indices of the data structures. If a data structure is in the <b>whitelist,</b> DSSR binary will randomize it in a defense cycle. Otherwise, the data structure will keep its pre-known layout. The only code of DSSR binary that can access the dynamic <b>whitelist</b> is an independent thread illustrated as follows.|$|R
25|$|Although Scroogle's {{activities}} technically violated Google's {{terms of}} service, Google generally tolerated its existence, <b>whitelisting</b> the site on multiple occasions. After 2005, the service encountered rapid growth before running {{into a series}} of problems starting in 2010. In February 2012, the service was permanently shut down by its creator due to a combination of throttling of search requests by Google and a denial-of-service attack by an unknown person or group.|$|E
25|$|In May 2015, {{the company}} {{acquired}} Savant Protection, enabling IT organizations to deploy a unique agent for <b>whitelisting</b> the applications {{that can be}} used on any particular endpoint. When Blue Coat Systems launched the Alliance Ecosystem of Endpoint Detection and Response in July 2015, Digital Guardian was among the alliance-founding members. The ecosystem allows sharing of actionable intelligence gathered from endpoint security solutions. Also in July, IT consulting firm Atos and Digital Guardian partnered up to deliver Atos’ cloud-based data loss prevention service.|$|E
5000|$|Google, a major {{provider}} of services on the Internet, experiments with using a type of DNS <b>whitelisting</b> on a per-ISP basis to prevent this until the World IPv6 Launch. In the DNS <b>whitelisting</b> approach, ISPs are determined from DNS lookup source IP addresses by correlating them with network prefixes derived from routing tables. There is an IETF draft entitled [...] "IPv6 AAAA DNS <b>Whitelisting</b> Implications" [...] that describes the issues around <b>whitelisting.</b> AAAA records are only sent to ISPs that can demonstrate that they are providing reliable IPv6 to their customers. Other ISPs are sent only A records, thus preventing users from attempting to connect over IPv6.|$|E
50|$|An {{automated}} <b>whitelist</b> is a <b>whitelist</b> {{which is}} created or maintained {{by a system}} that monitors incoming and/or outgoing email, and based on preset criteria, will add or remove entries from the <b>whitelist</b> without a need for human intervention.|$|R

50|$|This {{functionality}} is an enhancement {{to creating}} a <b>whitelist</b> manually, such as exporting customer, vendor, friends, or other contact lists from various sources, to then tediously assemble them into a <b>whitelist.</b> Additionally, {{the use of such}} a system removes the difficult task of maintaining a <b>whitelist</b> as new email relationships are formed.|$|R
50|$|One {{solution}} to enhance privacy software is <b>whitelisting.</b> <b>Whitelisting</b> {{is a process}} in which a company identifies the software that it will allow to and does not try to recognize malware. <b>Whitelisting</b> permits acceptable software to run and either prevents anything else from running or lets new software run in a quarantined environment until the can verify its validity. Whereas <b>whitelisting</b> allows nothing to run unless it is on the whitelist, blacklisting allows everything to run unless it is on the black. A blacklist then includes certain types of software that are not allowed to run in the company environment. For example, a company might blacklist peer-to-peer file sharing on its systems. In addition to software, people, devices, and web sites can also be whitelisted or blacklisted.|$|E

50|$|If a <b>whitelist</b> is exclusive, only {{email from}} {{entities}} on the <b>whitelist</b> will get through. If {{it is not}} exclusive, it prevents email from being deleted or sent to the junk mail folder by the spam filter. Usually, only end-users would set a spam filter to delete all emails from sources not on the <b>whitelist,</b> not Internet service providers or email services.|$|R

5000|$|The CSA <b>whitelist</b> is a {{positive}} list for email bulk senders. With ISPs and email-providers participating in the <b>whitelist,</b> solicited email {{does not need to}} enter the ISPs' spamfilter any longer - the chances of false positives (legitimate email erroneously tagged as spam) are supposedly reduced. Bulk email senders can apply for certification for the <b>whitelist.</b> They have to comply with the admission criteria, which assure that legal norms are fulfilled. A control committee monitors that participants adhere to the admission criteria. ISPs sign a licensing agreement setting the rules for the implementation of the <b>whitelist.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Spamhaus has {{released}} The Spamhaus <b>Whitelist</b> {{that includes a}} domain based <b>whitelist,</b> the DWL, where a domain name can be queried as, e.g., [...] Although the standard only specifies [...] resource records, following a long established DNSBL practice, Spamhaus has also assigned [...] resource records with values 127.0.2.0/24 for <b>whitelist</b> return codes. The possibility to query an address may allow easier deployment of existing code. However, their techfaq [...] recommends checking the domain (the value of the [...] tag) of a valid [...] by querying the corresponding [...] record, and their howto [...] gives details about inserting [...] header fields in messages signed by <b>whitelisted</b> domains. By 2013, one of the protocol authors considered it a flop.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{concerns}} were {{been raised about}} the practicality of DNS <b>whitelisting</b> as a long-term large-scale solution, such as scalability and maintenance issues relating {{to the maintenance of}} large numbers of bilateral agreements. In 2010, several of the major web service providers met to discuss pooling their DNS <b>whitelisting</b> information in an attempt to avoid these scaling problems.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{application}} level <b>whitelisting</b> is still {{vulnerable to a}} variety of attacks including those that make use of PowerShell or cross site scripting to launch scripts or inject malicious [...]DLLs onto an endpoint. Lower level <b>whitelisting</b> approaches that can monitor the specific processes and API calls are the deepest and strongest whitelist based cybersecurity solutions available today.|$|E

An exploration of MapReduce model which reliably accommodates big data processing requirements reveals that data traversing through nodes inside clusters during processing are exposed to security and privacy breaches. Further examination identifies elements in security task that impact MapReduce challenges. This paper concerns with the experimentation on how <b>Whitelist</b> access control element can enhance security within MapReduce environment using Hadoop platform. Datasets are executed through series of <b>Whitelist</b> coding/scripts. The enhancement is measured on a basis of <b>Whitelist</b> capability and effectiveness of reducing False Positive Rate error in different scenarios, comparing different sizes of applied <b>Whitelists,</b> key strengths used for filtering and the execution time. The results yield reduced False Positive Rate for <b>Whitelist,</b> supporting claim of an enhanced security but the execution time have increased, indicating lower overall performance...|$|R
50|$|Spam filters {{that come}} with email clients have both <b>whitelists</b> and blacklists of senders and {{keywords}} {{to look for in}} emails. If a spam filter keeps a <b>whitelist,</b> mail from the listed email addresses, domains, and/or IP address will always be allowed.|$|R
30|$|At the {{beginning}} of each defense cycle, DSSR binary randomizes the data structures in the dynamic <b>whitelist,</b> and de-randomizes the data structures that are not in the dynamic <b>whitelist.</b> There are two challenges when we design SALADSPlus: (1) changing the dynamic <b>whitelist</b> of data structures at runtime without recompiling the program (SALADS compiles the source code with a static whitelist); (2) when DSSR binary randomizes data structures, multiple DSSR statements are executed based on the previous layout of the data structures. Without concurrency methods, the DSSR statements may access totally irrelevant fields.|$|R
