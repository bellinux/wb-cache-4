50|$|<b>Woodland</b> <b>voles</b> live {{in family}} groups in burrow systems in home ranges around 14.75-17.75 in (40-45 cm). The burrows are {{exclusive}} {{to the family}} groups, however a group usually {{does not need to}} defend its burrows as other voles usually will not invade them. The size and location of the home range and dispersal of groups are limited by neighboring family groups. Family groups of the vole are made of a breeding female, a breeding male, their 1-4 offspring and sometimes a few other members that serve as helpers. Helpers are immigrants from other groups. Group emigration is uncommon and dependant on whether there are available positions in other groups. Staying in a group as a non-breeding individual is beneficial as burrow systems are major investments and a limited resource.|$|R
40|$|We use {{museum and}} other {{collection}} records to document large and extraordinarily rapid {{changes in the}} ranges and relative abundance of nine species of mammals in the northern Great Lakes region (white-footed mice, woodland deer mice, southern red-backed <b>voles,</b> <b>woodland</b> jumping mice, eastern chipmunks, least chipmunks, southern flying squirrels, northern flying squirrels, common opossums). These species reach either the southern or the northern limit of their distributions in this region. Changes consistently reflect increases in species of primarily southern distribution (white-footed mice, eastern chipmunks, southern flying squirrels, common opossums) and declines by northern species (woodland deer mice, southern red-backed <b>voles,</b> <b>woodland</b> jumping mice, least chipmunks, northern flying squirrels). White-footed mice and southern flying squirrels have extended their ranges over 225 km since 1980, and at particularly well-studied sites in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, small mammal assemblages have shifted from numerical domination by northern species to domination by southern species.

40|$|Predators use scent {{to locate}} their prey, and prey animals often alter their {{behavior}} {{in response to}} predation risk. I tested the hypothesis that voles would decrease their frequency of scent marking in response to predation risk. I conducted trials in which prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, and <b>woodland</b> <b>voles,</b> M. pinetorum, were allowed to scent mark ceramic tiles placed in their runways in the field. The tiles were subjected {{to one of three}} treatments: scented with odor from mink, Mustela vison (a rodent predator); rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus (a nonpredator mammal control); and no odor (control). No significant differences were found in the frequency of scent marking in response to the three treatments for either species. To validate that voles did not decrease their scent marking in response to predation risk, I brought male prairie voles from the field site into the laboratory and allowed them to scent mark white paper substrate treated with mink odor, rabbit odor, or no odor. No significant differences were found in the frequency of scent marks in response to the three treatments. These results differ from what was predicted based on laboratory studies with other species of rodents that show avoidance, reproductive suppression, decreased activity, and reduced scent marking in response to odors of predators. Voles appear to scent mark different substrates and under a wide variety of social and environmental situations, and this is not influenced by the presence of odor from a predator.

5000|$|Prey {{can vary}} greatly based on opportunity. According to one author, [...] "Almost any living {{creature}} that walks, crawls, flies, or swims, except the large mammals, {{is the great}} horned owl's legitimate prey". In fact, the great horned owl has the most diverse prey profile of any raptor in the Americas. Although some other owls may contain more prey diversity in their nests like the northern pygmy owl (Glaucidium gnoma) and barred owl per individual studies, {{as well as some}} diurnal raptors, due to its wide distribution, habitat adaptability, indiscriminate hunting and great size and power, the great horned owl easily outmatches other American raptorial birds in overall prey diversity. All told, over 500 species have been identified as great horned owl prey, with dozens more identified only to genus or general type (especially numerous invertebrates) and presumably several more unknown from their relatively little-studied populations in the neotropics. Mammals (more than 200 species) and, considerably secondarily in general, birds (nearly 300 species) make up the majority of their diet. When summarized, their diet in North America is made up of 87.6% mammals, 6.1% birds, 1.6% reptiles and amphibians with the remaining 4.7% being made up by insects, other assorted invertebrates and fish. Estimated mass of individual prey for the owls has ranged from as little as 0.4 g to as much as 6.8 kg Estimated mean weight of prey items found at nests and routine perches in various studies has ranged from 22.9 g in one study from Washington, where the primary prey was Perognathus, to 610.4 g in the Upper Midwest, where the primary prey was Sylvilagus. West of the Rocky Mountains, the biometric mean prey is typically under 90 g, i.e. 22.9 to 90 g, i.e. in Washington, California and Idaho, and over 90 g at most points to the east and north of the Rockies in North America. Most prey is the range of 4 g (shrews) to 2300 g (jackrabbits). A single owl requires about 50 to 100 g of food per day and can subsist on a large kill over several days. Despite the great diversity of prey taken by these predators, in most of the Continental United States from the East to the Midwest as well as Canada and Alaska, great horned owls largely live off just a handful of prey species: three species of lagomorph: the eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) and the black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus); two species of New World mice: the white-footed mouse and the North American deermouse (Peromyscus leucopus & maniculatus), approximately three species of vole: the meadow, prairie and <b>woodland</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus pennsylvanicus, ochrogaster & pinetorum) and one introduced pest, the brown rat.|$|R
5000|$|The prairie vole is {{a notable}} animal model for its monogamous sexual fidelity, since the male is usually {{faithful}} to the female, and shares in the raising of pups. The <b>woodland</b> <b>vole</b> is also usually monogamous. Another species from the same genus, the meadow vole, has promiscuously mating males, and scientists have changed adult male meadow voles' behavior to resemble that of prairie voles in experiments in which a single gene was introduced into the brain by a virus.|$|E

40|$|Diseases {{caused by}} parasites are {{responsible}} for immense human and animal suffering, declines in biodiversity, and substantial economic losses across the globe. It is therefore important to understand how parasites spread through and persist within natural populations, so that control interventions that aim to reduce individual infection risk can be designed and implemented appropriately. Crucially, most parasites exist within multi-host communities, and often appear to infect multiple sympatric species, all of which potentially {{play a role in}} parasite persistence. However, certain species may contribute disproportionately to transmission and be nearly completely responsible for the persistence of a parasite within a community. Identifying such “key hosts” therefore offers a means to appropriately target control interventions to maximise success. However, assessing host species contributions to parasite transmission within multi-host communities is a challenging task, and much insight can be gained from studies of model host-parasite systems. In this thesis, the transmission dynamics responsible for the persistence of several endemic Bartonella parasites (bacterial flea-borne haemoparasites) are investigated within wild sympatric populations of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in northwest England. Bartonella infections were first identified to species-level according to an existing method based on length polymorphism of a fragment of the 16 S- 23 S internal transcribed spacer region (ITS). Broad patterns of prevalence suggested that some species were host generalists while others were host-exclusive, indicating that different transmission dynamics underlie the persistence of each Bartonella species within the rodent community. Attempts to identify key transmission hosts for each Bartonella species based on the effect of past host population densities on infection risk proved inconclusive. However, finer-scale characterisation of Bartonella infections, using DNA sequencing, found that Bartonella species that appear to be generalists actually comprise a complex of genetic variants, the majority of which are host-specific, suggesting that transmission between host species is uncommon and limited to a relatively few host-shared variants. Furthermore, detailed characterisation of the flea community infecting wood mice and bank voles found that these Bartonella vectors were host-generalists, and that at least two flea species were able to transfer between individuals of different host species. This suggests that a lack of between-species transmission is likely to arise through different compatibility between host species and Bartonella variants, rather than as a result of current ecological encounter barriers (e. g. through differential Bartonella-flea or flea-rodent specificity). The results of an experimental manipulation of between-species transmission within these wild communities support the notion that between-species transmission of Bartonella parasites is uncommon. Across three <b>woodland</b> sites, bank <b>voles</b> were treated with a veterinary insecticide to remove their fleas and therefore reduce the rate of transmission of Bartonella from treated bank voles {{to the rest of the}} rodent community. Following treatment, risk of bank vole infection with bank vole-exclusive Bartonella variants was reduced, but there was no affect on the risk of bank vole infection with host-shared variants, nor risk of infection in wood mice with either wood mouse-exclusive or host-shared variants. Importantly, these treatment effects were best identified by grouping the parasites on a ‘functional’ (i. e. host-exclusive versus host-shared variants) rather than a taxonomic (i. e. Bartonella species) basis. Together, these findings highlight the importance of characterising parasite infections to as fine a scale as possible, and the value of using a combination of observation, genetic and experimental approaches to understand parasite transmission within complex natural multi-host systems...|$|R
50|$|The <b>woodland</b> <b>vole</b> lives {{throughout}} the eastern United States, ranging {{as far as}} Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. They inhabit deciduous forests, dry fields, and apple orchards. Voles prefer wooded areas with high vertical vegetative stratification but also evergreen shrubs, ground cover, and old fallen logs. Deciduous forests with moist, friable soils are suitable for burrowing and voles are most abundant in these habitats. However, {{they can also be}} found in other habitats from dry fields to the edges of coastal bays. In addition, apple orchards are a favorite habitat. The root systems of trees are an important food source for vole and thus tree spacing affects the density of vole populations.|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} a 1 -year small mammal biodiversity {{survey conducted}} on the Oak Ridge National Environmental Research Park (OR Research Park). The task was implemented through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Natural Resources Management Program and included researchers from the ORNL Environmental Sciences Division, interns in the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education Higher Education Research Experiences Program, and ORNL Environmental Protection Services staff. Eight sites were surveyed reservation wide. The survey was conducted {{in an effort to}} determine species abundance and diversity of small mammal populations throughout the reservation and to continue the historical inventory of small mammal presence for biodiversity records. This data collection effort was in support of the approved Wildlife Management Plan for the Oak Ridge Reservation, a major goal of which is to maintain and enhance wildlife biodiversity on the Reservation. Three of the sites (Poplar Creek, McNew Hollow, and Deer Check Station Field) were previously surveyed during a major natural resources inventory conducted in 1996. Five new sites were included in this study: Bearden Creek, Rainy Knob (Natural Area 21), Gum Hollow, White Oak Creek and Melton Branch. The 2009 - 2010 small mammal surveys were conducted from June 2009 to July 2010 on the Oak Ridge National Environmental Research Park (OR Research Park). The survey had two main goals: (1) to determine species abundance and diversity and (2) to update historical records on the OR Research Park. The park is located on the Department of Energy-owned Oak Ridge Reservation, which encompasses 13, 580 ha. The primary focus of the study was riparian zones. In addition to small mammal sampling, vegetation and coarse woody debris samples were taken at certain sites to determine any correlations between habitat and species presence. During the survey all specimens were captured and released using live trapping techniques including Sherman and pitfall traps. In total 227 small mammals representing nine species were captured {{during the course of the}} study. The most common species found in the study was the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus). The least common species found were the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius), <b>woodland</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus pinetorum), and northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) ...|$|E
40|$|Voles, {{also called}} meadow mice or field mice, {{belong to the}} genus Microtus. Voles are compact rodents with stocky bodies, short legs, and short tails. Their eyes are small and their ears {{partially}} hidden. Their underfur is generally dense and covered with thicker, longer guard hairs. They usually are brown or gray, though many color variations exist. There are 23 vole species in the United States. This chapter provides range maps, descriptions, and habitat characteristics for seven species that are widespread or cause significant economic damage. Tentative identification of a particular animal may be made using this information. For positive identification, use a field guide or contact an expert. Prairie Vole (Microtus ochrogaster). The prairie vole is 5 to 7 inches (13 to 18 cm) in total length (nose to tip of tail). Its fur is gray to dark brown and mixed with gray, yellow, or hazeltipped hairs, giving it a “peppery” appearance. Underparts are gray to yellow-gray. It {{is the most common}} vole in prairie habitats. Meadow Vole (M. pennsylvanicus). The meadow vole is the most widely distributed Microtus species in the United States. Its total length is 5 1 / 2 to 7 1 / 2 inches (14 to 19 cm) and its fur is gray to yellow-brown, obscured by black-tipped hairs. Northern subspecies may also have some red in their fur. Its underparts are gray, at times washed with silver or buff. The tail is bicolored. Long-tailed Vole (M. longicaudus). The long-tailed vole can be distinguished from other Microtus species by its tail, which comprises 30 % or more of its total length of 6 to 8 1 / 2 inches (15 to 21 cm). The long-tailed vole has gray to dark brown fur with many black-tipped hairs. The underparts are gray mixed with some white or yellow. The tail is indistinctly to sharply bicolored. Pine or <b>Woodland</b> <b>Vole</b> (M. pinetorum). The pine vole is a small vole. Its total length is 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm). Its brown fur is soft and dense. The underparts are gray mixed with some yellow to cinnamon. The tail is barely bicolored or unicolored. Montane (or Mountain) Vole (M. montanus). The montane vole is 5 1 / 2 to 8 1 / 2 inches (15 to 20 cm) in total length. Its fur is brown, washed with gray or yellow, and mixed with some black-tipped hairs. Its feet are usually silver-gray and its body underparts are whitish. The tail is bicolored. Oregon Vole (M. oregoni). The Oregon vole is 5 1 / 2 to 6 1 / 2 inches (14 to 16 cm) in length. Its fur is gray to brown or yellow-brown. Underparts are darkish, washed with yellow to white. The tail is indistinctly bicolored. California Vole (M. californicus). The California vole is 6 to 8 1 / 2 inches (15 to 20 cm) in total length. Its fur is tawny olive to cinnamon brown with brown to black overhairs. The underparts are grayish. The tail is bicolored. Exclusion: Recommended to protect trees, ornamental plants, and small areas. Habitat Modification: Eliminating ground cover reduces populations. Soil cultivation destroys burrows and reduces cover. Frightening: Not effective. Repellents: Effectiveness uncertain. Toxicants: Zinc phosphide. Anticoagulants (registered in most states). Fumigants: Not usually effective. Trapping: Mouse snap traps. Live traps (Sherman or box-type traps). Shooting: Not practical or effective...|$|E
