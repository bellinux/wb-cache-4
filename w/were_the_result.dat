5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Hindenburg airship was a notorious example of hydrogen combustion and the cause is still debated.

40|$|Standard {{macroeconomic}} {{models that}} assume an exogenous stochastic process for multifactor productivity offer the interpretation that recessions <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of ”bad news ” (technological regress) and expansions <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of ”good news” (technological advancement). The view taken {{here is that}} both expansions and recessions <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of ”good news ” {{in the sense that}} in both cases, aggregate production possibilities have increased. Recessions {{can be thought of as}} the Standard neoclassical models of economic fluctuations often rely on an exogenous autoregressive process for multifactor productivity. <b>The</b> interpretation <b>is</b> that recessoins <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a temporary decline in productivity while expansions <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a temporary increas...|$|R

40|$|Critically reading {{therapeutic}} trials {{consists in}} determining whether the treatment studied offers a sufficient and relevant benefit to patients in daily medical practice. Thus, critical reading implies that we answer the following questions : <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> reliable? <b>is</b> <b>the</b> trial’s methodology dependable? <b>are</b> <b>the</b> statistical <b>results</b> reliable? what is its epistemological value? <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> reproducible? have they been confirmed by other trials and are they consistent with our basic knowledge on <b>the</b> subject? <b>is</b> <b>the</b> effect size large enough and how precise is its estimation? what <b>is</b> <b>the</b> risk-benefit ratio? <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> relevant to daily clinical practice, and how representative <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> and can they be extrapolated...|$|R
5|$|A tall tale was recounted by S.E. Schlosser, {{it states}} that hairy trout <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of two bottles or four jugs of spilled hair tonic. To catch hairy trout, {{fisherman}} {{would act as}} barbers and lure fish from the waters with the offer of a free trim or shave. An intentionally fantastical story in Maine and claimed hairy trout were under catch and release policy that was enforced by wardens' carrying Brannock Devices. If a fish was caught, the warden would measure it against the fisher's foot. If the fish's length matched the fisher's foot size, the fish could be eaten and the outards made into furry slippers.|$|E
5|$|As Griffith stopped portraying {{some of the}} sheriff's more unsophisticated {{character}} traits and mannerisms, {{it was impossible for}} him to create his own problems and troubles in the manner of other central sitcom characters such as Lucy in I Love Lucy or Archie Bunker in All in the Family, whose problems <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of their temperaments, philosophies and attitudes. Consequently, the characters around Taylor were employed to create the problems and troubles, with rock-solid Taylor stepping in as problem solver, mediator, advisor, disciplinarian and counselor.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the {{efficacy}} of the Chapman–Jouguet model was still in doubt, and it was the subject of studies by John von Neumann at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. Kistiakowsky realized that the deviations from hydrodynamic theory <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of the speed of the chemical reactions themselves. To control the reaction, calculations down to the microsecond level were needed. Section 8 was drawn into the investigation of shaped charges, whose mechanism was explained by Taylor and James Tuck in 1943.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> phobia could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a {{negative}} experience in a person’s life that was associated with knees. The discomfort {{at the sight of}} one's knees could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of <b>the</b> person’s parents or themselves wearing exclusively clothing that covered the knees growing up, therefore making the person unfamiliar with the sight of them. It could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a traumatic injury that left a scar on the individual’s knee or on someone that they know.|$|R
5|$|Geotaphonomy is the {{examination}} of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body. By examining these characteristics, examiners can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially help determine the time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton {{was a result of}} peri or post-mortem activity, as well as if scattered remains <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, two {{trucking}} {{company officials}} {{were sentenced to}} federal prison for violating hours of service regulations. Charles Georgoulakos Jr. and his brother, James Georgoulakos were sentenced to four months in prison, eight months in home confinement, and one year of supervised release. Their company, C Trucking Company of Londonderry, New Hampshire, was placed on two years probation and fined $25,000 (the maximum amount). The sentences <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of an investigation which began {{when one of the}} trucking company's drivers was involved in a collision on Interstate 93 in Londonderry on Aug. 2, 1995, in which four individuals were killed.|$|E
5|$|Los Angeles was {{extensively}} researched for the game. The team {{spent the}} first year of development researching Los Angeles by using newspapers and magazines, organising field research field trips, and capturing photographs. A total of 180,000 photographs were available as resources throughout development, and over 1,000 newspapers were used for research. Both the interior and exterior of multiple sets <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of researched reference material. For example, the Barclay Hotel in Los Angeles was used as a reference point when modelling an apartment building in the game. However, some sets were originally designed, {{in order to meet the}} gameplay or the narrative script.|$|E

5|$|Neither {{of these}} {{children}} were recognised by Belgrano in his will, where {{he said he had}} no children. However, it is thought that he did not mention them in order to protect their mothers, as both children <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of relations that the moral standards of the society of the day would not have accepted. Nevertheless, he requested that his brother, Joaquín Eulogio Estanislao Belgrano, who was appointed as his heir, should look after his newborn daughter.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July 1999, Kouao took Climbié to Cameron's house, {{asking her}} to take Climbié {{permanently}} because Manning did not want her. Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night. Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including a burn {{on her face and}} a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted. Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed {{and he said that he}} hit Climbié because of her incontinence, beginning with slaps, but progressing to using his fist by the end of July. It was highly likely that at least some of the injuries <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of deliberate physical harm.|$|E
5|$|Oxenfree was {{developed}} primarily using the Unity game engine, Adobe Photoshop, and Autodesk Maya. The game's artwork {{was made by}} Heather Gross. The game's camera distance from the player characters and 2D look <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of functional necessity, as the team needed to show multiple characters, dialogue bubbles, and places to explore in the environment on the screen simultaneously. Working with these requirements, Gross created parallaxing, painterly backgrounds. The dark, organic elements of the setting were put {{in opposition to the}} supernatural elements, which are bright and geometric.|$|E

5|$|Sing {{returned}} to Australia on submarine guard duty in late July 1918. An army medical report from 23 November 1918 {{noted that he}} had gunshot wounds in the left shoulder, back, and left leg, and had suffered gas poisoning. The report stated that his general health was 'good' but that he complained of coughing upon exertion. It recognised that Sing's disability <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of service, was permanent, and recommended that he be discharged as permanently unfit for service. Following his departure from the army, he briefly turned his hand to sheep farming, but the land he was given was of poor quality. He then worked as a gold miner.|$|E
5|$|That {{space is}} {{undergoing}} metric expansion {{is shown by}} direct observational evidence of the Cosmological principle and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely isotropic and homogeneous, supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of an explosion from a center distant from us, {{they would not be}} so similar in different directions.|$|E
5|$|The Four Quartets {{was first}} {{published}} as a series in New York in 1943 and London in 1944. The original title {{was supposed to be}} the Kensington Quartets after his time in Kensington. The poems were kept as a separate entity in the United States until they were collected in 1952 as Eliot's Complete Poems and Plays, and in the United Kingdom until 1963 as part of Eliot's Complete Poems 1909–62. The delay in collecting the Four Quartets with the rest of Eliot's poetry separated them from his other work, even though they <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a development from his earlier poems.|$|E
50|$|The Bem Sex-Role Inventory offers four {{different}} possible resulting categorizations: masculine, feminine, androgynous and undifferentiated. Previously, an androgynous score {{was thought to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of equal masculine and feminine traits, while a sex-typed masculine or feminine score <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of more traits belonging in {{one or the other}} category.The fourth type of score, undifferentiated, <b>was</b> seen as <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of extremely low masculine and feminine traits.|$|R

5|$|The bicycle kick {{was invented}} in South America, {{possibly}} {{as early as the}} late 19th century, during a period of development in football history. Innovations like the bicycle kick <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of local adaptations to the football style introduced by British immigrants. Football lore has many legends on the possible origins of the bicycle kick. Newspaper archives {{from the beginning of the}} 20th century evidence a complex, multinational history for the bicycle kick's invention, naming, and diffusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{modifications}} {{are attributed}} to Maunsell’s Chief Draughtsman James Clayton, who had transferred to Ashford railway works in 1914 from Derby works. They <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of cooperation between the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) and the Great Western Railway (GWR) when Maunsell was seconded to the Railway Executive Committee during the First World War. The aim {{was to create a}} series of standard freight and passenger locomotives for use throughout Britain, and meant that Clayton was privy to the latest GWR developments in steam design. These included streamlined steam passages, long-travel valves, the maximisation of power through reduced cylinder sizes and higher boiler pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{names of}} a further 24 {{casualties}} from the First World War {{were added to}} the central panel of the memorial prior to Remembrance Sunday 2014. The additions <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of research {{by a member of the}} local branch of the Royal British Legion (RBL), which produced a list of 50 names, though the remaining casualties' connections to Spalding were deemed too tenuous for their names to be included. As a result of local government reorganisations, the memorial is now the responsibility of South Holland District Council, which is based in Spalding.|$|E
