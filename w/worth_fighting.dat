5|$|Pacifism slowly {{began to}} emerge after the war, but very few war {{memorials}} communicated a pacifist message, largely because in the 1920s, most in the victorious countries felt that the war, while costly in human life, had been <b>worth</b> <b>fighting.</b> Anti-war protests in the inter-war years did use war memorials, however, as locations to communicate their messages; the Communist party in France, for example, held rallies at them. In Britain, political views about the war influenced attitudes towards memorial design and the ceremonies that surrounded them. Those who supported the war were keen to see the ideals of justice and freedom embodied in the designs; those who opposed the conflict sought memorials that would convince people to avoid future slaughter. The opening of {{the tomb of the}} Unknown Soldier was criticised for what anti-war campaigners felt was its pro-war pomp and ceremony, and the burial of the Unknown Soldier in Westminster raised controversy between those who liked the ceremony, and those who thought that the pageantry was designed to distract from the poor living conditions faced by the survivors of the war.|$|E

When Redfield and Alomar reach the main deck, Wesker announces over the ship's intercom that he has betrayed Gionne and infected her with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster, which Redfield and Alomar defeat. Valentine radios in, telling Redfield and Alomar that Wesker must take precise, regular doses of a virus to maintain his strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would poison him. Alomar realizes that Gionne's syringes are doses of the drug. Redfield and Alomar follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus, injecting him with the syringes Gionne dropped. Wesker tries to escape on the bomber; Redfield and Alomar disable it, making him crash-land in a volcano. Furious‚ Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Redfield and Alomar through the volcano. They fight him, and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Redfield and Alomar are rescued by a helicopter, which is piloted by Valentine and Stone. As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, Redfield and Alomar fire rocket-propelled grenades at Wesker, killing him.

40|$|Extract] A casual {{reader of}} the {{behavioural}} ecology literature might think that sexual selection provides boundless evolutionary benefits to females. Females can directly choose a mate, or let males establish their <b>worth</b> by <b>fighting</b> amongst themselves {{for the chance to}} mate. We know that males trade the advantages of being chosen as a mate against the energy loss and risk to their lives of competing with one another and signalling to females. In contrast, our understanding of the process from the female perspective is dominated by attempts to resolve the benefits that females derive from mate choice or from multiple mating. The idea that a single mating can decrease a female's lifespan, and each additional mating or refusal to mate further decreases her survival and fecundity has received attention from only a handful of researchers. The hidden costs to females when males compete to mate can be understood in terms of conflict between the sexes in the way that reproductive success is optimized 5. A competitive male that outsignals or outfights other males will mate with more females and thus sire more offspring, even if his actions lead to a reduction in each mated female's reproductive output. The higher the potential variance in male mating success, the more important sexual selection becomes, and the greater the likelihood that it will lead to the evolution of traits incidentally harmful to females 6. Female mate choice is one, but by no means the only, female adaptation that results from competition between males for mates. How females balance the costs of courtship and harassment by males with those of mating (e. g. sperm toxicity 7 and vulnerability to predators 2) is a crucial aspect of female ecology. Variation in female tendency to remate greatly influences the strength and form of sexual selection in a population...|$|R
