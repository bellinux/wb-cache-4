5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s {{maintenance}} <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly expensive, and the building's design ill-suited {{to modern}} fire appliances. Plans to replace the fire station were put on hold pending the formation of the Greater Manchester Fire Service.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} this period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag, particularly for the auxiliary forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of the units <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of causing an incentive to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness, but even so it <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E

5|$|After Debonnaire's {{death in}} 1833, Hesketh-Fleetwood {{immersed}} himself in his development plans. Southport, a town he owned much of, <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> a popular sea bathing resort, and Hesketh-Fleetwood organised {{the construction of a}} promenade. He <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> concerned over delays {{on the part of the}} Railway and Port Company and decided to get on with building Fleetwood. He hired his old friend Decimus Burton, who had become a successful architect, and together they discussed what buildings would be required. Hesketh-Fleetwood wanted a church, docks, housing, a gas office, a school and a hotel. Burton agreed that a hotel would be important for passengers to spend the night before travelling on to Scotland. Because those passengers would be arriving from Euston railway station in London, Hesketh-Fleetwood decided to call the hotel the North Euston Hotel. Burton's plans were ready by 1835.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of leave in England over winter 1805–6 and {{promotion}} to colonel on 29 October 1805, Brock returned to Canada temporarily {{in command of the}} entire British army there. By 1806 the United States <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly hostile to the British Empire; relations between the two nations continued to deteriorate until war finally broke out in 1812.|$|E
5|$|At the bridge, Frost's forces {{continued}} to hold but without supply or reinforcement their position <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> weaker. The Germans—realising that infantry attacks were unlikely to remove the stubborn defenders—began to systematically destroy the houses the British were in using tanks, artillery and mortars. In {{the absence of any}} Allied air cover, the Luftwaffe were able to make strafing runs on the British occupied houses as well.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{immunology}} <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> more sophisticated, {{with the}} increasing role of molecular biology and biochemistry. Burnet was suspicious of {{the direction in which}} immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the institute's focus to immunology.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} castle <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> less fashionable as a residence. Goodrich was too distant from London to {{be a useful}} power base, and was {{gradually}} abandoned in favour of more stylish residences, Goodrich continued {{to be used as}} a judicial centre however; the antiquarian John Leland noted that some of the castle was used to hold prisoners for the local court during the 1530s, and the castle ditch was sometimes used to store confiscated cattle taken from local farmers.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, the {{telescope}} surface <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> badly corroded. In 2001–2003, {{the telescope}} was resurfaced, increasing its sensitivity at 5GHz {{by a factor}} of five. A holographic profiling technique was used on the surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5cm (compared to 18cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers.|$|E

In this paper, we present and evaluate the novel idea of shadow configurations. Shadow configurations allow configuration evaluation before deployment and thus can reduce potential network disruptions. We demonstrate using real implementation that shadow configurations can be implemented with low overhead...|$|R
5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, the large cent (about {{the size of}} a half dollar) being issued by the Mint <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> both unpopular in {{commerce}} and expensive to coin. After experimenting with various sizes and compositions, the Mint decided on an alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel for a new, smaller cent. After the Mint produced patterns with an 1856 date and gave them to legislators and officials, Congress formally authorized the new piece in February 1857.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, traffic {{congestion}} had reached such a level that the use of the square as a modern wholesale distribution market <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> untenable, and significant redevelopment was planned. Following a public outcry, buildings around the square were protected in 1973, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market moved to a new site in south-west London. The square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980.|$|E

40|$|Interaction design <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> an {{increasingly}} complex and diverse activity. It <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> more complex in that communications and computational technology is being integrated into more devices and environments {{as it becomes}} cheaper and smaller.

Even as the space of design possibilities increases, workplace studies are making us increasingly aware {{of the complexity of}} the sociotechnical systems within which we are working to integrate our new technologies. How are we to manage this complexity? Interaction design <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> more diverse in that a wider range of people <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> involved in it. Withi...|$|R

5|$|Damage to the {{crossing}} {{resulted in the}} closure of the QEW until a temporary bridge was erected. To remedy what <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> a major delay and hazard, the Department of Highways began planning a high-level bridge to cross the shipping channel. To provide better access to the new structure as well as the proposed Chedoke Expressway, construction began on the Freeman Diversion, bypassing the old trumpet interchange and creating a new three-level stack. Work on both proceeded over the next six years.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} considerable {{numbers of}} visitors - over 16,000 in 1955 - it <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly impractical {{to maintain the}} castle, and calls were made for the State {{to take over the}} property. For several decades the owners, Philip and Jewell Magnus-Allcroft, declined these proposals and continued to run the castle privately. In 1986 Jewell finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992.|$|E

The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had legally and practically become a protectorate of the Russian Empire.
