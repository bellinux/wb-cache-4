She plans to move to Spain with him and abandon her training, but Oliver convinces Scott to leave without her. Keen to earn praise from his consultants, Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) and Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley), Oliver claims Penny's research as his own, and is awarded her place in an operation. He is promoted to F2 level, and betrays Penny further by revealing her affair with Scott, which results in her failing her cardiothoracic rotation and being moved to the AAU. A rivalry develops between them, but {{they are forced to}} call a truce when a series of pranks endanger a patient.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E

25|$|Collateral {{information}} or parallel information is information obtained from family, friends or treatment providers of the patient.

25|$|When Robyn {{develops}} {{feelings for}} Lofty and sends him an unsigned Valentines, he panics because the feelings are unreciprocated. Robyn remains unaware of Lofty's unrequited feelings {{and when she}} later catches Lofty sharing a kiss <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient,</b> she becomes upset and annoyed that Lofty did not tell her sooner. Lofty begins working with Dylan Keogh (William Beck) who repeatedly undermines him. As Dylan struggles with OCD, he berates Lofty several times; on one occasion, Dylan labels Lofty incompetent.

An estimated 70 {{million people in}} 20 countries are {{at different levels of}} risk and only 3-4 million people are covered by active surveillance. The DALY index (disability-adjusted life years), an indicator to quantify the burden of disease, includes the impact of both the duration of life lost due to premature death and the duration of life lived with a disability. The annual burden of sleeping sickness is estimated at 2 million DALYs. Since the disease tends to affect economically active adults, the total cost to a family <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is about 25% of a year’s income.|$|E
25|$|One topic {{covered in}} this section {{describes}} the responsibility art therapist have to their patients (ATCB 2005). According to the ATCB, art therapists must strive to advance the wellness of their clients, respect {{the rights of the}} client, and make sure they are providing a useful service (2005). They cannot discriminate against patient whatsoever, and may never desert or neglect patients receiving therapy. Art therapist must fully explain to their patients what their expectations of the patients will be {{at the outset of the}} professional relationship between the two. Art therapists should continue therapy <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> only if the client is benefiting from the therapy. It's against the principles established by the ATCB for art therapist to have patients only for financial reasons.|$|E

Patrick follows her to the park, where she is crying.

25|$|While {{a health}} care {{provider}} visit <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> may result in the patient leaving with a prescription for medication, not all patients will fill the prescription at a pharmacy. In the U.S., 20-30% of prescriptions are never filled at the pharmacy. There are many reasons patients do not fill prescriptions including {{the cost of the}} medication, doubting the need for medication, or preference for self-care measures other than medication. Cost may be a barrier to prescription drug adherence, but convenience, side effects and lack of demonstrated benefit are also significant factors to a complex situation. A US nationwide survey of 1,010 adults in 2001 found that 22% chose not to fill prescriptions because of the price, which is similar to the 20-30% overall rate of unfilled prescriptions. However, analysis by health insurers suggest that patient co-payment requirements can be reduced to $0 with little or no improvement in long-term adherence rates.|$|E

500|$|Chris Harte {{commented that}} the match was also the origin of Old Trafford's [...] "reputation for wet weather", the game being drawn after rain had made the first day unplayable. The match was {{therefore}} reduced to two days play and {{it was reported that}} the wicket dried much quicker than expected and conditions were never difficult for batting. Even so, England were all out for 95 in their first innings, Boyle taking six wickets for 42 runs conceded (i.e., 6/42) with his medium-paced spin and Spofforth 4/42. Shrewsbury, displaying [...] "masterly technique", scored 43 to save his team from real embarrassment. In their first innings, Australia [...] "hit with more vigour and confidence than their opponents" [...] and scored 182, a lead of 87. Their top scorer was Midwinter with 37. The wicket had dried out on the final day and England were able to bat out time and secure the draw, scoring 180 for the loss of 9 wickets (i.e., 180/9). Grace was top scorer <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> 31 and Joey Palmer was the best of the Australian bowlers [...] "with his controlled off- and leg-cutters".|$|E
500|$|Noting the realism in {{the writing}} for the series, Gilchrist stated: [...] "It's as if Rhimes and Co. {{harnessed}} the sublime and the mundane of our daily experiences, that strange sense of drama that emerges from even the most unimportant daily conflicts, and it transported it on {{a world that is}} legitimately fraught with life and death decisions." [...] However, he expressed disappointment in {{the end of the second}} season, which he deemed surprisingly less strong, compared to the [...] "powerful" [...] first half and the [...] "immaculate" [...] first season, describing Stevens' [...] "awkward and self-destructive" [...] relationship <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> as a way to [...] "slow episodes to a screeching halt with maudlin and painfully underdeveloped turns towards melodrama", while expressing the predictability of Duquette's death. Gilchrist stated in response to Stevens' development in the last part of the second season: [...] "Izzie's descent into abject hysteria, which followed her season-long sanctimoniousness about everything, actually made me want something terrible to happen to her too." [...] He described how some episodes were not among the show's strongest, noting that the some plot lines created poignancy, and connected in an unfamiliar way.|$|E
500|$|George O'Malley is {{introduced}} {{as a fellow}} surgical intern to Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers); the five of them working under Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson). O'Malley and Stevens move in with Meredith, for whom he has romantic feelings but did not express them due to his fear of rejection {{and the fact that}} she and one of the attendings Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) had a mutual interest in one another. On the first day of internship, O'Malley is selected by chief of cardiothoracic surgery Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) as the first intern to perform surgery. He freezes in the operating room, and is mocked by his peers, and earns the nickname [...] "007" [...] because of almost killing a patient in such a simple operation (referring to James Bond's [...] "licence to kill"). O'Malley dates nurse Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback), breaking up with her when he contracts syphilis from her, which she in turn contracted from Karev. His friendship with Karev is further strained when the two become trapped in an elevator <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> who begins to bleed out. Karev freezes, and O'Malley is able to save the patient single-handedly. He goes on to admit his feelings to Meredith, and the two have a one-night stand.
