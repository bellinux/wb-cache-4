5|$|Tapp {{is forced}} to move further into the asylum, where he is {{captured}} by Pighead and {{is placed in the}} Shotgun Collar, which is later used in Saw III. Still in the trap, Tapp finds a second victim who is being held by Jigsaw. The victim, Jennings Foster, blames Tapp for being in his trap and thus harbors hatred for him. Tapp finds Jennings in a Pendulum Trap similar to the one used in Saw V. Tapp releases Jennings, who quickly runs away, believing that Tapp <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> killed if he stayed with him. Tapp moves on to find the next victim left behind by Jigsaw. He traverses the asylum and is led to the grave of his former partner Detective Steven Sing. It is there that Tapp discovers that Jigsaw has captured Melissa Sing, Detective Sing's widow. She has become a neglectful parent and is convinced that it is Tapp's fault that her husband was killed. Melissa is found in an Iron Maiden-esque Trap with spinning blades that will mangle her body should the device close on her. Jigsaw informs her that Tapp did not call for backup when searching Jigsaw's lair and that every one of the traps there could have been easily avoided by using standard police procedure, which makes Tapp responsible for his partner's death. Tapp saves Melissa. She says Jigsaw gave her the option to leave Tapp, so she quickly runs away.|$|E
25|$|His {{best friend}} is Mungyeong Seong, who goes to school with him and Fanta. Ryang was held back a year because he missed too much school, for a reason {{that has not been}} {{disclosed}} yet, but he seems to be a decent student. He is fairly athletic as well, as he is an extremely fast runner and good skateboarder. It is said that Ryang has no problem attracting girls, something that <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> into trouble later on. As for Ryang himself, {{there are more and more}} hints that he is attracted to Fanta.|$|E

25|$|Hugo Gressmann {{has found}} 22 similar stories in world {{folklore}} and literature, especially in India {{and the far}} east. One Indian version is a Jataka story dealing with Buddha {{in one of his}} previous incarnations as the sage Mahosadha, who arbitrates between a mother and a Yakshini who is {{in the shape of a}} woman, who kidnapped the mother's baby and claimed he was hers. The sage announced a tug war: He drew a line on the ground and asked the two to stand on opposite sides of the line, one holding his feet and the other his hands – The one who would pull the baby's whole body beyond the line <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>him.</b> The mother, seeing how the baby suffers, released him and let the Yakshini take him, weeping. When the sage saw that, he turned the baby back to the hands of the true mother, exposed the identity of the Yakshini and expelled her. In other Indian versions the two women are widows of one husband. Another version appears in the Chinese drama The Chalk Circle (in this version the judge draws a circle on the ground), which has been widespread all over the world and many versions and reworkings were made after it, among them The Caucasian Chalk Circle, a play by Bertolt Brecht.|$|E
500|$|Miller's {{later life}} {{was plagued by}} ill health. In November 1991, he was hospitalised with a stroke, and soon after fell over and broke his hip, necessitating two further operations. He had skin cancer, caused by his insistence on always {{displaying}} his mop of hair and not wearing a hat. He accepted these vicissitudes equably. [...] "Some grieved to see him reduced, but not him; these were life's deliveries. He knew only that one <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> out eventually." [...] He had an earlobe removed. The cancer also attacked his legs, and coupled with his hip injury, severely curtailed his mobility, forcing him to use walking frames and wheelchairs. Asked at 75 about death, he said: [...] "Never think about it. No regrets. I've had {{a hell of a}} good life. Been damned lucky." ...|$|E
500|$|Another bill Milk {{concentrated}} on {{was designed to}} solve the number one problem {{according to a recent}} citywide poll: dog excrement. Within a month of being sworn in, he began to work on a city ordinance to require dog owners to scoop their pets' feces. Dubbed the [...] "pooper scooper law", its authorization by the Board of Supervisors was covered extensively by television and newspapers in San Francisco. Anne Kronenberg, Milk's campaign manager, called him [...] "a master at figuring out what <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> covered in the newspaper". He invited the press to Duboce Park to explain why it was necessary, and while cameras were rolling, stepped in the offending substance, seemingly by mistake. His staffers, however, knew he had been at the park for an hour before the press conference looking for the right place to walk in front of the cameras. It earned him the most fan mail of his tenure in politics and went out on national news releases.|$|E

50|$|In 1730, at nineteen, Lomonosov went to Moscow on foot, {{because he}} was {{determined}} to study.

500|$|After {{first meeting}} Lennon, Jim warned Paul that he <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> [...] "into trouble", {{although}} he later allowed The Quarrymen to rehearse {{in the dining}} room at Forthlin Road in the evenings. Jim was reluctant to let the teenage Paul go to Hamburg with The Beatles until Paul said the group would earn £15 per week each. As this was more than he earned himself, Jim finally agreed, but only after a visit from the group's then-manager, Allan Williams, who said that Jim should not worry. Jim was later present at a Beatles' concert in Manchester when fans surrounded drummer Pete Best, and ignored the rest of The Beatles. Jim criticised Best by saying, [...] "Why did you have to attract all the attention? Why didn't you call the other lads back? I think that was very selfish of you". Bill Harry recalled that Jim was probably [...] "The Beatles' biggest fan", and was extremely proud of Paul's success. Shelagh Johnson—later to become director of The Beatles' Museum in Liverpool—said that Jim's outward show of pride embarrassed his son. Jim enlisted Michael's help when sorting through the ever-increasing sacks of fan letters that were delivered to Forthlin Road, with both composing [...] "personal" [...] responses that were supposedly from Paul. Michael would later have success on his own with the group The Scaffold.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} casting was announced, Barber told a {{reporter}} for the Herald Sun that he loved his character and said his determination and focus <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> into trouble. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said Rhys's arrival would cause a stir in Erinsborough and may not go down well with some of the local residents. Barber also called Rhys ambitious and said that while he is not a villain, he is not an entirely good guy either. The actor explained [...] "He rides that line and that's {{a lot of fun to}} play. There are a lot of different dynamics. He can be very persuasive, bordering on manipulative, but he has a sensitive side as well, which is coming out gradually." [...] Barber told a writer for Inside Soap that Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life, and can easily switch from one to the other. Barber quipped that Rhys knows how to have a good time, while the official Neighbours website said he considers himself [...] "a bit of a ladies' man". A Herald Sun reporter said Rhys would [...] "rile" [...] his colleague, Karl Kennedy. Alan Fletcher, who plays Karl, revealed that his character and Rhys would share many scenes. Fletcher explained that it can be [...] "somewhat galling" [...] for Karl to be faced with Rhys, who is an enthusiastic young doctor. The actor added [...] "So expect some fun confrontation but also cleverly the writers have explored what Rhys and Karl might have in common." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kurkjian's caller said Donati visited Ferrara at {{the federal}} lockup in Hartford, Connecticut, where he was being held, after his January 1990 arrest on {{racketeering}} charges. The two spoke quietly, using short and vague language, aware their conversations were likely being monitored. Donati told Ferrara he <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> out; Ferrara pleaded with him not to try anything. [...] "No matter what you do, it's {{not going to get}} me out of here", he said. [...] "They will for these; you'll see", Donati responded.|$|E

25|$|Fry's party {{trick was}} to leap from a {{stationary}} {{position on the}} floor backwards onto a mantelpiece; he would face the mantelpiece, crouch down, take a leap upwards, turn in the air, and bow to the gallery with his feet planted on the shelf.

2500|$|Esposito and Martinez {{had come}} into {{conflict}} before arriving in Tikrit in April 2004, as Esposito tried to bring the sergeant in line. Martinez was later described in court [...] "as a poorly disciplined and foul-mouthed guardsman who needed a special waiver to qualify for duty." [...] Witnesses testified that Martinez [...] "could not account {{for hundreds of thousands}} of dollars in missing equipment." [...] Esposito eventually restricted Martinez from going into the supply area without an escort. Martinez feared Esposito <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> kicked out of the Guard, costing him $2,859 in monthly pay.|$|E
2500|$|The 1990s was {{the golden}} era for Karnataka cricket. Due to the {{presence}} of Javagal Srinath, Venkatesh Prasad, Anil Kumble and Sunil Joshi, Ganesh had limited opportunities to show his talent. Despite making his debut in the 1994-95 season, Ganesh could not get a permanent slot in the Karnataka team. Coming from a humble background, he was helped by kind team-mates and well-wishers. Jayaprakash waived the tuition fees and gave him a bat, Srinath <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> a pair of shoes from abroad, Kumble would give him clothes and, while at the MRF Pace Academy, Prasad would translate in Kannada for him.|$|E

50|$|Because {{none of the}} {{messengers}} {{could have}} a motive to kill Jerin, and because he has assumed that Sally is correct that her father didn't, Wolfe conjectures that Jerin was poisoned not because the murderer had it in for Jerin, but to get at Blount, whose apparent motive <b>would</b> surely <b>get</b> <b>him</b> arrested. Wolfe's hypothesis, then, is that Jerin was a pawn, sacrificed in a gambit {{to get rid of}} Blount.|$|R
