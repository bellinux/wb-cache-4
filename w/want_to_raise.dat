500|$|Characteristic to Joss Whedon's {{character}}s, Connor {{goes through}} drastic changes with the series progression. Introduced as an 'impossible birth' {{at the start}} of season three, as an infant the character still had little chance of his own development. So he became an agent for evolution of others; Darla through him, redeems herself of her villainous acts spanning two television series, and Wesley transform from a goofy sidekick to a brooding anti-hero. Once these developments came to fruition, the creators chose to upgrade Connor to a teen. Taking advantage of the fantasy genre, they were able to accelerate his growth within a few weeks of the show's normal timeline, thus not affecting the ages {{of the rest of the}} characters and setting up stage for the next act. The middle of season three sees the infant kidnapped by Angel's long-term adversary Holtz, who takes Connor to a hell dimension where [...] "time moves differently," [...] explains David Greenwalt. [...] "We didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> a baby for 18 years." ...|$|E

That's when I {{began to develop}} what you now see full-fledged in the 'wedge' strategy: 'Stick with the most important thing' â€”the mechanism and the building up of information. Get the Bible and the Book of Genesis out of the debate because you do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the so-called Bible-science dichotomy. Phrase the argument {{in such a way}} that you can get it heard in the secular academy and in a way that tends to unify the religious dissenters. That means concentrating on, 'Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?' and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Story {{details were}} more {{plentiful}} {{than in the}} Souls games, though the team created a larger mystery {{at the heart of}} the story to compensate for this. The team did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the difficulty level higher than their previous games as they felt it would make the game [...] "pretty much unplayable for anyone". To balance this out, the team created a more aggressive combat system focusing on both action and strategy. They also wanted to alter the penalties for death used in the Souls games as they did not want the game to be classified as being for hardcore gamers. One of the more difficult decisions the team faced was the introduction of guns as weapons. Because it would fit well into the game's setting, and that it would consequently be less accurate than modern models, guns were eventually included.|$|E

2500|$|Romney's {{energy plan}} that was {{unveiled}} in August 2012 would maintain subsidies for oil companies, which Romney's rival for the presidency, Obama, would eliminate. During the 2008 presidential campaign, in November 2007 {{when all of}} the Democratic presidential candidates were calling for eliminating billions of dollars of tax breaks for oil companies, Romney told the New York Times, [...] "Now is not the right time to raise taxes on our oil companies." [...] Throughout most of the 2012 presidential campaign, Romney himself made almost no public statements directly commenting on tax breaks for oil and gas companies; and the Romney campaign declined to respond to repeated requests from the Tampa Bay Times Politifact and The Washington Post's Fact Checker to clarify his position. However, he did tell a town hall gathering in April 2012 that, in contrast to Obama, he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> taxes on oil companies. Romney's chief energy advisor also testified before Congress twice during the campaign on behalf of {{the oil and gas industry}} that Congress should maintain tax benefits for oil and gas producers. During the first presidential debate between Romney and Obama, in October 2012, Romney hinted for the first time that as president he might consider eliminating $2.8 billion in tax breaks for oil and gas producers if Congress would agree to cut the tax rate for all corporations by 30%.|$|E
2500|$|The {{three main}} issues were RCA {{position}} on homosexuality, {{the adoption of}} the Belhar confession and complementarianism. Beyond the three reasons University Reformed Church mentioned: [...] "We have a deep desire to belong to a family of churches where who we are as a congregation fits squarely with what our denomination does and believes." [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> up pastors who do not fear that the ordination process is against them"."We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "We {{want to be in a}} denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, notsome extreme right flank". [...] "The denomination(RCA) has moved away from churches like ours." [...] "We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "In practice, the RCA is already well down this path [...] and that given the way our classical structure works those who stand for biblical orthodoxy can do little to stop it. We believe laboring in such a mixed denomination undermines the true nature of biblical unity, hinders our witness for Christ, and does not represent the most effective avenue for ministry for URC in the years and decades ahead." [...] "URC would be able to serve with greater integrity and disciple our people (especially ministerial candidates) more effectively if we were in a denomination that shares our complementarian convictions, rather than in one that is moving full speed ahead in the other direction." [...] "We(URC) are troubled by the weak form of confessional subscription in the RCA, the process for examining ministerial candidates, and our formal ecumenical ties with liberal denominations like the UCC, ELCA and PCUSA". [...] "We have often heard from visitors that though they lived in Lansing for years they never thought to visit URC because it was an RCA church or because of things they had heard about liberal leanings in the RCA. How many others might be staying away because our denominational affiliation gives them the wrong idea about who we are and what we believe?"We do not recommend our RCA seminaries. [...] "We want to be in a denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, not some extreme right flank". [...] "The RCA connection inhibits interest in planting churches, the vision for training up pastors, and placement for new pastors." [...] "we also feel a measure of distance between us and most churches in the denomination".|$|E
