40|$|Network {{intrusion}} detection {{has emerged as}} one of the ways to enforce computer security in recent years. It is the problem of detecting intrusive activities by using network data as the source. The commonest way is to hand-code the attack signatures into rules for detection. This approach is slow and expensive. Consequently, other techniques have been proposed to tackle the problem. Many of these techniques have to use both normal and intrusion data to build their classifiers. In practice, however, intrusion data are usually limited in quantity for model training. Therefore, we propose to solve the network {{intrusion detection}} problem by using a novelty detection approach. In particular, the probabilistic neural network (PNN) model based on the use of Parzen windows for nonparametric density estimation is used. Our method can build an intrusion detection system using only normal network traffic records. We have tested our system on the dataset used in the KDD Cup 1999 contest. Results show that our system performs favorably when compared to the <b>winning</b> <b>system</b> of the contest. The <b>winning</b> <b>system,</b> which is based on an ensemble of decision trees with bagged boosting, uses many intrusion records and much more normal data records for classifier training. This shows that our model is promising for solving the network intrusion problem. Besides, a speedup scheme for our model is presented. Moreover, we propose a service-based PNN model which is based on the detection of individual network service traffic. Experimental results for this model are also presented...|$|E

40|$|Planning as Satisfiability {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{well-known}} and effective technique for classical planning: SATPLAN has been the <b>winning</b> <b>system</b> in the deterministic track for optimal planners in the 4 th International Planning Competition (IPC) and a co-winner in the 5 th IPC. In this paper we extend the Planning as Satisfiability approach in order to handle preferences and SATPLAN in order to solve problems with simple preferences. The resulting system, SATPLAN(P) is competitive with SGPLAN, the <b>winning</b> <b>system</b> in the category “simple preferences ” at the last IPC. Further, we show that SATPLAN(P) performances are (almost) always comparable to those of SATPLAN when solving the same problems without preferences: in other words, introducing simple preferences in SATPLAN does not affect its performances. This latter result is due both to the particular mechanism we use in order to incorporate preferences in SAT-PLAN and to the relative low number of soft goals (each corresponding to a simple preference) usually present in planning problems. Indeed, if we consider the issue of determining minimal plans (corresponding to problems with thousands of preferences) the performances of SATPLAN(P) are comparable to those of SATPLAN in many cases, but can be significantly worse when the number of preferences is very high compared to the total number of variables in the problem. Our analysis is conducted considering both qualitative and quantitative preferences, different reductions from quantitative to qualitative ones, and most of the propositional planning domains from the IPCs and that SATPLAN can handle...|$|E
