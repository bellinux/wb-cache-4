5|$|A special {{group was}} {{established}} under Teller in March 1944 {{to investigate the}} mathematics of an implosion-type nuclear weapon. It too ran into difficulties. Because of {{his interest in the}} Super, Teller did not <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> on the implosion calculations as Bethe wanted. These too were originally low-priority tasks, but the discovery of spontaneous fission in plutonium by Emilio Segrè's group gave the Super increased importance. In June 1944, at Bethe's request, Oppenheimer moved Teller out of T Division, and placed him in charge of a special group responsible for the Super, reporting directly to Oppenheimer. He was replaced by Rudolf Peierls from the British Mission, who in turn brought in Klaus Fuchs, who was later revealed to be a Soviet spy. Teller's Super group became part of Fermi's F Division when he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory in September 1944. It included Stanislaw Ulam, Jane Roberg, Geoffrey Chew, Harold and Mary Argo, and Maria Goeppert-Mayer.|$|E
25|$|Calderon left Villanueva to {{play for}} Vitoria-Gasteiz. He {{received}} a proposal to play professional basketball after he won a junior team championship. After a discussion with his parents, Calderón decided {{to carry on the}} professional basketball tradition. Calderón was greatly focused on training for and playing basketball during this time in his life. He was surrounded by motivated teammates who put in strong effort, and pushed Calderón to <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> as them.|$|E
25|$|The team {{suffered}} a serious blow when center fielder Adam Eaton, {{acquired in the}} off-season in a trade with the Chicago White Sox, stepped awkwardly on first base beating out an infield single {{in the ninth inning}} at Nationals Park against the Mets on April 28. Eaton had to be carried off the field, and an MRI showed he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament and knee meniscus and sprained his ankle. The injuries were expected to rule him out for the season, although Eaton said he would <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> as he could to return in time for the playoffs. The Nationals called up outfielder Rafael Bautista to replace Eaton on the active roster.|$|E

25|$|Many birds migrate in flocks. For larger birds, it {{is assumed}} that flying in flocks reduces energy costs. The V {{formation}} is often supposed to boost the efficiency and range of flying birds, particularly over long migratory routes. All the birds except the first fly in the upwash from one of the wingtip vortices of the bird ahead. The upwash assists each bird in supporting its own weight in flight, in the same way a glider can climb or maintain height indefinitely in rising air. Geese flying in a V formation save energy by flying in the updraft of the wingtip vortex generated by the previous animal in the formation. Thus, the birds flying behind do not need to <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> to achieve lift. Studies show that birds in a V formation place themselves roughly at the optimum distance predicted by simple aerodynamic theory. Geese in a V-formation may conserve 12–20% of the energy they would need to fly alone. Red knots and dunlins were found in radar studies to fly 5km per hour faster in flocks than when they were flying alone. The birds flying at the tips and at the front are rotated in a timely cyclical fashion to spread flight fatigue equally among the flock members. The formation also makes communication easier and allows the birds to maintain visual contact with each other.|$|E

[...] It goes from screaming heavy metal to techno dance, to Country and Western; there's even a flamenco hootenanny where everyone comes down front, beats on logs and plays acoustic guitars and pennywhistles. Then {{it goes back to}} 'Holiday' which is an old dance number. It keeps you steppin'. Madonna sings everything live. She's been that way from the beginning of her career, even with all the athletic dancing. She's a hard worker and she expects everybody else to <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> or harder.

500|$|Rankine plays as a striker and {{has been}} {{described}} as a target man, not being a prolific goalscorer, and he has said [...] "I just like to chip away and <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> as I can and, hopefully, then you get rewarded with goals". He has the [...] "ability to hold the ball up, and cause the defenders problems" [...] and is in possession of the long throw-in ability. After Rankine signed for Bournemouth, manager Jimmy Quinn said [...] "He's big, he's strong and I'm pleased to get him in". York manager Martin Foyle said Rankine [...] "will also work hard, close down and give us a presence in the final third. He's a good size, mobile and will certainly run the channels." ...|$|E

500|$|After Robinson's hire as manager, Doby {{returned}} {{to work for the}} Expos. In 1976, Bill Veeck purchased the White Sox for a second time and hired Doby to be the team's batting coach. As a team, the White Sox finished the 1976 season with a [...]255 batting average, 586 runs scored and 73 home runs. By June 29, 1977, the team's average was [...]284, and had recorded 382 runs scored and 87 home runs. They finished the season second in team batting average (to the Yankees and Red Sox, each with a [...]281 average) and had 192 home runs and 844 runs scored as a team. After firing the White Sox's manager and former Doby teammate Bob Lemon, Veeck replaced him with Doby on June 30, 1978. At age 53, Doby became the second black manager in the majors after Robinson. [...] "It's so nice to work for a man like Bill Veeck. You just <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> as you can, and if the opportunity arises, you will certainly get the opportunity to fulfill your dreams", Doby said after being named White Sox manager.|$|E
2500|$|After the defeat, Keane blamed United's loss of form {{on some of}} his teammates' {{fixation}} with wealth, claiming that they had [...] "forgot about the game, lost the hunger that got you the Rolex, the cars, the mansion". Earlier in the season, Keane had publicly advocated {{the breakup of the}} treble-winning team as he believed the team-mates who had played in United's victorious 1999 Champions League final no longer had the motivation to <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Governor's {{main problem}} {{was with his}} own {{military}} officers, who wanted large grants of land, which Phillip had not been authorised to grant. Scurvy broke out, and in October 1788 Phillip had to send Sirius to Cape Town for supplies, and strict rationing was introduced, with thefts of food punished by hanging. Arthur Phillip quoted [...] "The living conditions need to improve or my men won't <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard,</b> so I {{have come to a}} conclusion that I must hire surgeons to fix the convicts." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Bush {{administration}} reportedly {{went out}} of its way to make the transition as seamless as possible for the incoming administration, earning accolades from Obama staff members and outside experts alike. According to nearly all accounts, the Bush administration streamlined the process for new officials to obtain security clearances and planned training exercises for the incoming national security team, to ensure that they would be ready to face a possible crisis on the first day in office. Part of this enhanced cooperation is required by laws passed at the behest of the 9/11 Commission, while part is attributed to the difficulty that the Bush administration had with its own transition, which lasted only five weeks and was felt to have had a deleterious effect on Bush's ability to govern. [...] "I'm not sure I've ever seen an outgoing administration <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> at saying the right thing", said Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution. [...] "This is really quite memorable." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{spending}} {{the majority of}} the season behind Rosberg, Hamilton had won the four preceding rounds of the season, converting a 29-point deficit into a 17-point lead over his teammate heading into the Austin race. With three races left in the season, Hamilton said he would prioritise not allowing any negative thoughts concerning double-points in the season-closing event in Abu Dhabi bother him and would take any opportunities he was presented with: [...] "We've just got to do our due diligence and <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> as we can to make sure we don't have any problems." [...] Hamilton hoped to achieve his fifth consecutive victory of the year: [...] "A lot of the American side of my family come to the race, plus I won the first F1 GP at the circuit back in 2012 - it's a special one for me. I really enjoy going there and I'm looking forward to another great race." [...] Rosberg was aiming to improve on his best finish in Austin (ninth in 2013) and to further reduce Hamilton's advantage in the Driver's Championship. He said Mercedes were targeting [...] "a big finish" [...] to their season, while also declaring he would not concede defeat until the final round of the season, and hoped to maintain the level of entertainment for the sport's fan base: [...] "The first step comes in Austin, which is a really cool city and a great race track. I haven't had the best races there so far, but I'm determined to change that this year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opt-out consent, {{otherwise}} known as [...] "deemed" [...] consent, support refers {{to the notion that}} the majority of people support organ donation, but {{only a small percentage of}} the population are actually registered, because they fail to go through the actual step of registration, even if they want to donate their organs at the time of death. This could be resolved with an opt-out system, where many more people would be registered as donors when only those who object consent to donation have to register to be on the non-donation list. For this reasons, countries, such as Wales, have adopted a [...] "soft opt-out" [...] consent, meaning if a citizen has not clearly made a decision to register, then they will be treated as a registered citizen and participate in the organ donation process. Likewise, opt-in consent refers to the consent process of only those who are registered to participate in organ donation. Currently, the United States has an opt-in system, but studies show that countries with an opt-out system save more lives due to more availability of donated organs. The current opt-in consent policy assumes that individuals are not willing to become organ donors at the time of their death, unless they have documented otherwise through organ donation registration. Registering to become an organ donor heavily depends on the attitude of the individual; those with a positive outlook might feel a sense of altruism towards organ donation, while others may have a more negative perspective, such as not trusting doctors to <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> to save the lives of registered organ donors. Some common concerns regarding a presumed consent ("opt-out") system are sociologic fears of a new system, moral objection, sentimentality, and worries of the management of the objection registry for those who do decide to opt-out of donation. Additional concerns exist with views of compromising the freedom of choice to donate [...] and conflicts with religious beliefs which exist. Even though concerns exist, the United States still has a 95 percent organ donation approval rate. This level of nationwide acceptance may foster an environment where moving to a policy of presumed consent may help solve some of the organ shortage problem, where individuals are assumed to be willing organ donors unless they document a desire to [...] "opt-out", which must be respected.|$|E
