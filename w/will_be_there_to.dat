The most high profile of aspect {{of its work}} has been its investigative work, however as important {{if not more so}} has been its work in prevention and education.

25|$|Eight weeks later, Alison {{experiences}} {{morning sickness}} {{during an interview}} with James Franco and realizes she could be pregnant. She contacts Ben {{for the first time}} since their one-night stand to tell him. Although insensitive at first, Ben says he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> support Alison. While he is still unsure about being a parent, his father (Harold Ramis) is excited. Alison's mother (Joanna Kerns) tries to persuade her daughter to have an abortion, but Alison decides to keep the child. Later, Alison and Ben decide to give their relationship a chance. The couple's efforts include Ben making an awkward marriage proposal with an empty ring box, promising to get her one someday. Alison thinks it's too early to think about marriage, because she is more concerned with hiding the pregnancy from her bosses, believing that they will fire her if they ever found out. After a somewhat promising beginning, tensions surface in the relationship.|$|E

After freeing Good King James, Kuros {{encounters}} Malkil, who offers his partnership to Kuros, saying that they would only destroy each other and that they could rule the world if they joined together. Players are then given the option of choosing [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no". If the player chooses [...] "yes", Malkil then shoots Kuros in the back with magic and instantly defeats him while saying: [...] "Ha! Ha! Ha! The Fool!!" [...] Malkil then holds Kuros prisoner, and the game ends. If the player chooses [...] "no", then the final battle commences; after Kuros defeats Malkil, Kuros is then sucked into a time portal, sending him into the future. The game then concludes, saying that Kuros has restored the city of Piedup to its former self, that the damsels have been saved, and that Good King James has taken back his throne; Kuros' legend is then immortalized among the people, as his saga [...] "unfurls like a glorious banner". The game concludes by saying that, while Malkil will return, Kuros <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> defeat him repeatedly, and according to the game, [...] "the light shall reign until the end of time". The game's ending sets the stage for a sequel, but no sequel for the game was ever released.|$|E

2500|$|Carol died on September 27, and was {{succeeded by}} his nephew Ferdinand I. Between March 1915 and August 1916, with private German funding, Carp {{put out the}} {{political}} newspaper Moldova, which popularized his take on the war, and, as historian Ion Bulei writes, [...] "was entirely against the nation's current." [...] In his first editorial, Idealul național ("The National Ideal"), he implied that Romania's very survival was uncertain as long as Russia still bordered the Danube Delta; he therefore urged Romanians to focus on taking back the province of Bessarabia, held by Russia since 1812. Carp again advised against war on the Central Powers for the taking of Transylvania: [...] "If we take Transylvania and lose the Mouths of the Danube, we are lost and so is Transylvania. If, on the other hand, we extend our borders to the Dniester, the Transylvania issue <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> solve for future generations, with ease and without going into conflict with the Austro-Hungarian Empire." [...] He explained his rationale in more detail within the 1915 brochure România și Războiul European ("Romania and the European War"), issued with Poporul S. A., where he noted that a unified Greater Romania was the stuff of utopia, and stressed that Transylvania's Romanians could benefit from Austrian loyalism.|$|E

40|$|The street {{campaign}}s {{of the mid}} 1990 s and the citywide campaign {{that grew out of}} them were driven by the reality of the drugs situation in local communities. Things had got so bad and so little was being done that people took to the streets and campaigned to try and improve the situation. The anger of local communities and the campaigns that grew out of that anger {{played a major role in}} finally making the drugs crisis a political priority in 1996. We saw the setting up of the Task Forces, based on the community-led partnership model developed by the Interagency Project in the North Inner City. For the next few years, it seemed that the political <b>will</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> tackle the drugs crisis and many projects and programmes came into being, offering hope for a better future for our drug users and their communities. But where are we now? Despite the fact that many of these projects and programmes have helped to give us glimpses of a better future, the drugs issue is no longer seen as a political priority. Experience shows us that it <b>is</b> only when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> political <b>will</b> <b>to</b> tackle the problem that real progress can be made.
