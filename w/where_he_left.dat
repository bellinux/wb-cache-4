5|$|Around this time, {{perhaps because}} of the great and {{definitive}} works from Cairano, the Sanmicheli left Brescia, never to return. In Casale Monferrato, Bartolomeo died two years later. Matteo, who started alongside his father, continued and ended his career in Piedmont, near Turin, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> many of his better known works.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the United States Naval Reserve, Cecil Harris's {{commission}} ended with the War. Upon returning home he picked up <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> off previously, completing his undergraduate degree at Northern State Teachers College. He began teaching at Cresbard High School where he functioned variously as principal, coach and teacher. He was also engaged to Eva at this time.|$|E
5|$|After resigning {{from the}} AHC, Darwaza {{spent the rest}} of his life in the modern state of Syria <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> {{politics}} to concentrate on literature. Although he did much of his writing in the 1930s and 1940s, he did not have any of his works published until the 1960s. As a pan-Arab intellectual, Darwaza aided in establishing the union between Syria and Egypt forming the short-lived United Arab Republic. After Egypt adopted its 1956 constitution declaring that it was an Arab country and its people a part of the Arab nation, Darwaza concluded that Egypt and Syria were in a position to unite. When unity negotiations underwent, he suggested several forms of federation, such as the American, Soviet, and Indian models, but did not recommend any specific model for an Arab state. Darwaza did, however, suggest that the institution of a federation between Egypt and Syria would be the first step towards the realization of a comprehensive union.|$|E

5|$|At Moe's Tavern, Moe informs Homer and {{his friends}} {{that one of them}} must be a {{designated}} driver, and Barney loses the choosing draw. After Barney drives the drunken men home in Homer's car, Homer allows him to use it to drive himself home, expecting Barney to return it the following morning. In his distressed state, Barney disappears with the car. Two months later, Barney returns to Moe's Tavern, unable to recall <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the car. Homer later receives a letter from the New York City government, which informs him that his car has been found parked in the World Trade Center plaza. Homer reveals to the family that he had once been to New York before when he was 17 years old and had a horrible experience. Marge and the children persuade Homer to go retrieve the car and he reluctantly agrees.|$|E
5|$|Drogba came on as a {{substitute}} for Anelka against Manchester United in the Community Shield, but could not help prevent Chelsea from succumbing to a 3–1 loss. However, he started the Premier League season in fine form, continuing from <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> off {{on the last day of}} the previous campaign as he scored a hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion in a 6–0 victory. In Chelsea's next game against Wigan Athletic at the DW Stadium, Drogba made three assists in another 6–0 win. Drogba also played the next game at home against Stoke City where he played the whole 90 minutes and scored his fourth Premier League goal of the season when he kicked home a penalty after Nicolas Anelka was brought down by Thomas Sørensen inside the box. On 7 November 2010, Drogba missed the first half of Chelsea's 2–0 defeat by Liverpool. It was later revealed that he had been suffering from malaria for at least a month. He had first complained of feeling unwell before the October 2010 international break but the illness was only diagnosed on 8 November 2010. Having diagnosed the problem, Chelsea insisted that he would make a full recovery within days.|$|E
5|$|During spring {{training}} in 2005, Nathan signed a two-year deal {{that includes a}} club option for 2008. He picked up from <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> off in 2004, allowing no earned runs in 15 appearances from April 5 to May 10. He also had streaks of 13 and 12 consecutive save opportunities converted between April and July. As a result, Nathan was named the American League Player of the Week for the week of June 27. Nathan earned another All-Star appearance in 2005 for his pitching {{in the first half}} of the season. Although his record was 1–3 with a 3.57 ERA in 37 appearances, he had struck out 43 batters in 35 innings pitched, and lead the AL with 23 saves in 25 opportunities. Nathan pitched in the 2005 MLB All-Star Game alongside fellow pitcher Johan Santana. Pitching the eighth inning of the game, he got Morgan Ensberg to pop out for the first out, then gave out a double to Moisés Alou. Felipe López singled, and Nathan was able to get Miguel Cabrera and Luis Castillo out, but not before Alou scored. Nathan had a brilliant second half as he went 6–1 with 18 saves in 20 chances, and posted an ERA of 1.76. He finished the season with a 7–4 record, a 2.70 ERA, 43 saves in 48 opportunities, and 94 strikeouts. Nathan also became the third pitcher in club history to post consecutive 40 save seasons. The Twins however missed the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to these Byzantine successes, Caliph al-Mahdi now resolved to take the field in person. On 12 March 780, Mahdi departed Baghdad and via Aleppo marched to Hadath, which he refortified. He then advanced to Arabissus, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the army and returned to Baghdad. His son and heir Harun—better known by his laqab, or regnal name, al-Rashid—was left in charge of {{one half of the}} army, which raided the Armeniac Theme and took the small fort of Semaluos. Thumama, who had been entrusted with the other half, penetrated deeper into Asia Minor. He marched west as far as the Thracesian Theme, but was heavily defeated there by Lachanodrakon. In June 781, as the Arab invasion force assembled at Hadath under Abd al-Kabir, a great-great-nephew of the Caliph Umar (r. 634–644), and again prepared to launch their annual raid, Empress Irene called up the thematic armies of Asia Minor and placed them under the eunuch sakellarios John. The Muslims crossed into Byzantine Cappadocia over the Pass of Hadath, and were met near Caesarea by the combined Byzantine forces under Lachanodrakon. The ensuing battle resulted in a costly Arab defeat, forcing Abd al-Kabir to abandon his campaign and retreat to Syria.|$|E
5|$|Margarito, {{traditionally}} {{a sluggish}} starter, anticipated to emerge swift, {{but it was}} Cotto who {{got off to a}} more effective start by throwing numerous punches and applying plenty of movement. Cotto picked up <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> off in the second round, approaching directly at Margarito though easily getting by harm's way once Margarito sought to counterpunch. That, nevertheless, changed approximately a minute into the round, as Margarito landed a right hand that momentarily had Cotto by the ropes. Margarito directed his assault to Cotto's body, but Cotto landed various left hooks. Blood started descending from Cotto's nose, but did not discourage him from closing the round by landing a punch upon Margarito. Mobility represented the key for Cotto in the third round, efficaciously blending boxing and brawling while trying to minimize the blood flow from his nose and a small cut over his left eye. Margarito continued targeting the body, but drew two distinguish warnings for low blows in the span of less than a minute. Margarito closed the gap sufficiency in the fourth round by landing a right uppercut and attacking Cotto's body to slow him down. In the fifth round, Cotto provided plenty of lateral movement which frustrated Margarito. Cotto persisted on the move and would land a flurry of punches prior to directly escaping harm's way. Margarito landed a straight right hand that had Cotto temporarily unsteady with ten seconds to go, but Cotto eluded all of the ensuing punches until the final bell.|$|E

He probably travelled to Noricum to restore the imperial authority in that province, and then passed through Ravenna, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> a Gothic force under the new patricius and magister militum Remistus, a Visigoth. On 21 September, finally, he entered Rome.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Taylor saw {{the first}} major action of the campaign. Leaving Fort Gardiner on the upper Kissimmee with 1,000 men on December 19, Taylor headed towards Lake Okeechobee.

On the third day Taylor stopped to build Fort Basinger, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> his sick and enough men to guard the Seminoles that had surrendered. Three days later, on Christmas Day, 1837, Taylor's column caught up with {{the main body of the}} Seminoles on the north shore of Lake Okeechobee.|$|E
25|$|Greenberg {{had missed}} four seasons to {{military}} service, but rejoined the Tigers after his discharge on July 1, 1945. At age 34, Greenberg picked up <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> off, hitting {{a home run}} in his first game. Without the benefit of spring training, {{he returned to the}} Tigers, was again voted to the All-Star Team, and hit a dramatic pennant-clinching grand slam home run in the 9th inning {{on the last day of}} the regular season. He also set a major league record with 11 multi-homer games in 1945.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, América de Cali {{once again}} reached {{the final of}} the Copa Libertadores, again with River Plate. America won the first game in Cali 1–0 with a goal by Antony de Ávila from a very closed angle. This was América's chance for revenge after the loss in the 1986 final against the same rival, but in the end América lost on an Óscar Córdoba error. The first goal was scored by Hernán Crespo and in a play by Córdoba, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the box and did not clear the ball correctly. Crespo also scored the second goal.|$|E
25|$|His first {{assignment}} was a five Test series against India, and Simpson began <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> off a decade earlier. He top-scored with 89 {{in the second}} innings of the First Test in Brisbane, before scoring 176 and 39 as Australia won in Perth. Simpson failed to pass double figures in the Third Test in Melbourne, and made 30s in both innings in Sydney, as the Indians won two consecutive Tests to level the series. Simpson responded with 100 and 51 in the deciding Fifth Test in Adelaide as Australia scraped to a 3–2 series victory. Simpson totalled 539 runs at 53.90 and took four wickets.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 Persson {{was chosen}} over Mona Sahlin, the Deputy Prime Minister, {{to lead the}} country after Carlsson retired. Persson began <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> off as finance {{minister}} - by continuing to spearhead government efforts to alleviate Sweden's chronic budget deficit. In 1994, the annual shortfall was about 13% of GDP. But, after implementing welfare cuts and tax increases, it fell to a projected 2.6% of GDP in 1997, which put Sweden in a position to qualify for the European economic and monetary union. However, the cost was high: unemployment rose, hovering persistently around 13%, then suddenly fell to about 6.5% the same year.|$|E
