5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} get an {{estimate}} of the critical speed, we use the fact that the condition for which this kinematic solution is valid corresponds to the case where there is no net energy exchange with the surroundings, so by considering the kinetic and potential energy of the system, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to derive the critical speed.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common {{objections}} to rule-consequentialism is that it is incoherent, because {{it is based on the}} consequentialist principle that what <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> concerned with is maximizing the good, but then it tells us not to act to maximize the good, but to follow rules (even in cases where we know that breaking the rule could produce better results).|$|E
25|$|Augustine {{also does}} not {{envision}} original sin as causing structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of Adam and Eve were already created mortal before the Fall.

25|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{candid about}} the {{interests}} surrounding Indian gaming.

25|$|Stephen R. L. Clark, Mary Midgley, and Bernard Rollin also discuss {{animal rights}} {{in terms of}} animals being {{permitted}} to lead a life appropriate for their kind. Egalitarianism favors an equal distribution of happiness among all individuals, which makes {{the interests of the}} worse off more important than those of the better off. Another approach, virtue ethics, holds that in considering how to act we should consider the character of the actor, and what kind of moral agents <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> Rosalind Hursthouse has suggested an approach to animal rights based on virtue ethics. Mark Rowlands has proposed a contractarian approach.|$|E

25|$|Dr. King {{would be}} greatly distressed {{to find that}} his blood had {{triggered}} off bloodshed and disorder. I think instead the nation should be quiet; black and white, and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> in a prayerful mood, which would be {{in keeping with his}} life. We should make that kind of dedication and commitment to the goals which his life served to solving the domestic problems. That's the memorial, that's the kind of memorial we should build for him. It's just not appropriate for there to be violent retaliations, and that kind of demonstration {{in the wake of the}} murder of this pacifist and man of peace.|$|E
25|$|More subtly, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to {{determine}} our next action {{based on the results}} of previous actions. To do this, Haskell has an operator >>= (pronounced bind) with type IO a → (a → IOnbsp&b) → IOnbsp&b. That is, the operand on the left is an I/O action that returns a value of type a; the operand on the right is a function that can pick an I/O action based on the value produced by the action on the left. The resulting combined action, when performed, performs the first action, then evaluates the function with the first action's return value, then performs the second action, and finally returns the second action's value.|$|E
25|$|On 1 December 2002, the Sunday Times printed {{an extract}} {{of a speech}} made by Minister of State for Health, Balaji Sadasivan, an ethnically Indian {{neurosurgeon}} who was fluent in Mandarin. He said, 'Research has also shown that the brain of homosexuals is structurally different from heterosexuals. It is likely therefore that the homosexual tendency is imprinted in the brain in utero and homosexuals must live with the tendencies that they inherit {{as a result of}} the structural changes in their brain. Within the moral and cultural constraints of our society, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> tolerant of those who may be different from most of us.' This was the first time a Cabinet Minister had publicly quoted scientific findings about homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|The {{report on}} Duke Wiser, {{mentioned}} above, {{on the other}} hand confirms Hasels point of view: Duke von Wiser, who had been given administrative powers over the forestry department in Friedrichstal, {{had been a member of}} Hubertia since 1877. Krutina {{on the other hand}}, who originated the quoted report, was just as well a member of Hubertia. If one would assume that Kurtina sides with Wiser due to their connection within their common fraternity, then <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to deduct supportive words instead of criticism. What surprises though is that the report itself speaks in a critical, if not negative, tone where Krutina denies Wiser any passion for his work: He refers to him as a mediocre hunter, something that is unlikely to be said between friends portraying each other outside. If there would have been unfair connections between members of Hubertia, then Krutina's reporst would likely have resulted in a more positive view of Wiser and the situation.|$|E
25|$|As the war progressed, with no hope {{of joining}} the {{rebellion}} due to power of the Royal Navy (in the letter he had addressed to Bermudians soliciting the theft of the gunpowder, George Washington had written We would not wish to in volve you in an Opposition, in which from your Situation, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> unable to support you: – We knew not therefore to what Extent to sollicit your Assistance in availing ourselves of this Supply), with increasing numbers of American loyalists in Bermuda (such as the privateer Bridger Goodrich), and with their economic opportunities dwindling, Bermudians overcame their sympathies for their erstwhile countrymen and unleashed their privateers (which, {{by the middle of}} the 18th century already outnumbered those of any of the mainland colonies) upon American shipping. The Bermudian effectiveness was such that, when the US sued British privateers for wrongful seizures in British courts, following the war, a sizable part of the damages they were awarded were to have come from Bermudians, like Hezekiah Frith (although, with the local authorities tasked with collecting these damages being in sympathy with the defendants, most of these damages were never paid).|$|E
