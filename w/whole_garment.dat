2500|$|His {{style for}} the {{magazine}} was radically different than any of its contemporaries. Brodovitch wanted his spreads to be innovative and fresh. While other fashion magazines thought it important to show the <b>whole</b> <b>garment,</b> Brodovitch would crop images unexpectedly or off-center to bring a new dynamism to the layout. He used forms in the photographs or illustrations as a cue for {{how to handle the}} shape of the text. In his earlier layouts, he would arrange photographs like playing cards, splayed out on the page or {{in the shape of a}} fan. Later in his career, however, he abandoned this technique in favor of using only one or two images to a page. Surrealism [...] found its way onto the pages of the magazines in various experimental forms. For example, Brodovitch once used fashion photographs sent via radio from Paris to New York in blurry forms to communicate this new way of sharing information. Designs also included torn edges on photographs, or pages made to look as they had been torn through with a woman's figure stepping out of them. The motif of isolated body parts, another common Surrealist theme, could be seen on the covers and spreads of Harper's in the form of lips, hands, and eyes.|$|E

As he retraces {{his way to}} {{the point}} from which he descried the woman at a distance sitting on the step, he sees a ragged figure coming very cautiously along, crouching close to the soiled walls--which the wretchedest figure might as well avoid--and furtively thrusting a hand before it. It is the figure of a youth whose face is hollow and whose eyes have an emaciated glare. He is so intent on getting along unseen that even the apparition of a stranger in <b>whole</b> <b>garments</b> does not tempt him to look back. He shades his face with his ragged elbow as he passes {{on the other side of}} the way, and goes shrinking and creeping on with his anxious hand before him and his shapeless clothes hanging in shreds.

60|$|Away we go again, by muddy roads, {{and through}} the most {{shattered}} and tattered of villages, where {{there is not a}} whole window among all the houses, or a <b>whole</b> <b>garment</b> among all the peasants, or the least appearance of anything to eat, in any of the wretched hucksters' shops. The women wear a bright red bodice laced before and behind, a white skirt, and the Neapolitan head-dress of square folds of linen, primitively meant to carry loads on. The men and children wear anything they can get. The soldiers are as dirty and rapacious as the dogs. The inns are such hobgoblin places, that they are infinitely more attractive and amusing than the best hotels in Paris. Here is one near Valmontone (that is Valmontone the round, walled town on the mount opposite), which is approached by a quagmire almost knee-deep. There is a wild colonnade below, and a dark yard full of empty stables and lofts, and a great long kitchen with a great long bench and a great long form, where a party of travellers, with two priests among them, are crowding round the fire while their supper is cooking. Above stairs, is a rough brick gallery to sit in, with very little windows with very small patches of knotty glass in them, and all the doors that open from it (a dozen or two) off their hinges, and a bare board on tressels for a table, at which thirty people might dine easily, and a fireplace large enough in itself for a breakfast-parlour, where, as the faggots blaze and crackle, they illuminate the ugliest and grimmest of faces, drawn in charcoal on the whitewashed chimney- sides by previous travellers. There is a flaring country lamp on the table; and, hovering about it, scratching her thick black hair continually, a yellow dwarf of a woman, who stands on tiptoe to arrange the hatchet knives, and takes a flying leap to look into the water-jug. The beds in the adjoining rooms are of the liveliest kind. There is not a solitary scrap of looking-glass in the house, and the washing apparatus is identical with the cooking utensils. But the yellow dwarf sets on the table a good flask of excellent wine, holding a quart at least; and produces, among half- a-dozen other dishes, two-thirds of a roasted kid, smoking hot. She is as good-humoured, too, as dirty, which is saying a great deal. So here's long life to her, in the flask of wine, and prosperity to the establishment.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} several algorithms {{and concepts}} {{in order to}} make interactive animation of textiles and even of <b>whole</b> <b>garments</b> in the context of virtual try-on and virtual prototyping feasible. The algorithms are designed for stability of the simulation and interactivity of the whole system. The main contributions are ontologies for virtual garments, algorithms for rapid collision detection, efficient simulation of textile materials and visualisation in real time. Since garments are a composition of several patterns at first an ontology for patterns is described. On the basis of this ontology and extensions to garments the process of virtual dressing can be specified and even manipulated intuitively on a higher semantic level. In combination with a method for geometric pre-positioning virtual characters can be dressed automatically. Moreover, it is shown how the process of collision detection can be enhanced by using the induced semantic information of different garment layers. The process of collisions detection is split into self collisions and collisions between cloth and the environment. The latter collisions are detected by using a distance field. This representation of 3 D objects provides highly robust collision detection, since space is divided strictly into inside and outside. Since a distance field yields not only the penetration depth but also the normal needed for collision response, collision detection between textiles and the environment is carried out very efficiently. For avoiding self collisions a hierarchic method is used, which rapidly determines nearby particles of the cloth mesh and keeps them apart. The described approximate self collision detection is also extremely stable. For interactive simulation of textile materials an algorithm is presented, which works in real time even for meshes containing several thousand triangles. The method remains stable for large time steps, since high internal forces are modelled by geometric constraints, which can be parameterized for different cloth behaviour. Only external forces like gravity are integrated conventionally. For realistic visualisation of garments methods for rendering seams, buttons and labels are presented. By using only few additional geometry and extra textures these elements can be rendered efficiently with high resolution...|$|R

The Extravehicular and Protective Systems (STE) Branch of NASA Ames Research Center has developed advanced concepts or liquid cooling garments for both industrial and biomedical applications for the past 25 years. Examples of this work include: (1) liquid cooled helmets for helicopter pilots and race car drivers; (2) vests for fire and mine rescue personnel; (3) bras to increase the definition of tumors during thermography; (4) lower body garments for young women with erythomelaigia; and (5) <b>whole</b> body <b>garments</b> used by patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The benefits of the biomedical application of artificial thermoregulation received national attention through two recent events: (1) the liquid-cooled garment technology {{was inducted into the}} United States Space Foundation's Space Technology Hall of Fame (1993); and (2) NASA has signed a joint Memorandum of Understanding with the Multiple Sclerosis Association (1994) to share this technology for use with MS patient treatment. The STE Branch is currently pursuing a program to refine thermoregulatory design in light of recent technology developments that might be applicable for use by several medical patient populations. Projects have been initiated to apply thermoregulatory technology for the treatment and/or rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, migraine headaches, and to help prevent the loss of hair during chemotherapy...|$|R
60|$|I {{went out}} to smoke a cigar amongst the trees, it being a very lovely autumnal evening, with the light of an unclouded new moon to temper the darkness. I was {{walking up and down}} in a narrow path amongst the weeds, {{thinking}} of my approaching meeting with Paquíta, when old Santos came out to me and mysteriously informed me that Doña Demetria wished to see me. He led me through the large room where we always had our meals, then through a narrow, dimly lighted passage into another room I had not entered before. Though {{the rest of the house}} was now in darkness, the old colonel having already retired to bed, it was very light here, there being about half a dozen candles placed about the room. In the centre of the floor, with her old face beaming with delighted admiration, stood Ramona, gazing on another person seated on the sofa. And on this individual I also gazed silently for some time; for, though I recognised Demetria in her, she was so changed that astonishment prevented me from speaking. The rusty grub had come forth as a splendid green and gold butterfly. She had on a grass-green silk dress, made in a fashion I had never seen before; extremely high in the waist, puffed out on the shoulders, and with enormous bell-shaped sleeves reaching to the elbows, the <b>whole</b> <b>garment</b> being plentifully trimmed with very fine cream-coloured lace. Her long, thick hair, which had hitherto always been worn in heavy plaits on her back, was now piled up in great coils on her head and surmounted by a tortoiseshell comb a foot high at least, and about fifteen inches broad at the top, looking like an immense crest on her head. In her ears were curious gold filigree pendants reaching to her bare shoulders; she also wore a necklet of half-doubloons linked together in a chain, and heavy gold bracelets on her arms. It was extremely quaint. Possibly this finery had belonged to her grandmother a hundred years ago; and I daresay that bright green was not the proper tint for Demetria's pallid complexion; still, I must confess, at the risk of being set down as a barbarian in matters of taste, that it gave me a shock of pleasure to see her. She saw that I was very much surprised, and a blush of confusion overspread her face; then, recovering her usual quiet, self-possessed manner, she invited me to sit on the sofa by her. I took her hand and complimented her on her appearance. She laughed a little shy laugh, then said that, as I was going to leave her next day, she did not wish me to remember her only as a woman in rusty black. I replied that I would always remember her not for the colour and fashion of her garments, but for her great, unmerited misfortunes, her virtuous heart, and for the kindness she had shown to me. My words evidently pleased her, and while we sat together conversing pleasantly, before us were Ramona and Santos, one standing, the other seated, both feasting their eyes on their mistress in her brilliant attire. Their delight was quite open and childlike, and gave an additional zest to the pleasure I felt. Demetria seemed pleased to think she looked well, and was more light-hearted than I had seen her before. That antique finery, which would have been laughable on another woman, somehow or other seemed appropriate to her; possibly because the strange simplicity and ignorance of the world displayed in her conversation, and that gentle dignity of manner natural to her, would have prevented her from appearing ridiculous in any costume.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{spite of}} {{increased}} environmental cold stress, heat strain is possible {{also in a}} cold environment. The body heat balance depends on three factors: environmental thermal conditions, metabolic heat production and thermal insulation of clothing and other protective garments. As physical exercise may increase metabolic heat production from rest values by ten times or even more, the required thermal insulation of clothing may vary accordingly. However, in most outdoor work, and often in indoor cold work, too, the thermal insulation of clothing is impractical, difficult or impossible to adjust according to the changes in physical activity. This is especially true with <b>whole</b> body covering <b>garments</b> like chemical protective clothing. As {{a result of this}} imbalance, heat strain may develop. In cold all the signs of heat strain (core temperature above 38 °C, warm or hot thermal sensations, increased cutaneous circulation and sweating) may not be present at the same time. Heat strain in cold may be whole body heat strain or related only to torso or core temperature. Together with heat strain in torso or body core, there can be at the same time even cold strain in peripheral parts and/or superficial layers of the body. In cold environment both the preservation of insulation and facilitation of heat loss are important. Development of clothing design is still needed to allow easy adjustments of thermal insulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCompression {{garments}} {{are widely}} used in various sports activities. Since the cloths in a compression garment are sufficiently attached to the human body, {{it is possible for}} a compression garment to have particular mechanical functions by appropriately arranging the tension distribution in the garment. However, the effects of such garment on muscle activity have not been sufficiently investigated yet. Therefore, a method of musculoskeletal simulation for such problems were developed in the present study. In the developed musculoskeletal model, particular belt-like parts of cloths which had larger tension against stretch were modelled as virtual ligaments. In order to distribute the virtual ligaments, 403 reference points for upper half of the body were defined on the whole body in the musculoskeletal model. These points could be used as start, end and via points for the virtual ligaments. As an example of analysis, a running motion was analyzed in the present study. The running motion was acquired from the experiment using motion capture system, and put into the simulation model. One simple pattern of tension distribution was examined by the simulation. From the simulation, it was confirmed that the muscle activity changed according to the tension of the belt-like cloths. Therefore the developed simulation method will be useful for the design (the arrangement of the belt-like cloths) of the <b>whole</b> body compression <b>garments...</b>|$|R

40|$|Most launch {{vehicles}} and satellites in the US inventory rely upon {{the use of}} hypergolic rocket propellants, {{many of which are}} toxic to humans. These fuels and oxidizers, such as hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide have threshold limit values as low as 0. 01 PPM. It is essential to provide space workers handling these agents whole body protection as they are universally hazardous not only to the respiratory system, but the skin as well. This paper describes a new method for powering a <b>whole</b> body protective <b>garment</b> to assure the safety of ground servicing crews. A new technology has been developed through the small business innovative research program at the Kennedy Space Center. Currently, liquid air is used in the environmental control unit (ECU) that powers the propellant handlers suit (PHE). However, liquid air exhibits problems with attitude dependence, oxygen enrichment, and difficulty with reliable quantity measurement. The new technology employs the storage of the supply air as a supercritical gas. This method of air storage overcomes all of three problems above while maintaining high density storage at relatively low vessel pressures (< 7000 kPa or approximately 1000 psi). A one hour prototype ECU was developed and tested to prove the feasibility of this concept. This was upgraded by the design of a larger supercritical dewar capable of holding 7 Kg of air, a supply which provides a 2 hour duration to the PHE. A third version is being developed to test the feasibility of replacing existing air cooling methodology with a liquid cooled garment for relief of heat stress in this warm Florida environment. Testing of the first one hour prototype yielded data comparable to the liquid air powered predecessor, but enjoyed advantages of attitude independence and oxygen level stability. Thermal data revealed heat stress relief at least as good as liquid air supplied units. The application of supercritical air technology to this whole body protective ensemble marked an advancement in the state-of-the-art in personal protective equipment. Not only was long duration environmental control provided, but it was done without a high pressure vessel. The unit met human performance needs for attitude independence, oxygen stability and relief of heat stress. This supercritical air (and oxygen) technology is suggested for microgravity applications in life support such as the Extravehicular Mobility Unit. c 2001. Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|In Byzantium {{between the}} fourth and the twelfth century, a {{hierarchy}} of silken splendour was established across social, artistic, religious, economic and political boundaries. On one level silk was a decorative fabric socially exploited for its aesthetic qualities. On another level it was prized as a fabric fit for furnishing the House of God.

Consequently silk was made to serve both as the prime Imperial ceremonial fabric and as the diplomatic cloth 2 ̆ 7 par excellence 2 ̆ 7. 1 The present paper seeks to explore two questions in this context:How and why did silk assume such a strongly political role in Byzantium?

Silk as a power base Silk was established as a power base in Byzantium between {{the fourth and}} the twelfth century under three umbrellas:• It was granted an elevated status through Imperial legislation and through its association with Imperial murcx purple dyes. 2 • Concomitantly it was rendered indispensable to Imperial Ceremonial. 3 • It was featured in domestic and in foreign policy {{as a tool for}} the implementation of Imperial policy. 4 Imperial silk legislation Imperial silk legislation survives in two forms: Imperial decrees (embodied in the Theodosian and the Justinianic Codes, in a Novel of Leo the Wise and in the Basilics) 5 and in economic legislation (as found in the Book of the Prefect). 6 The Decrees were concerned first to establish and then to maintain an Imperial monopoly over the production of silks intended for court consumption and principal amongst these were the murcx dyed purple silks. 7 From the fourth to the tenth century Imperial silks and purples appear to have been manufactured only in Imperial workshops but in the tenth century some were manufactured under strict control by non-Imperial silk guilds in Constantinople. The Book of the Prefect, which details non Imperial silk guild regulations, indicates that seven categories of Imperial silk garments or purples were in non-Imperial production. 8 These included <b>whole</b> silk <b>garments</b> and petticoats of Imperial cut, and exclusive Imperial red or blue purples of different strengths, as well as some peach and other green tinted purple silk shades. These purple dyes were produced through labour intensive and costly processing of the light sensitive, purple yielding juices from the glands of murex sea snails. The Imperial monopoly over manufacture and use of the murex purple silks in particular, immediately rendered Imperial silk a political presence. Leo VI (d. 912) was well aware that murex purples had a high political profile and that they had long since become synonymous with Imperial authority and power. Leo VI stated (Novel 80) : 2 ̆ 7 I do not understand why the Emperors, my predecessors, who dressed in purple, were induced to legislate to forbid any piece of purple material from figuring as an article of commerce, or prohibit the purchase and sale thereof. To prevent the trade in a whole piece of the fabric would not be a vain matter for legislation; but since scraps and clippings cannot be of practical use or advantage to buyers and sellers, what honest purpose, and exempt from jealousy of their subjects can have prompted the idea of the legislators: and how can it be prejudicial or derogatory of the Imperial rank? Since we do not approve of suchan idea, weordain that scraps and clippings, to which our subjects attach distinction and importance, and which they can use for any purpose not forbidden by law, may be bought and sold. Besides other benefits which the Emperor confers upon his subjects he must not be envious of their luxuries. 2 ̆ 7...|$|R

Parents are in the pivotal role of helping our children see learning differences as {{part of the fabric of}} their lives, not as the <b>whole</b> <b>garment.</b> As Sally Smith, who has interviewed many adults with learning disabilities, says, “It’s not so much the words uttered by parents that adults [with learning disabili-ties] carry with them through life as it is their parents’ attitudes, values, and habits of feeling.

40|$|This chapter {{seeks to}} develop an {{argument}} for a more nuanced language in our critical understanding of the cultural and contextual significance of hand knitting within contemporary craft practice, towards developing a clearer articulation of the intrinsic complexities within this craft practice set against emergent digital contexts, technologies and new modes of collaborative socially engaged practices. The physical activity of hand knitting is a relatively simple repetitive action that has often been described as requiring limited skill or ability. Knitting {{at its most basic}} can be described as the transformation of a linear thread into an interwoven layered construct, whether as a hand-knitted flat panelled jumper knitted on two pins or a complex multi panelled <b>whole</b> <b>garment</b> produced on a high-end computer controlled seamless 3 D knitting machine. However, these basic actions and processes, the transformation of yarn into artefacts is not the whole story or the starting point of this chapter. Instead the author suggests deeper levels of complexity that are embedded within the hand knitting language informed by: haptic, temporal and cultural indices. There are greater levels of embodied tacit and experiential knowledge together with complex associations across culture[s] and customs that call {{for the development of a}} far more precise and appropriate language in contextualizing knitting against preconceptions of craft...|$|E
40|$|Protective {{equipment}} {{represents an}} alternative for the sustainable development of companies and {{for human health}} protection. The insertion of "invisible functionalities" in textile structures, the use of functional elements {{as part of the}} <b>whole</b> <b>garment</b> are just a few tools which define "freedom" of creation in the field of textiles. The electrical, chemical and mechanical properties of conductive textiles are crucial for intelligent textiles. ESD garments are used to protect sensitive devices from electrostatic discharges that can occur from the normal clothing of the human operators. ESD garments on the market don’t solve all the problems raised by accidental electrostatic discharges. This is because the fabric, from which the garment is made, must fulfill at the same time two contradictory conditions: high resistivity, to limit the charging process and energy transfer in case of an eventual discharge, and high conductivity, to facilitate the dissipation process of charges, thus limiting the accumulation of charge on the fabric. To obtain an ESD garment with superior qualities, the present paper proposes the development of a bilayer structure using the integral knitting technique. The outer layer, which comes in contact with the working environment, is mainly dissipative (DL) which ensures the protection against short circuit and limitation of electrostatic energy transfer into the working environment, while the inner layer, which comes in contact with the human operator, is mainly conductive (CL), providing the controlled drainage of accumulated electrostatic charge...|$|E
40|$|The ‘hypothesis’ of this practice-led {{research}} is that seamless knitwear processes, recognized as mass- production tools within a post-Fordist {{system of the}} mass-production of difference, may be rethought as design innovation processes for three-dimensional assemblage. This opens to a design-led rather than a production-led understanding of innovation. The thesis outcome {{is a collection of}} knitwear garments, each of which is singular though iterative; a collection produced as repetitive difference. Engaging with the computerized design capability of the Shima Seiki seamless knitwear system, this research opens critical approaches to an understanding of design, technology, garment, surface and form. Contexts associated with the work of the philosopher, Gilles Deleuze and the ethos of Wabi-Sabi ground the research questioning of production’s relationship to form, materiality and the fashioning of things. The thesis outcome of a ‘seriality’ of singular garments is accompanied by an exegesis that engages the historical and critical contexts of the advent of seamless knitwear processes, and current research on seamless knit production and aesthetics. Though now twenty years since its inception, its model of production does not realize the potential for three dimensional design-led capabilities, tending to perpetuate already established knitwear production models of two-dimensional symmetrical design processes that traditionally required seams. This research investigates the impact of <b>whole</b> <b>garment</b> knitwear technologies, particularly the role of design and its applications to production. The thesis suggests that the designer’s ability to create singularities in knitwear design has been bounded by mass-production design and manufacturing processes, exemplified by current commercial applications of seamless knitwear techniques. When knitwear encounters the potential for a paradigm shift in its modes of production, there is also the potential to rethink design itself. Singularities in Design is a PhD research project that localizes such a paradigm shift in seamless knitwear processes. The research methodology works at the nexus of a triple engagement that of ‘concept’, ‘affect’ and ‘function’. The thinking of Gilles Deleuze, particularly The Fold, informs this engagement and opens to a reflection on the designer’s approach to her craft, invoking the tradition of Wabi-Sabi ethos and the broad technology imperatives of seamless knitwear and global techno cultural traditions. This research project aims at creating original modalities of understanding fashion other than with in traditional legacies of a science and art dualism...|$|E
