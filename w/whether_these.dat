5|$|Paxillus involutus also {{contains}} agents which appear to damage chromosomes; {{it is unclear}} <b>whether</b> <b>these</b> have carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Two compounds that have been identified are the phenols involutone and involutin; the latter {{is responsible for the}} brownish discolouration upon bruising.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{proposed}} relationships between certain modifiable factors, such as diet, cardiovascular risk, pharmaceutical products, or intellectual activities among others, and a population's likelihood of developing AD.

5|$|In 1974, DARPA {{secretly}} requested {{answers from}} five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations. The first {{was about the}} signature thresholds at which an aircraft is virtually undetectable. The second point was <b>whether</b> <b>these</b> companies {{had the capacity to}} design and manufacture such an aircraft. Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate, while General Dynamics insisted on the use of electronic countermeasures. As a result, General Dynamics left the discussion. The remaining two companies, McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, were each awarded $100,000 for further research.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 Bamber's lawyers {{highlighted}} {{two police}} logs {{in support of}} Bamber's application to have his case referred back to the Court of Appeal. The question was <b>whether</b> <b>these</b> logs support the prosecution position that there was one call that night to the police, from Bamber alone; or the defence position {{that there were two}} calls to police, one from Nevill followed by a second from Bamber.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2016, Gingrich {{stated that}} he {{believes}} that Americans of Muslim backgrounds who believe in Sharia law should be deported, and that visiting websites that promote the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or Al-Qaeda should be a felony.

5|$|Pym and Peters {{hide in the}} {{mountains}} surrounding {{the site of the}} ambush. They discover a labyrinth of passages in the hills with strange marks on the walls, and disagree about <b>whether</b> <b>these</b> are the result of artificial or natural causes. Facing a shortage of food, they make a desperate run and steal a pirogue from the natives, narrowly escaping from the island and taking one of its inhabitants prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{children}} who were reared in institutions have suggested that they are inattentive and overactive, no matter what quality of care they received. In one investigation, some institution-reared boys were reported to be inattentive, overactive, and markedly unselective in their social relationships, while girls, foster-reared children, and some institution-reared children were not. It {{is not yet clear}} <b>whether</b> <b>these</b> behaviors should be considered as part of disordered attachment.|$|E

5|$|The Office of the Special Prosecutor {{was founded}} {{with the passage}} of a bill in the Icelandic {{parliament}} 10 December 2008. The aim was to investigate suspected criminal conduct leading up to, in connection with or {{in the wake of the}} banking crisis, <b>whether</b> <b>these</b> relate to the activities of financial undertakings, other legal entities or individuals, and, as appropriate, to follow up these investigations by bringing charges in court against those concerned.|$|E
5|$|The Platyhelminthes {{excluding}} Acoelomorpha contain {{two main}} groups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora, {{both of which}} are generally agreed to be monophyletic (each contains all and only the descendants of an ancestor that {{is a member of the}} same group). Early molecular phylogenetics analyses of the Catenulida and Rhabditophora left uncertainties about <b>whether</b> <b>these</b> could be combined in a single monophyletic group, but a study in 2008 concluded they could, therefore Platyhelminthes could be redefined as Catenulida plus Rhabditophora, excluding the Acoelomorpha.|$|E
5|$|The insects {{captured}} by the glandular trichomes {{are too small to}} serve any role in pollination.

5|$|The long-pink and short-white races {{frequently}} {{occur in}} close proximity to each other; in these mixed populations the former tends to flower in winter and the latter in spring. The question has been raised <b>whether</b> <b>these</b> different forms are becoming incompatible. However, controlled cross-pollination between plants with short and long corollas showed that there was no incompatibility between them.|$|E
5|$|Three {{subspecies}} {{were identified}} by Goldman in 1935, M.p. columbiana, M.p. pacifica, and M.p. pennanti. Later research has debated <b>whether</b> <b>these</b> subspecies could be positively identified. In 1959, E.M. Hagmeier concluded that the subspecies are not separable based on either fur or skull characteristics. Although some debate still exists, in general it is recognized that the fisher is a monotypic species with no extant subspecies.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of genetic engineering, a whole new type of food has been brought into the world, and {{scholars}} in both academia and Judaic faith have differing viewpoints on <b>whether</b> <b>these</b> new strains of foods are to be considered kosher or not. The first genetically modified animal approved by the FDA for human consumption is the AquAdvantage salmon, and while salmon is normally an acceptably kosher food, this modified organism has a gene from a nonkosher organism.|$|E

5|$|Wulfred was {{the first}} {{archbishop}} to place his portrait on the pennies struck in his name which, unlike those of previous archbishops, never made reference to the ruling Mercian king. Wulfred also rebuilt some buildings at Christ Church, Canterbury, {{although it is not}} known <b>whether</b> <b>these</b> were support buildings, such as the dormitory and refractory, or if he rebuilt the cathedral itself.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Bronze Age people had settled {{in the area around}} 1000 BC, although it is not known <b>whether</b> <b>these</b> settlements were permanent or temporary. The town itself was founded in the 11th century when Benedictine monks established a priory {{at the foot of the}} highest peak of Malvern Hills. During the 19th century Malvern developed rapidly from a village to a sprawling conurbation owing to its popularity as a hydrotherapy spa based on its spring waters. Immediately following the decline of spa tourism towards the end of the 19th century, the town's focus shifted to education with the establishment of several private boarding schools in former hotels and large villas. A further major expansion was the result of the relocation of the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) to Malvern in 1942. QinetiQ, TRE's successor company, remains the town's largest local employer.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage may {{extend beyond}} an {{aircraft}}'s airframe. High-flying aircraft {{can sometimes be}} detected by their vapor contrails. Researchers have considered <b>whether</b> <b>these</b> might be reduced {{with the use of}} chemical additives. Work was carried out on a contrail management system for B-2 stealth bombers in 1994. From the Second World War onwards, reconnaissance pilots took care to avoid creating contrails, varying their altitude as necessary; the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was equipped with a mirror to enable the pilot to see if the plane was creating a contrail, and to take action accordingly.|$|E
