500|$|By 12 o'clock <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> {{it looked}} as if we'd lost control of the whole thing. My first {{decision}} was to send a Governor 5 back up to the remand prison {{to see if we could}} hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties of one sort or another and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it. We rang staff up about it, who said [...] "You must be joking, is this an April Fool?" [...] That's what happened when they rang up my home, my son thought it was an April Fool.|$|E
500|$|Katherine Tina Valentine was {{introduced}} by former executive producer Edward J. Scott, born onscreen during the episode that aired July 30, 1990. She was portrayed by twins Darla and Sandra Greer from 1990 to 1991, with child actress Danielle Ryah taking over the role briefly in 1994. Upon the character's re-introduction as an adult by executive producer Maria Arena Bell on February 6, 2008, actress Elizabeth Hendrickson assumed the role. Hendrickson was previously known {{for her role as}} Maggie Stone on All My Children, one half of the iconic Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone lesbian supercouple. Having been offered the part in 2007 as a ten-episode guest stint, she was soon promoted to a contract status. Reflecting on her casting, Hendrickson described the process as a [...] "lovely surprise" [...] and said, [...] "I used to always watch Y when I was on AMC. I always liked {{the look and feel of}} the show, so I’ve always been a big fan. Chloe wasn’t even on the page <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> for a chemistry audition." [...] As a result of the character's positive response, Bell decided to write Chloe's backstory which revealed her to be the daughter of long-running character Esther Valentine (Kate Linder) while also providing her with additional storyline. [...] "Everyone is so pleasant here and it's such a great, warm environment and it just feels really right. If they ask me to stay that would be a blessing," [...] Hendrickson said, before being offered a contract. In March 2014, following increased speculation, Hendrickson confirmed her exit from the series, stating: [...] "I need to stretch my wings and fly into the unknown. The one thing that remains true and what I will hold close to my heart as I embark on this new adventure is that I will ALWAYS have you." [...] She made her last appearance on May 27, 2014. Hendrickson reprised the role for one episode on October 14, 2014 to commemorate the passing of Chloe's daughter, Delia. In October 2015, Hendrickson also reprised the role of Chloe from October 12 to 28.|$|E
2500|$|Looking {{to break}} into production, Thomas wrote to Beatles {{producer}} George Martin seeking work and in 1967 was employed as an assistant by AIR, an independent production company which had been founded by Martin and three other EMI producers. Thomas was allowed to attend sessions at EMI with the Hollies and, in 1968, The Beatles during their sessions for the White Album. Midway through the sessions, Martin {{decided to take a}} vacation, and he proposed that Thomas assume his duties as producer. [...] "I had just come back from holiday myself, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> there was a little letter on the desk that said, [...] "Dear Chris, Hope you had a nice holiday. I'm off on mine now. Make yourself available to The Beatles. Neil and Mal know you're coming down." [...] Thomas produced [...] "Birthday" [...] and [...] "Happiness Is A Warm Gun" [...] and played keyboards on four songs: Mellotron on [...] "The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill", piano on [...] "Long, Long, Long" [...] and [...] "Savoy Truffle", and harpsichord on [...] "Piggies".|$|E

2500|$|Before leaving, Kelly {{told the}} group that when Fitzpatrick, the Benalla constable, was shot, he was not within 400 miles of Greta. However, he {{admitted}} to stealing 280 horses from Whitty's station and denied that he had committed any other crime. The horses, he stated, were sold to Baumgarten. Kelly showed the group his revolvers, and pointed out one which he had taken from Constable Lonigan, and further stated that he had shot Lonigan with a worn-out, crooked musket, held together with string and 'could shoot around corners'. He asked those present how they would like detectives pointing revolvers at their mothers and sisters, threatening to shoot them {{if they did not}} say where they were. He blamed such treatment for turning him against the law. He said that he had come only to shoot the two policemen, Devine and Richards, calling them worse than any black trackers, especially Richards, whom he intended to shoot immediately. Tarleton remarked that Kelly should not blame Richards for doing his duty. Kelly then replied, [...] "Suppose you had your revolver ready <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>in,</b> would you not have shot me ?" [...] Mr Tarleton replied [...] "Yes." [...] "Well", said Kelly, [...] "that's just what I am going to do with Richards—shoot him before he shoots me." [...] The party then interceded for Richards, but Kelly said, [...] "He must die." [...] Before leaving Ned Kelly remarked that he had made a great blunder which would likely lead to their capture.|$|E

6000|$|... "No; because <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> {{from the}} forge of a night, any {{one can see}} me turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{think my}} shoes were so dusty <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> else I'd taken them off," [...] Joe said, apologetically. [...] "You see, ma'am, {{we never saw}} a floor as clean as this one." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{was dead}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> the room, gentlemen," [...] said the prisoner, strenuously.

5000|$|John Varvatos, a {{well-known}} men's fashion designer, wrote this about a photo taken by Mankowitz: [...] "This {{is from a}} series of photos Gered Mankowitz did with Jimi in 1967 at Mason's Yard in London. That series {{may be the most important}} pictures to me. I have a big, limited-edition print of that photo behind my desk. I look at it every day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>in.</b> There was nobody that looked like that when Jimi came on the scene, and there are not very many people who could pull that look off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] said Jeff. [...] "And what's {{the reason}} you didn't want me to marry her <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> here last summer and told you I'd asked her to?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was just}} it, Doctor, and I do feel so ashamed of myself. They thought I looked tired, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>in,</b> and were silly {{enough not to}} wake me this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are going}} somewhere with Laurie, I know you are. You were {{whispering}} and laughing {{together on the}} sofa last night, and you stopped <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>in.</b> Aren't you going with him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, I {{never thought}} if of myself till now!' said Mark, raising his eyebrows {{with a look}} of the merriest {{possible}} surprise. 'I always expected we should part, and never have no explanation; I meant to do it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> here just now; but there's something about you, as makes a man sensible. Then let us have a word or two together; letting it be understood beforehand,' he added this in a grave tone, to prevent the possibility of any mistake, 'that I'm not a-going to make no love, you know.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{at least}} it's a change," [...] the younger sage allowed, [...] "and I haven't found the other {{changes in our}} dear old New York which <b>I</b> look for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> back <b>in</b> the fall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{was poor}} and needed help," [...] said Mirah, {{in a new}} tone of feeling, [...] "and Mr. Deronda has given me the best friends in the world.

6000|$|... "Just so," [...] his {{employer}} assented. [...] "By the bye, {{is it my}} fancy, or weren't you reading the newspaper <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>in?</b> No time for newspapers, you know, after nine o'clock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{remember}} I nearly {{stood on}} my head one day. The conservatory opened off the smoking-room, so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> the room, I heard my two sisters and Beatrice talking about good-looking men.|$|E

60|$|I took up {{the river}} road as hard as I could put.

There was a wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn't.|$|R

She opened her eyes, and Suzette said, severely, [...] "What has come over you, Adeline? Aren't you well?" [...] and as Adeline answered nothing, she went on: [...] "I don't believe she knows where she is. Let us get her into the library on the lounge." ...|$|R
