500|$|Natasha's father, Michael, discovers {{what has}} {{happened}} and he is disgusted when he hears the boys at school talking about his daughter. He confronts Ivan, thinking he made Natasha take the pictures, but he is [...] "gutted" [...] when he learns {{that it was all}} Natasha's idea. Natasha tries to win her father's favour back and she sprays some unpleasant graffiti about herself around the street, before playing the victim. Natasha enjoys the attention she receives, but when Michael realises what she did, he chooses to disown his daughter and tells her that he does not care what she gets up to. Natasha is left shocked by Michael's decision and does not know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Natasha becomes insecure following the photo scandal and Michael's rejection of her and she begins to obsess about improving her appearance. Natasha searches for nose jobs online, before stealing her father's credit card and booking herself in for a procedure.|$|E

2500|$|Berger was {{a central}} figure in formulating the foreign policy of the Clinton Administration, and played an {{integral}} role advancing the administration's self-described objectives of advancing [...] "democracy, shared prosperity, and peace." [...] In President Clinton's words, [...] "Nobody was more knowledgeable about policy or smarter about how to formulate it. [...] He was both great in analyzing a situation and figuring out <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> His gifts proved invaluable time and time again, in Latin America, the Balkans, Northern Ireland, and the Middle East." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once they arrive, the two cosmonauts sent to Parity {{discover}} that their predecessors have disappeared completely. Before leaving, they {{left a note}} stating that they had made contact with intelligent life from the planet Lesnaya Grud'. Together, they decided to keep their findings private out of fear for the political turmoil that might occur. The inhabitants of Lesnaya Grud' had traveled to Parity and transported the two cosmonauts to their home planet. From there, the cosmonauts send a transmission back to Parity describing the planet. It has a much larger population than Earth, nobody has any concept of war, {{and there is an}} established and functional world government. Furthermore, Lesnaya Grud' suffers from the problem of [...] "internal withering," [...] where portions of the planet turn to uninhabitable desert. Although this problem will not be critical for many millions of years, the inhabitants of Lesnaya Grud' are already trying to decide <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and how to possibly fix it.|$|E
2500|$|Nathan (Jimmy Bennett) and Amanda (Chloë Grace Moretz) are {{watching}} television after school at Nathan's house as their first [...] "middle school" [...] date. When {{they begin to}} kiss, his older brother Mikey (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) enters {{the living room and}} makes fun of them. Amanda then discovers she is menstruating and tries to hide it, and when Nathan sees blood on her pants, he panics and believes her to be bleeding to death, causing a debacle, which would later have Nathan and Mikey's father Steve (Patrick Warburton) and Amanda's father (Matt Walsh) involved. Amanda calls them out on their stupidity and feels embarrassed to know that she's getting her first period {{in front of them and}} they don't know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> When she leaves with her father, Nathan yells that the process of keeping the lining of her internal organs intact by inserting his erect phallus into her vagina is much too complicated and Mikey agrees. Steve cheers them up by farting in front of them. As Mikey goes to the bathroom, Nathan and Steve watch a game on television, which has a very graphic Tampax commercial in which a girl gets eaten by a shark due to her menstruating.|$|E
