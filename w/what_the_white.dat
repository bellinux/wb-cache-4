Thus, leadership development cannot take place during a single training course. It is a continuous sequence of sequential, structured learning and experience-building opportunities. The program subscribes {{to the belief that}} when an individual embraces the infinite challenge to change, he is engaged in the never-ending process of becoming a leader. [...] "The infinity principle of growth in leadership is <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Stag symbolizes in this leadership development process." ...|$|E

The law {{guaranteed}} them eight months of school, and, though it cost many times in proportion <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> schools cost, they should have it. Money values should not be set off against moral and intellectual improvement. A nation that depends on its wealth is a depraved nation, while moral purity and intellectual progress alone can preserve the integrity of free institutions, and the love of true liberty, under the protection of equal laws, in the hearts of the people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later {{that same}} day, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House later called [...] "Black Saturday," [...] the US Navy dropped {{a series of}} [...] "signaling depth charges" [...] (practice depth charges the size of hand grenades) on a Soviet {{submarine}} (B-59) at the blockade line, unaware that it was armed with a nuclear-tipped torpedo with orders that allowed it to be used if the submarine was [...] "hulled" [...] (a hole in the hull from depth charges or surface fire). The decision to launch these required agreement from all three officers on board, but one of them, Vasili Arkhipov, objected and so the launch was narrowly averted.|$|E

25|$|Red Cloud's War was {{the name}} the US Army gave {{to a series of}} {{conflicts}} fought with Native American Plains tribes in the Wyoming and Montana territories. The battles were waged between the Northern Cheyenne, allied with Lakota and Arapaho bands, against the United States Army between 1866 and 1868. In December 1866, the Native American allies attacked and defeated a United States unit in <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> would call <b>the</b> Fetterman Massacre (or the Battle of the Hundred Slain), which resulted in the most US casualties of any Plains battle up to that point.|$|R

60|$|He was {{a remarkably}} {{handsome}} man; some years past forty, I should judge; with long black hair, an aquiline nose, broad cheek-bones, a sunburnt complexion, {{and a very}} bright, keen, dark, and piercing eye. There were but twenty thousand of the Choctaws left, he said, and their number was decreasing every day. A few of his brother chiefs had been obliged to become civilised, and to make themselves acquainted with <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> knew, for it was their only chance of existence. But they were not many; and the rest were as they always had been. He dwelt on this: and said several times that unless they tried to assimilate themselves to their conquerors, they must be swept away before the strides of civilised society.|$|R

50|$|By 1972 {{termination}} {{clearly had}} affected the tribes' education. There was a 75 percent dropout {{rate for the}} Menominee Tribe, {{which resulted in a}} generation of Menominee children who had only a ninth grade education. The tribes lost federal support for their schools, and the states were expected to assume the role of educating the Indian children. The Menominee children, for example, did not have their own tribal schools anymore and were discriminated against within the public schools. The Menominee education program became a part of Joint School District No. 8. Younger children were still able to attend schools close to their homes, but high school students had to travel to either Gresham, Wisconsin, or Shawano for schooling. All terminated tribes faced new education policies, which gave the children fewer educational opportunities that were not as good as <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> received.|$|R
5000|$|He went on: [...] "Mr. Jefferson's {{very severe}} remarks on {{us have been}} so {{extensively}} argued upon by men whose attainments in literature, I shall {{never be able to}} reach, that I would not have meddled with it, were it not to solicit each of my brethren, who has the spirit of a man, to buy a copy of Mr. Jefferson's Notes on Virginia, {{and put it in the}} hand of his son. For let no one of us suppose that the refutations which have been written by our white friends are enough—they are whites—we are blacks. We, and the world wish to see the charges of Mr. Jefferson refuted by the blacks themselves, according to their chance; for we must remember that <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> have written respecting this subject, is other men's labours, and did not emanate from the blacks." ...|$|R
60|$|And this, thought Shefford in revolt, was <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> man {{had killed}} in the Indian tribes, was {{reaching}} out now to kill in this wild remnant of the Navajos. The padre, the trapper, the trader, the prospector, and the missionary--so the white man had come, some of him good, no doubt, but more of him evil; and the young brave learned a thirst that could never be quenched at the cold, sweet spring of his forefathers, and the young maiden burned with a fever in her blood, and lost the sweet, strange, wild fancies of her tribe.|$|E
6000|$|... "How was I to {{know the}} way of the white man is never twice the same?" [...] the old man demanded, {{whirling}} upon me fiercely. [...] "How was I to know that <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> man does yesterday he will not do to-day, and that what he does to-day he will not do to-morrow?" [...] Ebbits shook his head sadly. [...] "There is no understanding the white man. Yesterday he takes Yamikan to the land under the sun and makes him fat with much grub. To-day he takes Bidarshik and--what does he do with Bidarshik? Let me tell you what he does with Bidarshik.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait, you fellows! Now listen, George. We don't {{want you}} to make any mistake. These {{starving}} people are your kind of people. They're another tribe, but they're Indians just the same. Now you've seen <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> men are doing--coughing up their dust, giving their dogs and sleds, falling over one another to hit the trail. Only the best men can go with the first sleds. Look at Fat Olsen there. He was ready to fight because they wouldn't let him go. You ought to be mighty proud because all men think you are a number-one musher. It isn't a case of how much, but how quick." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Kent {{area was}} first {{permanently}} settled by westerners {{in the early}} 1860s along <b>the</b> banks of (<b>what</b> was then) <b>the</b> <b>White</b> River, and originally called Titusville. (There is still a 'Titusville Station' sign on Gowe Street near First Avenue.) ...|$|R
6000|$|There yet lingered {{sufficient}} {{light in}} the heavens to exhibit those bright openings among the tree-tops, where different paths left the clearing to enter {{the depths of the}} wilderness. Beneath one of them, a line of warriors issued from the woods, and advanced slowly towards the dwellings. One in front bore a short pole, on which, as it afterwards appeared, were suspended several human scalps. The startling sounds that Duncan had heard were <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> have not inappropriately called the [...] "death-halloo;" [...] and each repetition of the cry was intended to announce to the tribe the fate of an enemy. Thus far the knowledge of Heyward assisted him in the explanation; and as he now knew that the interruption was caused by the unlooked-for return of a successful war-party, every disagreeable sensation was quieted in inward congratulation, for the opportune relief and insignificance it conferred on himself.|$|R
60|$|The {{pleading}} began again, the Hungry Wolf interpreting with tremors of earnestness.

60|$|I {{was at the}} Gould and Curry mine, {{the other}} day, and they had two or three tons of choice rock piled up, which was valued at $20,000 a ton. I {{gathered}} up a hat-full of chunks, on account of their beauty as specimens--they don't let everybody supply themselves so liberally. I send Mr. Moffett a little specimen of it for his cabinet. If you don't know <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> stuff on it is, I must inform {{you that it is}} purer silver than the minted coin. There is about as much gold in it as there is silver, but it is not visible. I will explain to you some day how to detect it.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{beauty of}} the Indian's life is in his love of the open, {{of all that is}} nature, of silence, freedom, wildness. It is a beauty of mind and soul. The Indian would have been content to watch and feel. To a white man he might be dirty and lazy--content to dream life away without trouble or <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> man calls evolution. The Indian might seem cruel because he leaves his old father out in the desert to die. But the old man wants to die that way, alone with his spirits and the sunset. And the white man's {{medicine}} keeps his old father alive days and days after he ought to be dead. Which is more cruel? The Navajos used to fight with other tribes, and then they were stronger men than they are to-day.|$|E
60|$|One of my {{excursions}} took me {{towards the}} south-west extremity of the island. The day {{was clear and}} hot, and I saw the island, not smiling with beauty, but staring with naked hideousness. The lava streams are covered with hummocks, and are rugged to a degree which, geologically speaking, is not of easy explanation. The intervening spaces are concealed with layers of pumice, ashes and volcanic tuff. Whilst passing {{this end of the}} island at sea, I could not imagine <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> patches were with which the whole plain was mottled; I now found that they were sea-fowl, sleeping in such full confidence, that even in mid-day a man could walk up and seize hold of them. These birds were the only living creatures I saw during the whole day. On the beach a great surf, although the breeze was light, came tumbling over the broken lava rocks.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, Thomas Dixon, {{author of}} The Clansman (1905), began a {{newspaper}} controversy with Washington over the industrial system, {{most likely to}} encourage talk of his upcoming book. He characterized the newfound independence of Tuskegee graduates as inciting competition: [...] "Competition is war…. <b>What</b> will <b>the</b> <b>white</b> man do when put to the test? He will do exactly what his <b>white</b> neighbor in <b>the</b> North does when the Negro threatens his bread—kill him!" ...|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} thus, {{he arrived in}} the sequestered glen of Corri-nan-shian, as it verged upon the hour of noon. A few moments he {{remained}} looking upon the fountain, and doubting {{in his own mind}} with <b>what</b> countenance <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Lady might receive him. She had not indeed expressly forbidden his again evoking her; but yet there was something like such a prohibition implied in the farewell, which recommended him to wait for another guide.|$|R
