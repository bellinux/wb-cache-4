5|$|A. f. styani {{has been}} {{described}} by Thomas in 1902 based on one skull from a specimen collected in Sichuan. Pocock distinguished A. f. styani from A. f. fulgens by its longer <b>winter</b> <b>coat</b> and greater blackness of the pelage, bigger skull, more strongly curved forehead, and more robust teeth. His description is based on skulls and skins collected in Sichuan, Myitkyina close to the border of Yunnan, and Upper Burma.|$|E
5|$|More than 10% of the hamsters kept in {{the first}} winter develop the summer coat. In the second winter, only a few change into the <b>winter</b> <b>coat</b> and winter colour is less pronounced. The {{moulting}} in the winter fur starts in October or November and is completed in December, while the summer coat begins in January or February and is completed in March or early April. The ears are grey with a pinkish tint.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} leg of the flight, at about 15:00, Keč, wearing a <b>winter</b> <b>coat,</b> got up from his seat and walked {{to the front of the}} aircraft. A flight {{attendant}} stopped him. After talking for a short while, and another flight attendant came by, he was let into the cockpit. No information about the hijacking was given to the passengers until arrival at Bodø. Bodø Airport was evacuated and the aircraft parked at Bodø Main Air Station, the military section. After landing, by order of the hijacker, the passengers were informed that all women, children under 18 and people over 60 were to leave the aircraft. After this had happened, there were 77 passengers and four crew members left. The aircraft departed Bodø at about 16:00 and headed for Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which was closed for all other traffic.|$|E

5|$|During the fall, elk grow a thicker coat of hair, {{which helps}} to {{insulate}} {{them during the}} winter. Males, females and calves of Siberian and North American elk all grow thin neck manes; female and young Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis do not. By early summer, the heavy <b>winter</b> <b>coat</b> has been shed, and elk are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies. All elk have small and clearly defined rump patches with short tails. They have different coloration based on the seasons and types of habitats, with gray or lighter coloration prevalent {{in the winter and}} a more reddish, darker coat in the summer. Subspecies living in arid climates tend to have lighter colored coats than do those living in forests. Most have lighter yellow-brown to orange-brown coats in contrast to dark brown hair on the head, neck, and legs during the summer. Forest-adapted Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis have darker reddish-brown coats with less contrast between the body coat {{and the rest of the}} body during the summer months. Calves are born spotted, as is common with many deer species, and they lose their spots by the end of summer. Adult Manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older. This characteristic has also been observed in the forest-adapted European red deer.|$|E

50|$|The summer coat {{is short}} and sandy-yellow, with dirty white underparts. Also, dark brown stripes occur along the front surface of the legs and on the upper surface of the tail. In the <b>winter,</b> the <b>coats</b> of females and {{juvenile}} males becomes slightly greyish in colour, but otherwise remain similar. However, the <b>winter</b> <b>coats</b> of adult males are a solid dark brown, without visible stripes on the legs. Males develop a beard with their <b>winter</b> <b>coats</b> in their second year, reaching {{the full length of}} about 12 cm by their fourth or fifth year. Compared with other goats, the beards of East Caucasian turs are relatively stiff, and project somewhat forwards, rather than drooping down. The beard is small or entirely absent in females, and in males in their summer coats.|$|R

25|$|During the autumn, all {{red deer}} {{subspecies}} grow thicker coats of hair, which helps to insulate {{them during the}} winter. Autumn is also {{when some of the}} stags grow their neck manes. The autumn/winter coat of most subspecies are most distinct. The Caspian red deer's <b>winter</b> <b>coat</b> is greyer and has a larger and more distinguished light rump-patch (like wapiti and some central Asian red deer) compared to the Western European red deer, which has more of a greyish-brown coat with a darker yellowish rump patch in the winter. By the time summer begins, the heavy <b>winter</b> <b>coat</b> has been shed; the animals are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies. Red deer have different colouration based on the seasons and types of habitats, with grey or lighter colouration prevalent in the winter and more reddish and darker coat colouration in the summer. Most European red deer have reddish-brown summer coats, and some individuals may have a few spots on the backs of their summer coats.|$|E

25|$|The <b>winter</b> <b>coat</b> {{is unusually}} long and uniform for an animal its size, with a {{luxuriant}} mane of tough, long hairs {{along the back}} from the occiput {{to the base of}} the tail. The coat is generally coarse and bristly, though this varies according to season. In winter, the coat is fairly dense, soft, and has well-developed underfur. The guard hairs are 50–75mm long on the flanks, 150–225mm long on the mane and 150mm on the tail. In summer, the coat is much shorter and coarser, and lacks underfur, though the mane remains large.|$|E

25|$|The fur of the Siberian tiger is {{moderately}} thick, coarse and sparse {{compared to}} that of other felids living in the former Soviet Union. Compared to the now-extinct westernmost populations, the Far Eastern Siberian tiger's summer and winter coats contrast sharply with other subspecies. Generally, the coat of western populations was brighter and more uniform than that of the Far Eastern populations. The summer coat is coarse, while the <b>winter</b> <b>coat</b> is denser, longer, softer, and silkier. The winter fur often appears quite shaggy on the trunk, and is markedly longer on the head, almost covering the ears. Apart from that, Siberian and Caspian tigers had the thickest fur amongst tigers, given their occurrence in the more temperate parts of Eurasia.|$|E
25|$|The <b>winter</b> <b>coat</b> {{consists}} of long, coarse bristles underlaid with short brown downy fur. The length of these bristles varies along the body, with the shortest being around {{the face and}} limbs and the longest running along the back. These back bristles form the aforementioned mane prominent in males, and stand erect when the animal is agitated. Colour is highly variable; specimens around Lake Balkhash are very lightly coloured, and can even be white, while some boars from Belarus and Ussuriland can be black. Some subspecies sport a light coloured patch running backwards {{from the corners of}} the mouth. Coat colour also varies with age, with piglets having light brown or rusty-brown fur with pale bands extending from the flanks and back.|$|E
25|$|The general {{tone of the}} fur is reddish, {{with the}} {{brightest}} hues occurring in winter. In the <b>winter</b> <b>coat,</b> the back is clothed in a saturated rusty-red to reddish colour with brownish highlights {{along the top of}} the head, neck and shoulders. The throat, chest, flanks, and belly and the upper parts of the limbs are less brightly coloured, and are more yellowish in tone. The lower parts of the limbs are whitish, with dark brownish bands on the anterior sides of the forelimbs. The muzzle and forehead are greyish-reddish. The tail is very luxuriant and fluffy, and is mainly of a reddish-ocherous colour, with a dark brown tip. The summer coat is shorter, coarser, and darker. The dorsal and lateral guard hairs in adults measure 20–30mm in length. Dholes in the Moscow Zoo moult once a year from March to May.|$|E

25|$|Fox species {{differ in}} fur color, length, and density. Coat colors range from pearly white to {{black and white}} to black flecked with white or grey on the underside. Fennec foxes (and other species of fox adapted {{to life in the}} desert, such as kit foxes), for example, have large ears and short fur to aid in keeping the body cool. Arctic foxes, on the other hand, have tiny ears and short limbs as well as thick, {{insulating}} fur, which aid in keeping the body warm. Red foxes, by contrast, have a typical auburn pelt, the tail normally ending with white marking. A fox's coat color and texture may vary due to the change in seasons; fox pelts are richer and denser in the colder months and lighter in the warmer months. To get rid of the dense <b>winter</b> <b>coat,</b> foxes moult once a year around April; the process begins from the feet, up the legs, and then along the back. Coat color may also change as the individual ages.|$|E
25|$|In 1792, Robert Kerr first {{described}} a leopard cat under the binominal Felis bengalensis in his translation of Carl von Linné's Systema Naturae as being native to southern Bengal. Between 1829 and 1922, different authors of 20 more descriptions classified the cat either as Felis or Leopardus. Owing {{to the individual}} variation in fur colour, leopard cats from British India were described as Felis nipalensis from Nepal, Leopardus ellioti from the area of Bombay, Felis wagati and Felis tenasserimensis from Tenasserim. In 1939, Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated them to the genus Prionailurus. The collection of the Natural History Museum in London comprised several skulls and large amounts of skins of leopard cats from various regions. Based on this broad variety of skins, he proposed to differentiate between a southern subspecies Prionailurus bengalensis bengalensis from warmer latitudes {{to the west and}} east of the Bay of Bengal, and a northern Prionailurus bengalensis horsfieldi from the Himalayas, having a fuller <b>winter</b> <b>coat</b> than the southern. His description of leopard cats from the areas of Gilgit and Karachi under the trinomen Prionailurus bengalensis trevelyani is based on seven skins that had longer, paler and more greyish fur than those from the Himalayas. He assumed that trevelyani inhabits more rocky, less forested habitats than bengalensis and horsfieldi.|$|E
