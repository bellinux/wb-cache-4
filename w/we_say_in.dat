25|$|He {{studied a}} {{question}} analogous {{to that of}} the surface movement in a cup of coffee. What can <b>we</b> <b>say,</b> <b>in</b> general, about the trajectories on a surface animated by a constant flow? Poincaré discovered that the answer can be found in what we now call the topological properties in the area containing the trajectory. If this area is compact, i.e. both closed and bounded, then the trajectory either becomes stationary, or it approaches a limit cycle. Poincaré went further; if the area is of the same kind as a disk, as is the case for the cup of coffee, there must necessarily be a fixed point. This fixed point is invariant under all functions which associate to each point of the original surface its position after a short time intervalt. If the area is a circular band, or if it is not closed, has no fixed point. then this is not necessarily the case.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Promiscuous" [...] {{describe}} {{the two sides}} of the relationship that the song's protagonist deals with. It was one of the first songs Furtado wrote with labelmate Timothy [...] "Attitude" [...] Clayton. Furtado called their teamwork something she [...] "had never done before" [...] because she saw the writing process as [...] "extremely freeing" [...] because of his different approach and style. Clayton helped Furtado experiment with interpreting the [...] "promiscuous girl" [...] character and the two-sided relationship she is in. Furtado also described that in the process of writing lyrics [...] "we were actually flirting, which is why the song is so playful" [...] and that she and Clayton nicknamed the song 'The BlackBerry Song', because everything <b>we</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the song you could text-message to somebody". Because of the preponderant musical influence of artists such as Talking Heads, Blondie, Madonna, The Police and Eurythmics, whom producers Timbaland and Danja listened to during the writing of the album, [...] "Promiscuous" [...] takes inspiration from pop music of the 1980s. The sexuality was based on the [...] "strong women in control" [...] of the 1990s, such as Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Yo-Yo, Salt-n-Pepa and TLC.|$|E

2500|$|Next morning, Thursday, Sasun Eff. {{came in at}} 10; I {{took him}} {{straight}} to Sir Percy and left them. Half an hour later, he returned {{and told me that}} he had accepted and I understood the full significance of the Nunc Dimittis. He asked me what he could now do to help and I sent him straight to the Naqib. The leading Shi'ah of Baghdad had also refused to join the Council and it was essential to get him in. In the midst of this talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. It was past one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. He told me he had come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, I assured him that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. I took him at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this thing off! rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be.
