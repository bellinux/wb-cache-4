5|$|It {{has been}} a {{struggle}} telling this story over the years, {{because a lot of}} people don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about this kind of history. People don't relate to it, or just don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about it. But Mama told me to keep it alive, so I keep telling it... It's a sad story, but it's one I think everyone needs to hear.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{collaboration}} {{with one of}} my friends from the international music industry, Eric Turner, a very talented guy from Sweden, and with the boys from Play & Win. It is very particular. I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and makes me <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a joke as the episode ends.|$|E

25|$|Bridge {{also wrote}} and edited many carols, and was {{editor of the}} Westminster Abbey Hymn-Book and the Wesleyan Hymn-Book. Among his shorter works are many songs, both comic and serious. The former were popular, and Bridge commented that he had written {{a good deal of}} serious music, but that nobody seemed to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it.|$|E
25|$|A {{party that}} is aggrieved by a {{decision}} of the NLRB can seek review by petitioning in the Court of Appeals. The Act gives parties {{a good deal of}} latitude as to which court they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> their case: either the Circuit in which the hearing was held or the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or any Circuit in which one of the parties against whom the complaint was brought resides or does business. The NLRB, as a matter of policy, only petitions in the Circuit in which the hearing was held.|$|E
25|$|A {{million people}} in our country and abroad like songs like Kalinka, Katyusha, Smuglyanka and the other songs of the {{military}} years as well as The Day of the Victory, Dark Eyes, Vecherny zvon and Podmoskovnye vechera. All these songs are known because of the Alexandrov folk song and dance company and people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> these songs at every concert. They are not just part of our history; they are great masterpieces. It is interesting that Svyaschennaya Voyna, written by Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov in 1941, helped Soviet soldiers to protect their Motherland and is still popular in Slovakia, Poland and Bulgaria. Those audiences listen to it standing up and it touches their hearts and souls.|$|E

25|$|On 11 February 2016, BT {{announced}} {{they will be}} launching a new free service later in 2016 to divert nuisance calls within its network before they ring on customers' phones and will use huge computing power to root out 25 million unwanted calls a week. BT customers can currently purchase special phones {{that will allow them}} to block nuisance calls or pay to stop calls getting through. However, the new service will identify some of the 5 billion unwanted calls made each year before they arrive, which will then be diverted automatically to a junk voicemail box. BT customers will also be able to add numbers they don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from to the blacklist, for free.|$|E
25|$|Another part of {{restructuring}} the movement comes from education; bell hooks {{points out that}} there is an anti-intellectual stigma among the masses. Poor people do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from intellectuals because they are different and have different ideas. As bell hooks points out though, this stigma against intellectuals leads to poor people who have risen up to become graduates of post secondary education, to be shunned because they are no longer {{like the rest of the}} masses. In order for us to achieve equality, people must be able to learn from those who have been able to smash these stereotypes. This separation leads to further inequality and in order for the feminist movement to succeed, they must be able to bridge the education gap and relate to those in the lower end of the economic sphere. If they are able to do this, then there will be more success and less inequality.|$|E
