5|$|Eruptions {{would likely}} {{continue}} {{for a period}} of time, followed by years of decreasing secondary activity. The solidifying lava would occasionally collapse portions of the volcano to create pyroclastic flows.

During the previous year, Macdonald had met with potential railway financiers such as Hugh Allan and considerable financial discussion took place. Nevertheless, the greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which had not yet been debated in Parliament.|$|E

5|$|STAC {{stated that}} an SST would have {{economic}} performance similar to existing subsonic types. Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, {{they would be}} able to fly more sorties in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.|$|E

According to one estimate, of the potential wind energy in the jet stream, only 1 percent <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> meet the world's current energy needs. The required technology would reportedly take 10–20 years to develop.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surrender}} of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, {{the primary reason for}} manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Col. Alexander, chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Fort Stanton fell into the first-class category, as it was thought that the fort <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> defend the Washington Navy Yard.|$|E

Eccles (2004), however, {{has stated}} that F-region dynamo effects should prevail as early as 1600  LT, presumably, because Σ_P^F>Σ_P^E [...] [also, see Crain et al. (1993)]. Given that LSWS forms along the bottomside F layer, it is not obvious, without careful modeling, whether the E- or F-region dynamo is {{controlling}} this process.

5|$|As an {{offshoot}} of Boeing's MX-2145 manned boost-glide bomber project, Boeing partnered with RAND Corporation in January 1954 to explore what sort of bomber aircraft <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> deliver the various nuclear weapons then under development. At the time, nuclear weapons weighed several tons, {{and the need to}} carry enough fuel to fly that payload from the continental United States to the Soviet Union demanded large bombers. They also concluded that after release of bombs the aircraft would need supersonic speed to escape the critical blast-radius.|$|E
5|$|Because TAPS {{hoped to}} begin laying pipe by September 1969, {{substantial}} orders were placed for steel pipeline 48inches (122cm) in diameter. No American company manufactured pipe of that specification, so three Japanese companies—Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., Nippon Steel Corporation, and Nippon Kokan Kabushiki Kaisha—received a $100 million contract {{for more than}} 800 miles (1280km) of pipeline. At the same time, TAPS placed a $30 million order {{for the first of}} the enormous pumps that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> push the oil through the pipeline.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> create patterns in living organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E

5|$|In February 1965 the Army asked Bell to {{consider}} different deployment concepts under the Nth Country study. This examined {{what sort of}} system <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with {{a limited number of}} warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system would be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not a concern for a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E
5|$|On 12 January 2009, {{at least}} three people, {{including}} two Mexicans and one American, entered the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa and damaged just under 30 archaeological pieces, including the four La Venta colossal heads. The vandals were all members of an evangelical church and {{appeared to have been}} carrying out a supposed pre-Columbian ritual, during which salts, grape juice, and oil were thrown on the heads. It was estimated that 300,000 pesos (US$21,900) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> repair the damage, and the restoration process would last four months. The three vandals were released soon after their arrest after paying 330,000 pesos each.|$|E

Separate model runs were used to determine the sustainability of the polar stratospheric clouds. Methane <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> continually released and sustained to maintain the lower stratospheric water vapor. Increasing amounts of ice and condensation nuclei <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> high for the polar stratospheric cloud to sustain itself and eventually expand.|$|R
5|$|Seymour Cray {{began the}} design of the Cray-3 in 1985, as soon as the Cray-2 reached production. Cray {{generally}} set himself the goal of producing new machines with ten times the performance of the previous models. Although the machines did not always meet this goal, this was a useful technique in defining the project and clarifying what sort of process improvements <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> meet it. For the Cray-3, he decided to set an even higher performance improvement goal, an increase of 12x over the Cray-2.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{stated that}} it wished to run up to four multichannels at {{different}} times of the day or alternatively offer an HDTV service. It claimed that up to $100 million <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> prepare for these services, half of which would need to be government-funded. Other interested parties, such as internet service provider OzEmail argued for the provision of spectrum for interactive services, while Telstra, shareholder in the subscription television provider Foxtel, supported ASTRA's argument for a competitive bidding process for digital spectrum.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Interior Department's {{rejection}} of the overall Rampart Dam project, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continued its engineering feasibility study on the project. That plan was completed on June 25, 1971, and it included most of the previous federal documents pertaining to the project, including the electricity market studies published by the Department of the Interior in 1965, the Fish and Wildlife study of 1964, and other studies about the economic feasibility of the project. A detailed description of potential construction methods and the overall plan for the project were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages. Because the construction season at the site is only five months, the Corps of Engineers projected that several decades <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> build the dam and associated structures.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time. Additional follow-up data was recovered {{in the spring and}} summer of 2010, but large errors in the data's astrometry led the investigating astronomers to disregard it. The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of the images and improve the images' quality. The result suggested not only that the faint object in the image was nearby the star HIP 78530, but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size. Further study <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> prove its true nature.|$|E

First Selectman Paul Brycki, hoped that the pending nomination to the National Register of Historic Places would help obtain grant money to repair the bridge. Prior to February 1999, the historic bridge was moved to a vacant parking lot near the town hall and a replacement bridge was installed. The bridge was also {{on the state of}} Connecticut's historic register list.|$|E
