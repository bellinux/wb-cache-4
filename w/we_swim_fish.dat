40|$|Comparisons of the {{behavior}} of herring (Clupea harengus L.) were made in the light and dark by means of an infra-red sensitive TV system and video recording. Herring which were schooling in the light became less active in the dark, their swimming speed decreased, they tended to disperse and the proportion of gliding compared with <b>swimming</b> <b>fish</b> increased. Herring which were not schooling in the light increased their swimming speed in the dark. When subjected to transient sound stimuli herring made fast-startle responses. The proportion of fish responding was lower in the dark. The directionality of the response (the proportion turning away from the sound source) was the same in the light and dark suggesting there was no visual component to the response. The proportion of <b>swimming</b> and gliding <b>fish</b> affected both response rate and directionality. Gliding fish tended to have a higher response rate and better directionality than <b>swimming</b> <b>fish,</b> although this depended on the conditions of the experiment. The configuration of the body of <b>swimming</b> <b>fish</b> at the onset of a transient sound stimulus was important. Of the <b>swimming</b> <b>fish,</b> over 80...|$|R

40|$|A {{self-propelled}} <b>swimming</b> <b>fish</b> {{model is}} established, which can reflect {{the interaction between}} fish movement, internal force generated by muscle contraction, and the external force provided by fluid. Using finite element immersed boundary method combined with traditional feedback force method, the self-propelled <b>swimming</b> <b>fish</b> is numerically simulated. Firstly, a self-induced vibration of a cantilever beam immersed in a fluid {{is one of the}} benchmarks of fluid-structure interaction, which is used to verify the validity of the numerical method. Secondly, start and cruise process of a single <b>swimming</b> <b>fish</b> in a straight-line swimming state is simulated and analysis of the flow characteristics and fish body movement features is done. The results reveal that the fish gain energy from flow field by the conversion of “C” type and “S” type of fish body...|$|R
