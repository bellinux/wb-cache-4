40|$|The {{prevalence}} of vinyl nail-on {{windows in the}} North American new home construction market has prompted ASTM International to write ASTM E 2112 - 01 "Standard Practice for Installation of Exterior Windows, Doors and Skylights". This thesis focuses on the window jamb flashing recommendation in ASTM E 2112 - 01 for vinyl nail-on windows by asking {{the question of whether}} a vinyl window's integral nail-on flange is by itself an adequate jamb flashing. To answer this question, the Jamb Drip Test was designed and completed on fourteen (14) window/wall details. The answer to the question depends on the window/wall construction sequence. When the weather resistant barrier (WRB) is installed prior to the window, it isn't. When the WRB is installed after the window, the nail-on fin is by itself an adequate jamb flashing. Based on this Jamb Drip Test study, a recommended window/wall construction sequence of sheathing- flashing (sill, jamb and head) - vinyl nail-on window - WRB - siding option is proposed. This sequence recognizes that while the nail-on fin may be an adequate jamb flashing, without flashing, the designer cannot take full advantage of the symbiotic relationship between the nail-on flange and the space it creates between the adjoining building elements (e. g. sheathing and the WRB). In this capacity, jamb flashing is added to the construction sequence to protect the sheathing from wetting and aid in directing incidental water to the exterior. Based on this proposed construction sequence, effort was focused on improving the present state of the art window/wall weatherproofing detail. An alternative to the use of high performance sealant to create the seal between the flashing and the window's nail-on flange is proposed. The present recommendation uses a(cont.) one-piece folded sheet that envelops the window flange, WRB {{and at the same time}} incorporates the <b>window</b> <b>flashing</b> function. This novel, dual function (window seal + <b>window</b> <b>flashing</b> system) product is called w-Flashing. The thesis ends with a description of w-Flashing's performance attributes, prototype design and recommended installation sequence around a vinyl nail-on window. by Austin Parsons. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Protection of {{interface}} at {{windows and}} other penetrations from rainwater intrusion {{is a primary}} need of building structures. This is especially true when the building is in a high weather exposure location or in {{a climate in which}} the ability for walls to dry may be limited. Two areas of specific concern are: 1) the bottom corners of windows where damage is most commonly seen, and 2) the area around curved, arched or round-top windows where it is difficult to install the standard flashing materials. This paper reviews performance testing of <b>window</b> <b>flashing</b> installation methods commonly used in the trade, as well as improved methods made possible by recent advancements in flashing products. A series of laboratory tests were designed to determine water resistance, air leakage resistance and durability of several installation methods with different flashing materials. Windows were installed in test wall sections using several methods. The installations were monitored and evaluated for ease of installation and then tested for air leakage and water resistance using ASTM E 283 and ASTM E 331. The durability of the installations was then evaluated by subjecting the walls to thermal cycling (0 to 160 oF) and retesting for water resistance using ASTM E 331. Recommendations for best practice installation based on the testing results and key material selection issues are presented...|$|E

25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock razor wire fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). Walkie talkie announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels around the back of the warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders walk through a dimly lit corridor, with four shotguns hanging from the ceiling. The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the Rack from Saw III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be seen and heard on TV monitors up the stairs to the station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first Saw), before the queue goes into the station.

40|$|Abstract — A digital PWM voltage mode {{controller}} {{integrated circuit}} (IC) for high-frequency dc-dc switching converters achieving virtually minimum possible, i. e. optimum, output voltage deviation to load transients is introduced. The IC is implemented with simple hardware, requiring small silicon area, and {{can operate as}} a single-phase or a two-phase controller. To minimize the area and eliminate known mode transition problems of the optimal response controllers, two novel blocks are combined. Namely, an asynchronous track-and-hold analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a “large-small ” signal compensator are implemented. The ADC utilizes a pre-amplifier and only four comparators having approximately eight times smaller silicon area and power consumption than an equivalent <b>windowed</b> <b>flash</b> architecture. The “large-small ” signal compensator consists of two parts, a digital PID minimizing small variations and a zero-current detection-based compensator suppressing large load transients. The large-signal compensator requires no extra calculations and has a low sensitivity to parameter variations. It utilizes a synchronization algorithm and the PID calculation results to obtain a bumpless mode transition and stable response to successive load transients. The IC occupying only 0. 26 mm 2 silicon area is implemented in a CMOS 0. 18 µm process and its minimum deviation response is verified with a single and dual-phase 12 V-to- 1. 8 V, 500 kHz 60 / 120 W buck converter.

40|$|Most {{building}} {{professionals have}} investigated or performed remedial designs {{for at least}} one architectural or engineering system failure during their careers. Other practitioners, especially those who work for forensic consultants or firms specializing in disaster response and repair, are more familiar with the variety and extent of building failures as they assist their clients in restoring damaged or deficient buildings. The advent of social medial and twenty-four-hour news channels along with the general ease of finding more examples of failures in the Internet have made us realize that building failures in the broad sense are much more common than we may have realized. Relatively recent events leading to building failures such as the Christchurch, New Zealand earthquakes, the roof/parking deck of the Algo Centre mall in the northern Ontario, Canada city of Elliot Lake and the Indiana State Fairground stage collapse in the US are just a few reminders that much more work needs to be done on a variety of fronts to prevent building failures from a life safety standpoint. The need is compounded by economic concerns from what would be considered more mundane or common failures.
