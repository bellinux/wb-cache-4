5|$|Apollonius {{problem is}} to {{construct}} one or more circles tangent to three given objects in a plane, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> circles, points, or lines. This gives rise to ten types of Apollonius' problem, one corresponding to each combination of circles, lines and points, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> labeled with three letters, either C, L, or P, to denote whether the given elements are a circle, line or point, respectively (Table 1). As an example, the type of Apollonius problem with a given circle, line, and point is denoted as CLP.|$|E

Another similar species is R.haematinus, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> distinguished by its yellower stem and cap colors that are various shades of brown. Its darker cap and lack of reticulation on the stipe differentiate it from R. satanas.|$|E

5|$|As in all insects, {{the body}} {{is divided into three}} sections: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The thorax is {{composed}} of three segments, each with a pair of legs. In most families of butterfly the antennae are clubbed, unlike those of moths <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> threadlike or feathery.
