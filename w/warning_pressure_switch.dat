Industrial <b>pressure</b> <b>switches</b> may have a calibrated scale and pointer to show the set point of the <b>switch.</b> A <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> will have a differential range around its setpoint in which small changes of pressure do not change {{the state of the}} contacts.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the design of {{pneumatic}} <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> with adjustable hysteresis. In the thesis is carried out the introduction {{in the theory of}} compressed air and research of the <b>pressure</b> <b>switches</b> at the market. Based on the gathered information and customer specification, the design draft of the <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> has been created. In the thesis are described three main parts of the prototype: transform of the pressure, adjustable hysteresis and synchronization of the microswitches. In the end of the thesis is described the testing of prototype and summary of the results...|$|R
40|$|In-place {{calibration}} of a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> {{is provided}} by a system of radially oriented flexing arms which, when rotated at a known velocity, convert the centrifugal force of the arms to a linear force along the shaft.

50|$|Turning {{the mode}} switch does not {{turn on the}} lasers. A {{recessed}} button {{on top of the}} device is tapped once to briefly turn on the lasers or tapped twice to turn the lasers on until deactivated, either by pressing a third time or by turning the mode switch to off. Additionally, an extra <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> can be plugged into the rear of the device and then placed virtually anywhere, limited only by the length of the <b>pressure</b> <b>switch's</b> cord; typically one to two feet. This <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> operates {{the same way as the}} recessed button.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> {{is a form}} of {{switch that}} closes an {{electrical}} contact when a certain set fluid pressure has been reached on its input.

50|$|Hydraulic <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>switches</b> have various uses in automobiles, for example, to warn if the engineÂ´s {{oil pressure}} falls below a safe level, or to control automatic transmission torque converter lock-up. Prior to the 1960s, a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> {{was used in}} the hydraulic braking circuit to control power to the brake lights; more recent automobiles use a switch directly activated by the brake pedal.|$|R

50|$|The pressure-sensing {{element of}} a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> may be {{arranged}} {{to respond to the}} difference of two <b>pressures.</b> Such <b>switches</b> are useful when the difference is significant, for example, to detect a clogged filter in a water supply system.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of capacitive pressure sensors and <b>pressure</b> <b>switches</b> using a 2. 4 mu m thick strain compensated heavily boron doped SiGeB diaphragm is presented. The process {{relies on the}} silicon fusion bonding of two silicon wafers to seal the pressure sensor cavity and construct the device. Both rectangular and circular type pressure sensors and <b>pressure</b> <b>switches</b> have successfully been fabricated using this process. Results are presented of a capacitive type sensor operating in the medical pressure regime (0 - 300 mmHg) with a sensitivity to pressure of 1. 5 fF/mmHg or 305 ppm/mmHg, and of a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> operating in the 3 - 8 bar pressure range and are thus suitable {{for a number of}} industrial and automotive applications. The current flowing through the switch when biased at 2 V jumps over six orders of magnitude when its two plates come in contact at a well defined pressure threshold. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|A <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>switch</b> for sensing {{fluid pressure}} contains a capsule, bellows, Bourdon tube, diaphragm or piston element that deforms or displaces proportionally to the applied pressure. The resulting motion is applied, {{either directly or}} through amplifying levers, {{to a set of}} <b>switch</b> contacts. Since <b>pressure</b> may be changing slowly and contacts should operate quickly, some kind of over-center mechanism such as a miniature snap-action switch is used to ensure quick operation of the contacts. One sensitive type of <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> uses mercury switches mounted on a Bourdon tube; the shifting weight of the mercury provides a useful over-center characteristic.|$|R

50|$|The {{charge control}} {{consists}} of a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> built into the cell, which disconnects the charging current when the internal cell pressure rises above a certain limit (usually 200 to 300 psi or 1.4 to 2.1 MPa). This prevents overcharging and damage to the cell.|$|R

5000|$|Water level sensing <b>switch</b> type - <b>Pressure</b> <b>switches</b> {{are fully}} enclosed, usually inside the pump body, making them immune to {{obstructions}} or floating debris in the sump basin. Float switches, particularly the types {{attached to the}} end of a short length of flexible electrical cable, can get tangled or obstructed, especially if the pump is prone to movement in the basin due to torque effects when starting and stopping. <b>Pressure</b> <b>switches</b> are typically factory set and not adjustable, while float switches can be adjusted in place to set the high and low water levels in the sump basin. There is a solid state switch utilizing field-effect technology, which will turn on and off the pump through use of an internal switch and a piggyback plug.|$|R
