5|$|A {{declaration}} is only {{as effective}} as the willingness of a public body to abide by the court's statement of the law in it, as it is not a contempt of court to ignore a declaration. In Webster v. Southwark London Borough Council (1982), Webster was a parliamentary candidate for the National Front, a far right racial nationalist political party, who wanted to hold an election meeting in a hall owned by Southwark London Borough Council. Despite being required by provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1949 to permit Webster to use the hall, the local council refused to do so as it did not agree with Webster's political views. The court made a declaration that Webster was legally entitled to use the hall at a certain time for the purpose of his election campaign, {{on the assumption that the}} local council would obey it. Nonetheless, the local council still refused to allow Webster use of the hall. It was held that a declaration is not a coercive order of the court and, accordingly, refusal to comply <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not contempt.|$|E
5|$|Statutes {{are written}} laws {{enacted by the}} Singapore Parliament, {{as well as by}} other bodies such as the British Parliament, Governor-General of India in Council and Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements, which had power to pass laws for Singapore in the past. Statutes enacted by these other bodies may still be in force if they have not been repealed. One {{particularly}} important statute is the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, which is the supreme law of Singapore. Any law the Legislature enacts after the commencement of the Constitution that is inconsistent <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> to the extent of the inconsistency, void. Statutes of the Singapore Parliament, as well as English statutes in force in Singapore by virtue of the Application of English Law Act 1993, are published in looseleaf form in a series called the Statutes of the Republic of Singapore, which is gathered in red binders, and are also accessible on-line from , a free service provided by the Attorney-General's Chambers of Singapore.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately, the {{military}} history of Greece {{between the end}} of the second Persian invasion of Greece and the Peloponnesian War (479431 BC) is poorly attested by surviving ancient sources. This period, sometimes referred to as the pentekontaetia by ancient scholars, was a period of relative peace and prosperity within Greece. The richest source for the period, and also the most contemporary <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> Thucydides's History of the Peloponnesian War, which is generally considered by modern historians to be a reliable primary account. Thucydides only mentions this period in a digression on the growth of Athenian power in the run up to the Peloponnesian War, and the account is brief, probably selective and lacks any dates. Nevertheless, Thucydides's account can be, and is used by historians to draw up a skeleton chronology for the period, on to which details from archaeological records and other writers can be superimposed.|$|E
5|$|While the {{electromagnetic}} field {{together with the}} gravitational field are the only classical fields providing accurate descriptions of nature, other types of classical fields are important too. In the approach to quantum field theory (QFT) referred to as second quantization, the starting point is one or more classical fields, where e.g. the wave functions solving the Dirac equation are considered as classical fields prior to (second) quantization. While second quantization and the Lagrangian formalism associated <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not a fundamental aspect of QFT, {{it is the case}} that so far all quantum field theories can be approached this way, including the standard model. In these cases, there are classical versions of the field equations following from the Euler–Lagrange equations derived from the Lagrangian using the principle of least action. These field equations must be relativistically invariant, and their solutions (which will qualify as relativistic wave functions according to the definition below) must transform under some representation of the Lorentz group.|$|E

In a real vector space the Hodge dual relates a {{subspace}} to its orthogonal complement, so if a bivector {{is represented by}} a plane then the axial vector associated <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> simply the plane's surface normal. The plane has two normals, one on each side, giving the two possible orientations for the plane and bivector.|$|E

25|$|Another {{way to deal}} <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{to allow}} that {{experiments}} with processes of heat transfer to or from the system {{may be used to}} justify the formula (1) above.

This way does not provide theoretical purity in terms of adiabatic work processes, but is empirically feasible, and is in accord with experiments actually done, such as the Joule experiments mentioned just above, and with older traditions.|$|E

25|$|Morse code {{is used by}} some amateur radio operators, {{although}} {{knowledge of}} and proficiency <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> no longer required for licensing in most countries. Pilots and air traffic controllers usually need only a cursory understanding. Aeronautical navigational aids, such as VORs and NDBs, constantly identify in Morse code. Compared to voice, Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions, yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device. Morse is, therefore, a useful alternative to synthesized speech for sending automated data to skilled listeners on voice channels. Many amateur radio repeaters, for example, identify with Morse, {{even though they are}} used for voice communications.|$|E

25|$|The paper {{postage stamp}} itself {{was born of}} utility (in England, 1840), as {{something}} simple {{and easy to use}} was needed to confirm that postage had been paid for an item of mail. People could purchase several stamps at one time and no longer had to make a special trip to pay for postage each time an item was mailed. The postage stamp design was usually printed from a fine engraving and were almost impossible to forge adequately. This is where the appearance of presidents on stamps was introduced. Moreover, the subject theme of a president, along with the honors associated <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> what began to define the stamp issues in ways that took it beyond the physical postage stamp itself and is why people began to collect them.
