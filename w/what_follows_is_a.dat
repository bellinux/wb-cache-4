500|$|Within the six {{disability}} categories {{the athletes}} {{still need to}} be divided according to their level of impairment. [...] The classification systems differ from sport to sport. [...] The systems are designed to open up Paralympic sports to as many athletes as possible, who can participate in fair competitions against athletes with similar levels of ability. [...] The closest equivalents in able-bodied competitions are age classifications in junior sports, and weight divisions in wrestling, boxing, and weightlifting. [...] Classifications vary in accordance with the different skills required to perform the sport. [...] The biggest challenge in the classification system is how to account for the wide variety and severity of disabilities.

Kratos kills Ares {{at the behest of the}} goddess Athena and takes his place as the new God of War, but is still haunted by the nightmares of his past.

500|$|Many reviewers criticised the film's climax {{and certain}} features, {{feeling that they}} {{deviated}} from its general style. Rituparna Chatterjee of CNN-IBN noted that {{the climax of the}} film was a [...] "huge dampener" [...] and explained, [...] "The diabolic twist at that juncture got underplayed... <b>What</b> <b>follows</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sobfest... the apologetic explanation of why she does what she does. Justifying her action comes across more as an effort to appease the Indian morality". The Outlook review noted, [...] "At times, Kahaani is too clever, at others extremely pedestrian like in the depiction of computer hacking and IB operations, not to speak of the ludicrous terrorist angle and the all-too predictable Durga Puja setting for that mythology tie-in." [...] It adds that the [...] "spoon-feeding" [...] of reasons at the end dampens the intrigue factor. The review in Yahoo! India comments that the Durga metaphor at the end was enforced, and that the film over-indulged in Bengali stereotypes. Gautaman Bhaskaran, in his review in Gulf Times, noted that the sometimes-handheld photography was [...] "as irksome as the plot with a sleuth too many and cops galore." ...|$|E
