50|$|Generally, {{use of a}} <b>work</b> <b>to</b> {{comment on}} the work itself somehow will qualify as transformative. Quoting {{portions}} of a <b>work</b> <b>to</b> criticize it, as in a book review, is transformative. Likewise, parody is transformative — repurposing a <b>work</b> <b>to</b> mock the <b>work</b> itself or the principles the work represents serves a very different purpose {{from that of the}} original work.|$|R

5|$|Although Watts {{received}} many offers {{to buy the}} painting, he had agreed to donate his most important <b>works</b> <b>to</b> the nation and felt {{it would be inappropriate}} not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.|$|E
5|$|Andjar's toneels were {{generally}} based on day-to-day experiences, {{rather than the}} tales of princes and ancient wars which were standard at the time. Regarding Andjar's toneels, the Indonesian literary critic Bakri Siregar writes that Andjar's stage plays, {{as well as those}} of fellow dramatist Njoo Cheong Seng, revitalised the genre and made the works more realistic. However, he considered the conflict in these <b>works</b> <b>to</b> have been poorly developed. Andjar believed that the Padangsche Opera's performances influenced other troupes in West Sumatra to adapt the toneel format, which later spread throughout the Indies.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} gender differences among profiles based on life role importance on work-family conflict. The {{sample consisted of}} 404 Indonesia working couples with children.

More men than women belonged <b>to</b> the <b>Work</b> profile and Low profile; {{more women than men}} belonged to the Family profile. There was no difference between men and women in Dual profile. There were differences among the four profiles on <b>Work</b> <b>to</b> Family and Family <b>to</b> <b>Work</b> conflicts. Men in the Dual profile experienced the least <b>Work</b> <b>to</b> Family and Family <b>to</b> <b>Work</b> conflicts. Men in the Low profile group experienced the most <b>Work</b> <b>to</b> Family and Family <b>to</b> <b>Work</b> conflicts. There were no differences in <b>Work</b> <b>to</b> Family conflict among women in the four profile groups. Women in the Dual profile experienced the least Family <b>to</b> <b>Work</b> conflicts. Women in the Low profile experienced the most Family <b>to</b> <b>Work</b> conflicts. Limitations and future research are discussed in the light of these findings...|$|R
