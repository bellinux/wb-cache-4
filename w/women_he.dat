5|$|Another {{difference}} in Troilus' characterisation from the Filostrato {{is that he}} is no longer misogynistic in the beginning. Instead of mocking lovers because of their putting trust in <b>women,</b> <b>he</b> mocks them because of how love affects them. Troilus' vision of love is stark: total commitment offers total fulfilment; any form of failure means total rejection. He is unable to comprehend the subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E
5|$|As a rationalist and ardent social reformer, Periyar {{advocated}} forcefully {{throughout his}} life that women should be given their legitimate position in society as the equals of men {{and that they should}} be given good education and have the right to property.

During filming, Truffaut used his free time to write the script for The Man Who Loved <b>Women.</b> <b>He</b> also worked on a novel titled The Actor, a project he abandoned.|$|E

5|$|As a senator, Walker {{devoted his}} support {{to a variety}} of causes, {{including}} a transcontinental railway and equal pay for <b>women.</b> <b>He</b> opposed a federal old-age pension scheme on the grounds of lack of funds, and also opposed the Immigration Restriction Bill, although he supported the White Australia policy in principle. He opposed the proposed form of the dictation test and supported James Macfarlane's amendment requiring the test to be administered in a language known to the immigrant, moving his own amendment after Macfarlane's was defeated. He also expressed reservations about the deportation of Kanaka labourers, supporting the reduction in their use but advocating that those resident in Australia {{for at least five years}} be permitted to remain. He vigorously opposed compulsory arbitration, and voted against the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.|$|E
5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended to all of mankind equally. Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing {{an active role in the}} leadership of the church, and provides a list of <b>women</b> <b>he</b> considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.|$|E

5|$|In 2017, Douglas Stenton, {{director}} for heritage in the Nunavut territory in north eastern Canada, suggested that {{four sets of}} European human remains found could possibly be <b>women.</b> <b>He</b> initially suspected that DNA testing would not offer up anything more, but to his surprise they registered {{that there was no}} 'Y' chromosomal element to the DNA. Stenton acknowledged that women were known to have served in the Royal Navy in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, but he also pointed out that {{it could be that the}} DNA had simply degraded as further tests proved ambiguous. Stenton also stated that whilst the probability of four disguised women aboard the two ships was very, very low; he could not rule it out completely.|$|E

5|$|Shepard was {{assigned}} to Fighter Squadron 42 (VF-42), flying the Vought F4U Corsair. The squadron was nominally based on the aircraft carrier , but the ship was being overhauled at the time Shepard arrived, {{and in the meantime}} the squadron was based at Naval Air Station Norfolk in Virginia. He departed on his first cruise, of the Caribbean, on Franklin D. Roosevelt with VF-42 in 1948. Most of the aviators were, like Shepard, on their first assignment. Those that were not were given the opportunity to qualify for night landings on a carrier, a dangerous maneuver, especially in a Corsair, which had to bank sharply on approach. Shepard managed to persuade his squadron commander to allow him to qualify as well. After briefly returning to Norfolk, the carrier set out on a nine-month tour of the Mediterranean Sea. He earned a reputation for carousing and chasing <b>women.</b> <b>He</b> also instituted a ritual of, whenever he could, calling Louise at 17:00 (her time) each day.|$|E
5|$|Stanton's {{position}} {{caused a}} significant rift {{between herself and}} many civil rights leaders, particularly Frederick Douglass, who believed that white women, already empowered by their connection to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. According to Douglass, their treatment as slaves entitled the now liberated African American men, who lacked women's indirect empowerment, to voting rights before women were granted the franchise. African American <b>women,</b> <b>he</b> believed, {{would have the same}} degree of empowerment as white women once African American men had the vote; hence, general female suffrage was, according to Douglass, of less concern than black male suffrage.|$|E

Omar Little continues to rob the Barksdale organization wherever possible. Working with his new boyfriend Dante and two <b>women,</b> <b>he</b> is once more a serious problem. The violence related to the drug trade makes it an obvious choice of investigation for Cedric Daniels' permanently established Major Crimes Unit.|$|E

Ben Ata is not used to the company of <b>women</b> <b>he</b> cannot control, and Al•Ith has difficulty relating to this ill-bred man, but in time they grow accustomed to each other and gain new insights into each other's Zones. Al•Ith is appalled that all of Zone Four's wealth goes into its huge armies, leaving the rest of its population poor and underdeveloped; Ben Ata is astounded that Zone Three has no army at all.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his first}} {{marriage}} he {{had a number of}} affairs with other <b>women.</b> <b>He</b> had no children, having been rendered sterile by radiation treatment, but in the 1950s offered to adopt his brother Paul's two children, Denise and George, when their parents were experiencing trouble in their relationship. Paul declined the offer, with Denise and George later noting that they had no great affection for Hergé, deeming him awkward around children. Hergé was raised as a Catholic although was never a devout practitioner of the religion. His adherence to Catholicism declined in later life as he developed a keen interest in Taoism, and became an agnostic. He was a fan of the Tao Te Ching and Arnaud Desjardins' The Path to Wisdom, as well as Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics and the work of Jean-Émile Charon.|$|E
