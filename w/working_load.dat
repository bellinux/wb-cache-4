5|$|Dispatch {{is notable}} {{for its use}} of, and the sole {{surviving}} remains of, Fell's Patent Knees. These were a patent innovation from 1839 by Jonathan Fell of Workington, Cumberland, and {{were part of the}} development of the iron and wood composite hull. Ships before this had been built from oak, where the strong curved brackets needed to join the deck into the hull side frames could be found as naturally grown 'knees' from the angles between major branches and the trunk. In the post-Nelsonic era there was a general shortage of shipbuilding timber, particularly oak, one of the few species with strong enough branch attachments to provide knees. Dispatch's hull is of pine, which has weak branches. A number of iron substitutes were developed, Fell's design being one of the later and more advanced forms. It had two advantages over earlier rigid-forged patterns: it provided a degree of flexibility in storms and, most significantly, could be stressed after the hull had been constructed and launched or even loaded, when the hull was under its <b>working</b> <b>load.</b> Together with the diagonal iron strapping, this rendered Dispatch's hull particularly strong and had allowed her to endure at least two collisions.|$|E

To get <b>working</b> <b>loads</b> for {{analysis}} of strength safety of well testing tubing strings, providing references to combine tubing strings and select operation parameters, the <b>working</b> <b>loads</b> of tubing string were measured by self-made load measurement device for down-hole tubular strings and the stresses of tubing strings with measured load were analyzed with ANSYS. The dynamic response and strength of tubing strings exerted by varied pressures and weight were analyzed, taking wellhead and packer as fixed constraints. It {{was found that the}} maximum stress would vary sharply around the baseline with radial acceleration and increase as much as 37 % if the acceleration is 0. 38 g...|$|R
40|$|If the {{usefulness}} of a structure depends on the working stresses produced at <b>working</b> <b>loads,</b> then these stresses should be checked.

She has a 60-foot (18.3-meter) telescopic boom with a lifting capacity of 6,250 pounds (2,835 kg) aft and a 23-foot (7-meter) fixed boom with a lifting capacity of 1,000 pounds (454kg) at her bow.

The oceanographic winch and large after A-frame work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while the two hydrographic winches work with the side A-frame to service her side sampling station, and the two hydrographic winches together give Oscar Dyson the capability to have two scientific packages ready for sequential operations. In addition to trawling, her sampling stations can deploy smaller sampling nets, longlines, and fish traps. The hydrographic winches can deploy CTD instruments to measure the electrical conductivity, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence of sea water. Oscar Dyson also can deploy specialized gear such as Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) frames, towed vehicles, dredges, and bottom corers, and she can deploy and recover both floating and bottom-moored sensor arrays.|$|E

30|$|A complex part often works under multi-condition, {{of which}} the types, directions, magnitude, {{locations}} and numbers of <b>working</b> <b>loads</b> will vary correspondingly during operation. Theoretically, the <b>working</b> <b>loads</b> should be calculated using the load spectrum, however, the actual load spectrum is often unknown. Therefore, the <b>working</b> <b>loads</b> of multi-condition is weighted equivalent performed based on dangerous conditions, typical conditions and the working frequency. The constraints on the connection surfaces constrain the motion and deformation of a part called degree of freedom constraint and stiffness constraint respectively. According to the types of connection, the mobility constraints are classified into movable connection and stable connection constraints [24]. Furthermore, the stiffness characteristics of a part are difficult to accurately solve due to plenty of affecting factors. Therefore, {{it is important that}} the constrained degree of freedom and stiffness equivalent rules are simplified to establish constraint equivalent models for simulating the effect of the motion and deformation. The degree of freedom equivalent rule is to determine the number and direction of the constrained motion based on the type of connection. The stiffness equivalent rule is to equal the stiffness characteristic of actual joint surface by using spring equivalent and contact equivalent method.|$|R

40|$|Most brain-based {{measures}} of the electroencephalogram (EEG) are used in highly controlled lab environments and only focus on narrow mental states (e. g., <b>working</b> memory <b>load).</b> However, we assume that outside the lab complex multidimensional mental states are evoked. This could potentially create interference between EEG signatures used for identification of specific mental states. In this study, we aimed to investigate more realistic conditions and therefore induced a combination of <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> and affective valence to reveal potential interferences in EEG measures. To induce changes in <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> and affective valence, we used a paradigm which combines an N-back task (for <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> manipulation) with a standard method to induce affect (affective pictures taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database). Subjective ratings showed that the experimental task was successful in inducing <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> as well as affective valence. Additionally, performance measures were analyzed and {{it was found that}} behavioral performance decreased with increasing workload as well as negative valence, showing that affective valence can have an effect on cognitive processing. These findings are supported by changes in frontal theta and parietal alpha power, parameters used for measuring of <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> in the EEG. However, these EEG measures are influenced by the negative valence condition as well and thereby show that detection of <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> is sensitive to affective contexts. Unexpectedly, we did not find any effects for EEG measures typically used for affective valence detection (Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)). Therefore we assume that the FAA measure might not be usable if cognitive workload is induced simultaneously. We conclude that future studies should account for potential context-specifity of EEG measures...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive {{overload}} or underload {{results in}} a decrease in human performance which may result in fatal incidents while driving. We envision that driver assistive systems which adapt their functionality to the driver’s cognitive state could be a promising approach to reduce road accidents due to human errors. This research attempts to predict variations of cognitive <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> levels in a natural driving scenario with multiple parallel tasks and to reveal predictive brain areas. We used {{a modified version of}} the n-back task to induce five different <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> levels (from 0 -back up to 4 -back) forcing the participants to continuously update, memorize, and recall the previous ‘n’ speed sequences and adjust their speed accordingly while they drove for approximately 60 min on a highway with concurrent traffic in a virtual reality driving simulator. We measured brain activation using multichannel whole head, high density functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and predicted <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> level from the fNIRS data by combining multivariate lasso regression and cross-validation. This allowed us to predict variations in <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> in a continuous time-resolved manner with mean Pearson correlations between induced and predicted <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> over 15 participants of 0. 61 [standard error (SE) 0. 04] and a maximum of 0. 8.

Moreover, <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> predictions derived from peripheral heart rate parameters achieved much lower correlations (mean 0. 21, SE 0. 1). Importantly, whole head fNIRS sampling revealed increasing brain activation in bilateral inferior frontal and bilateral temporo-occipital brain areas with increasing <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> levels suggesting that these areas are specifically involved in workload-related processing...|$|R
