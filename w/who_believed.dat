5|$|Since {{the days}} of the Constituent Assembly in 1823, and with renewed vigor in 1826 {{with the opening of the}} General Assembly (the Brazilian parliament), there had been an ideological {{struggle}} over the balance of powers wielded by the emperor and legislature in governance. On one side were those who shared PedroI's views, politicians <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> that the monarch should be free to choose ministers, national policies and the direction of government. In opposition were those, then known as the Liberal Party, <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> that cabinets should have the power to set the government's course and should consist of deputies drawn from the majority party who were accountable to the parliament. Strictly speaking, both the party that supported PedroI's government and the Liberal Party advocated Liberalism, and thus constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Amin Hajee as Bagha (batsman), {{the mute}} drummer. Hajee earlier {{worked in a}} film with Ashutosh. The {{friendly}} association brought Ashutosh to him with the script, which he liked, and thereafter he successfully auditioned for his role. His knowledge of mute people and some assistance from a music band helped him better prepare for his role. Ashutosh, <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> that Amin was like Sylvester Stallone, would refer to him as Stallone during filming.|$|E

5|$|An {{experienced}} right-handed opening batsman, Brown was on {{his third}} campaign in England, having first toured in 1934 before the World War II. However, Brown's best years were lost to the war and by 1948, Barnes and Morris had risen above him in the pecking order and become Australia's first-choice opening pair. Brown {{was selected as the}} reserve opener, a decision that generated controversy among pundits <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> he was past his best.|$|E

5|$|Baggio was {{controversially}} {{excluded from}} Italy's 2002 World Cup squad by coach Giovanni Trapattoni, <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> him {{to not have}} fully recovered from the serious injury he had sustained during the season. Although he was initially keen to include Baggio in the final 23-man list, he ultimately excluded him from the squad; Baggio had made a direct appeal to him prior to the tournament by writing him a letter. Fans and pundits criticised the omission, as Italy were eliminated by co-hosts South Korea in the round of 16.|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{interest}} and public pressure for greater air pollution regulation had existed since {{the signing of}} the 1963 Clean Air Act, the first federal legislation on the issue, but further action had been opposed by members of Congress <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> responsibility for air regulation properly lay with the states, not the federal government. Partly in response to the added public pressure spurred by the smog event, Congress passed and Johnson signed the 1967 Air Quality Act, which amended the 1963 Clean Air Act to provide for study of air quality and control methods.|$|E
5|$|During {{the voyage}} to England the team {{conducted}} training drills on the ship's deck; for this the forwards were coached by Gallaher and fellow player Bill Cunningham, while Stead {{was in charge}} of the backs. Consequently, the services of the NZRFU-appointed coach Jimmy Duncan were not used; his appointment had caused opposition from many in the squad <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> his expertise was not required, and that an extra player should have been taken on tour instead. After a six-week voyage, the team arrived in Plymouth, England on 8September 1905.|$|E

50|$|Members of the Gay Christian Network have {{expressed}} {{a wide variety}} of opinions concerning gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender life and how it should be lived from a Christian perspective. For instance, the site is committed to being a safe haven both for members <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> it is okay for gay Christians to enter into healthy, committed relationships (including sex) and for those <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> that the Bible prohibits such behavior and requires chastity. On the site, these two positions have been nicknamed Side A, i.e., those members <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> that homosexual activity is not sinful, and Side B, i.e., those <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> that God does love gay people but does not accept homosexual activity.|$|R

5|$|Each team progressed {{through four}} rounds {{to reach the}} final. Manchester City were a First Division team chasing a league and cup double; Bolton Wanderers were a mid-table Second Division team. Consequently, most {{observers}} anticipated a Manchester City win.

The goal, scored by Billy Meredith, was disputed by those with Bolton sympathies, <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> Meredith to be offside. The victory gave Manchester City their first major honour.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{have been}} the subject of {{religious}} beliefs. The Mbuti people of central Africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants. Similar ideas existed among other African tribes, <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> that their chiefs would be reincarnated as elephants. During the 10th century AD, the people of Igbo-Ukwu, near the Niger Delta, buried their leaders with elephant tusks. The animals' religious importance is only totemic in Africa but is much more significant in Asia. In Sumatra, elephants have been associated with lightning. Likewise in Hinduism, they are linked with thunderstorms as Airavata, the father of all elephants, represents both lightning and rainbows. One of the most important Hindu deities, the elephant-headed Ganesha, is ranked equal with the supreme gods Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. Ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can give people success as well as grant them their desires. In Buddhism, Buddha is said to have been a white elephant reincarnated as a human. In Islamic tradition, the year 570 when Muhammad was born is known as the Year of the Elephant. Elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the Romans, <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> that they worshipped the sun and stars.|$|E

The team's decision to draft Hester was initially criticized by fans and sports analysts, <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> the Bears should have spent their early picks on offensive prospects.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the speeches, there are fifty-six prologues (openings of speeches). They were collected for the Library of Alexandria by Callimachus, <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> them genuine.
