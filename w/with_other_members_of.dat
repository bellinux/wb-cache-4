5|$|Calostoma cinnabarinums {{physical}} dissimilarity to {{many other}} species in Boletales corresponds to {{a higher rate of}} genetic drift than average for the order. This trait is shared <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the Sclerodermatineae, which as a group have undergone more rapid evolutionary change than the order as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In common <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the {{superorder}} Holometabola, Lepidoptera undergo complete metamorphosis, {{going through}} a four-stage life cycle: egg, larva / caterpillar, pupa / chrysalis, and imago (plural:imagines) / adult.|$|E

5|$|Brunner {{returned}} {{to the mouth of}} the Buller River in March 1861 but this time aboard a ship. Working in much greater comfort than on his last visit to the area in 1848, <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> his staff he surveyed and laid out sections for what would become the town of Westport. Later that month he did the same for Greymouth. The work was soon completed and the party {{returned to}} Nelson in April 1861.|$|E
5|$|Found in dry sclerophyll {{forest on}} sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soils, P.linearis {{is adapted to}} a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires. The fruit are {{consumed}} by vertebrates such as kangaroo, possums and currawongs. As <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the genus, P.linearis is rare in cultivation as {{it is very hard}} to propagate, either by seed or cuttings. It adapts readily to cultivation, preferring acidic soils with good drainage and at least a partly sunny aspect.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{nomenclature}} {{has been}} established by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for each known human gene {{in the form of}} an approved gene name and symbol (short-form abbreviation), which can be accessed through a database maintained by HGNC. Symbols are chosen to be unique, and each gene has only one symbol (although approved symbols sometimes change). Symbols are preferably kept consistent <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> a gene family and with homologs in other species, particularly the mouse due to its role as a common model organism.|$|E

A week later Jim Gannon returned to Edgeley Park for a third spell as manager, following a successful period at Northwich Victoria.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the Eurasian sparrowhawk.

5|$|The {{player is}} usually {{accompanied}} {{by one or}} more friendly non-player characters, who will follow the player and provide assistance in combat against enemies. As they are often key to the story, friendly characters must not be killed in combat except during scripted events. In between combat missions, the player can move around the USS Voyager and interact <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> its crew, often performing non-combat tasks to progress the story.|$|E
5|$|The up-down {{display is}} used {{for a number of}} {{interactions}} <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the species. Here a stork positions its body horizontally and quickly bobs its head up from down-facing to around 30 degrees above horizontal and back again, while displaying the white segments of its plumage prominently, and this is repeated several times. The display is used as a greeting between birds, and—more vigorously—as a threat display. The species' solitary nature means that this threat display is rarely witnessed.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the Eleonora's falcon, and eggs and young may be taken by terrestrial predators including stoats and snakes. As <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> its genus, the water pipit is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. Eggs of cuckoos that specialise in parasitising pipits are similar in appearance to those of their hosts.|$|E

5|$|Although in {{some areas}} the marsh shrew is {{sympatric}} <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the genus Sorex, no other large, velvety, gray-black shrew shares this geographic range. Its size distinguishes it from all but the American water shrew (Sorex palustris). Although the marsh shrew and the American water shrew (the two largest shrews in North America) share some features, the American water shrew has more dark-grey-to-black fur on its back, a silver-grey belly and a bi-colored tail and the marsh shrew's fringed hairs are more distinct. The American water shrew has a smaller skull, without the marsh shrew's characteristic curvature, and its upper incisors have less-distinct medial tines. The marsh shrew typically has a longer snout {{than that of the}} American water shrew, which is more streamlined when viewed from the side.|$|E
5|$|An aggressive, {{powerful}} apex predator, the {{silvertip shark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of bony fishes, as well as eagle rays, smaller sharks, and cephalopods. This species dominates other requiem sharks of equal size when competing for food, and larger individuals are often heavily scarred from conflicts with others of its species. As <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> its family, the silvertip shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to one to 11 pups in the summer. Silvertip sharks are regarded as potentially dangerous to humans, as they often approach divers quite closely. This slow-reproducing species is taken by commercial fisheries for its meat, fins, skin, cartilage, and jaws and teeth, which has apparently led to local population declines or extirpations.|$|E
