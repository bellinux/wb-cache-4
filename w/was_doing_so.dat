5|$|Two years later, {{the two had}} a major {{argument}} over the country's budget, as Banza adamantly opposed Bokassa's extravagant spending. Bokassa moved to Camp de Roux, where he felt he could safely run the government without {{having to worry about}} Banza's thirst for power. In the meantime, Banza tried to obtain a support base within the army, spending much of his time in the company of soldiers. Bokassa recognized what his minister <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>so</b> he sent military units most sympathetic to Banza to the country's border and brought his own army supporters as close to the capital as possible. In September 1967, he took a special trip to Paris, where he asked for protection from French troops. Two months later, the government deployed 80 paratroopers to Bangui.|$|E
5|$|Although {{suddenly}} {{very wealthy}} and successful, {{many of the}} band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Red Dog Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, then 24, {{was killed in a}} motorcycle accident one day after returning to Macon. Allman was riding his motorcycle at a high speed at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane approached. The truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so,</b> he struck either {{the back of the truck}} or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle. The motorcycle bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman pinned underneath, crushing his internal organs. Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries.|$|E

5|$|Several {{accounts}} about Murrell's {{activities have}} been preserved, {{either because they}} were reported on by the regional press or because they were passed down in oral tradition. One example focused around a rumour that had spread in nearby Canewdon which claimed that two prominent local women were malevolent witches. One of these individuals was Mary Ann Atkinson, {{the wife of the}} Reverend William Atkinson, the vicar of Canewdon. The other was Eliza Lodwick, a widow who took control of the 500 acre Lambourne Hall following the death of her husband in 1826; on two separate occasions labourers were convicted of stealing from her, while another died accidentally on her property. Locals concerned that these women were witches approached the vicar with their beliefs, but he dismissed them. They subsequently turned to Murrell, asking for his aid in exposing the women as witches. According to claims made in the 1950s by the-then 94-year-old local man Arthur Downes, the Canewdon villagers believed that Murrell could force all of the witches to assemble and dance about the churchyard against their will by whistling. However, the vicar intervened, with locals believing that he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> to protect his wife. The vicar himself died in March 1847.|$|E
25|$|The pilots {{flew the}} aircraft, which can carry up to 46,860 pounds (21,255kg) of {{aviation}} fuel, in a figure eight pattern between Bob Hope Airport in Burbank and LAX {{for more than}} two hours in order to burn fuel and lower the risk of fire upon landing. This also served to lighten the plane, reducing potential stress on the landing gear and dramatically lowering landing speed as well. The Airbus A320 does not have the mechanical facility to dump fuel, despite various news agencies reporting that the aircraft <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> over the ocean.|$|E

In a study of pilot suicides from 2002-2013, eight cases were identified as definite suicides, with five additional cases of undetermined cause {{that may have been}} suicides. Investigators may also work with terrorism experts, checking for links to extremist groups to try to determine whether the suicide was an act of terrorism.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of his career, Beebe {{authored}} over 800 articles and 21 books, including his four-volume pheasant monograph. He had a total of 64 animals named after him, and himself described one new species of bird and 87 species of fish.

25|$|In May 1950, {{after the}} capture of Hainan island by Chinese {{communist}} forces, U.S. President Harry S. Truman began covertly authorizing direct financial assistance to the French, and on June 27, 1950, after {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War, announced publicly that the U.S. <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so.</b> It was feared in Washington that if Ho were to win the war, with his ties to the Soviet Union, he would establish a puppet state with Moscow with the Soviets ultimately controlling Vietnamese affairs. The prospect of a communist-dominated Southeast Asia was enough to spur the U.S. to support France, so that the spread of Soviet-allied communism could be contained.|$|E
25|$|The “New Continental” began {{emerging}} {{while in}} bankruptcy. With its cost structure {{in line with}} any post deregulation upstart carrier, the airline began competing effectively with legacy carriers. By May 1984, Continental was operating 83 of its 105 aircraft, which had been mostly grounded upon filing for bankruptcy. Though operating near capacity, it <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> with nearly half the 12,000 employees, on half the wages, than prior to bankruptcy. By the summer of 1984, the Lorenzo team had filled many of the positions downsized during the strike, and employment had reached 9,000 with a route system served 67 destinations. Planes were averaging a 67% load factor, amongst {{the highest in the}} industry. New Continental’s low-cost carrier strategy was beginning to bear fruit.|$|E
25|$|Around May 1834, the Melvilles {{moved to}} another house in Albany, a three-story brick house. That same month a fire {{destroyed}} Gansevoort's skin-preparing factory, which left him with personnel he could neither employ nor afford. Instead he pulled Melville {{out of the bank}} to man the cap and fur store. (Biographer Andrew Delbanco says that Gansevoort <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> well he could hire his younger brother until a fire broke out in 1835, destroying both factory and the store.) In any case, older brother Gansevoort served as a role model for Melville in various ways. In early 1834 Gansevoort had {{become a member of the}} Albany's Young Men's Association for Mutual Improvement, and in January 1835 Melville became a member as well.|$|E

25|$|Orillia {{was first}} {{assigned}} to Halifax Local Defence Force upon arrival. She served with them until 23 May 1941 {{when she was}} assigned as an original member of Newfoundland Escort Force operating out of St. John's, Newfoundland. During this time she was assigned to convoy SC 42, a slow convoy. Orillia {{was part of an}} escort group that included the destroyer HMCS Skeena, and corvettes HMCS Alberni and Kenogami. The convoy sailed directly into the path of a U-boat wolfpack of 14 u-boats. During the running battle the Orillia dropped back to pick up survivors and eventually stood by the damaged tanker Tahchee and towed her to Iceland. However the commander, Lieutenant Commander Ted Briggs, RNCR, failed to notify his senior officer that he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> for some time, depriving the convoy of one of her few escorts. Though a great humanitarian gesture this added to the mayhem within the convoy. Sixteen ships were sunk during the battle.|$|E
25|$|As Harkins and Felt {{prepared}} to leave, Diệm took Lodge aside {{for an individual}} discussion and repeatedly asked what the Americans wanted, repeating his request for 20 minutes. This was a trick on Diem's part, as the fake coup was about to start. In reference to a United Nations inquiry over his repression of the Buddhists, Diệm claimed that Buddhists had been brainwashed by the Americans. Diệm claimed he had closed the pagodas because among the students were communists about to throw grenades and perpetrate bombings during the UN visit. The president also claimed that some Americans were planning a coup against him and promised to give Lodge names. The American ambassador replied with a poker face that he was committed to removing any of his countrymen {{who were involved in}} plotting, even though he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> himself. Lodge was not taken in by Diệm, as Washington had already told Diệm what reforms were necessary, such as the removal of Nhu {{and the use of the}} special forces to fight communists rather than dissidents; Diệm had not responded to US advice. Lodge knew that the real coup was in the offing and did not want to stop it, even if Diệm's overtures were genuine.|$|E
25|$|Torishima {{is a fan}} {{of video}} games and was {{therefore}} put in charge of the first video game-related articles in Weekly Shōnen Jump, for which he brought in Yuji Horii to help. When his manager told him to figure out why CoroCoro Comic <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> well, Torishima determined {{it was because of the}} sealed pages that had to be cut opened and included cheats and tips for video games. In addition to including similar pages in Jump, they also began to rate games, something new at the time, with the resulting content being voted third in the magazine's reader polls. This was the birth of , the video game section of Weekly Shōnen Jump issues. After finding success with video game articles and wanting to show readers of Jump how one is developed, the magazine decided to develop their own role-playing game like Ultima so that they would have exclusive coverage of it. He decided to have Horii, who had begun working at Enix, write the scenario and Toriyama design the characters. Torishima claimed that he purposefully had Enix fully fund the game, intentionally keeping Shueisha out of the decision making process for the good of the product while still reserving the option to create a manga based on it and not pay any royalties. The video game was Dragon Quest.|$|E

500|$|Mandated by {{the results}} of the 1953 referendum, Federation began later that year with Southern Rhodesia, the most {{developed}} of the three territories, at its head.

500|$|Until the 1990s, the Act and its {{application}} to medical residents were not an issue. Many hospitals assessed and paid FICA taxes {{on behalf of their}} employees. The University of Minnesota's hospitals did not, however, and in the early 1990s, the Social Security Administration sued to recover a small portion of those taxes. An initial administrative review ruled for the Social Security Administration, but the district court reversed. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision after granting a de novo review, and the University recovered $40 million. A number of other residency programs quickly filed lawsuits, attempting to recoup the taxes they had paid. After some of those programs were successful in other circuit courts, the Treasury agreed to repay the taxes it had collected. However, it also promulgated a new regulation to take effect in April 2005 that stated that any full-time employee, which includes nearly all medical residents, were ineligible to receive the student exemption, clearly stating that it <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> to [...] "overturn court rulings that had upheld the view that residents remained students".|$|E
