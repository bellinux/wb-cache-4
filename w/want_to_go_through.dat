Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce.|$|E

He noted that the sound Stefani had cultivated with No Doubt was missing from her solo work. Stefani, preoccupied with her baby Kingston Rossdale, cancelled their session and commented that she [...] "didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the pain of {{trying to work with}} someone [...] didn't know".

Roger and Jane go to the party, which is hosted by Jane's therapist and her husband. After dinner, Roger asks Jane if they can leave, but Jane reminds Roger that he agreed to take LSD with the group and begs him to stay, as she doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the experience alone.

After that season, Vandersloot was asked by many people if she would consider Washington or another Pac-10 school, but decided against it after a Pac-10 assistant told Hennig she was too small. She would eventually sign with Gonzaga in November 2006, during her senior year at Kentwood; she noted in 2011, [...] "I wasn't really being highly recruited and I just didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the stressful recruiting process, so I committed early to Gonzaga." ...|$|E

She replied, [...] "Well, let's go down {{and start all over}} again," [...] and she began to take the elevator down. He said, [...] "Not down, up!"

50|$|The {{president}} of CBS {{at the time}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> with the measure but would only agree if NBC and ABC consented, citing a possible decline in ratings (the network had been #1 in U.S. households since the mid-1950s) {{if they were the}} only network to try the new policy.

2500|$|The {{cast and}} crew endured over six months of grueling six-day, 70-hour weeks on an {{isolated}} set. At one point, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on the set and on another occasion, Ed Harris burst into spontaneous sobbing while driving home. Cameron himself admitted, [...] "I knew {{this was going to}} be a hard shoot, but even I had no idea just how hard. I don't ever <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> this again". For example, for the scene where portions of the rig are flooded with water, he realized that he initially did not know how to minimize the sequence's inherent danger. It took him more than four hours to set up the shot safely. Actor Leo Burmester said, [...] "Shooting The Abyss has been the hardest thing I've ever done. Jim Cameron is the type of director who pushes you to the edge, but he doesn't make you do anything he wouldn't do himself." [...] A lightning storm caused a 200-foot (65 m) tear in the black tarpaulin covering the main tank. Repairing it would have taken too much time, so the production began shooting at night. In addition, blooming algae often reduced visibility to 20 feet (6 m) within hours. Over-chlorination led to divers' skin burning and exposed hair being stripped off or turning white.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the fifth}} series, several {{people in the}} {{entertainment}} industry, including Ronan Keating, Noel Gallagher and Graham Norton questioned Minogue's judging credentials and mentoring ability. On 22 November 2008, during a live broadcast of the programme, Minogue broke down in tears {{and was unable to}} introduce one of her acts, Rachel Hylton, following an on-air row with Louis Walsh over a choice of song. Despite the controversies, she proved popular in public votes and polls. Minogue later stated that she did not enjoy her experience on the fifth series and [...] "would never <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> that again". Minogue returned for the sixth series in 2009. She chose Rachel Adedeji, Lucie Jones and Stacey Solomon as her final three acts to compete in the live shows and was assisted at the judges' houses stage by her older sister, Kylie Minogue. Despite losing Adedeji in week 4 and Jones the following week, Solomon went on to advance into the final and ultimately finish in third place. In 2010, Minogue was pregnant. She later stated that, as her baby's expected arrival in July would clash with filming for The X Factor, she would be unable to judge in the audition episodes for the seventh series. Minogue returned during the judges' houses round, selecting Nicolo Festa, Matt Cardle and Aiden Grimshaw as her final three, with Paije Richardson as her wildcard act. Minogue was assisted by fellow Australian and friend Natalie Imbruglia who was a guest judge in Birmingham that year filling in for Minogue. Cardle was her only act to make it into the final and eventually won, with Minogue becoming the winning mentor for the second time.|$|E
2500|$|A more long-running romantic pairing was {{featured}} between Mel {{and the character}} Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who was portrayed as a villain. It was an on/off romance beginning shortly after both characters' introduction in 1998. In an interview in June 2000, Kemp discussed the relationship between Steve and Mel: [...] "Steve's convinced Mel will make his life complete. She kept him going during all the bad times and now he's determined to have her. It's true {{of a lot of}} guys who get into trouble, they hang their hat on one idea and that keeps them sane [...] there's a driving force that kept them going while they were [...] And often that's a woman. You know from those tender moments when Mel came to visit Steve [...] that she was the thing that kept him going, and he won't stop til he gets her back." [...] Eventually the couple were shown to marry in the soap in March 2001, despite a revelation that Mel had strayed with Steve's nemesis Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Tamzin Outhwaite explained, [...] "With Ian, Mel was the one who didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> with it. This time around Mel is the one who is apprehensive, hoping Steve will be there for her. If he isn't, she has no reason to stay in Walford. This really is make or break time for her." [...] The wedding night was a precursor to one of the soap's most publicised storylines, Who Shot Phil?, where Phil was gunned down by an unknown assailant and, due to Mel's infifelity, Steve became one of the prime suspects for the murder attempt, though he transpired to be a red herring. Discussing Mel and Steve's wedding, Outhwaite said, [...] "Even though this wedding with Steve has got as much controversy as Mel's last one , it feels more true. The characters seem more suited and it's not a big, white wedding, it's a low-key register office thing." [...] 17 million viewers watched the wedding.|$|E
