5|$|About 222million <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> avoid {{pregnancy}} {{in developing}} countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use {{in developing countries}} has decreased {{the number of deaths}} during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

Mukhiddin Kabiri, the Deputy Chairman of the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan, says that legislation is unlikely to stop the growth in polygyny. He criticizes the ruling élite for speaking out against the practice while taking more than one wife themselves.|$|E

25|$|The {{first edition}} of the International Women in Business Conference was {{organized}} on 17 October 2013, when there were presents 19 speakers from Romania, Poland, Switzerland, Moldova, Belgium and Greece.

25|$|The National Public Radio investigative {{report on}} Acu-Gen {{predicted}} that parents {{may use the}} Baby Gender Mentor test {{as a basis for}} determining whether to get a sex-selective abortion. KMSP-TV interviewed genetic counselor Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction. The concern is that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early. They say that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have a specific sex will be learning the results {{at a time when it}} is safer for them to have an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|If a cone biopsy {{does not}} produce clear margins (findings on biopsy showing that the tumor is {{surrounded}} by cancer free tissue, suggesting all of the tumor is removed), one more possible treatment option for <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> preserve their fertility is a trachelectomy. This attempts to surgically remove the cancer while preserving the ovaries and uterus, providing for a more conservative operation than a hysterectomy. It is a viable option for those in stage I cervical cancer which has not spread; however, {{it is not yet}} considered a standard of care, as few doctors are skilled in this procedure. Even the most experienced surgeon cannot promise that a trachelectomy can be performed until after surgical microscopic examination, as the extent of the spread of cancer is unknown. If the surgeon is not able to microscopically confirm clear margins of cervical tissue once the woman is under general anesthesia in the operating room, a hysterectomy may still be needed. This can only be done during the same operation if the woman has given prior consent. Due to the possible risk of cancer spread to the lymph nodes in stage 1b cancers and some stage 1a cancers, the surgeon may also need to remove some lymph nodes from around the uterus for pathologic evaluation.|$|E

500|$|On 29 March 1928, when a bill {{came before}} {{parliament}} giving {{the vote in}} parliamentary elections to all men and women over 21, she termed the measure [...] "a tremendous social advance", and added: [...] "At last [...] are established on that equitable footing because we are human beings and part of society as a whole... once and for all, we shall destroy the artificial barrier {{in the way of}} any <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get education in politics and who want to come forward and take their full share in the political life of their day". When the bill became law, 4 million voters, most of them women, were added to the register. In the 1929 general election, held on 30 May, Bondfield easily held her Wallsend seat despite the intervention of a candidate representing unemployed workers. The overall election result left Labour as the largest party with 287 seats, but without an overall majority, and MacDonald formed his second minority administration.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{as part of}} a new storyline, Sable was {{attacked}} by a masked woman named Spider Lady, {{who turned out to be}} Luna. Sable defeated Luna in a Strap match at the Royal Rumble after an assist from a planted female Sable fan, WWF newcomer Tori. Tori's debut signified a change in Sable's persona. After the Rumble, Rena (under her Sable ring name) was featured as the cover girl for the April 1999 issue of Playboy. The issue was one of the highest selling issues of Playboy ever. Surrounding the release of the issue, the Sable character turned heel by [...] "going Hollywood" [...] and having an inflated ego. Rarely defending her title, Sable continually berated her fan Tori, and she feuded with both Tori and Luna Vachon (who had turned face). She debuted a new catchphrase: [...] "This is for all the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be me and all the men who come to see me" [...] and a dance move called [...] "the grind." [...] The feud with Tori led to a match at WrestleMania XV. During the contest, Nicole Bass debuted as Sable's bodyguard and helped Sable win the match.|$|E

500|$|Falle took a {{sustained}} interest in Bedford v. Canada, {{a case that}} began in the fall of 2010 when laws against keeping a brothel, communicating in order to facilitate prostitution, and living off the avails of prostitution were struck down by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice as unconstitutional. When Falle first heard about this decision, she cried, and expressed surprise and disappointment. She said that she did not believe that the average Canadian realized the implications of striking down these laws, which she said were that [...] "your next door neighbours can run a brothel right beside you. Your children could be exposed to condoms left on their driveway, johns propositioning them." [...] She also expressed her concern that striking down anti-prostitution laws normalizes prostitution as a career option for children to consider. She also said that, without the laws, [...] "pimps will be legitimate businesspeople [...] billboards advertising brothels could start appearing on roadsides." [...] Ron Marzel, a lawyer attempting to have the anti-prostitution laws declared unconstitutional, said, [...] "the reality is there are consenting adults who want to go into" [...] prostitution. Falle was angered by this statement, and replied that 97% of women in the sex industry are not engaging in prostitution by choice, and that [...] "the voices of the overwhelming majority of <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get out of prostitution are being drowned out by a vocal few." ...|$|E

Gibson later backed away from such conspiracy theories saying, [...] "It was like: 'Hey, tell us a conspiracy'...so I laid out this thing, and suddenly, it was like I was talking the gospel truth, espousing all this political shit like I believed in it." [...] In the same 1995 Playboy interview, Gibson argued against ordaining women to the priesthood.|$|E

He further argues that women in the West have lost their honor by pointing out perceived high rate of sexual violence in the West {{as well as the}} widespread exploitation of female sexual appeal for commercial purposes: [...] "In effect, they have been treating women like a commodity, like another of their products.

2500|$|The opera glove {{has enjoyed}} varying {{popularity}} in the decades since World War I, being most prevalent as a fashion accessory in the 1940s through the early 1960s (long gloves were an important accessory of Christian Dior's [...] "New Look" [...] designs), but {{continues to this day}} to be popular with <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> add a particularly elegant touch to their formal outfits, and have enjoyed minor revivals in fashion design on several occasions in recent years (they were very prominent, for example, in haute couture collections for the fall/winter 2007 season). Opera gloves continue to be popular accessories for bridal, prom, debutante, and quinceañera gowns and at very formal ballroom dances (to this day, for example, it is mandatory for female participants at the Vienna Opera Ball to wear white opera gloves) and are often worn by entertainers such as can-can dancers and burlesque performers (particularly to perform a gown-and-glove dance). In popular culture, probably the two best-known images incorporating opera gloves are those of Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946) and Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953). (Actress Audrey Hepburn was also known for glove-wearing on- and off-screen, but the style of glove she popularized is a type of coat-sleeve-length or three-quarters-length glove, rather than true opera-length.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Jhally (1989) and Jackson (2009) on {{the other}} hand do not see the {{portrayal}} of women being objectified as a commodity or [...] "hot lesbians" [...] necessarily wrong. Not in the literal sense, but advertisements are reflective of what our views are. In turn, this may open up women who were unsure of their sexuality (even though most lesbians would state that they were lesbians from birth) and let them experiment without the boundaries. As an example, older advertisements from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s are made up of ideologies of what men wanted, and what they believed to be their ultimate dreams. Those ads supposedly portrayed what women dreamed about, when really this was only because they were being told what to dream about by men. Women were just heterosexual in everyone's eyes, as being lesbian was a major taboo during that time. Lesbians were always in the background, just not front-and-centre. Nowadays, you have postfeminist <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be free from labels, experiment sexually, and use fashionable lesbianism in advertising as it does not affect their heterosexual ways. It has become a [...] "fad", or [...] "cool" [...] to be bi-curious, or tri-sexual. This, in turn, may open up other avenues for women who were once shunned upon. Sexuality and gender have been elevated to a privileged position in our cultural discourse, and thus powerful media campaigns only further this cause. It is natural that the [...] "hot lesbian" [...] would be at the forefront because sex always sells, and the [...] "hot lesbian" [...] theme in advertising is what is taking place now. As such, people can view the advertisements as just advertisements, or it can pique their curiosity.|$|E
