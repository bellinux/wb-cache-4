40|$|In this study, {{we looked}} at the effect of {{promotion}} in the speed and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> of information on the Internet by tracking the diffusion of news articles over a social network. Speed of spread means the number of readers that the news has reached in a given time, while <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> means how far the story has travelled from the news originator within the social network. After analyzing six stories in a 30 -hour time span, we found out that the lifetime of a story's popularity among the members of the social network has three phases: Expansion, Front-page, and Saturation. Expansion phase starts when a story is published and the article spreads from a source node to nodes within a connected component of the social network. Front-page phase happens when a news aggregator promotes the story in its front page resulting to the story's faster rate of spread among the connected nodes {{while at the same time}} spreading the article to nodes outside the original connected component of the social network. Saturation phase is when the story ages and its rate of spread within the social network slows down, suggesting popularity saturation among the nodes. Within these three phases, we observed minimal changes on the width of information spread as suggested by relatively low increase of the width of the spread's diameter within the social network. We see that this paper provides the various stakeholders a first-hand empirical data for modeling, designing, and improving the current web-based services, specifically the IT educators for designing and improving academic curricula, and for improving the current web-enabled deployment of knowledge and online evaluation of skills.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the collective phase dynamics in conventional long Josephson junction (LJJ) stacks and in layered superconductors, exhibiting intrinsic LJJ behaviors. Using a theoretical model {{which accounts for}} both the magnetic induction effect and the breakdown of local charge neutrality (i. e., charging effect), we show that the collective motion of Josephson vortices, including the dispersion of Josephson plasma mode and the Swihart-type velocity, in an intrinsic LJJ stack such as Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 +y (BSCCO) is significantly modified from those in a conventional LJJ stack. In BSCCO, {{the strength of the}} charging effect α is small (i. e., α ∼ 0. 1 − 0. 4), but it leads to notable changes in collective phase dynamics, including changes to the stability condition. Also, we show that splitting of the supercurrent branch in the resistive state is due to collective motion of Josephson vortices. The <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> of these sub-branches in the linear current-voltage regime depends on α, suggesting another way to measure the charging effect in BSCCO...|$|E
40|$|A {{field study}} to {{evaluate}} the cement nala plug in Wagarwadi watershed of Hingoli district was carried out during 1998 - 99. Water storage characteristics in the cement nala plug was studied by monitoring the depth of water storage in cement plug and length of water spread. The losses from surface water storage {{in the form of}} evaporation and seepage/percolation were estimated. The effect of seepage on ground water recharge was studied by monitoring water levels in the observation wells. Utilization of stored water in the cement nala plug was observed. The full water storage of cement nala plug was found to be 1725. 91 m, with the maximum length and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>spread,</b> 11. 3 m and 14. 0 m, respectively with maximum impounding of water as 3. 0 m. The maximum evaporation loss and seepage loss from the cement nala plug was found to be 257. 2 m 3 and 1634 m 3, respectively. The impounded water in cement nala plug resulted in the increase in water levels in the observation wells of the influencing area.

40|$|Cochlear {{implants}} (CI) {{provide the}} opportunity for post-lingually deafened adults to regain {{a part of their}} auditory communicative skills. Despite significant improvements in average performance there remains a considerable amount of unpredictable inter-subject variability. Most previous studies seeking to predict post-operative speech understanding have been handicapped by heterogeneous patient populations with variable devices, speech processing strategies, speech discrimination tests or clinical rehabilitation programs. The use of varying clinical programs, particularly different devices, can influence the usefulness of performance predictors. Electronics and electrode designs have evolved over time, leading to improved speech perception for the whole group of CI recipients. Another possible explanation for the broad variety in performances after implantation could be related to differences in peripheral nerve excitability. This activity could be estimated by measuring the widths of spread of excitation profiles through neural response telemetry. The study group was made up of 20 adult subjects who underwent CI surgery by the same otosurgeon and were rehabilitated by the same speech therapist at Pisa CI centre in the period from 2000 to 2011. In all these patients a Cochlear® perimodiolar electrode array was used, an array with 22 electrode contacts directed towards the inner wall of the scala tympani. The only variation was in the surgical insertion procedure, advance off stylet and in-stylet technique. One of this study's aims was to compare electrophysiological data to audiological outcomes in a CI adult population in order to find a specific method to predict future audiological outcomes from first programme mapping. To investigate dependence between excitability and patient benefits (described as speech understanding results) all the patients were submitted to a neural response telemetry and spread of excitation width on all the odd electrodes, evaluated with logopedical test using the new MAP performed on the basis of behavioural cues. All these data were compared to audiological outcomes. Another goal to achieve was to find a correlation between neural response telemetry and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> of excitation in 11 electrodes out of 22 measured. The measure of spread of excitation is not commonly used in the follow up of a CI population, but it could be of great importance in difficult cases such as non-collaborative patients and to study patients who do not achieve the expected results. In this context we tried to statistically demonstrate that as the SOE width increases, audiological performances of the patient declines. Finally, we compared all patient maps and their performances in order to find a correlation between MAP's modifications and their audiological outcomes...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel method to track fluorescent particles {{in three dimensions}} with nanometre precision and millisecond time resolution. In this method, we use our two-photon excitation microscope. The galvomotor-driven x-y scanning mirrors allow the laser beam to move repetitively in a circular path with a radius <b>of</b> half the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the point <b>spread</b> function <b>of</b> the laser. When the fluorescent particle is located within the scanning radius of the laser, the precise position of the particle in the x-x plane can be determined by its fluorescence intensity distribution along the circular scanning path. A z-nanopositioner on the objective was used to change the laser focus at two planes (half <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the point <b>spread</b> function apart). The difference of the fluorescence intensity in the two planes {{is used to calculate}} the z-position of the fluorescent particle. The laser beam is allowed to scan multiple circular orbits before it is moved to the other plane, thus improving the signal to noise ratio. With a fast feedback mechanism, the position of the laser beam is directed to the centre of the fluorescent particle, thus allowing us to track a particle in three dimensions.

For the baseline case with no electric field applied, the flame spread {{rate and the}} flame <b>width</b> <b>of</b> downwardly <b>spreading</b> flames (DSFs) decreased from the horizontal case for − 20 ° ≤ θ <  0 ° and maintained near constant values for − 90 ° ≤ θ < − 20 °, while the flame spread rate increased appreciably as the inclination angle <b>of</b> upwardly <b>spreading</b> flames (USFs) increased. When an AC electric field was applied, the behavior <b>of</b> flame <b>spread</b> rate in DSFs (USFs) could be classified into two (three) sub-regimes characterized by various functional dependences on VAC, fAC, and θ. In nearly all cases of DSFs, a globular molten polyethylene formed ahead <b>of</b> the <b>spreading</b> flame edge, occasionally dripping onto the ground. In these cases, an effective flame spread rate was defined to represent the burning rate by measuring the mass loss due to dripping. This effective spread rate was independent of AC frequency, while it decreased linearly with voltage and was independent of the inclination angle. In DSFs, when excessively high voltage and frequency were applied, the dripping led to flame extinction during propagation and the extinction frequency correlated well with applied voltage. In USFs, when high voltage and frequency were applied, multiple globular molten PEs formed at several locations, leading to ejections of multiple small flame segments from the main flame, thereby reducing the flame spread rate, which {{could be attributed to}} the electrospray phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|Rayleigh's {{criterion}} {{states that}} it becomes essentially difficult to resolve two incoherent optical point sources separated by a distance below the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> point <b>spread</b> functions (PSF), namely in the subdiffraction limit. Recently, researchers have achieved superresolution for two incoherent point sources with equal strengths using {{a new type of}} measurement technique, surpassing Rayleigh's criterion. However, situations where more than two point sources needed to be resolved have not been fully investigated. Here we prove that for any incoherent sources with arbitrary strengths, a one- or two-dimensional image can be precisely resolved up to its second moment in the subdiffraction limit, i. e. the Fisher information (FI) is non-zero. But the FI with respect to higher order moments always tends to zero polynomially as the size of the image decreases, for any type of measurement. We call this phenomenon a modern description of Rayleigh's criterion. For PSFs under certain constraints, the optimal measurement basis estimating all moments in the subdiffraction limit for 1 D weak-source imaging is constructed. Such basis also generates the optimal-scaling FI with respect {{to the size of the}} image for 2 D or strong-source imaging, which achieves an overall quadratic improvement compared to direct imaging.

It is suggested that hese oriented omains are formed from the larger platelets present in the system. The Bragg diffraction pattern is better explained by a disordered lattice model rather than by a mixture model with small particles having awell-defined lattice spacing.

The lattice spacing of the latter appears to be better defined for samples prepared by compression.

The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a tool that can be used to estimate these metrics from summary wave-front analysis data. Methods The core of the tool is a two-parameter (primary spherical aberration and an overall measure of all other higher-order aberrations) model for the statistical description of the optical aberrations of the human eye. Modulation transfer through-focus curves were calculated for realistic ranges of spherical aberration, other higher-order aberrations and pupil diameters, for both white and monochromatic light. A series of commonly used metrics (modulation transfer, Strehl ratio, visual Strehl ratio and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> line <b>spread</b> function) was derived from these through-focus curves, with corresponding location of optimal focus and depth-of-focus. Results Published wave-front analysis data from healthy subjects served as input for the tool. The output was compared to published measurements of the included metrics, performed in the same or in comparable samples. Agreement between output of the tool and measurements was within the accuracy of the data. Conclusions The tool is able to relate accurately summary wave-front analysis data from groups of patients to metrics relevant to visual perception and can thus be used to estimate these metrics in situations where their calculation from raw wave-front analysis data is not possible. ...|$|R

The ordering occurs despite the fact that a random <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the energy levels of the localized one-electron states, exceeding the mean Coulomb energy per electron, renders it impossible the electrons to be self-localized due to their mutual Coulomb repulsion This differs principally the Coulomb ordered Anderson localized electron system (COALES) from Wigner crystal, Wigner glass, and any other ordered electron or hole system that results from the Coulomb self-localization of electrons/holes. The residual disorder inherent to COALES is found to bring about a multi-valley ground-state degeneration akin to that in spin glass. With the electron density increasing, COALES is revealed to turn into Wigner glass or a glassy state of a Fermi-glass type depending on the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the random <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the electron levels.
