6000|$|... "You lie!" [...] {{said the}} old man fiercely. [...] "I didn't say I thought any thing. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> go back on me for, eh?" [...] His hands were {{trembling}} as he rose muttering from the bed, and made his way toward the hearth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wow! <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do? Give me a shower-bath?" [...] grumbled Randy presently. Jack {{had pushed}} some long and well-saturated {{brushwood}} {{to one side}} in passing.
