2500|$|Charging of surface: [...] the {{top surface}} of the {{charging}} film must be electrostatically charged. [...] To achieve this most EDDs use a shielded (grounded) hand-held unit containing a high-tension corona wire which is turned on and literally waved over the entire surface of platen for several seconds criss-crossing the platen area. [...] The objective is to produce an evenly distributed electrostatic charge {{in the air above}} the {{surface of the}} charging film. [...] After passing the unit over the platen, the examiner <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes until the charge has been passed {{to the surface of the}} charging film.|$|E
2500|$|Left-Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) {{as often}} used as a [...] "bridge" [...] to provide {{additional}} time while a patient <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> transplant. [...] For example, former U.S. vice-president Dick Cheney had a LVAD implanted in 2010 and then twenty months later received a heart transplant in 2012. [...] In year 2012, about 3,000 ventricular assist devices were inserted in the United States, as compared to approximately 2,500 heart transplants. The use of airbags in cars as well as greater use of helmets by bicyclists and skiers has {{reduced the number of}} persons with fatal head injuries, which is a common source of donors hearts.|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparation}} for winter, bears can gain approximately , {{during a period}} of hyperphagia, before going into hibernation. The bear often <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> substantial snowstorm before it enters its den: such behavior lessens the chances predators will find the den. The dens are typically at elevations above [...] on north-facing slopes. There is some debate amongst professionals as to whether grizzly bears technically hibernate: much of this debate revolves around body temperature and the ability of the bears to move around during hibernation on occasion. Grizzly bears can [...] "partially" [...] recycle their body wastes during this period. Although inland or Rocky Mountain grizzlies spend nearly half of their life in dens, coastal grizzlies with better access to food sources spend less time in dens. In some areas where food is very plentiful year round, grizzly bears skip hibernation altogether.|$|E

60|$|When a {{publisher}} offers an author better royalties than other publishers {{have been paying}} him, he is scabbing on those other publishers.
