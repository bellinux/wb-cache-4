500|$|In 1921 {{the couple}} went to Europe where Tunis freelanced {{as a sports}} writer for American {{publications}} and played in some tennis tournaments on the Riviera, including a match against King Gustaf V of Sweden, who was 70 at the time. Tunis also played a doubles match against the French women's champion Suzanne Lenglen. Returning to the U.S. {{at the end of}} the summer, he dropped in on former Harvard classmate Lawrence Winship, the Sunday editor of The Boston Globe. When Winship learned that Tunis actually knew the flamboyant Lenglen, he insisted he write an article about her for the Globe before leaving the building. The pressure of that deadline caused him such anxiety that after half an hour of struggle he went to the building's fire escape, [...] "leaned over the railing, and threw up. I'll never forget it. I <b>wiped</b> <b>my</b> face with copy paper. But I did the story." [...] Between 1920 and 1940 Tunis freelanced for a number of major magazines, including Reader's Digest, Harper's, Atlantic Monthly, Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire, writing primarily on two topics: sports and education. He also covered sports for the New York Evening Post from 1925 to 1932 and had a weekly column in The New Yorker. According to Norman Cousins in Writing for Love or Money, Tunis was known for producing [...] "fact-packed articles based upon research". Working six days a week and taking the seventh to play tennis, Tunis published over 2,000 articles and short stories, becoming one ofAmerica's premier sportswriters.|$|E

60|$|And so I {{went into}} a chamber apart with the old wife, Atoua. There, muttering prayers, she poured pure water over my hands into a ewer of gold, and having dipped a fine cloth into oil <b>wiped</b> <b>my</b> brow with it.|$|E

60|$|And, knowing this, I {{removed the}} wig and circlet from my head, tossing them {{carelessly}} upon the flagging of the court. Then I <b>wiped</b> <b>my</b> feet upon the yellow tresses; {{and as a}} groan of rage arose from the balcony I spat full upon the holy diadem.|$|E

60|$|Ashamed of my weakness, {{ashamed of}} {{everything}} about me, I burst into tears; {{and that of}} course made me still more ashamed. To add to my discomfort, I had no handkerchief.

60|$|Two part-pails {{of water}} {{could not go}} far among over a hundred of us, not {{counting}} the, men. Only the babies, and the very little children, and the wounded men, got any.

60|$|With that {{he brought}} some water from the burn by the road, and therewith he <b>wiped</b> <b>my</b> face, first giving me to drink.

60|$|At first I saw nobody; but {{feeling a}} {{pressure}} against the door, I looked round it, and there, to my amazement, were Mr. Peggotty and Ham, ducking {{at me with}} their hats, and squeezing one another against the wall.

6000|$|... "All right, Dan; but be {{a little}} careful with the water, {{you seem to be}} pretty near {{drowning}} me as it is.

60|$|She {{was gone}} now, and I {{felt that she}} must say and think evil things of me through all my future life.
