40|$|Cliches come {{easy when}} the {{importance}} of <b>water</b> <b>is</b> discussed. <b>Water</b> <b>is</b> life. <b>Water</b> <b>is</b> destiny. "Whiskey is for drinking and <b>water</b> <b>is</b> to fight over" is an oft used phrase to acknowledge water's more immediate influence, especially in the West. Many speakers have proclaimed that <b>water</b> <b>is</b> a driving force in western politics and a wave upon which much of the economic activities of the region rise and fall. In short, <b>water</b> <b>is</b> pretty important stuff...|$|R
50|$|In {{chemical}} and biological laboratories, {{as well as in}} industry, cheaper alternatives such as deionized <b>water</b> <b>are</b> preferred to distilled water.

5|$|Cold water {{fishing is}} {{available}} in Black Moshannon Creek and several of its tributaries, where anglers will find rainbow and brown trout that have been stocked there for sport fishing by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Black Moshannon Lake's <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> warmer {{than those of the}} creek, and so hold many different species of fish, including largemouth bass, muskellunge, yellow perch, chain pickerel, bullhead catfish, northern pike, bluegill, and crappie.|$|E
25|$|The Riparian <b>water</b> system <b>is</b> {{the system}} {{controlling}} water {{use in the}} eastern states where <b>water</b> <b>is</b> {{found to be more}} plentiful. Under this system the owner of the land bordering the source of <b>water</b> <b>is</b> entitled to use of said <b>water.</b> This system <b>is</b> sufficient for the states where <b>water</b> <b>is</b> found in abundance, but in the less water rich western states the control of <b>water</b> must <b>be</b> handled differently.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, mineral <b>waters</b> <b>were</b> used or {{consumed}} {{at their}} spring sources, {{often referred to}} as [...] "taking the waters" [...] or [...] "taking the cure," [...] at places such as spas, baths, or wells. The term spa was used for a place where the <b>water</b> <b>was</b> consumed and bathed in; bath where the <b>water</b> <b>was</b> used primarily for bathing, therapeutics, or recreation; and well where the <b>water</b> <b>was</b> to be consumed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Water</b> <b>is</b> very {{scarce in}} this town for many decades now.The local town {{administration}} takes care of supply of drinking water to homes.

5|$|Normally, {{an ocean}} {{temperature}} of 26.5°C (79.7°F) spanning {{through at least}} a 50-metre depth is considered the minimum to maintain a tropical cyclone. These warm <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> needed to maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems. This value is well above 16.1°C (60.9°F), the global average surface temperature of the oceans.|$|E
5|$|Several beaches dot Banton's coast {{including}} Macat-ang, Tabonan, Mahaba, Recodo, Togbongan, Mainit, and Tambak beaches. Some like Macat-ang, Tabonan, and Tambak {{are white}} sand beaches, while others, like Togbongan, are pebbled and rocky. The island's <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> also well-known dive sites, with corals {{that serve as}} breeding ground for groupers, snappers, sharks, and stingrays.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{voracious}} predators, eating most {{living things}} that are smaller than they are. Their staple diet is mostly bloodworms and other insect larvae, but they also feed on tadpoles and small fish. A few species, especially those that live in temporary <b>waters,</b> <b>are</b> likely to leave water. Nymphs of Cordulegaster bidentata sometimes hunt small arthropods {{on the ground at}} night.|$|E
50|$|One puzzling {{consequence}} of Kripke semantics is that identities involving rigid designators <b>are</b> necessary. If <b>water</b> <b>is</b> H2O, then <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H2O' {{pick out the}} same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H2O'. Therefore, <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, {{but that does not}} affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed <b>is</b> that <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O, but conditionally, if <b>water</b> <b>is</b> H2O (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it <b>is</b> true), then <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} {{can also}} be applied to natural kinds. If <b>water</b> <b>is</b> H2O, then <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O.

5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly {{when the wind}} is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of smell is more important than sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{conservation}} {{has recently}} garnered support in Puerto Rico. The archipelago has an estimated 700miles (1,126.5km) of coastline and 1,300mi2 (3,370km2) of coral reef communities. The Department of Natural Resources of Puerto Rico maintains 25 areas with marine components {{but only two}} of these (11km2) are designated as no-take zones. All turtle species occurring in Puerto Rico's <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> classified as either endangered or threatened. Earthwatch-supported turtle conservation programs and U.S. federal programs have raised local awareness and {{have contributed to the}} decline of egg-poaching and turtle meat consumption.|$|E

5|$|Near Benton, Fishing Creek's pH {{ranges from}} around 5.6 to 7.25, while near Bloomsburg, {{a wider range}} has been recorded, from 5.8 to 8.5. Near Camp Lavigne, it ranges from 5.5 to 7.1. East Branch Fishing Creek is the only stream in the {{watershed}} whose pH drops below 5.5; it can fall as low as 4.9. West Creek and Coles Creek are the least acidic streams in the watershed, with pH levels usually above 6.3 and often above 7. Typically, the creek and its tributaries are not at risk of becoming too acidic for the optimal health of fish, but in early spring during snowmelts, the levels approach the limit that brook trout can tolerate. Fishing Creek's <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> acidic because of acid rain.|$|E
5|$|The long-toed {{salamander}} is an ecologically versatile species {{living in a}} variety of habitats, ranging from temperate rainforests, coniferous forests, montane riparian, sagebrush plains, red fir forest, semiarid sagebrush, cheatgrass plains, to alpine meadows along the rocky shores of mountain lakes. Adults can be located in forested understory, hiding under coarse woody debris, rocks, and in small mammal burrows. During the spring breeding season, adults can be found under debris or in the shoreline shallows of rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds. Ephemeral <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> often frequented.|$|E
5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray preys on {{a variety}} of benthic and neritic organisms, including crabs, shrimps, mantis shrimps, bivalves, gastropods, worms, jellyfish, and bony fishes. In the western Indian Ocean, about two-thirds of its diet consists of fishes, in particular ponyfish and anchovies, with shrimps and other crustaceans making up most of the remainder. By contrast, rays in Australian <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> apparently not piscivorous, and are known to consume penaeid prawns. Known parasites of this species include Anthrobothrium loculatum, Dendromonocotyle colorni, Halysiorhynchus macrocephalus, Monocotyle helicophallus, M. multiparous, and M. spiremae, Thaumatocotyle australensis, and Tylocephalum chiralensis.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} species of trees that are {{considered}} mangroves: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All grow in oxygen-poor soil, can survive drastic water level changes, and are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water. All three mangrove species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves have the farthest-reaching roots, trapping sediments that help build coastlines after and between storms. All three types of trees absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. Everglades mangroves also serve as nurseries for crustaceans and fish, and rookeries for birds. The region supports Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) and stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industries; between 80 and 90 percent of commercially harvested crustacean species in Florida's salt <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> born or spend time near the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{signed the}} Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 12 June 1993, {{and became a}} party to the {{convention}} on 24 June 1994. It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 16 April 1998. The country is megadiverse with a high number of species and high levels of endemism. It is estimated to contain 20percent of the world's animal species. High levels of endemism are found on the diverse forests of Borneo's mountains, as species are isolated from each other by lowland forest. There are about 210 mammal species in the country. Over 620 species of birds have been recorded in Peninsular Malaysia, with many endemic to the mountains there. A high number of endemic bird species are also found in Malaysian Borneo. 250 reptile species have been recorded in the country, with about 150 species of snakes and 80 species of lizards. There are about 150 species of frogs, and thousands of insect species. Malaysia's exclusive economic zone is 1.5 times larger than its land area, and some of its <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> in the Coral Triangle, a biodiversity hotspot. The waters around Sipadan island are the most biodiverse in the world. Bordering East Malaysia, the Sulu Sea is a biodiversity hotspot, with around 600 coral species and 1200 fish species. The unique biodiversity of Malaysian Caves always attracts lovers of ecotourism from all over the world.|$|E
5|$|The Adriatic's shores are {{populated}} {{by more than}} 3.5million people; the largest cities are Bari, Venice, Trieste and Split. The earliest settlements on the Adriatic shores were Etruscan, Illyrian, and Greek. By the 2nd century BC, the shores were under Rome's control. In the Middle Ages, the Adriatic shores and the sea itself were controlled, to a varying extent, {{by a series of}} states—most notably the Byzantine Empire, the Serbian Empire, the Republic of Venice, the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire. The Napoleonic Wars resulted in the First French Empire gaining coastal control and the British effort to counter the French in the area, ultimately securing most of the eastern Adriatic shore and the Po Valley for Austria. Following Italian unification, the Kingdom of Italy started an eastward expansion that lasted until the 20th century. Following World War I and the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, the eastern coast's control passed to Yugoslavia and Albania. The former disintegrated during the 1990s, resulting in four new states on the Adriatic coast. Italy and Yugoslavia agreed on their maritime boundaries by 1975 and this boundary is recognised by Yugoslavia's successor states, but the maritime boundaries between Slovenian, Croatian, Bosnian-Herzegovinian, and Montenegrin <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> still disputed. Italy and Albania agreed on their maritime boundary in 1992.|$|E
