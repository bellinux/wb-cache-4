5|$|On 27 October, {{the same}} day Rhys-Davids died in action, a British {{intelligence}} officer finally gained access to the wreckage after it had lain {{a month in the}} open. He verified it was a triplane, and noted that its upper surfaces were camouflage green and its bottom surfaces <b>were</b> <b>blue.</b> Second Lieutenant Barfoot-Saunt removed some small pieces from the wreck to accompany his report, illustrating technical points. The technical information that was reported gave the British their first insight into the new craft, although Voss had swapped in a French Le Rhone engine.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban macaw had a red {{forehead}} fading {{to orange}} {{and then to}} yellow {{at the nape of}} the neck. It had white unfeathered areas around the eyes, and yellow irises. The face, chin, chest, abdomen and thighs were orange. The legs were brown. The upper back was brownish red with feathers scalloped with green. The rump, undertail feathers, and lower back <b>were</b> <b>blue.</b> The wing feathers were brown, red and purplish blue. The upper surface of the tail was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface of the tail was brownish red. The beak has variously been described as dark, all-black, and greyish black. The sexes were identical in external appearance, as with other macaws.|$|E
5|$|The Rush+ {{realignment}} {{was intended}} to free up space in the Rosslyn Portal (the tunnel between Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom), which operates at full capacity already. When Silver Line service began, those trains would be routed through the tunnel, and so some of what <b>were</b> <b>Blue</b> Line trains to Largo Town Center were now diverted across the Fenwick Bridge to become Yellow Line trains running {{all the way up}} the Green Line to Greenbelt. Select Yellow Line trains running south diverted along the Blue Line to Franconia-Springfield (as opposed to the normal Yellow line terminus at Huntington). Until the start of Silver Line service, excess Rosslyn Tunnel capacity was used by additional Orange Line trains that traveled along the Blue Line to Largo (as opposed to the normal Orange Line terminus at New Carrollton). Rush+ had the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys, though severely increasing headways for the portion of the Blue Line running between Pentagon and Rosslyn. In May 2017, Metro announced that Yellow Rush+ service would be eliminated effective June 25, 2017.|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} {{was built on}} the site of derelict farm buildings. There were different designers for different parts of the service area, with Owen Williams as the coordinating architect. An ornate design for a footbridge by Clough Williams-Ellis was rejected in favour of a more functional and conservative modernist design by Owen Williams. When the services opened the new buildings were incomplete so the food was served from temporary sheds. The original plan had been for trucks to use this service station and for cars to use Newport Pagnell. In practice, however, both service areas were unrestricted. The first owners of the services <b>were</b> <b>Blue</b> Boar Limited, a family company that owned a nearby petrol station on the A5. Although the official name has always been Watford Gap, the services were colloquially called Blue Boar for some time after opening.|$|E

25|$|Vancouver Whitecaps FC was a Canadian {{professional}} soccer club {{based in}} Vancouver, British Columbia. Founded in 1986, the team played its final {{year in the}} second tier of the United States soccer pyramid in the NASL Conference of the USSF Division 2 Professional League coached by Teitur Thordarson. The team played its home games at Swangard Stadium in nearby Burnaby, British Columbia. The team's colours <b>were</b> <b>blue</b> and white.|$|E
25|$|The {{club was}} {{originally}} called Grimsby Pelham, {{this being the}} family name of the Earl of Yarborough, a significant landowner in the area. In 1880 the club purchased land at Clee Park which was to become their ground until 1889 when they relocated to Abbey Park, before moving again in 1899 to their present home, Blundell Park. The original colours <b>were</b> <b>blue</b> and white hoops, which were changed to chocolate brown and blue quartered shirts in 1884.|$|E
25|$|In their rugby {{football}} {{days and}} early {{years as a}} rugby league club, St Helens wore a vertically striped blue and white jersey with blue shorts and socks. In their initial period at Knowsley Road, St Helens wore a similar jersey, but the stripes were horizontal, and the colours <b>were</b> <b>blue</b> and grey. These colours however were dropped in favour of a more traditional to today, red and white design. The jersey had a single broad red horizontal band, on a white background, and was used until 1961.|$|E

25|$|The {{highways}} {{were originally}} designated using a two-tier system, national (SH 1 to 8) and provincial, with national highways having {{a higher standard}} and funding priorities. Now all are state highways, and the network consists of SH 1 running the length of both islands, SH 2 to 5 and 10 to 58 in the North Island, and SH 6 to 8 and 60 to 99 in the South Island, numbered approximately north to south. State highways are marked by red shield-shaped signs with white numbering (shields for the former provincial highways <b>were</b> <b>blue).</b> Road maps usually number state highways in this fashion.|$|E
25|$|Eduvigis Beauchamp Sterling, named Treasurer of the {{revolution}} by Betances, provided Mariana Bracetti with the materials for the Revolutionary Flag of Lares. The flag was divided in the middle by a white Latin cross, the two lower corners were red and the two upper corners <b>were</b> <b>blue.</b> A white star {{was placed in the}} upper left blue corner. According to Puerto Rican poet Luis Lloréns Torres the white cross stands for the yearning for homeland redemption; the red squares, the blood poured by the heroes of the rebellion and the white star in the blue solitude square, stands for liberty and freedom.|$|E
25|$|BBS {{systems on}} other systems {{remained}} popular, especially home computers, largely because they catered {{to the audience}} of users running those machines. The ubiquitous Commodore 64 (introduced in 1982) was a common platform in the 1980s. Popular commercial BBS programs <b>were</b> <b>Blue</b> Board, Ivory BBS, Color64 and CNet 64. In the early 1990s, {{a small number of}} BBSes were also running on the Commodore Amiga. Popular BBS software for the Amiga were ABBS, Amiexpress, C-Net, StormforceBBS, Infinity and Tempest. There was also a small faction of devoted Atari BBSes that used the Atari 800, then the 800XL, and eventually the 1040ST. The earlier machines generally lacked hard drive capabilities, which limited them primarily to messaging.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{teams in}} western Canada formed the Pacific Coast Hockey Association in 1911. This league created new designs and rules that helped ice hockey evolve {{into the game}} it is today. Some of these new {{innovations}} that were created <b>were</b> <b>blue</b> lines that were painted under the ice which divided the ice into three sections, goaltenders are allowed to fall and slide on the ice to help prevent the other team from scoring a goal, forward passing is permitted in the neutral zone, and the game was split into three periods of 20 minutes. In 1912, the game changed again {{reducing the number of}} on-ice players to six players from the previous seven.|$|E
25|$|First, a ray {{is created}} at an {{eyepoint}} and traced through a pixel {{and into the}} scene, where it hits a diffuse surface. From that surface the algorithm recursively generates a reflection ray, which is traced through the scene, where it hits another diffuse surface. Finally, another reflection ray is generated and traced through the scene, where it hits the light source and is absorbed. The color of the pixel now depends on {{the colors of the}} first and second diffuse surface and the color of the light emitted from the light source. For example, if the light source emitted white light and the two diffuse surfaces <b>were</b> <b>blue,</b> then the resulting color of the pixel is blue.|$|E
25|$|By November 2007, {{the game}} was about pride with both teams {{national}} title hopes dashed by USC's losses to Stanford and Oregon, and Cal's 3 in a row loss to Oregon State, UCLA, and Arizona State. Played in the Memorial Stadium in Berkeley under intense rain, the Golden Bears donned throwback uniforms honoring 1975 All-American Cal quarterback Joe Roth. Designed by Nike, the helmet was gold with 2 blue lines bordering a center white line. The Cal logo {{on the side of}} the helmet was replaced by a white C inside a blue oval. The jerseys <b>were</b> <b>blue</b> with yellow numbering but does not feature the player's name. 2 blue lines bordered a white center line down the side of the yellow pants.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the stadium}} was {{originally}} {{built for the}} Giants, the stadium's lower walls <b>were</b> <b>blue</b> and the seats and the stadium's four gates were red and blue to reflect the team colors. When the Jets moved in, green banners were hung over the walls and eventually over the outer gates of the stadium anytime the team hosted a game. In addition, team-specific end zone decorations would be changed for Jets home games. This was accomplished by either painting over the Giants logos, or replacing the turf section of each end zone. Midfield decorations at the 50-yard line were typically not team-specific (in early years a Meadowlands logo, and later an NFL shield), {{which could be used}} for both teams' games.|$|E
25|$|Local {{identity}} varies throughout Madison, {{with over}} 120 officially recognized neighborhood associations. Neighborhoods on {{and near the}} eastern part of the isthmus, some of the city's oldest, have the strongest sense of identity and are the most politically liberal. Historically, the north, east, and south sides <b>were</b> <b>blue</b> collar while the west side was white collar, and to a certain extent this remains true. Students dominate on the University of Wisconsin campus and to the east into downtown, while to its south and in Shorewood Hills on its west, faculty have been a major presence since those neighborhoods were originally developed. The turning point in Madison's development was the university's 1954 decision to develop its experimental farm on the western edge of town; since then, the city has grown substantially along suburban lines.|$|E
25|$|When a Parramatta District Club {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1936, the colours put {{forward to the}} New South Wales Rugby League by the District were emerald green and white, as these were the colours worn by the Western Districts President’s Cup side and the Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club. However, when the proposal for a Parramatta club was next put to the NSWRL in 1946, the proposed colours for the new District side <b>were</b> <b>blue</b> and gold. These colours {{are said to have}} been selected based on the navy, sky blue and gold colours used by Arthur Phillip High School. These colours were also adopted by the Parramatta District Rugby Union club in 1936 and also suggested in Parramatta City Council’s use of livery of blue and golden-orange in their crest. While this colour scheme has remained consistent throughout the history of the club, the shades of blue and gold have changed several times.|$|E
