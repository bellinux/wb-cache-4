5|$|The He 111 design quickly {{ran through}} a series of minor design revisions. One of the more obvious changes started with the He 111F models, which moved from the {{elliptical}} wing to one with straight leading and trailing edges, which could be manufactured more efficiently. The dimensions of the new design had a <b>wing</b> <b>span</b> of 22.6m (74ft 1¾in) and an area of 87.60m² (942.90ft).|$|E
5|$|During the Permian, the dragonflies Odonata {{were the}} {{dominant}} aerial predator and probably dominated terrestrial insect predation as well. True Odonata {{appeared in the}} Permian and all are amphibian. Their prototypes are the oldest winged fossils, {{go back to the}} Devonian, and are different from other wings in every way. Their prototypes may have had the beginnings of many modern attributes even by late Carboniferous and it is possible that they even captured small vertebrates, for some species had a <b>wing</b> <b>span</b> of 71cm. The earliest beetle-like species during the Permian had pointed, leather like forewings with cells and pits. Hemiptera, or true bugs had appeared in the form of Arctiniscytina and Paraknightia having forewings with unusual venation, possibly diverging from Blattoptera.|$|E
5|$|Vehicles also {{received}} digital enhancement. For {{the scene in}} which the Expendables crash their Canadair CL-215 amphibious plane into a cave, the effects team intended to use Miniature effects, filming using a 1/3 scale model of the 90-feet <b>wing</b> <b>span</b> plane. Production constraints and the limited shooting schedule meant the miniature shoot was abandoned and the entire sequence was rendered digitally. The plane itself was also digitally modified, adding a nose mounted gun which in practice could have stalled the engine with its recoil. A rear hatch door was required for jet skis to drive into the plane but the crafts design made such a door impractical; visual trickery was used to obscure this fact and make the door fit into the existing plane design. A helicopter used in the opening sequence was required to perform more dynamic moves {{and so it was}} digitally removed entirely and replaced with a digital recreation that better fit the scene's requirements. The helicopter which decapitates Hector during his fight with Christmas had no rotors and they were digitally added. WWFX later enhanced it more, modifying lighting and stabilizing the helicopter's body which shook unnaturally when struck during the fight. The Sangs Mi-8 helicopter was a civilian variant, but it was digitally replaced with the gunship variant, the Hip-E, to make it look meaner and more fitting for Van Damme's villainous mercenary, with a black reflective coating and armaments. The T-72 tank used to assault the Expendables would have devastated the set with the resulting concussive wave if it had fired a single shot, so it was replaced in most shots with a digital version that performed the shooting.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{a racing}} variant {{were built in}} 1910. This had a reduced wingspan, with the upper <b>wing</b> <b>spanning</b> 8.5 m and a {{monoplane}} tail.|$|R
50|$|The Salisbury Mall was {{originally}} anchored by Sears, and Hecht's (then known as The Hecht Co). The mall's west <b>wing</b> <b>spanned</b> 1/10 of a mile.|$|R
50|$|The palace has {{undergone}} major reconstructions {{since it was}} built. Currently, it consists of a central part with two long <b>wings,</b> <b>spanning</b> approximately 110 m from end to end.|$|R
25|$|All these {{modifications}} added weight, so {{the lower}} <b>wing</b> <b>span</b> was extended by 9.5 feet.|$|E
25|$|Phoebus C is {{the same}} as B model except has 17 meter <b>wing</b> <b>span,</b> did not have tail mounted braking parachute.|$|E
25|$|A {{fixed gear}} version {{with a larger}} <b>wing</b> <b>span</b> and area {{as well as a}} higher gross weight was {{developed}} for the US light-sport aircraft category and is marketed as the Gobosh 800XP.|$|E
50|$|F.13: first prototype, smaller <b>wings</b> (<b>span</b> 14.47 m/47 ft 5.75 in, area 38.9 m² /419 ft²) {{and less}} {{powerful}} engine 127 kW (170 hp) Mercedes D IIIa inline) than production models.|$|R

5000|$|An {{additional}} fifteen, differing {{in being}} fitted with floats {{in place of}} wheels, a [...] Thomas among other engines {{in place of the}} OX-5, and three-bay <b>wings</b> <b>spanning</b> 44 ft (13.41 m), were sold to the United States Navy as the SH-4. at US$7,575 each.|$|R
25|$|Built {{shortly after}} World War II, the NC.1070 was a {{contemporary}} of the Nord 1500 Noréclair and {{was intended to}} take a similar rôle. It was a twin engine aircraft of unconventional layout with twin booms, twin fins and a double horizontal tail. The central fuselage was not a pod, though short compared with the <b>wing</b> <b>span,</b> and extended beyond the tail.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Thunderceptor was its unusual inverse tapered wing, in which the chord length {{increased}} along the <b>wing</b> <b>span</b> from the root to the tip, the opposite of conventional swept wing designs. This {{was an attempt to}} address the problem of pitch-up, a potentially deadly phenomenon that plagued early high-speed models. The Thunderceptor's design meant the entire wing stalled smoothly, more like a straight-wing design.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitive}} F-100D {{aimed to}} address the offensive shortcomings of the F-100C by being primarily a ground attack aircraft with secondary fighter capabilities. To this effect, the aircraft was fitted with autopilot, upgraded avionics, and, starting with the 184th production aircraft, AIM-9 Sidewinder capability. In 1959, 65 aircraft were modified to also fire the AGM-12 Bullpup air-to-ground missile. To further address the dangerous flight characteristics, the <b>wing</b> <b>span</b> was extended by 26in (66cm) and the vertical tail area was increased by 27%.|$|E

2500|$|Adults are {{characterized}} by large size, heavy bodies covered in hair-like scales, lobed wings, reduced mouthparts, and small heads. They lack a frenulum but the hind wings overlap the forewings, producing the same effect of an unbroken wing surface. These moths are sometimes brightly colored and often have translucent eyespots or [...] "windows" [...] on their wings. [...] Sexual dimorphism varies by species, but males can generally be distinguished by their larger, broader antennae. Most adults possess <b>wing</b> <b>spans</b> between 1 and 6in (2.5 and 15cm), but some tropical species, such as the Atlas moth (Attacus atlas), may have <b>wing</b> <b>spans</b> up to 12in (30cm). Together with certain Noctuidae (chiefly Calpinae and Catocalinae, such as the genera Ascalapha, Erebus, or Thysania), the Saturniidae contain the largest Lepidoptera, {{and some of the}} largest insects alive today.|$|R
50|$|The two Pratt & Whitney R-2800-25S Double Wasp engines {{were each}} mounted {{approximately}} one-sixth {{out on the}} <b>wing's</b> <b>span.</b> Two-stage, two-speed mechanical superchargers were fitted. In an effort to save space and weight, no turbo-superchargers were fitted, despite the expected 50 mph top speed and 10,000 ft (3,048 m) operational ceiling increases.|$|R
25|$|The {{northern}} yellow bat {{is larger}} than the southern yellow bat, and has an average body length of 14cm, weight of 14-31 g, and <b>wing</b> <b>span</b> of 35–41cm. Its body fur ranges in color from yellow orange to gray-brown, and is dark tipped. Wing membranes are generally darker than the body, and forearms are light. Unusually for Lasiurine bats, only the front half of the tail membrane is furred, and this species also lacks white markings on the shoulders and wrists.|$|E
25|$|On 31 August 1948, a fully navalised prototype, VP413, {{which was}} {{equipped}} with folding wings, catapult spools and a full armament, conducted its first flight. VP413 was quickly subjected {{to a series of}} deck assessment trials using a mockup deck at Boscombe Down. In April 1949, VP413 was transferred to the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious to conduct general deck and handling trials at sea. These trials revealed the need for the <b>wing</b> <b>span</b> to be increased by 30 inches, the low-speed handling of the prototype having been found to be lacking. In November 1949, VP413 was re-deployed to Illustrious, performing around 25 deck landings without issue.|$|E
25|$|The Merlin was {{designed}} by F.G. Miles of Philips and Powis, {{as a result of}} collaboration with G. Birkett of Birkett Air Service Ltd, and Tata Sons Ltd of India. It was based on the three-seat and four-seat versions of the M.3 Falcon, but with wider fuselage and consequent increased <b>wing</b> <b>span.</b> It was a low-wing monoplane, with fixed main undercarriage in trouser fairings plus a fixed tailwheel. Construction was mainly of wood, with spruce frames and three-ply birch covering, and the wings had hydraulically operated split flaps. It was powered by a 200hp de Havilland Gipsy Six piston engine. It was first designated M.4 Merlin, but all four examples were completed as M.4A Merlin, with fixed pitch propeller instead of the intended variable pitch unit.|$|E

50|$|Around 1570, {{the south}} {{west end of}} the Gate House was fitted with a new {{building}} that connected a gated section of wall to the south-west wing, making another courtyard. This <b>wing</b> <b>spanned</b> north-west to the main block, and from the main block extended the chapel, which had an altarpiece in the far north-west end.|$|R
50|$|In 1934 Engelbert Zaschka {{completed}} a large human-powered aircraft, the Zaschka Human-Power Aircraft. Zaschka constructed the large human-powered tractor monoplane {{with a narrow}} <b>wing</b> <b>spanning</b> about 66 feet (20 metres). On 11 July 1934 he flew his large human-powered aircraft, the Zaschka Human-Power Aircraft, about 20 meters at Berlin's Tempelhof Airport without assisted take off.|$|R
25|$|During this time, many of {{the species}} from the Carboniferous diversified, and many new orders developed, including: Protelytroptera, {{primitive}} relatives of Plecoptera (Paraplecoptera), Psocoptera, Mecoptera, Coleoptera, Raphidioptera, and Neuroptera. The last four being the first definitive records of the Holometabola. By the Pennsylvanian and well into the Permian, {{by far the most}} successful were primitive Blattoptera, or relatives of cockroaches. Six fast legs, two well-developed folding wings, fairly good eyes, long, well-developed antennae (olfactory), an omnivorous digestive system, a receptacle for storing sperm, a chitin skeleton that could support and protect, as well as a form of gizzard and efficient mouth parts, gave it formidable advantages over other herbivorous animals. About 90% of insects were cockroach-like insects ("Blattopterans"). The dragonflies Odonata were the dominant aerial predator and probably dominated terrestrial insect predation as well. True Odonata appeared in the Permian and all are amphibian. Their prototypes are the oldest winged fossils, go back to the Devonian, and are different from other wings in every way.

In 2010, Mark Witton and Michael Habib concluded that Hatzegopteryx was probably no larger than that of Q. northropi in wingspan; the initial conclusions did not account for distortion of the bone. The latter is generally estimated at [...] in length.|$|E
500|$|Speculation of Wild Eagle [...] {{began in}} March 2011 when plans to discuss Dollywood's 2012 {{attraction}} were {{submitted to the}} Pigeon Forge Planning Commission. On March 24, 2011, those plans were approved and though city officials could not tell exactly what the plans were, some believed it {{looked to be a}} roller coaster. On September 4, 2011, Wild Eagle was officially announced to the public as the first wing coaster to open in the United States. On October 7, 2011, the lift hill was completed, {{and by the end of}} October 2011, the track layout was complete. On February 28, 2012, Dollywood unveiled a steel sculpture of an eagle with a <b>wing</b> <b>span</b> of [...] and a total weight of [...] that would be placed near the entrance of the ride.

50|$|According to the {{equations}} below, a wing of infinite aspect ratio (wingspan/chord length) and constant airfoil section would produce no induced drag. The characteristics {{of such a}} wing can be measured on a section of <b>wing</b> <b>spanning</b> {{the width of a}} wind tunnel, since the walls block spanwise flow and create what is effectively two-dimensional flow.|$|R

500|$|The first prototype, He 111 V1 (W.Nr. 713, D-ADAP), {{flew from}} Rostock-Marienehe on 24 February 1935. It was {{followed}} by the civilian-equipped V2 and V4 in May 1935. The V2 (W.Nr. 715, D-ALIX) used the bomb bay as a four-seat [...] "smoking compartment", with another six seats behind it in the rear fuselage. V2 entered service with Deutsche Luft Hansa in 1936, along with six other newly built versions known as the He 111C. The He 111 V4 was unveiled to the foreign press on 10 January 1936. Nazi propaganda inflated the performance of the He 111C, announcing its maximum speed as 400km/h (249mph); in reality its performance stood at 360km/h (224mph). The He 111C-0 was a commercial version and took the form of the V4 prototype design. The first machine was designated D-AHAO [...] "Dresden". It was powered by the BMW VI engine and could manage a range (depending on the fuel capacity) of 1,000km (621mi) to 2,200km (1,367mi) and a maximum speed of 310km/h (193mph). The <b>wing</b> <b>span</b> on the C series was 22.6m (74ft 1¾in). The fuselage dimensions were 17.1m (56ft 1¾in) in the He 111 V1, but changed in the C to 17.5m (57ft 5 in). The Jumo 205 diesel powerplant replaced the BMW VI. Nevertheless, the maximum speed remained in the 220–240km/h (137–149mph) bracket. This was increased slightly when the BMW 132 engines were introduced.|$|E
