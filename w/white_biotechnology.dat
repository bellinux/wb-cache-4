In this concept, <b>white</b> <b>biotechnologies</b> are usually considered {{for the production of}} new compounds or compounds actually derived from the oil industry.

In the latest case, these molecules are concentrated in the residual medium and could be more easily recuperated. An example of this exists in the production of ethanol from beet.

40|$|<b>White</b> <b>biotechnologies</b> {{have several}} {{challenges}} to overcome {{in order to}} become a viable industrial process. Achieving highly concentrated lignocellulose materials and releasing fermentable substrates, with controlled kinetics in order to regulate micro-organism activity, present major technical and scientific bottlenecks. The degradation of the main polymeric fractions of lignocellulose into simpler molecules is a prerequisite for an integrated utilisation of this resource in a biorefinery concept. The characterisation methods and the observations developed for rheology, morphology, etc., that are reviewed here are strongly dependent on the fibrous nature of lignocellulose, are thus similar or constitute a good approach to filamentous culture broths. This review focuses on scientific works related {{to the study of the}} rheological behaviour of lignocellulose suspensions and their evolution during biocatalysis. In order to produce the targeted molecules (synthon), the lignocellulose substrates are converted by enzymatic degradation and are then metabolised by micro-organisms. The dynamics of the mechanisms is limited by coupled phenomena between flow, heat and mass transfers in regard to diffusion (within solid and liquid phases), convection (mixing, transfer coefficients, homogeneity) and specific inhibitors (concentration gradients). As lignocellulose suspensions consist of long entangled fibres for the matrix of industrial interest, they exhibit diverse and complex properties linked to this fibrous character (rheological, morphological, thermal, mechanical and biochemical parameters). Among the main variables to be studied, the rheological behaviour of such suspensions appears to be determinant for process efficiency. It is this behaviour that will determine the equipment to be used and the strategies applied (substrate and biocatalysis feed, mixing, etc.). This review provides an overview of (i) the rheological behaviour of fibrous materials in suspension, (ii) the methods and experimental conditions for their measurements, (iii) the main models used and (iv) their evolution during biocatalytic reactions with a focus on enzymatic hydrolysis...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} aim of <b>white</b> (grey) <b>biotechnology</b> is bioremediation, where microbes {{are employed}} to remove unwanted chemicals. Microcystins (MCs) and other cyanobacterial toxins are not industrial or agricultural pollutants; however, their occurrence {{as a consequence}} of human activity and water reservoir eutrophication is regarded as anthropogenic. Microbial degradation of microcystins is suggested as an alternative to chemical and physical methods of their elimination. This paper describes a possible technique of the practical application of the biodegradation process. The idea relies on the utilization of bacteria with a significantly enhanced MC-degradation ability (in comparison with wild strains). The cells of an Escherichia coli laboratory strain expressing microcystinase (MlrA) responsible for the detoxification of MCs were immobilized in alginate beads. The degradation potency of the tested bioreactors was monitored by HPLC detection of linear microcystin LR (MC-LR) as the MlrA degradation product. An open system based on a column filled with alginate-entrapped cells was shown to operate more efficiently than a closed system (alginate beads shaken in a glass container). The maximal degradation rate calculated per one liter of carrier was 219. 9 µg h− 1 of degraded MC-LR. A comparison of the efficiency of the described system with other biological and chemo-physical proposals suggests that this new idea presents several advantages and is worth investigating in future studies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Practically all organic {{chemicals}} and plastics are nowadays produced from crude {{oil and natural}} gas. However, {{it is possible to}} produce a wide range of bulk chemicals from renewable resources by application of biotechnology. This paper focuses on <b>White</b> <b>Biotechnology,</b> which makes use of bacteria (or yeasts) or enzymes for the conversion of the fermentable sugar to the target product. It is shown that <b>White</b> <b>Biotechnology</b> offers substantial savings of non-renewable energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for nearly all of the products studied. Under favorable boundary conditions up to two thirds (67 %) of the current non-renewable energy use for the production of the selected chemicals can be saved by 2050 if substantial technological progress is made and if the use of lignocellulosic feedstocks is successfully developed. The analysis for Europe (E. U. 25 countries) shows that land requirements related to <b>White</b> <b>Biotechnology</b> chemicals are not likely to become a critical issue in the next few decades, especially considering the large unused and underutilized resources in Eastern Europe. Substantial macroeconomic savings can be achieved under favourable boundary conditions. In principle, natural bacteria and enzymes can be used for <b>White</b> <b>Biotechnology</b> but, according to many experts in the fields, Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) will be necessary in order to achieve the high yields, concentrations and productivities that are required to reach economic viability.

40|$|Recent {{studies in}} science, {{technology}} and innovation show that innovations {{are the result}} of interactions in which knowledge diffuses between the actors of the system (Cooke, 2002; Hekkert et al., 2007). Knowledge diffusion is therefore essential for innovations (Lundvall, 1992). Due to the small spatial distances between the actors of the system that facilitates interactions and knowledge diffusion, the regional innovation system has gained growing attention in innovation studies and policies. Regional policies are increasingly being used to stimulate innovations in the biotechnology industry (Cooke, 2002). The biotechnology industry has been characterized as an important driver for the knowledge based economy as it is the most fast growing science based industry with relatively high product revenues and high speed advancements (EC, 2005 b). Compared to the US, Europe is lagging behind in the commercialization of academic biotechnology research (Ernst &Young, 2005; Van der Valk, 2007). This indicates a gap between biotechnology knowledge creation and commercialization of this knowledge by biotechnology firms. This thesis aims to explain knowledge diffusion between knowledge organizations and biotechnology firms on a regional level by addressing the role of firm level characteristics. The focus is on knowledge diffusion by means of subsidized R&D collaborations. The provision of subsidies for collaborations between firms and knowledge organizations is a globally used (regional) policy instrument to stimulate innovations in science based industries. The influence of firm level factors on knowledge diffusion by means of subsidized R&D collaborations between regional knowledge organizations and biotechnology firms is investigated by a case study research on all subsidized R&D collaborations of Flemish biotechnology firms and regional knowledge organizations in the period 2003 - 2007.

The unit of analysis is the (biotechnology) firm and the reached domain is all the Flemish biotechnology firms that have had subsidized R&D collaborations with regional knowledge organizations in the period of 2003 - 2007.

Moreover, it covers the total process chain for both petrochemical and bio-based products from cradle to grave.
