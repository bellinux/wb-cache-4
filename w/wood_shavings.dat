5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} <b>wood</b> <b>shavings</b> until one of the excavators found two stuck together and peeled them apart to discover writing on the inside. They {{were taken to the}} epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable {{by the time he was}} able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable. However, Alan Bowman at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of cursive script and were able to produce transcriptions.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel {{on the front and}} little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from <b>wood</b> <b>shavings</b> and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E

25|$|Much wood collage art is {{considerably}} smaller in scale, framed and hung as a painting would be. It usually features pieces of wood, <b>wood</b> <b>shavings,</b> or scraps, assembled on a canvas (if there is painting involved), or {{on a wooden}} board. Such framed, picture-like, wood-relief collages offer the artist an opportunity to explore the qualities of depth, natural color, and textural variety inherent in the material, while drawing on and {{taking advantage of the}} language, conventions, and historical resonances that arise from the tradition of creating pictures to hang on walls. The technique of wood collage is also sometimes combined with painting and other media in a single work of art.|$|E

25|$|From about July 1942 {{to about}} September 1943, {{experiments}} {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of sulfonamide, a synthetic antimicrobial agent, were conducted at Ravensbrück. Wounds inflicted on the subjects were infected with bacteria such as Streptococcus, Clostridium perfringens (a major causative agent in gas gangrene) and Clostridium tetani, the causative agent in tetanus. Circulation of blood was interrupted by tying off blood vessels {{at both ends of}} the wound to create a condition similar to that of a battlefield wound. Infection was aggravated by forcing <b>wood</b> <b>shavings</b> and ground glass into the wounds. The infection was treated with sulfonamide and other drugs to determine their effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|The Lego Group {{began in}} the {{carpentry}} workshop of Ole Kirk Christiansen, in Billund, Denmark. In 1916, Christiansen purchased a woodworking shop in Billund which had been in business since 1895. The shop mostly helped construct houses and furniture, and had a small staff of apprentices. The workshop burned down in 1924 when a fire ignited some <b>wood</b> <b>shavings.</b> Ole Kirk constructed a larger workshop, and worked towards expanding his business even further. When the Great Depression hit, Ole Kirk had fewer customers and had to focus on smaller projects. He began producing miniature versions of his products as design aids. It was these miniature models of stepladders and ironing boards that inspired him to begin producing toys.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} modern {{commercial}} processes was the [...] "fast method" [...] or [...] "German method", first practised in Germany in 1823. In this process, fermentation {{takes place in a}} tower packed with <b>wood</b> <b>shavings</b> or charcoal. The alcohol-containing feed is trickled into the top of the tower, and fresh air supplied from the bottom by either natural or forced convection. The improved air supply in this process cut the time to prepare vinegar from months to weeks.|$|E

500|$|Domestic {{guinea pigs}} {{generally}} live in cages, although some owners {{of large numbers}} of guinea pigs dedicate entire rooms to their pets. Cages with solid or wire mesh floors are used, although wire mesh floors can cause injury and may be associated with an infection commonly known as bumblefoot (ulcerative pododermatitis). [...] "Cubes and Coroplast" [...] (or C) style cages are now a common choice. Cages are often lined with <b>wood</b> <b>shavings</b> or a similar material. Bedding made from red cedar (Eastern or Western) and pine, both softwoods, were commonly used in the past, but these materials are now believed to contain harmful phenols (aromatic hydrocarbons) and oils. Safer beddings made from hardwoods (such as aspen), paper products, and corn cob materials are other alternatives. Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them, and their urine sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces, making it difficult to remove. After its cage has been cleaned, a guinea pig typically urinates and drags its lower body across the floor of the cage to mark its territory. Male guinea pigs may also mark their territory in this way when they are taken out of their cages.|$|E

500|$|Richard and Molly had ten children. The first child, Mary, {{was born}} in 1794. She was {{followed}} by another girl, who died almost at once; Joseph in 1796; and another son in 1798, who died in infancy. In December that year, the oldest child, then four years old, died after her clothes caught fire, possibly while adding <b>wood</b> <b>shavings</b> to the fire. The incident {{was reported in the}} Bath Chronicle on 27 December 1798: [...] "A child, four years of age of Mr. R. Anning, a cabinetmaker of Lyme, was left by the mother for about five minutes ... in a room where there were some shavings ... The girl's clothes caught fire and she was so dreadfully burnt as to cause her death." [...] When another daughter was born just five months later, she was named Mary after her dead sister. More children were born after her, but none of them survived {{more than a couple of}} years. Only Mary and Joseph survived to adulthood. The high childhood mortality rate for the Anning family was not very unusual. Almost half the children born in Britain throughout the 19th century died before the age of 5, and in the crowded living conditions of early 19th century Lyme Regis, infant deaths from diseases like smallpox and measles were particularly common.|$|E
500|$|In 1960, {{there was}} a major fire which burned down most of the station area.

The fire was {{discovered}} by Station Master Mons Almenningen, who immediately notified Bergen Station, Myrdal Station, and Finse Station. The morning expresses in both directions were en route to Hallingskeid, with the east-bound train about half an hour away. It was forced to turn around at Myrdal, and the passengers were bused from Voss Station across the mountain. A train with a fire engine containing [...] of water was sent from Myrdal and a fire engine was dispatched from Finse, but the fire spread quickly and within an hour the station building, the guard house and [...] of tunnel had burnt down.

500|$|Hollows can be [...] {{deep and}} [...] wide, with {{a base of}} woodchips. A chance felling of a {{eucalypt}} {{known to have been}} used as a nesting tree near Scottsdale in northeastern Tasmania allowed accurate measurements to be made, yielding a hollow measuring [...] high by [...] wide at the mouth, and at least [...] deep, in a tree which measured [...] in diameter below the hollow. Both the male and female prepare the hollow for breeding, which involves peeling or scraping off <b>wood</b> <b>shavings</b> from the inside the hollow to prepare bedding for the eggs. Gum leaves are occasionally added as well. The clutch consists of one or two white lustreless rounded oval eggs which may have the occasional lime nodule. The first egg averages around 47 or 48mm long and 37mm in diameter (2 × 1.4in). The second egg is around 2mm smaller all over and is laid two to seven days later. The female incubates the eggs alone and begins after the completion of laying. She enters the hollow feet first, and is visited by the male who brings food two to four times a day. Later both parents help to raise the chicks. The second chick is neglected and usually perishes in infancy. Information on the breeding of birds in the wild is lacking; however, the incubation period in captivity is 28–31days. Newly hatched chicks are covered with yellow down and have pink beaks that fade to a greyish white by the time of fledging. Chicks fledge from the nest three months after hatching, and remain in the company of their parents until the next breeding season.|$|E
