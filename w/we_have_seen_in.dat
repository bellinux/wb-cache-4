25|$|First, the Legio Maria church {{recognises}} salvation through Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The discontinuity with orthodox {{theology is}} that the Son of God has been incarnated in multiple contexts, rejecting the orthodox doctrine of Christ taking a human body and soul for eternity. As <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the above research, none of these incarnations are considered exclusive; they only serve to reveal Christ to people of different contexts. All who are saved through any of these incarnations of Christ will worship God together in heaven. Thus, for the Legio Church, salvation is found through Christ, as revealed in their particular Messias Simeo Ondeto.|$|E

25|$|In another {{paper with}} Simon Johnson at Massachusetts Institute of Technology called The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation, the authors use a natural {{experiment}} {{in history to}} show that different institutions result in different levels of economic growth. The paper examines institutional choices {{during the colonial period}} of several nations in relation to the same nations' economic development today. It found that in countries where the disease environment meant that it was hard for colonizers to survive (high mortality rate), they tended to set up extractive regimes, which resulted in poor economic growth today. In places where it was easier for colonizers to survive (low mortality rates), however, they tended to settle down and duplicate institutions from their country of origin—especially from Britain, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the colonial success of Australia and United States. Thus, the mortality rate among colonial settlers several hundred years ago has determined the economic growth of today's post-colonial nations by setting institutions on very different paths.|$|E

In his review of the episode, Dan Iverson of IGN wrote: [...] "After a couple more episodes like the one that Family Guy had on Sunday night, we could officially and unequivocally call the show the best animated program to air on the weekend", adding [...] "we are completely willing to raise the once hit-or-miss comedy of Family Guy to the level of most consistently funny comedy on FOX Sunday nights— and that is thanks to great stories and hilarious comedy like that of this week's episode [...] "Barely Legal." [...] In a review of Family Guy, Volume five, Nancy Basile regarded [...] "Airport '07", [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", and [...] "Barely Legal" [...] as [...] "gem episodes". Brett Love of TV Squad commented: [...] "It seemed like more of a cohesive story than <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> a while as the whole family was tied in to the same storyline", later adding [...] "I liked the story of Meg's infatuation with Brian", concluding with [...] "overall, I'd call this one a really good episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle {{was fairly}} well {{received}} by reviewers, who {{described it as}} a treat for Clamp fans due to the large number of crossover characters in the series. Initial fan response to Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle was that it was [...] "Cardcaptor Sakura for guys". Fans speculated that the series would conclude one of Clamp's unfinished series, X, or {{that it would be a}} sequel to Cardcaptor Sakura that focused on the character Syaoran Li. Critics described the series as being marked by several plot twists, with About.com writer Katherine Luther labelling it as [...] "perhaps the [...] "twistiest" [...] of twists that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> anime and manga in quite some time". For the earlier half of the series, Mikhail Koulikov from Anime News Network described the series as settling into a [...] "predictable pattern" [...] that Melissa Harper, also from Anime News Network, described as somewhat slow, and [...] "frankly a bit boring". However, Michael Aronson from Manga Life found the series appealing and accessible to readers who have not read other Clamp series, and he hoped it would remain this accessible for following volumes. He found that the relation between Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle and xxxHolic would persuade readers to also read the latter series. Mania Entertainment's Megan Lavey found the introduction to be a [...] "pretty simple love story", while liking the characters' personalities. She liked how the series was connected with xxxHolic and hoped that both series would continue crossing over. In a general overview of the manga, Julie Gray from Comic Book Bin gave positive remarks to the characters' complex personalities and how the plot has been developed throughout its first ten volumes. She recommended that people should buy the series. Active Anime's Blake Waymire found that the change of settings was well done, and he noted how some story arcs could go from dramatic to charming.|$|E

2500|$|It is true {{that these}} general ideas occur in all the old liturgies; {{but in this case}} a {{remarkable}} identity is found even in the words. Some allusions to what were probably older forms in the Canon make the similarity still more striking. Thus Optatus of Mileve says that Mass is offered [...] "pro ecclesiâ, quæ una est et toto orbe terrarum diffusa" [...] (Adv. Parm., III, xii). This represents exactly a Latin version of the [...] "holy Church which is in all the world" [...] that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the Syrian Anaphora above. The Syrian use adds a prayer for [...] "our religious kings and queens" [...] after that for the patriarch and bishop. So the Roman Missal long contained the words [...] "et pro rege nostro N." [...] after [...] "et Antistite nostro N." [...] (see below). It has a prayer for the celebrant himself (Brightman, 90), where the Roman Missal once contained just such a prayer (below). The treatise [...] "De Sacramentis" [...] gives the words on Institution for the Chalice as [...] "Hic est sanguis meus", just as does the Syrian Liturgy.|$|E
