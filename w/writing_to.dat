50|$|Write-once media such as DVD-R and CD-R have {{limitations}} when being <b>written</b> <b>to,</b> in {{that each}} physical block {{can only be}} <b>written</b> <b>to</b> once, and the writing must happen incrementally.

50|$|The {{system in}} Example 4 is not {{processor}} consistent, because some writes {{by the same}} processor are seen out of order by other processors.

The fact that the only writes seen in order are <b>writes</b> <b>to</b> the same memory location limits this example to Cache Consistency.|$|R

After watching some of the tape, the Bundys realize that the couple having sex on the video is Steve and Marcy. Although Al is disgusted, the action turns Peggy on and the couple has sex.|$|E

5|$|Correspondence between Chesney and {{his nephew}} Gilbert Foliot {{suggests}} {{their relationship was}} quite close. Foliot strongly supported his uncle's candidacy for Lincoln, <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> Pope Eugene III to encourage papal approval of the election. Foliot later ordered {{a copy of the}} Digest for his uncle, which demonstrates Chesney's interest in Roman law. Some of Archbishop Theobald's letters, written to Chesney and recorded in John of Salisbury's collection of letters, contain the earliest recorded quotations from Gratian's Decretum in an English source. They were part of a letter sent by Theobald to Chesney discussing difficult legal cases, and giving advice on how to resolve them.|$|E
5|$|Dorothy soon fell in {{love with}} Pound. In late 1909 and early 1910 Olivia and Dorothy {{attended}} his lectures at the London Polytechnic Institution; in June 1910 they joined him in Sirmione, Italy. For reasons unclear to biographers Olivia forbade the two from <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> each other during his extended visit to New York from 1910-11. Despite the restriction Dorothy seems to have considered herself engaged to Pound, although uncertain whether he intended to stay in New York or return to London.|$|E
5|$|Early in Becket's exile, Robert {{received}} a papal censure {{for not doing}} more to support Becket. In summer 1165, Robert accompanied Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of London, on a papal mission to King Henry, to convey to the king Pope Alexander's complaints about the king's behaviour. The king had been preventing his subjects from visiting or appealing to the papacy, and Alexander wished to protest against that, as well as against the king's treatment of Becket. In 1166, Becket tried to convince Robert to switch sides, <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> Robert in conciliatory tones. John of Salisbury, a supporter of Becket's, prevailed upon two French academics to write to Robert, criticising him for hypocrisy.|$|E

5|$|However, Markham {{had second}} thoughts, {{and was soon}} <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> the current RGS president, Leonard Darwin, to express disbelief about Shackleton's claimed latitudes, repeating these doubts to Scott. Historians have surmised that Scott was Markham's protégé, and {{that the old man}} resented polar glory going to someone else. Whatever his reason, Markham adopted a {{bitterness}} towards Shackleton which he retained {{for the rest of his}} life. He is said to have crossed out all favourable references to Shackleton in his own notes on the Discovery expedition, and to have virtually ignored Shackleton's achievements in a 1912 address to the British Association. He was equally dismissive in his history of Antarctic exploration, The Lands of Silence (published posthumously in 1921).|$|E
5|$|In 1892, {{while in}} Omaha, Nebraska, Rose met a young Virginian named Gray Latham, whom she married in 1896.

After Latham's father went to Mexico to make films, he went to Bonniebrook in 1896. Concerned with the welfare of her family, O'Neill sent much of her paycheck home.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Riley's doctor {{diagnosed}} {{him with}} neurasthenia, a nervous disorder, and recommended {{long periods of}} rest as a cure. Riley remained ill {{for the rest of}} his life and relied on his landlords and family to aid in his care. During the winter months he moved to Miami, Florida, and during summer spent time with his family in Greenfield. He made only a few trips during the decade, including one to Mexico in 1906. He became very depressed by his condition, <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> his friends that he thought he could die at any moment, and often used alcohol for relief.|$|E
