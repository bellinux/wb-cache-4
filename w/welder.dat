40|$|<b>Welders</b> {{exposure}} to nickel and hexavalent chromium in welding fumes {{is associated with}} increase of cancer risk in <b>welders.</b> In this study we calculated cancer risk due to {{exposure to}} these compounds in <b>welders.</b> The role of exposure parameters in <b>welders</b> on derived incremental lifetime cancer risk were determined by stochastic modeling of cancer risk. Input parameters were determined by field investigation in Iranian <b>welders</b> in 2013 and literature review. The 90 % upper band cancer risk due to hexavalent chromium and nickel exposure was {{in the range of}} 6. 03 E- 03 to 2. 12 E- 02 and 7. 18 E- 03 to 2. 61 E- 02 respectively. Scenario analysis showed that asthmatic and project <b>welders</b> are significantly at higher cancer risk in comparison with other <b>welders</b> (P< 0. 05). Shift duration was responsible for 37 % and 33 % of variances for hexavalent chromium and nickel respectively. <b>Welders</b> are at high and unacceptable risk of cancer. Control measures according to scenario analysis findings are advisable...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The {{respiratory}} {{effects of}} exposure to welding fumes have been investigated in numerous studies; but results of these studies have not been consistent. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the respiratory effects of welding exposure in a large group of manual are <b>welders</b> exposed primarily to mild steel welding processes in confined spaces without respiratory protection. METHODS [...] Respiratory symptoms and spirometry were studied in 110 <b>welders</b> and 55 controls. The <b>welders</b> and controls were of similar average age and height; smoking habits of the groups were similar. Chest x ray films were taken to exclude people with radiological abnormalities that may influence pulmonary function tests. <b>Welders</b> were grouped according to smoking habits and duration of employment (20 years). RESULTS [...] No gross radiological abnormalities were found. Respiratory symptoms and chronic bronchitis were more prevalent in <b>welders</b> (P < 0. 05). <b>Welders</b> who were smokers showed a higher frequency of chronic bronchitis than controls who smoked (P < 0. 05). No significant difference in the occurrence of chronic bronchitis was found between <b>welders</b> who smoked and <b>welders</b> who were non-smokers or exsmokers. Compared with the controls, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and maximum midexpiratory flow (MMEF) were significantly lower in <b>welders</b> (mean values of FVC for <b>welders</b> and controls were 86. 06 (25. 74) and 96. 40 (13. 03); and values for FEV 1 were 87. 54 (13. 70) and 95. 36 (12. 40) respectively; P < 0. 01). There was no significant difference in pulmonary function tests between <b>welders</b> who were non-smokers and controls who were non-smokers; whereas FVC, FEV 1, PEF, and MMEF were significantly lower in <b>welders</b> who smoked than controls who smoked (P < 0. 01). There were no significant differences in pulmonary function tests and occurrence of chronic bronchitis between <b>welders</b> with more or less than 20 years at work.

40|$|<b>Welders</b> in {{this study}} were {{selected}} from a vehicle manufacturer; control subjects were from a nearby food factory. Airborne manganese levels in the breathing zones of <b>welders</b> and controls were 1. 45 SD 1. 08 mg/m 3 and 0. 11 0. 07 g/m 3, respectively. Serum levels of manganese and iron in <b>welders</b> were 4. 3 -fold and 1. 9 -fold, respectively, higher than those of controls. Blood lead concentrations in <b>welders</b> increased 2. 5 -fold, whereas serum zinc levels decreased 1. 2 -fold, in comparison with controls. Linear regression revealed the lack of associ-ations between blood levels of five metals and <b>welder’s</b> age. Furthermore, <b>welders</b> had erythrocytic superoxide dismutase activity and serum malondialdehyde levels 24 % less and 78 % higher, respectively, than those of controls. These findings suggest that occupational exposure to welding fumes among <b>welders</b> disturbs the homeostasis of trace elements in systemic circulation and induces oxidative stress.

5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc <b>welder</b> to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The <b>welder</b> was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not {{show up in the}} deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine wires could be used as support.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the <b>welder.</b> The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The <b>welder</b> judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E

The median exposures to HCr compounds were 0. 23, 0. 20, and 0. 08 microg/m(3), respectively. Median concentrations of TCr in urine, blood plasma and erythrocytes were elevated in all <b>welders,</b> compared with the corresponding median concentrations in the reference group (p< 0. 005). The TCr levels observed in plasma were two-fold higher in <b>welders</b> of SS and HAS than in <b>welders</b> of MS (p< 0. 01). Exposure to HCr as indicated by median total content of Cr in erythrocytes was 10 microg/L in <b>welders</b> of SS, MS and HAS. Uptake of TCr during the shift was confirmed for <b>welders</b> of SS by a median increase of urinary TCr from pre- to post-shift of 0. 30 microg/g creatinine.

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} is {{most commonly used}} to weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as aluminum and magnesium, {{but it can be}} applied to nearly all metals, with a notable exception being zinc and its alloys. Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because of process restrictions, but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding. Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the <b>welder</b> and the materials being welded.|$|E
5|$|Once the arc is struck, the <b>welder</b> {{moves the}} torch {{in a small}} circle to create a welding pool, the size of which depends {{on the size of}} the {{electrode}} and the amount of current.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} workplace exposure and its duration on respiratory symptoms, atopic status, ventilatory capacity, and bronchial responsiveness in <b>welders.</b> Material and Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study including 39 males working as stainless steel <b>welders</b> and {{an equal number of}} male office workers matched by age, duration of employment and smoking status. Respiratory symptoms and detailed smoking history were recorded by questionnaire. Evaluation of examined subjects included skin prick tests to common inhalant allergens, spirometry, and histamine challenge. Results: We found non-significantly higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms in the last 12 months in <b>welders</b> with significant difference for cough (P = 0. 043) and phlegm (P = 0. 009). Prevalence of sensitization to common inhalant allergens was similar in both <b>welders</b> and controls.

40|$|Background: Welding {{can produce}} {{dangerous}} fumes containing various metals especially carcinogenic ones. Occupational exposure to welding fumes {{is associated with}} lung cancer. Therefore, <b>welders</b> in Gas Transmission Pipelines are known as a high-risk group. This {{study was designed to}} determinate the amounts of metals Cr, Ni, and Cd in breathing zone and urine of <b>welders</b> and to assess the possibility of introducing urinary metals as a biomarker due to occupational exposure. Methods: In this cross sectional study, 94 individuals from Gas Transmission Pipelines <b>welders,</b> Iran, Borujen in 2011 were selected and classified into 3 groups including <b>Welders,</b> Back <b>Welders</b> and Assistances. The sampling procedures were performed according to NIOSH 7300 for total chromium, nickel, and cadmium and NIOSH 7600 for Cr+ 6. For all participants urine samples were collected during the entire work shift and metals in urine were determined according to NIOSH 8310. Results: Back <b>Welders</b> and Assistances groups had maximum and minimum exposure to total fume and its elements, respectively. In addition, results showed that there are significant differences (P< 0. 05) between <b>Welders</b> and Back <b>Welders</b> with Assistances group in exposure with total fume and elements except Ni. Urinary concentrations of three metals including Cr, Cd and Ni among all <b>welders</b> were about 4. 5, 12 and 14 -fold greater than those detected in controls, respectively. Weak correlations were found between airborne and urinary metals concentrations (R 2 : Cr= 0. 45, Cd= 0. 298, Ni= 0. 362).
