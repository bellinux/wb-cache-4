5|$|Despite {{numerous}} mistakes, Villani often displayed an insider's {{knowledge on}} many subjects, {{as a result}} of his extensive travels and access to both official and private documents. For example, De Vries states that he wrote one of the most accurate accounts of the Battle of Crécy during the Hundred Years' War, including information that the archers were placed precariously behind the English and Welsh infantry, not on the flanks as others asserted. While describing detailed events unfolding within the city, Villani would name every individual street, square, bridge, family, and person involved, assuming his readers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> intimate knowledge of Florence as he did.|$|E
5|$|Stanton's {{position}} {{caused a}} significant rift {{between herself and}} many civil rights leaders, particularly Frederick Douglass, who believed that white women, already empowered by their connection to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. According to Douglass, their treatment as slaves entitled the now liberated African American men, who lacked women's indirect empowerment, to voting rights before women were granted the franchise. African American women, he believed, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> degree of empowerment as white women once African American men had the vote; hence, general female suffrage was, according to Douglass, of less concern than black male suffrage.|$|E
5|$|The {{light rail}} model {{would have used}} the same {{approach}} as the tram in Ørestad, but would instead have run through a tunnel in the city centre. The tunnel sections would be shorter, but the diameter larger {{because it would have}} to accommodate overhead wires. The system <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> frequency as the tram, but use double trams and would therefore require larger stations. The metro solution was chosen because it combined the highest average speeds, the highest passenger capacity, the lowest visual and noise impact, and the lowest number of accidents. Despite requiring the highest investment, it had the highest net present value.|$|E

5|$|There are {{alternative}} uses of {{food power}} as well. An importer can refuse to continue import unless political concessions are made. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> effects that an exporter refusing to export would have. An {{example of this}} would be American reduction of the Cuban sugar quota. In simple terms, the demand concentration (one importer being the dominant buyer) and supply dispersion (several exporters competing to sell the same product) an importer can try to use this exchange politically to their favor; this is especially effective if the exporter has little else so export (low action independence).|$|E
5|$|From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can {{be driven}} by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an {{overlapping}} minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability. In the reverse case a DVI-D monitor <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> level of basic interoperability unless there are content protection issues with High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space YCbCr which is not possible in DVI, instead of RGB. An HDMI source such as a Blu-ray player may demand HDCP-compliance of the display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display. A further complication {{is that there is}} a small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{negative}} reception, the Wii version has had some positive reception. While Official Nintendo Magazine UK editor Tom East similarly bemoaned the motion controls, {{he felt that the}} multiplayer still held up, as it becomes balanced since the other players <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> problems with the controls. 1UP.com editor Justin Haywald agreed, stating that while it made single player modes difficult, the game was meant to be played with friends. Game Informer editor Matt Helgeson, however, found the motion controls to be good, commenting that other developers should learn from Nintendo. In spite of this, fellow Game Informer editor Matthew Kato described the controls as being only so-so. GameShark editor Danielle Riendeau, however, described the controls as excellent, though adding that it occasionally misreads her shots. In the first four days of the Wii version's release in Japan, Mario Power Tennis sold 56,000 copies. By January 3, 2010, it had sold 205,070 copies in Japan.|$|E

5|$|In the gas phase, the {{alkaline}} earth metals do not usually form covalently bonded diatomic molecules like the alkali metals do, since such molecules <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number of electrons in the bonding and antibonding orbitals {{and would have}} very low dissociation energies. Thus, the M–M bonding in these molecules is predominantly through van der Waals forces. The metal–metal bond lengths in these M2 molecules increase down the group from Ca2 to Ubn2. On the other hand, their metal–metal bond-dissociation energies generally increase from Ca2 to Ba2 and then drop precipitously to Ubn2, which should be the most weakly bound of all the group 2 homodiatomic molecules. The cause of this trend is the increasing participation of the p3/2 and d electrons {{as well as the}} relativistically contracted s orbital. From these M2 dissociation energies, the enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub) of unbinilium is predicted to be 150kJ·mol−1.|$|E
5|$|The {{negotiations}} were inaugurated on 15 July 1963 at the Kremlin with Khrushchev in attendance. Khrushchev reiterated that the Anglo-American inspection plan {{would amount to}} espionage, effectively dismissing {{the possibility of a}} comprehensive ban. Following the script of his 3 July 1963 speech, Khrushchev did not demand a simultaneous moratorium on underground testing and instead proposed a non-aggression pact. Under instruction from Washington, Harriman replied that the US would explore the possibility of a non-aggression pact in good faith, but indicated that while a test ban could be quickly completed, a non-aggression pact would require lengthy discussions. Additionally, such a pact would complicate the issue of Western access to West Berlin. Harriman also took the opportunity to propose a non-proliferation agreement with would bar the transfer of nuclear weapons between countries. Khrushchev said that such an agreement should be considered in the future, but in the interim, a test ban <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> effect on limiting proliferation.|$|E

25|$|Supporters modeled a nonthermal plasma. The {{justification}} is {{the high}} amount of scattering in the device center. Without a magnetic field, electrons scatter in this region. They claimed that this scattering leads to a monoenergetic distribution, like the one shown in Figure 6. This argument is supported by 2 dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Bussard argued that constant electron injection <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> effect. Such a distribution would help maintain a negative voltage in the center, improving performance.|$|E

These {{were given the}} designation CT-145 under the CF's identification system and were used as multi-engine trainers, replacing Douglas C-47s. One was subsequently returned to the lessor and a third Model 200 placed into service in order that the two aircraft used <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> cockpit layout. The two aircraft were replaced by eight civilian-operated 90 Model King Airs in 1995.|$|E

URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet (better characterised as Uniform Resource Identifiers) although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> DOI name.|$|E

25|$|While Lévy {{defines the}} notion of optimal sharing, he does not provide an {{algorithm}} to do it. In Vincent van Oostrom, Kees-Jan van de Looij, and Marijn Zwitserlood's paper , they provide such an algorithm by transforming lambda terms into interaction nets, which are then reduced. Roughly speaking, the resulting reduction is optimal because every term that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> labels as per Lévy's paper would also be the same graph in the interaction net. In the paper, they mention that their prototype implementation of Lambdascope performs {{as well as the}} optimised version of the reference optimal higher order machine BOHM.|$|E
25|$|Douglass thought such a {{strategy}} was too risky, that there was barely enough support for black men's suffrage. He feared that linking the cause of women's suffrage to that of black men would result in failure for both. Douglass argued that white women, already empowered by their social connections to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. African-American women, he believed, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> degree of empowerment as white women once African-American men had the vote. Douglass assured the American women that at no time had he ever argued against women's right to vote.|$|E

They last appeared in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final in 1994. Down had however beaten Kerry, the reigning All-Ireland Senior Football Champions, in their 2010 quarter-final. Ahead of the 2010 final Down had also won all five All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Finals {{in which they had}} featured throughout their history.

25|$|A way for {{reducing}} this number is to disallow {{the generation of}} some tableau based on their internal structure. An example is the condition of regularity: if a branch contains a literal, using an expansion rule that generates the same literal is useless because the branch containing two copies of the literals <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> set of formulae of the original one. This expansion can be disallowed because if a closed tableau exists, {{it can be found}} without it. This restriction is structural because it can be checked by looking at the structure of the tableau to expand only.|$|E
25|$|The {{half-life}} of the radioisotopes {{produced by}} fusion {{tends to be}} less than those from fission, so that the inventory decreases more rapidly. Unlike fission reactors, whose waste remains radioactive for thousands of years, most of the radioactive material in a fusion reactor would be the reactor core itself, which would be dangerous for about 50 years, and low-level waste for another 100. Although this waste will be considerably more radioactive during those 50 years than fission waste, the very short half-life makes the process very attractive, as the waste management is fairly straightforward. By 500 years the material <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> radiotoxicity as coal ash.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} minimalist {{approach to}} change provides for removing the sovereign and retaining the governor-general. The most notable model {{of this type}} is the McGarvie Model, while Copernican models replace the monarch with a directly-elected figurehead. These Copernican models allow for regular and periodic elections {{for the office of}} head of state while limiting the reserve powers to the appointed governor-general only. A popularly elected head of state <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> powers as the monarch, but he or she could not dismiss the prime minister.
