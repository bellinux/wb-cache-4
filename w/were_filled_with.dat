5|$|In the Jamia Hafsa complex, {{damage was}} extensive, with {{thousands}} of bullet holes in the courtyard. The basement was blackened from rockets. The main buildings of the complex were structurally intact, but the boundary walls had been breached in several places. The building had bullet marks in its cement structure. The two courtyards inside the school <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> shattered glass and spent rounds. Piles of the girls' bed rolls and stacks of books were piled against walls.|$|E

5|$|Ninety {{percent or}} more of {{smallpox}} cases among unvaccinated persons were of the ordinary type. In this form of the disease, by {{the second day of the}} rash the macules became raised papules. By the third or fourth day the papules filled with an opalescent fluid to become vesicles. This fluid became opaque and turbid within 24–48 hours, giving them the appearance of pustules; however, the so-called pustules <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> tissue debris, not pus.|$|E
5|$|The Germans finally flanked the American {{forces at}} dusk, {{capturing}} them. Only one American, a forward artillery observer, was killed, while 14 were wounded: German casualties totaled 92. The Germans paused, believing the woods <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> more Americans and tanks. Only when SS-Standartenführer Joachim Peiper and his Panzer tanks arrived at midnight, twelve hours behind schedule, did the Germans learn the nearby woods were empty.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{partially}} inspired by Coyle's father, a kind but belligerent {{man who had}} considered becoming a priest in his early life. The script won the McKnight Screenwriting Fellowship from the IFP Minnesota Center for Media Arts. Into Temptation was filmed and set in Coyle's hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Several supporting roles <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> actors from the Minneapolis – Saint Paul theater area, and Coyle himself performed in a supporting role.|$|E

5|$|As a {{steamship}} line connecting northern {{cities and}} the south, the Old Bay Line hauled a considerable volume of freight between the two regions and their ships' cargo holds <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> bales of cotton, produce, and other goods. When hostilities commenced, Southern ports were blockaded by the Federal Navy and the Old Bay Line was unable to serve Norfolk {{for the duration of}} the war, going no further south than Old Point Comfort. Passenger traffic as well as cargo shipping declined significantly. The Powhatan Line discontinued operations altogether between Norfolk and Richmond until the war's end.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 the Armenian Academy of Sciences began major {{excavations}} of the Garni fortress site led by Babken Arakelyan. Architectural historian Alexander Sahinian {{focused on}} the temple itself. It was not until almost twenty years later, on December 10, 1968, that the Soviet Armenian government approved the reconstruction plan of the temple. A group led by Sahinian began reconstruction works in January 1969. It was completed by 1975, almost 300 {{years after it was}} destroyed in an earthquake. The temple was almost entirely rebuilt using its original stones, except the missing pieces which <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> blank stones intended to be easily recognisable. In 1978 a monument dedicated to Sahinian was erected not far from the temple.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} days of the fight, to the west of Sangju, Major John R. Woolridge, one of the regiment's senior officers, set up a check point west of the town and stopped every vehicle coming from the west, taking off stragglers {{attempting}} to retreat. Many jeeps <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> six or seven men claiming they were retreating after their position was overrun. He averaged about 75 stragglers a day, and 150 on the last day of the battle. A contingent of military police were dispatched specifically to collect men abandoning their positions and to return them to the front.|$|E

5|$|Lit torches (burning sticks) {{were likely}} the {{earliest}} form of incendiary device. They {{were followed by}} incendiary arrows, which were used throughout the ancient and medieval periods. The simplest flaming arrows had oil- or resin-soaked tows tied just below the arrowhead and were effective against wooden structures. Both the Assyrians and the Judeans used fire arrows at the siege of Lachish in 701 BC. More sophisticated devices were developed by the Romans which had iron boxes and tubes which <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> incendiary substances and attached to arrows or spears. These arrows needed to be shot from loose bows, since swift flight extinguished the flame; spears could be launched by hand or throwing machine.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania regained its {{independence}} on February 16, 1918 {{and the old}} fortress was placed under engineering staff supervision. Those materials {{that had not been}} taken by the Germans were used to resupply Lithuanian military needs, and for the construction of the armored train Gediminas, named after the 14th century Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas. In 1920, the Kaunas Fortress Board was formed and charged with the task of administering the fortress. Due to the development of new military technologies, its reconstruction was seen as a vast and inappropriate expense. The fortress' armament was dismantled and the trenches <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> scrap iron.|$|E
5|$|Niccolò Massa {{discovered}} in 1536 that the ventricles <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> fluid. Archiangelo Piccolomini of Rome {{was the first}} to distinguish between the cerebrum and cerebral cortex. In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published his seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica. The seventh book covered the brain and eye, with detailed images of the ventricles, cranial nerves, pituitary gland, meninges, structures of the eye, the vascular supply to the brain and spinal cord, and an image of the peripheral nerves. Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function, arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans, but no true intelligence.|$|E

According to {{preliminary}} {{information from the}} NTSB, the flight plans that <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> Transport Canada was to fly to Pelee, Ontario. It is currently unclear how the plane got to Nashville International Airport. Around 3AM Eastern time, the plane crashed on runway 2C. The burned wreckage on runway 2C went unnoticed for nearly six hours before being spotted by another general aviation aircraft. There was dense fog at the airport {{at the time of}} the accident The sole occupant, the pilot, was killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperial}} {{courts of}} the emperor's palace <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist {{as well as}} a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} invasion threat passed, but {{the castle}} was reinforced in 1558, due to fresh concerns of a French attack. Around 1570, the main bastions <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> earth, probably to allow heavier guns to be mounted on them, and Queen Elizabeth I inspected the castle in 1573. The defences {{along the coast}} were mobilised in 1588 {{in response to the}} threat posed by the Spanish armada, and were probably kept ready for action throughout the rest of Elizabeth's reign.|$|E

For this reason, control of particle size distribution can be quite important in the choice of aggregate; appropriate simulations or experiments are necessary to determine the optimal proportions of different-sized particles.|$|R
