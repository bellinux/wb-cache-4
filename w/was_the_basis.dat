5|$|Codex Vaticanus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} manuscripts for the text of the Septuagint and Greek New Testament. It is a leading example of the Alexandrian text-type. It was used by Westcott and Hort in their edition, The New Testament in the Original Greek (1881), and it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for their text. All critical editions of the New Testament published after Westcott and Hort were closer in the Gospels to the Codex Vaticanus text than to the Sinaiticus, with only the exception of Hermann von Soden's editions which are closer to Sinaiticus. All editions of Nestle-Aland remain close in textual character to the text of Westcott-Hort, which means Vaticanus <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for the translation.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni da Udine {{painted in}} Raphael's {{workshop}} in the 16th century. His Mistle Thrush and Alpine Chough was a sketch for his Bird with Garland and Fruit, and {{this in turn}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for a Raphael fresco in the Apostolic Palace.|$|E
5|$|In a {{panoramic}} camera, the focal-plane shutter {{was replaced by}} a rotation of 180° of the lens itself. This model <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for the Doppel-Sport Panoramic Camera, which Neubronner tried to market around 1910. It captured {{a panoramic}} view on 3cm×8cm film. It never went into serial production, though.|$|E

A subsequent printed version (the Aldine edition) was published at Venice in 1516, and this was followed closely by an edition edited by Desiderius Erasmus, and published by Johann Froben in Basel in 1518.|$|E
5|$|A raw 3D {{model of}} Jacob's wolf <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for {{creating}} the others. A muscle system, which gave the appearance of muscles firing and flexing, contributed to this model. From there, the initial fur layout went to painters who were responsible for its color and groom. They also added characteristics, such as wet hair clumping together, and applied it to the fur. They refined this look before passing it off to the lighting and technical directors.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 {{election}} Bruce's {{government was}} returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed {{the leadership of the}} ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis. This doctrine <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of his appeals to the public for the next year and a half.|$|E

5|$|Berkman {{was born}} in Vilna in the Russian Empire (present-day Vilnius, Lithuania) and emigrated to the United States in 1888. He lived in New York City, where he became {{involved}} in the anarchist movement. He was the one-time lover and lifelong friend of anarchist Emma Goldman. In 1892, undertaking an act of propaganda of the deed, Berkman made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate businessman Henry Clay Frick, for which he served 14 years in prison. His experience in prison <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for his first book, Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist.|$|E
5|$|Charles Boycott and {{the events}} that led to his name {{entering}} the English language {{have been the subject of}} several works of fiction. The first was Captain Boycott, a 1946 romantic novel by Phillip Rooney. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for the 1947 film Captain Boycott—directed by Frank Lauder and starred Stewart Granger, Kathleen Ryan, Alastair Sim, and Cecil Parker as Charles Boycott. More recently the story was the subject of the 2012 novel Boycott, by Colin C. Murphy.|$|E
5|$|Compton Mackenzie, an English born Scottish novelist, {{acquired}} the tenancy. He recalled that his three years there had numerous logistical problems.

Lawrence's The Man who Loved Islands, about a man who moved to ever smaller islands much as Mackenzie moved from Herm to the smaller Jethou, but Lawrence himself denied it. At one point Mackenzie threatened to sue. However, Mackenzie did love islands and would graduate from Herm to the Hebrides.|$|E

5|$|Due to his {{casualty}} {{studies on}} mustard gas from an accident {{during the war}} in Italy, Rhoads became interested in its potential for cancer treatment. For the rest of his life, his research interest was in developing chemotherapy for cancer treatment, but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies of mustard gas, he developed a drug called mechlorethamine or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials during the war years <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> {{for the development of the}} field of anti-cancer chemotherapy. Rhoads also became interested in total body irradiation, which led to early work on chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, {{went to work}} at once on {{the task}} of reform. He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey. He began by {{establishing}} Benedictine monasticism at Glastonbury. The Rule of St. Benedict <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of his restoration according to the author of 'Edgar's Establishment of the Monasteries' (written in the 960s or 970s) and according to Dunstan's first biographer, who {{had been a member of}} the community at Glastonbury. Their statements are also in accordance with the nature of his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.|$|E
5|$|Father Dale Grubba, {{the priest}} who had presided over Kulwicki's funeral, {{released}} {{a biography of}} his friend entitled Alan Kulwicki: NASCAR champion Against All Odds in 2009. The book <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for a low-budget feature film, Dare to Dream: The Alan Kulwicki Story, released on April 1, 2005. The film chronicles Kulwicki's life from racing late models at Slinger Super Speedway, through his rise to NASCAR champion, and ends with his death. The movie was created by Kulwicki's Wisconsin fans for less than $100,000. The star of the film, Brad Weber, was a Kulwicki fan and credits the late driver with being his inspiration to become an actor.|$|E
