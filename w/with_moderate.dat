40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was {{to find out how}} people <b>with</b> a <b>moderate</b> mental {{disorder}} experience sexuality. We wanted to examinate whether sexuality is important for them, whether they talk about it and who they talk to.

The research showed that people <b>with</b> a <b>moderate</b> mental disorder find sexuality important; however, sexuality is rarely discussed, neither with people <b>with</b> a <b>moderate</b> mental disorder nor with their parents, professionals who work with them or in society in general. People <b>with</b> a <b>moderate</b> mental disorder need constant education about sexuality. They wish to be touched and kissed and they feel attracted to the opposite sex.

5|$|Furthermore, {{acetylcysteine}} {{has been}} confirmed, {{in a recent}} double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted by the US military, to reduce the effects of blast induced mild traumatic brain and neurological injury in soldiers.

In particular, it has been demonstrated through multiple studies to significantly reduce neuronal losses and to improve cognitive and neurological outcomes associated with these traumatic events.

5|$|After nearly 40 {{minutes of}} brutal, close-quarters fighting, {{the two sides}} broke contact and ceased fire at 02:26, after Abe and Captain Gilbert Hoover (the captain of Helena and senior {{surviving}} U.S. officer) ordered their respective forces to disengage.

The U.S. had only one light cruiser (Helena) and one destroyer (Fletcher) that were still capable of effective resistance. Although perhaps unclear to Abe, the way was now clear for him to bombard Henderson Field and finish off the U.S. naval forces in the area, thus allowing the troops and supplies to be landed safely on Guadalcanal.|$|E
