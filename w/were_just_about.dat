5|$|The Fur Army {{were not}} {{defeated}} and {{a force of}} 500 cavalry and 300 infantry attacked the Anglo-Egyptian camp at 03:00 on 23 May. Kelly's artillery opened fire with starshells, lighting up the battleground. The attack was defeated, Fur casualties are not known, but the only Anglo Egyptian casualty was a wounded gunner. Later that day, at 06:00 the Anglo-Egyptians <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to break camp, when several hundred Fur troops appeared on their left flank. They were engaged and forced to withdraw by artillery, machine gun fire and aerial bombardment. At 10:00, Kelly and his mounted troops entered the capital, finding it deserted except for some women. Sultan Ali Dinar had left El Fasher accompanied by 2,000 troops after hearing about the defeat at Beringia. Captured in the city were four artillery pieces, 55,000 rounds of small arms ammunition and 4,000 rifles.|$|E

25|$|The group wrote, {{printed and}} {{initially}} distributed their pamphlets {{in the greater}} Munich region. Later on, secret carriers brought copies to other cities, mostly in the southern parts of Germany. In total, the White Rose authored six leaflets, which were multiplied and spread, {{in a total of}} about 15,000 copies. They denounced the Nazi regime's crimes and oppression, and called for resistance. In their second leaflet, they openly denounced the persecution and mass murder of the Jews. By the time of their arrest, the members of the White Rose <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to establish contacts with other German resistance groups like the Kreisau Circle or the Schulze-Boysen/Harnack group of the Red Orchestra. Today, the White Rose is well-known both within Germany and worldwide.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} {{theories}} {{about the origins of}} the Piraeus Athena. Because the room the statue was found in was very close to the main harbor, many scholars believe that the statue had been stored in a harbor’s stoa and <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to be shipped. Additionally, the Piraeus Athena and other statues were not in random order but seemed to be packed. A coin found near the statues had a date equivalent to 87/86 BC on it, along with a picture of King Mithridates VI. Because it is known that Piraeus was captured by Sulla in 86 BC, many have further speculated two theories. One theory is that the statues were going to be shipped in order to save them from the Roman attack. The second theory is that the statues were being shipped by the Romans to Italy as part of their spoils. It is thought that the statue may have originally come from the sanctuary of Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira in Piraeus. This is because the peplos in the statue is similar to the drapery of the peplos in the statue of Eirene by Cephisodotus the Elder, who was also known to have made a statue of Athena that resided in the sanctuary of Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira. Other scholars believe that the statue may have come from Delos, since three of the statues found with the Piraeus Athena were of Artemis, and Delos was considered the birthplace of Artemis. Additionally, the Romans had captured Delos in 88 BC and therefore the statues could {{have been part of the}} scared funds Mithradates’ general had sent to Delos. Due to the dating, it has been estimated that the Piraeus Athena probably dates back to 360-340 BCE.|$|E

500|$|By {{crossing}} the lush Wyoming and Salt River Ranges instead of circling via the deserts to the south, the route provided ample wood, grass and {{water for the}} travelers, and cut nearly 7 days off the total travel time for wagon trains going to Fort Hall. Despite the better conditions for livestock, the mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather made passage sometimes difficult and required continuing federally funded maintenance on the mountainous road—not a sure thing just before, {{during and after the}} American Civil War. Funds were appropriated in 1858 and 115 men (hired in Utah) completed the road in Wyoming and Idaho in 90 days, clearing timber and moving about [...] of earth. The Lander's road or cutoff opened in 1859 when it was extensively used. Records after 1859 are lacking and its use after that period are assumed to sharply decrease since the Sublette Cutoff, the Central Overland Route and other cutoffs <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> as fast or faster and were much less strenuous. Today the Lander cutoff road(s) are roughly followed by a series of county and Forest Service roads.|$|E

500|$|At 08:00 the NZMRB set out heading south-east, {{the plan}} called for them to assault Amman from the south. The vanguard was {{provided}} by the regiment with the 4th Squadron leading. When they got within [...] of the village, they came under a Turkish artillery barrage. At 12:00 when the regiment was [...] from the rail line, which would be their right flank position, they turned north. Then a Turkish train arrived along the tracks from the south. The regiment's machine-gunners opened fire of it, and they <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to charge when it continued on into Amman. By now Turkish artillery and machine-gun fire was proving effective and the regiment was unable to make any progress. Hill 3039, in front of the 3rd Squadron, was well defended with numerous machine-guns, so the 4th Squadron were sent forward to support the assault. While 11th Squadron moved right, to the higher ground, to give covering fire. [...] At 18:00 Turkish troops mounted a counter-attack against the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on the regiment's left, but the regiment held the position. By nightfall no further progress was made and the division decided to hold onto what territory they had occupied and wait for assistance from 60th Division. The day's fighting had cost the regiment eighteen casualties. They still had not received any supplies and the rations they carried were exhausted.|$|E

2500|$|The {{population}} of Italian settlers in Libya increased rapidly after the Great Depression: in 1927, they <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> 26,000 of them, by 1931 they were 44,600, 66,525 in 1936 and eventually, in 1939, they numbered 119,139, or 13% {{of the total}} population. [...] They were concentrated on the Mediterranean coast, especially in the main urban centres and in the farmlands around the city of Tripoli (constituting 41% of the city's population) and Benghazi (35% of the city's population) where they found jobs in the construction boom fuelled by Fascist interventionist policies. In 1938, Governor Italo Balbo brought 20,000 Italian farmers to settle in Libya, and 27 new villages were founded, mainly in Cyrenaica.|$|E

2500|$|When the {{battalion}} landed outside Arnhem on 18 September they were {{detached from the}} brigade and sent to reinforce the 1st Parachute Battalion and the glider-borne infantry of 2nd South Staffords, trying to fight through to the 2nd Parachute Battalion which had captured {{the northern end of}} the Arnhem road bridge. The two battalions were located in the town about [...] short of the bridge. They <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to start another attempt to break through to the 2nd Parachute Battalion. With no appreciation of the ground the 11th Battalion was held in reserve playing no part in the attack. Under heavy fire the attempt stalled and to relieve the pressure on the assaulting troops, the 11th Battalion was asked to carry out a left flanking attack on the German positions. Orders were being issued for the assault, when the divisional commander Major-General Roy Urquhart personally intervened, forbidding {{the battalion}} to take part in what he now considered a futile attack. The 2nd South Staffords had been decimated with only their 'C' Company surviving as a unit. The 1st Parachute Battalion were in an even worse state and only numbered about 40 men.|$|E
