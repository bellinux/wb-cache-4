5|$|Quatre Bras was a hamlet at a {{strategic}} crossroads {{on the road}} to Brussels. French control of it would not only threaten the city, but divide Wellington's allied army from Blucher's Prussians. At 14:00 on 16 June 1815, after some initial skirmishing, the main French force under Marshall Ney, approached Quatre Bras from the south. They came up against the 2nd Netherlands Division who had formed a line well in advance of the crossroads. Facing three French infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade, the Dutch and Nassau troops were forced back but did not break. Reinforcements arrived at 15:00, being a Dutch cavalry brigade, Picton's 5th British Division, followed closely by the Brunswick Corps. The sharpshooters of the Brunswick Advance Guard regiment were sent to support Dutch skirmishers in Bossou Wood on the allied right (western) flank; the rest of the corps took up a reserve position across the Brussels road. The Duke reassured his inexperienced troops by <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down in front of them, calmly puffing on his pipe.|$|E

25|$|A corset dress (also {{known as}} hobble corset because it {{produces}} similar restrictive effects to a hobble skirt) {{is a long}} corset. It is like an ordinary corset, but it is long {{enough to cover the}} legs, partially or totally. It thus looks like a dress, hence the name. A person wearing a corset dress can have great difficulty in <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the stairs (especially if wearing high-heeled footwear) and may be unable to sit down if the boning is too stiff.|$|E

500|$|Tomlinson {{stayed on}} Lombard Street for another half hour, then {{made his way}} to King William Street, toward two lines of police cordons, where police had [...] "kettled" [...] {{thousands}} of protesters near the Bank of England. At 7:10pm he doubled back on himself, <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down Change Alley where he encountered more cordons, and five minutes later was on Lombard Street again, crossed it, walked down Birchin Lane, and reached Cornhill at 7:10–7:15pm.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Brosnan joined Meryl Streep in {{the film}} {{adaption}} of the ABBA musical Mamma Mia!. He played Sam Carmichael, one of three men rumoured {{to be the father}} of lead Amanda Seyfried, while Streep played her mother. Judy Craymer, producer to the film, said [...] "Pierce brings a certain smooch factor, and we think he'll have great chemistry with Meryl in a romantic comedy." [...] Brosnan's preparation in singing for the role included <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the coast and singing karaoke to his own voice for about six weeks, followed by rehearsals in New York in which he noted he [...] "sounded dreadful." [...] Brosnan's singing {{in the film}} was generally disparaged by critics, with his singing compared in separate reviews to the sound of a water buffalo, a donkey, and a wounded raccoon. In September 2008, Brosnan provided the narration for the Thomas & Friends special The Great Discovery. He was originally set to narrate for both US and UK from Season 12 and onward, but withdrew from it for unknown reasons.|$|E
500|$|The National Trust {{states that}} Newton House is [...] "thought {{to be one}} of the most haunted houses in Britain", and Wales Online cites it as one of the most notable ghostly houses of Wales. Over the years, many ghost {{sightings}} or paranormal activity have been allegedly witnessed at the house. The servants' basement is one of the purported centres of activity, with numerous sightings, particularly of a ghost known as Walter the Butler who worked at the house. People have reported smelling his tobacco smoke in the room, muffled voices and lights eerily turning on and off on their own accord. Visitors have reported feeling as if they are being choked when <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the cantilever staircase; this is believed to be related to the strangling of Lady Elinor Cavendish, the cousin of the lady of Newton House in the 1720s, by a lover whom she had rejected. The alleged hauntings at the property began to be investigated by television journalists in the 1980s, and on one occasion crewmen mysteriously fell ill one after the other while shooting there. During one investigation, the spectre of a young, beautiful girl was said to have glided across the room and disappeared through the cupboard door. The house was later the subject of an investigation in the 11th and 15th series of the Most Haunted programme.|$|E

2500|$|The work is {{supported}} by a series of [...] "Notes Variorum", a set of footnotes that nearly double the length of the work. They were likely written by Murphy, although possibly supplied directly by Smart. Years later, Jesse Foot described the creation of the notes as [...] "Mr. Smart <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the room, speaking the Verses, and Mr. Murphy writing the notes to them." [...] However, {{it is quite possible that}} Fielding also contributed to the notes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{generic name}} {{is derived from}} the [...] Ancient Greek kormos 'trunk of a tree', and 'batēs' from the verb 'to go' or 'to travel', and refers to its mode of <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down trees. Its {{specific}} name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek leuko- 'white' and phaios 'dun' or 'dusky', and refers to its plumage. Some guidebooks have the binomial name written as Cormobates leucophaeus, however a review in 2001 rules that the genus name was feminine, hence leucophaea is the correct specific name.|$|E

2500|$|Vanguard {{is usually}} {{considered}} {{to have been a}} right-wing party. In its earliest days it adopted the style associated with falangist parties with an honour guard, a common salute and a habit of wearing sashes. This led to it being characterised as Mosleyite or even neo-Nazi with the Stormont unionist MP William McConnell claiming that Vanguard rallies involved [...] "a certain Hitlerian-type figure... <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the lines, inspecting his so-called storm-troopers." [...] Craig however denied that the party was either neo-nazi or paramilitary.|$|E
2500|$|The Bible {{states that}} Satan roams Heaven and Earth. It also states that Satan {{appeared}} with other angels [...] "before the Lord," [...] presumably in heaven. When God asked Satan {{where he had}} been, Satan replied, [...] "From going to and fro in the earth, and from <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down in it". [...] declares, [...] "Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion {{looking for someone to}} devour". The only point in the Bible where Satan is in Hell {{is at the end of}} the Book of Revelation, where he is thrown into Hell to face his eternal punishment along with the beast. As demonstrated by Dante, Milton, and several other writings, the Devil is commonly thought to be in Hell.|$|E
2500|$|But on {{the opening}} night of Bombo, and the first {{performance}} at the new theatre, he suffered from extreme stage fright, <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the streets for hours before showtime. Out of fear, he lost his voice backstage and begged the stagehands not to raise the curtains. But when the curtains went up, he [...] "was [...] standing in the wings trembling and sweating." [...] After being physically shoved onto the stage by his brother Harry, he performed and received an ovation {{that he would never}} forget: [...] "For several minutes, the applause continued while Al stood and bowed after the first act." [...] He refused to go back on stage for the second act, but the audience [...] "just stamped its feet and chanted 'Jolson, Jolson', until he came back out." [...] He took 37 curtain calls that night and told the audience, [...] "I'm a happy man tonight." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1941, Reznikoff {{published}} {{a collection of}} poems called Going To and Fro and <b>Walking</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> Down. After that, although he continued to write and to publish in periodicals, his poetry had no further book publication until the 1959 Inscriptions: 1944–1956. In 1962, New Directions {{published a}} selection of poems called By the Waters of Manhattan. Three years later, they brought out [...] Testimony: The United States, 1885–1890: Recitative, the first installment of a long work based on court records covering the period 1855 to 1915. The book was a commercial and critical flop, and New Directions dropped him. In the 1970s, Black Sparrow Press started publishing Reznikoff, bringing out the complete Testimony {{as well as a}} similar work, Holocaust, based on courtroom accounts of Nazi concentration camps. In the years after Reznikoff's death in 1976, Black Sparrow brought all his major works back into print.|$|E
