On the other hand, if the overprediction of the minority group's criterion performance is not too extreme, it may seem reasonable to many to leave it uncorrected, thereby giving the benefit of the slight predictive bias to the presumably disadvantaged group.|$|E

"On this occasion, {{we need a}} {{man with}} at least {{planetary}} thinking," [...] who would realize [...] "the geopolitical formula, guaranteeing {{the interests of the}} majority on the planet … This is the fate of Russia. It is destination, fate … We must do it, for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> … This is geopolitics."

25|$|I'd see the bus pass every day... But to me, {{that was}} a way of life; <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to accept what was the custom. The bus was among the first ways I {{realized}} there was a black world and a white world.|$|R
2500|$|In their book, Metaphors We Live By, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson helped pioneer this approach, {{claiming}} that metaphor {{is what makes}} human thought special. All language, they argued, is permeated with metaphor, whose use in fact constitutes distinctively human— that is, distinctively abstract— thought. To conceptualise things which cannot be directly perceived— intangibles such as time, life, reason, mind, society or justice— <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to set out from more concrete and directly perceptible phenomena such as motion, location, distance, size and so forth. In all cultures across the world, according to Lakoff and Johnson, people resort to such familiar metaphors as ideas are locations, thinking is moving and mind is body. For example, we might express the idea of [...] "arriving at a crucial point in our argument" [...] by proceeding as if literally travelling from one physical location to the next.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{weeks of}} taking office, Turner was {{attacked}} by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) for his no new tax pledge, and painted by the DCC as representing wealthy individuals and corporations rather than the average district voter. Turner expressed support for hydrofracking in upstate New York, and would allow states {{to opt out of}} No Child Left Behind. Remarking on the tenth anniversary of the war in Afghanistan, Turner said he would [...] "leave our military commitment in Afghanistan up to the generals in the field," [...] adding that, [...] "If they believe the sacrifice of our soldiers continues to be necessary to prevent attacks on U.S. soil, then <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to let them finish the task." [...] Turner was an advocate for removing the tolls on the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, and applauded Gov. Cuomo for his motions towards changing the policy.|$|E
2500|$|... “The United Nation’s Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Fifth Emissions Gap {{report shows}} {{there is an}} urgent need for governments to ramp up their 2020 {{commitments}} to cut greenhouse gases if the world is {{to stay within the}} global carbon budget needed to keep climate disrupting temperature increases below 20C… “Canada needs to seize these opportunities by committing to ramping up investments in renewable energy to power our homes, buildings and vehicles,” said John Bennett, Sierra Club of Canada. Kim Carstensen of the World Wide Fund for Nature stated: [...] "Well-meant but half-hearted pledges to protect our planet from dangerous climate change are simply not sufficient to address a crisis that calls for completely new ways of collaboration across rich and poor countries... We needed a treaty now and at best, we will be working on one in half a year's time. What we have after two years of negotiation is a half-baked text of unclear substance." [...] Robert Bailey, of Oxfam International, said: [...] "It is too late to save the summit, but it's not too late to save the planet and its people. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to forge forward towards a legally binding deal in 2010. This must be a rapid, decisive and ambitious movement, not business as usual." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, indeed," [...] Beorn said, [...] "our {{garments}} differ not {{greatly from}} those <b>we</b> now <b>have</b> on, for Norman fashions are prevalent at King Edward's court, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but {{to conform to}} them. Your language is always spoken there, and methinks that were you to visit Westminster you would see but little difference between King Edward's court and that of your own duke." ...|$|R
5000|$|Khalil al-Haya, Palestinian {{negotiator}} said [...] "It {{was a war}} {{of necessity}} not a war of <b>choice.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to defend ourselves,". He further said [...] "We are united and are unified in blood and dead bodies. We are one front, one side, one body ... We are all engaged in one battle defending our people. The war {{is the beginning of}} liberation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{well that}} Troy stands a good ten {{miles from the}} sea, for if they came out at us with a fleet they might have us at a disadvantage. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but {{to come here and}} refit, yet I shall <b>have</b> <b>no</b> happy hour until I see the white foam from the lash of our oars once more.

2500|$|Imperial {{and provincial}} {{government}} bureaucracies attempted to Germanise the state's national minorities situated near {{the borders of}} the empire: the Danes in the North, the Francophones in the West and Poles in the East. As minister president of Prussia and as imperial chancellor, Bismarck [...] "sorted people into their linguistic [...] ‘tribes’", however, he pursued a policy of hostility in particular toward the Poles, which was an expedient rooted in Prussian history. [...] "He never had a Pole among his peasants" [...] working the Bismarckian estates; it was the educated Polish bourgeoisie and revolutionaries he denounced from personal experience, and [...] "because of them he disliked intellectuals in politics." [...] Bismarck’s antagonism is revealed in a private letter to his sister in 1861: [...] "Hammer the Poles until they despair of living [...] I have all the sympathy in the world for their situation, but if we want to exist <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to wipe them out: wolves are only what God made them, but we shoot them all the same when we can get at them." [...] Later that year, the public Bismarck modified his belligerence and wrote to Prussia’s foreign minister: [...] "Every success of the Polish national movement is a defeat for Prussia, we cannot carry on the fight against this element according to the rules of civil justice, but only in accordance with the rules of war." [...] With Polish nationalism the ever-present menace, Bismarck preferred expulsion rather than Germanisation.|$|E

6000|$|... "I fear, countess," [...] the Admiral said, [...] "that {{our arrival}} at La Rochelle will bring trouble upon all the country round it. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> {{between that and}} exile. Had we {{consulted}} our own peace and safety only, <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> betaken ourselves to Germany; but <b>had</b> <b>we</b> done that, {{it would have been}} a desertion of our brethren, who look to us for leading and guidance.|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> to {{make them}} stop, {{and there was no}} other way ... we are not very proud about it. But it was a {{question}} of sheer necessity. We went back to the old biblical rule of an eye for an eye ... I approach these problems not from a moral point of view, but, hard as it may sound, from a cost-benefit point of view. If I'm very hard-headed, I can say, what is the political benefit in killing this person? Will it bring us nearer to peace? Will it bring us nearer to an understanding with the Palestinians or not? In most cases I don't think it will. But in the case of Black September <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> other <b>choice</b> and it worked. Is it morally acceptable? One can debate that question. Is it politically vital? It was.|$|R
5000|$|Bakoyannis won {{the local}} {{elections}} with 54.3%. In a To Vima interview he strongly defended the bailout deal stating that [...] "where <b>we</b> <b>have</b> come to {{after all the}} crimes that the Greek political system made over the past 30 years, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but the Memorandum." [...] He said that he wouldn't rule out joining the new Democratic Alliance party his mother had founded, and that [...] "Greece needs suicidal governments ready to kill themselves to save the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That can be {{only because}} he not know our real weakness," [...] was the fierce retort. [...] "And, anyway, we must accept these terms. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice.</b> That is my opinion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] {{returned}} Mark, with something of scorn in his tone, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice,</b> for you have us at your mercy--we cannot refuse. I suppose {{you are the}} brigand chief, and are guarding us for some sinister purpose of your own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By Heavens, {{they are}} attacking the ship!" [...] Simcoe cried; [...] "they {{will be here}} in a moment.

5000|$|Later news {{articles}} {{reported that}} both Gorley and the patient's brother {{had been removed}} from the bedside at the same time, due to what a hospital statement referred to as [...] "disruptive and belligerent behavior."

5000|$|By 1977, I was 29, {{just prior}} to Karac's passing, {{and that sort of}} wild energy that was there in the {{beginning}} had come {{to the point where we}} were showboating a bit.

5000|$|... "If we do {{not wish}} to embrace Bolshevism <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> other <b>choice</b> but to enter into this party which, despite many socialist ideas, is the counter-pole of Marxism and Bolshevism." ...|$|R

2500|$|Within months, Scott {{captured}} (or killed) every Cherokee {{in north}} Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama {{who could not}} escape. His troops reportedly rounded up the Cherokee and held them in rat-infested stockades with little food. Private John G.

60|$|But {{it is too}} late, we are told, for retrospection. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> between {{giving way}} and a sanguinary war.

60|$|This news {{filled my}} mother's mind with foreboding doubts of the {{stability}} of her husband's grand speculation in America.
