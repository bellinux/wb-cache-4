500|$|The final straw {{for many}} regular {{officers}} was Prime Minister Robert Menzies' announcement that all commands in the Second AIF {{would go to}} Militia officers, which Berryman considered [...] "a damn insult to the professional soldier, calculated to split the Army down the centre. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the hewers of wood and the drawers of water.

How could <b>we</b> not <b>be</b> in there?" [...] Moore later stated, [...] "When Terry Stewart [...] called and told me <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> inducted, he was apologetic," [...] Moore said. [...] "He said it should have been done years ago, {{everybody}} knew it. He said they received many, many calls over the years from angry (Miracles) fans." ...|$|R

In his diary, Gordon wrote: [...] "I own to having been very insubordinate to Her Majesty's Government and its officials, but it is my nature, and I cannot help it. I fear I have not even tried to play battledore and shuttlecock with them. I know if I was chief I would never employ myself for I am incorrigible".|$|E

There is nothing about fighting today, but the glorification of God and peace on the land ... Let us wait for the end; {{there is nothing else}} for us. Let us abide calmly upon the land." [...] He warned against armed defence: [...] "If any man thinks of his gun or his horse and goes to fetch it, he will die by it." [...] The settler press continued to denounce the Parihaka meetings as [...] "schools of fanaticism and sedition" [...] and said Te Whiti and Tohu needed to be [...] "taught the lesson of submission and obedience".|$|E
2500|$|After Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990, Powell {{claimed that}} since Britain {{was not an}} ally of Kuwait in the [...] "formal sense" [...] and because {{the balance of power}} in the Middle East had ceased to be a British concern after the end of the British Empire, Britain should not go to war. Powell claimed that [...] "Saddam Hussein has a long way to go yet before his troops come {{storming}} up the beaches of Kent or Sussex". On 21 October, he wrote, [...] "The world is full of evil men engaged in doing evil things. That does not make us policemen to round them up nor judges to find them guilty and to sentence them. What is so special about the ruler of Iraq that we suddenly discover that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his jailers and his judges?... we as a nation have no interest in the existence or non-existence of Kuwait or, for that matter, Saudi Arabia as an independent state.

2500|$|On February 27, 1801, only a {{few months}} after moving to the District, Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 and {{incorporated}} the new federal District under its sole authority as permitted by the District Clause, making Congress the supreme source of all local laws. Since the District of Columbia ceased being part of any state and was not a state itself, the District's residents lost voting representation in Congress, the Electoral College, and in the Constitutional amendment process [...] consequences that did not go without protest. In January 1801, a meeting of District citizens was held which resulted in a statement to Congress noting {{that as a result of}} the impending Organic Act [...] "we shall be completely disfranchised in respect to the national government, while we retain no security for participating in the formation of even the most minute local regulations by which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affected. We shall be reduced to that deprecated condition of which we pathetically complained in our charges against Great Britain, of being taxed without representation."

That day the American flag was displayed in [...] "every section of the city," [...] with zeal equal to that which existed during the late 1860 presidential campaign, wrote the Nashville Daily Gazette. [...] The proponents of the slavocracy were embarrassed, demoralized and politically disoriented but not willing to admit defeat: [...] "Whatever may be the result of the difficulties which at present agitate our country - whether <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> united in our common destiny or whether two Republics shall take the place of that which has stood for nearly a century, the admired of all nations we will still bow with reverence to the sight of the stars and stripes, and recognize it as the standard around which the sons of liberty can rally [...] And if the remonstrances of the people of the South-pleading and begging for redress for years-does not in this critical moment, arouse her brethren of the North to a sense of justice and right, and honor demands a separation, we would still have the same claims upon the 'colors of Washington, great son of the South, and of Virginia, mother of the States.' Let us not abandon the stars and stripes under which Southern men have so often been led to victory."
