5|$|Although it {{was planned}} that some key {{scenes of the}} episode would be filmed without an {{audience}} {{in order to avoid}} leaks of plot spoilers, the producers decided not to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> issue and filmed it all in front of the live studio audience. The producers also instigated the rumor that multiple endings would be filmed; in fact, only one was planned and shot.|$|E
5|$|The Abwehr {{was right}} to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{presence}} of British double agents within their secret service. They were at that time already running 'Garbo' (Juan Pujol), 'Zig-Zag' (Eddie Chapman) and 'Tricycle' (Dušan Popov), supposedly German agents to whom they were paying large sums of money, but who were in reality working for the British and were supplying the Germans with false information.|$|E
5|$|The Binding of Isaac was {{developed}} following {{the release of}} Super Meat Boy, which McMillen considered a significant risk and a large time effort. When Super Meat Boy was released to both critical praise and strong sales, {{he felt that he}} no longer had to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> consequences of taking risks with his finances supported by its sales. He also considered he could take further risk with the concept.|$|E

5|$|The Germans responded {{quickly by}} redeploying their only reserve in the area, the 29th Panzergrenadier Division. Despite initial {{victories}} against Soviet armored forces, the Romanian collapse forced the division to again redeploy {{in an attempt}} to shore up defenses to the south. The 29th Panzergrenadier Division's counterattack had cost the Red Army around fifty tanks, and caused Soviet commanders to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> safety of their left flank. However, the German division's redeployment meant {{that by the end of}} the day only the 6th Romanian Cavalry Regiment was positioned between advancing Soviet forces and the Don River.|$|E

5|$|Between 9 and 10 pm on {{the night}} of April 18, 1775, Joseph Warren told Revere and William Dawes that the British troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord. Warren's {{intelligence}} suggested that the most likely objectives of the regulars' movements later that night would be the capture of Adams and Hancock. They did not <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possibility of regulars marching to Concord, since the supplies at Concord were safe, but they did think their leaders in Lexington were unaware of the potential danger that night. Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn them and to alert colonial militias in nearby towns.|$|E

Da Matta felt his team had learnt more from the series previous race on a superspeedway which he believed would help him in California where he wanted to win. Having moved from 16th to eighth in the points standings with a victory in Laguna Seca and a second-place finish in Germany, Papis stated that he was focused on the race and hoped he would clinch his first victory in a 500-mile event despite having not managed to finish a race on a superspeedway in 2001. Bruno Junqueira was excited to race in Fontana and hoped that he could clinch his second victory of the year.|$|E

Later, {{at a meeting of}} the local chapter of International Brotherhood of Jazz Dancers, Pastry Chefs and Nuclear Technicians, Carl announces that the newest contract requires the union to give up their dental plan in exchange for a free keg of beer for their meeting. Homer slowly comprehends that giving up their dental plan would require him to pay for Lisa's braces and jumps into action, reminding everyone how their dental plan has helped them all.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E
5|$|Buckingham Palace finally {{became the}} {{principal}} royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, {{who was the}} first monarch to reside there; her predecessor WilliamIV had died before its completion. While the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory was}} well {{received}} among the Albanians, and Skanderbeg's recruits increased as documented by Geraldini: Skanderbeg {{was in his}} camp with 16,000 men and every day his camp grows with young warriors. The victory was also well received in Italy with contemporaries hoping for more such news. But, despite the Ottoman loss, the victory did not signal {{an end to the}} war. Skanderbeg's damaged forces, however, had been renewed with northern warriors and Venetian battalions. The situation remained critical, however, due to the economic hardships suffered during the siege. Skanderbeg's only expectancy was for help to come from Italy, but the Italian states, despite sending contragulatory messages, send no financial aid. Hungary continued its defensive war and thus Skanderbeg's only remaining ally was Venice. Even Venice became skeptical of continuing the war and was alone in allying with Skanderbeg. Venice reported to Hungary that Mehmed had offered peace and was willing to accept it. Hungary also opted for peace, but Mehmed only sought peace with Venice in order to isolate Skanderbeg and thus peace was not signed. Skanderbeg and Venice continually began to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman garrison in Elbasan. Skanderbeg led some assaults on the fortress after being urged to by Venice but failed to capture it due to lack of artillery. According to Critobulos, Mehmed was troubled after learning of the Ottoman defeat and began preparations for a new campaign. Venice itself was in conflict with its Italian neighbors who had grown wary of its increasing influence in the Balkans. With the western powers fighting among themselves, the road to Albania was open. Mehmed thus decided to send a force to subdue Albania conclusively which resulted in a new siege on Krujë.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Ralph Berry {{argued that}} Shakespeare was chiefly {{concerned}} with epistemology in this play. The lovers declare illusion to be reality, the actors declare reality to be illusion.

Also in 1972, Thomas McFarland {{argued that the}} play is dominated by a mood of happiness {{and that it is}} one of the happiest literary creations ever produced. The mood is so lovely that the audience never feels fear or <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fate of the characters.|$|E

When the leading Richards/Skaife Commodore retired with a failed diff, Ingall scrambled the car back onto the lead lap.

There was <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nobility of Shantanu's unborn children, now promised the throne. Hearing this, Bhishma said it was his decision and his father should not be blamed as Shantanu had never promised anything to Satyavati's father. The prime minister then asked who would be held responsible if the future crown prince isn't capable enough. Bhishma then took another vow that he would always see his father's image in whomever sat on the King's throne, and would thus serve him faithfully.|$|E
