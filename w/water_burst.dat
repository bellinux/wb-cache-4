2500|$|Clays only {{form in the}} {{presence}} of water. It is believed that great amount of water went through this area; one flow was caused by a body of water larger than Earth's Lake Huron. This happened when <b>water</b> <b>burst</b> through a crater rim that was damming it. Holden is an old crater, containing numerous smaller craters, many of which are filled with sediment. Indeed, over 150m of sediment is exposed in Holden Crater, especially in southwestern part of the crater. The crater's central mountain is also obscured by sediment. Much of the sediment probably originated from river and lake deposits. [...] Holden Crater is in the Uzboi-Landon-Morava (ULM) outflow system.|$|E

[...] Maritime historian Boyer {{wrote that the}} Superior City was, [...] "ammed on her port side, aft of midships … [...] … a tremendous explosion when the terrible inrushing wall of cold <b>water</b> <b>burst</b> her aft bulkheads and hit the boilers.

40|$|Abstract. Through {{applying}} the background values of aquifer derived from fuzzy clustering analysis, a fuzzy comprehensive estimation model {{was developed for}} quick recognition of mine water inrush. Based on the hydrological-chemical analysis data of water samples which <b>water</b> <b>bursting</b> sources were known in Liliu mining area, Shanxi province, this paper presented that the hydrological-chemical characters of different aquifer was different, and established a sort of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation models of discriminating coal mine <b>water</b> <b>bursting</b> sources in Liliu mining area. Applied to a production mine, the correct rate of <b>water</b> <b>bursting</b> source judged results by various methods was more than 70 %. With the dispersion method and the method extracted from stepwise discrimination analysis to determine the membership degree and Model 3 the type determined by various factors, the correct rate of <b>water</b> <b>bursting</b> source with comprehensive evaluation of combination of two methods was higher respectively 94. 5 % and 93. 3 %. The fuzzy system can efficiently and accurately discriminate the resource of water inrush for an unknown sample, and provide the decision basis for the safety production of the coal mine...|$|R

Through the research on lost stabilization {{of energy in the}} floor system of coal mine, a cusp catastrophic model applied to forecast <b>water</b> <b>bursting</b> from coal mine floor is put forward. The formulas of the critical stress, the strain and the released energy of the floor are developed when the floor system lost stabilization.

About 75 people were accommodated overnight in Cockermouth School and the Shepherds Hotel (known locally as the Sheep & Wool Centre). Search and rescue helicopters from RAF Valley, RAF Boulmer and RAF Leconfield rescued approximately 50 people, with the remainder being rescued by boat, particularly by the RNLI, and HM Coastguard. A Coastguard helicopter was deployed to the area from Stornoway to supplement the military SAR assets.

60|$|In a {{few minutes}} we gained the spot, which was very rugged and precipitous, and, moreover, quite damp with the falling of the spray. We had much ado to pass over dry-shod. The ground, also, was full of holes here and there.

Huge {{boulders}} and windfalls, moved by water at flood season, obstructed the narrow stream-bed. We crossed to start climbing the north slope, and soon worked up out of the thicket upon a steep, rocky slope, with isolated pines. We struck a deer-trail hard to follow.

6000|$|The Kilsby {{tunnel of}} the London and North west Railway {{is a case}} in point. When that tunnel was proposed, it was {{arranged}} that it should be about 3000 yards long, and 160 feet below the surface, with two great ventilating shafts 60 feet in diameter. It was a gigantic work. The engineer examined the ground in the usual way, with much care, and then advertised for [...] "tenders." [...] The various competing contractors also examined the ground minutely, and the offer of one of them to work it for 99,000 pounds was accepted. Forthwith the contractor went to work, and all went well and busily for some time, until it was suddenly discovered that a hidden quicksand extended 400 yards into the tunnel, which the trial shafts had just passed without touching. This was a more tremendous blow to the contractor than most readers may at first thought suppose, for he believed that to solidify a quicksand was impossible. The effect on him was so great that he was mentally prostrated, and although the company generously and justly relieved him from his engagement, the reprieve came too late, for he died. It then came to be a question whether or not the tunnel should be abandoned. Many advised that it should. At this juncture Mr Robert Stephenson, son of the great George, came forward and undertook the work. He placed his chief dependence on the steam-engine to keep the water down while the work was in progress. At first he was successful, but one day, while the men were busy laying their bricks in cement one of them drove into the roof, and a deluge of <b>water</b> <b>burst</b> in on them, and although they tried to continue their work on a raft the water prevailed and at last drove them out. They escaped with difficulty up one of the air-shafts. The water having put an effectual stop to the work, the directors felt disposed to give it up, but Stephenson begged for a fortnight more. It was granted. By means of thirteen steam-engines, the amazing quantity of 1800 gallons of water per minute was pumped out of the quicksand night and day for eight months. With the aid of 1250 men and 200 horses the work was finally completed, having occupied altogether thirty months from the laying of the first brick.|$|E
