5|$|After graduating college, Briskin {{worked as}} an accountant. Briskin entered the film {{industry}} as an accountant at Cohn-Brandt-Cohn Film Sales in 1920. In 1924, when the Cohn brothers incorporated CBC as Columbia Pictures, he left the studio and created an independent production company with George H. Davis named Banner Productions. The company was scheduled to produce 8 films, four {{on the east coast}} and four in California. The company was incorporated in May 1924, and produced over 20 films between 1925 and 1927. Briskin gave his brother, Irving, his start in the film industry, as an auditor for Banner. Irving would go on to be a film producer in his own right. The company's first film <b>was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Truth</b> About Women, a 1924 melodrama directed by Burton King, and starring Hope Hampton and Lowell Sherman. The picture was filmed at the Whitman Bennett Studios near Yonkers, New York. The next film Briskin would produce was The Man Without a Heart, again directed by King and filmed at the Bennett Studios, this time starring Kenneth Harlan and Jane Novak. In addition to producing the films, Briskin would also travel around the country making sales deals for the company's films. In 1925 Briskin would produce the melodrama, The Phantom Express, starring Ethel Shannon and George Periolat. This was followed in 1926 by the film Brooding Eyes, starring the legendary Lionel Barrymore.|$|E

Genie's mother later recalled that Genie was not a cuddly baby, did not babble much, and resisted solid food. At times she said that at some unspecified point Genie spoke individual words, but could not recall them, but at other times she said that Genie had never produced speech of any kind. Researchers never determined which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b>|$|E

500|$|Fincher had {{previously}} worked with director of photography Harris Savides on Seven (he shot the opening credits) and The Game. Savides loved the script but realized, [...] "there {{was so much}} exposition, just people {{talking on the phone}} or having conversations. It was difficult to imagine how it could be done in a visual way." [...] Fincher and Savides did not want to repeat the look of Seven. The director's approach to Zodiac was to create a look mundane enough that audiences would accept that what they were watching <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> The filmmakers also did not want to glamorize the killer or tell the story through his eyes. [...] "That would have turned the story into a first-person-shooter video game. We didn't want to make the sort of movie that serial killers would want to own," [...] Fincher said.|$|E
500|$|In a 1991 Canadian {{television}} interview, Love {{commented on}} the album's coarse musical structure. She said that since the band was from Los Angeles, the [...] "metal capital of the US", {{they thought they were}} making a [...] "pop record with an edge", and were surprised by people's reactions when they were told it was violent and extreme. Love also said, [...] "It was all about the expression of my experience. I was not coming from a black void; I was trying to create light... I was trying to heal." [...] In an interview with Spin magazine several years after its release, Love said that she was [...] "posing in a lot of ways" [...] with the album: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> but it was also me catching up with all my hip peers who'd gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths. I'd done the whole punk thing, sleeping on floors in piss and beer, and waking up with the guy with the fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing. But I hated it. I'd grown out of it by the time I was seventeen." [...] In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder, Love admitted to having been [...] "consciously self-conscious" [...] when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time.|$|E
500|$|Biographers {{describe}} Rutherford as {{tall and}} solidly built with a senatorial demeanor, {{and a strong}} booming voice that helped make him a powerful orator. In 1917, The New York Times stated that Rutherford [...] "has a reputation as an eloquent, forceful speaker". Watch Tower Society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor. One Witness history book says that while Russell was kind, warm and tactful, Rutherford [...] "was warm and generous toward his associates {{but he was also}} a brusque and direct type of person, and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense." [...] Another Watch Tower Society account says he did not hide his feelings, adding, [...] "His bluntness, even when spoken in kindness, was sometimes misunderstood." [...] Fellow Watch Tower Society director A. H. Macmillan says Rutherford [...] "spoke as simply and directly to the people as he knew how, and he was an extremely forthright man. He was thoroughly convinced that {{what he had to say}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> and that it was a matter of life and death." [...] Macmillan added, [...] "He would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood the Bible to teach. He was so strict about that, he would permit nothing that would seem to show a compromise when it came to an issue of the truth." [...] Author Tony Wills describes him as charitable and generous, and says his sympathy for the poor and oppressed was exceeded only by his hatred for the rich, the oppressors. Wills also notes that he was a dynamic, impatient extrovert. Other authors also address Rutherford's abrasiveness: James Penton describes him as blunt and moody with an explosive temper, with [...] "a streak of self-righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of the Devil", while Alan Rogerson notes that he was a [...] "dogmatic and insensitive person, obsessed with his own self-importance." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a Catholic apologist of the {{religious}} and political status quo, Barruel downplayed his own Catholicism and presented himself as a neutral party within the radicalized debate surrounding the Revolution. [...] His tactic was to cite document after document with a commentary that effectively showed it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> The reader of the Memoirs {{could have been any}} individual who doubted some of Barruels inferences, but who would eventually be overwhelmed by the sheer weight of evidence against the Enlightenment and liberation movements. His fanatical hatred for revolutionary and enlightenment ideas is hidden behind a faux neutrality and casuistic slight of pen. By isolating single passages and quoting them out of context, Barruel presented {{what seemed to be a}} convincing case. He made up for quality with quantity and persuaded a number of contemporaries to adopt his view. The Memoirs is constructed according to reason and Barruel attempts to use the Enlightenments own tool to bring about its demise.|$|E
2500|$|... 1986 heralded the {{beginning}} of a storyline that Colin Brake has described as one of the soap's most complicated, convoluted, confusing and mind-boggling: The paternity of Simon Wicks. As part of the original storyline, Wicksy's mother, Pat (Pam St Clement), was introduced as a major antagonist for the Beale family, when she announced that her former husband, Pete, was not Simon's biological father, as had previously been claimed. So began a long-running storyline played out throughout the year and continuing into 1988, which included other characters being implemented as the potential father of Simon, including Pete's older brother Kenny Beale (Michael Attwell). In the on-screen events, Simon was shown to bond with Kenny, despite Pat's admitting that she did not know which of the Beale brothers had fathered Wicksy. A final plot twist in mid-1988 saw Pat finally reveal what she thought <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> that Simon's real father was Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield), Pat's second husband and Wicksy's adoptive father.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} notable storylines {{featuring}} Pete revolved around the paternity of his alleged son, Simon Wicks (Nick Berry). Pete was shell-shocked to discover that Simon, was not really his child, {{and that he was}} possibly the son of his brother Kenny (Michael Attwell). The storyline spanned several years, since the arrival of Pete's first wife Pat (Pam St. Clement) in 1986, until the long-awaited showdown between Pete, Pat and Kenny in February 1988. The episode written by Tony McHale contained shocking revelations that would affect several relationships on the Square for years to come. In the on-screen events, Simon was shown to bond with Kenny, despite Pat admitting that she did not know which of the Beale brothers had fathered Wicksy. A final plot twist mid-1988 saw Pat finally reveal what she thought <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> that Simon's real father was Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield), Pat's second husband and Wicksy's adoptive father. Despite this revelation on-screen, writer Colin Brake stated in an official EastEnders book in 1994 that the true parentage of Simon was still uncertain {{in the minds of the}} producers. He stated, [...] "At various times over the years the story has been amended, until the only certainty is that we will never be certain about the actual facts." [...] He added that, at the time of writing the book for EastEnders 10th anniversary in 1994, [...] "the current producers believe that Pete was the father of [...] David and may have been the father of Simon." ...|$|E
