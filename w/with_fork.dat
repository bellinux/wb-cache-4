She looked extraordinarily like a flower to Billy, a little diamond buckle on a black velvet band glittered between the two masses of butter-coloured hair that flowed back from her forehead, her head was poised on the prettiest neck conceivable, and her shapely little shoulders and her shapely little arms came decidedly but pleasantly out of a softness and sparkle of white and silver and old rose. She talked what sounded like innocent commonplaces a little spiced by whim, though indeed each remark had an exploratory quality, and her soft blue eyes rested ever and again upon Billy's white tie. It seemed she did so by the merest inadvertency, but it made the young man wish he had after all borrowed a black one from Benham. But the manservant who had put his things out had put it out, and he hadn't been quite sure. Also she noted all the little things he did <b>with</b> <b>fork</b> and spoon and glass. She gave him an unusual sense of being brightly, accurately and completely visible.|$|E

And therefore it need not be wondered if by this time Lord Peter was become exceeding rich. But alas! he had kept his brain so long and so violently upon the rack, that at last it shook itself, and began to turn round for a little ease. In short, what with pride, projects, and knavery, poor Peter was grown distracted, and conceived the strangest imaginations in the world. In the height of his fits (as it is usual with those who run mad out of pride) he would call himself God Almighty, and sometimes monarch of the universe. I have seen him (says my author) take three old high-crowned hats, and clap them all on his head, three storey high, with a huge bunch of keys at his girdle, and an angling rod in his hand. In which guise, whoever went to take him by the hand in the way of salutation, Peter with much grace, like a well-educated spaniel, would present them with his foot, and if they refused his civility, then he would raise it as high as their chops, and give them a damned kick on the mouth, which hath ever since been called a salute. Whoever walked by without paying him their compliments, having a wonderful strong breath, he would blow their hats off into the dirt. Meantime his affairs at home went upside down, and his two brothers had a wretched time, where his first boutade was to kick both their wives one morning out of doors, and his own too, and in their stead gave orders to pick up the first three strollers could be met with in the streets. A while after he nailed up the cellar door, and would not allow his brothers a drop of drink to their victuals {95}. Dining one day at an alderman's in the city, Peter observed him expatiating, after the manner of his brethren in the praises of his sirloin of beef. [...] "Beef," [...] said the sage magistrate, [...] "is the king of meat; beef comprehends in it the quintessence of partridge, and quail, and venison, and pheasant, and plum-pudding, and custard." [...] When Peter came home, he would needs take the fancy of cooking up this doctrine into use, and apply the precept in default of a sirloin to his brown loaf. [...] "Bread," [...] says he, [...] "dear brothers, is the staff of life, in which bread is contained inclusive the quintessence of beef, mutton, veal, venison, partridge, plum-pudding, and custard, and to render all complete, there is intermingled a due quantity of water, whose crudities are also corrected by yeast or barm, through which means it becomes a wholesome fermented liquor, diffused through the mass of the bread." [...] Upon the strength of these conclusions, next day at dinner was the brown loaf served up in all the formality of a City feast. [...] "Come, brothers," [...] said Peter, [...] "fall to, and spare not; here is excellent good mutton {96}; or hold, now my hand is in, I'll help you." [...] At which word, in much ceremony, <b>with</b> <b>fork</b> and knife, he carves out two good slices of a loaf, and presents each on a plate to his brothers. The elder of the two, not suddenly entering into Lord Peter's conceit, began with very civil language to examine the mystery. [...] "My lord," [...] said he, [...] "I doubt, with great submission, there may be some mistake." [...] "What!" [...] says Peter, [...] "you are pleasant; come then, let us hear this jest your head is so big with." [...] "None in the world, my Lord; but unless I am very much deceived, your Lordship was pleased a while ago to let fall a word about mutton, and I would be glad to see it with all my heart." [...] "How," [...] said Peter, appearing in great surprise, [...] "I do not comprehend this at all;" [...] upon which the younger, interposing to set the business right, [...] "My Lord," [...] said he, [...] "my brother, I suppose, is hungry, and longs for the mutton your Lordship hath promised us to dinner." [...] "Pray," [...] said Peter, [...] "take me along with you, either you are both mad, or disposed to be merrier than I approve of; if you there do not like your piece, I will carve you another, though I should take that to be the choice bit of the whole shoulder." [...] "What then, my Lord?" [...] replied the first; [...] "it seems this is a shoulder of mutton all this while." [...] "Pray, sir," [...] says Peter, [...] "eat your victuals and leave off your impertinence, if you please, for I am not disposed to relish it at present;" [...] but the other could not forbear, being over-provoked at the affected seriousness of Peter's countenance. [...] "My Lord," [...] said he, [...] "I can only say, that to my eyes and fingers, and teeth and nose, it seems to be nothing but a crust of bread." [...] Upon which the second put in his word. [...] "I never saw a piece of mutton in my life so nearly resembling a slice from a twelve-penny loaf." [...] "Look ye, gentlemen," [...] cries Peter in a rage, [...] "to convince you what a couple of blind, positive, ignorant, wilful puppies you are, I will use but this plain argument; by G---, it is true, good, natural mutton as any in Leadenhall Market; and G--- confound you both eternally if you offer to believe otherwise." [...] Such a thundering proof as this left no further room for objection; the two unbelievers began to gather and pocket up their mistake as hastily as they could. [...] "Why, truly," [...] said the first, [...] "upon more mature consideration"--"Ay," [...] says the other, interrupting him, [...] "now I have thought better on the thing, your Lordship seems to {{have a great deal of}} reason." [...] "Very well," [...] said Peter. [...] "Here, boy, fill me a beer-glass of claret. Here's to you both with all my heart." [...] The two brethren, much delighted to see him so readily appeased, returned their most humble thanks, and said they would be glad to pledge his Lordship. [...] "That you shall," [...] said Peter, [...] "I am not a person to refuse you anything that is reasonable; wine moderately taken is a cordial. Here is a glass apiece for you; it is true natural juice from the grape; none of your damned vintner's brewings." [...] Having spoke thus, he presented to each of them another large dry crust, bidding them drink it off, and not be bashful, for it would do them no hurt. The two brothers, after having performed the usual office in such delicate conjunctures, of staring a sufficient period at Lord Peter and each other, and finding how matters were like to go, resolved not to enter on a new dispute, but let him carry the point as he pleased; for he was now got into one of his mad fits, and to argue or expostulate further would only serve to render him a hundred times more untractable.|$|E
