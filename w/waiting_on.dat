5|$|On the {{accession}} of Queen Victoria, {{he took up}} {{roles in}} the Royal Household, becoming a groom-in-waiting on 27 July 1837, and {{taking part in the}} coronation procession the following year. He still retained his army commission, and progressed steadily in rank through his retirement, becoming a major-general on 23 November 1841, lieutenant-general on 11 November 1851, and full general on 14 August 1859; on 1 September 1848, he took the colonelcy of the 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment of Foot. In 1855, he accompanied the young Prince Alfred to Geneva to supervise his studies there. In 1858 he was appointed a member of the Royal Commission set up to look into the functioning of the militia. He resigned his role as groom in <b>waiting</b> <b>on</b> 18 November 1859, because of ill-health; he was appointed an extra groom in <b>waiting</b> <b>on</b> 28 March 1860, and promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 18 May 1860.|$|E
5|$|A battle {{certainly}} ensued {{although there}} are naturally two accounts as to what actually took place. According to the Burmese chronicles, the Burmese command fielded an army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza, the Viceroy of Prome, as a decoy and the two armies lurked on the flanks in order to encircle any overstretched Siamese forces. As planned, the Siamese vanguard troops pressed on Thado Dhamma Yaza's army, allowing Bayinnaung's army <b>waiting</b> <b>on</b> the left flank to encircle the Siamese forces, which subsequently were wiped out. Tabinshwehti's army on the right flank drove back the remaining Siamese forces into the city.|$|E

5|$|An east–west freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing traffic to access downtown Lansing in the 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal {{for what would}} become the Interstate Highway System. As originally proposed by the Michigan State Highway Department in 1958, the freeway was to be called I-296. The department was <b>waiting</b> <b>on</b> approval of a final numbering scheme the next year, before the first Interstates were signed in the state in 1959. By the time construction started on the Lansing freeway, it was numbered I-496.|$|E
5|$|Ancona {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arman Brothers {{shipyard}} in Bordeaux, France on 11 August 1862, the last member of her class to begin construction. She was launched on 17 October 1864 and completed in April 1866. Two months later, in June, Italy declared war on Austria, {{as part of the}} Third Italian War of Independence, which was fought concurrently with the Austro-Prussian War. The Italian fleet commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, initially adopted a cautious course of action; he was unwilling to risk battle with the Austrian Navy, {{despite the fact that the}} Austrian fleet was much weaker than his own. Persano claimed he was simply <b>waiting</b> <b>on</b> the ironclad ram , en route from Britain, but his inaction weakened morale in the fleet, with many of his subordinates openly accusing him of cowardice.|$|E
5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is <b>waiting</b> <b>on</b> a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E

5|$|Before daybreak on February 15, 1916, between 100 and 300 Vietnamese {{wearing white}} headbands, white {{trousers}} and black tops, armed with sticks, farm implements and knives, sailed along the Arroyo Chinoise waterway and disembarked near {{the centre of}} Saigon. They had pretended to be working the transport industry, delivering fruit, vegetables and building materials.

5|$|Hurricane Ismael {{produced}} 30foot (9m) waves {{over the}} Gulf of California and coastal waters off of Mexico. The hurricane, which was forecast {{to move more}} slowly, left hundreds of fisherman unprepared due to deficient communications between the boats and harbor authorities. As a result, 52 boats were wrecked, of which 20 sank. 57 fishermen died offshore, with dozens washing ashore as the high tides receded. About 150 fishermen survived the storm by <b>waiting</b> <b>on</b> islands, sandbars, or disabled fishing boats. Navy rescue teams and other fishermen searched for days off the Mexican coast to find victims and survivors from the storm.|$|E

5|$|The {{crossing}} was not {{secure and}} when the Germans realised something was happening they opened fire with machine-guns and targeted the south bank with artillery fire, sinking some boats or killing their crews. At dawn the evacuation ended with around 500 men still <b>waiting</b> <b>on</b> the north bank. A small number of men tried to swim across and some {{made it to the}} far bank. Of the men left behind, 200 evaded capture and reached the safety of the south bank over the following days.|$|E

The only way out is being blocked off by some of the boats, which stay there until men who have been <b>waiting</b> <b>on</b> shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E

5|$|As a pinch hitter, Caballero {{came through}} with hits in clutch situations, notably against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 30. Behind 6–3 at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, the Phillies sent Caballero {{to the plate}} to pinch hit {{in the top of}} the seventh inning. He led off the inning with a single, scoring the first run of a seesaw come-from-behind rally that ended with a 9–8 Phillies victory, closer Jim Konstanty's 13th of the season. Caballero {{displayed}} his running skills again in September, replacing Goliat in the ninth inning of another game against the Cardinals, and scoring a late-inning run in place of Lopata against the Cincinnati Reds several days later to tie a close game that the Phillies eventually lost in 18 innings. On September 26, Caballero scored another crucial run against the Boston Braves when he pinch-ran for outfielder Dick Sisler. <b>Waiting</b> <b>on</b> third base after advancing from first on a Del Ennis single to center field, Jones hit a high ground ball to Boston shortstop Sibby Sisti, who booted the ball and allowed Caballero to score the game-tying run; the Phillies won, 8–7.|$|E

5|$|Formidabile {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée {{shipyard}} in La Seyne, France in December 1860, originally ordered by the Navy of the Kingdom of Sardinia. She was launched on 1 October 1861 and was completed in May 1862; by this time, the Sardinian fleet had been reformed as the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) of the newly unified Kingdom of Italy. In June 1866, Italy declared war on Austria, {{as part of the}} Third Italian War of Independence, which was fought concurrently with the Austro-Prussian War.

5|$|Gerard van Swieten, whom Maria Theresa had {{recruited}} {{following the}} death of her sister, Archduchess Maria Anna, founded the Vienna General Hospital, revamped Austria's educational system and served as the Empress's personal physician. After calling in van Swieten, Maria Theresa asked him to study the problem of infant mortality in Austria. Following his recommendation, she made a decree that autopsies would be mandatory for all hospital deaths in the city of Graz, Austria's second largest city. This law – still in effect today – combined with the relatively stable population of Graz, resulted {{in one of the most}} important and complete autopsy records in the world. Maria Theresa banned the creation of new burial grounds without prior government permission, thus countering wasteful and unhygienic burial customs. Her decision to have her children inoculated after the smallpox epidemic of 1767 was responsible for changing Austrian physicians' negative view of inoculation. The empress herself inaugurated inoculation in Austria by hosting a dinner for the first sixty-five inoculated children in Schönbrunn Palace, <b>waiting</b> <b>on</b> the children herself.|$|E
5|$|Meermins crew, now led by Krause's {{assistant}} Olof Leij, {{managed to}} communicate with the militia on shore by means of messages in bottles, and persuaded them to light the signal fires for which the Malagasy still on board were <b>waiting.</b> <b>On</b> seeing the fires, the Malagasy cut the ship's anchor cable and allowed the ship to drift towards the shore, after which she ran aground on an offshore sandbank. The Malagasy could then see the militia on the shore preparing to come to the ship's assistance, and realised that their situation was hopeless; they surrendered and were once again shackled. Captain Muller, ship's mate Daniel Carel Gulik and Krause's assistant Olof Leij were tried in the Dutch East India Company's Council of Justice; all three were fired from the Company, while Muller and Gulik were also stripped of their rank and wages. The slaves were not tried, but the two surviving leaders of the mutiny, named in Dutch East India Company records as Massavana and Koesaaij, were sent to Robben Island for observation, where Massavana died three years later; Koesaaij survived there for another 20years. In 2004 an ongoing search was begun for Meermins remains.|$|E
