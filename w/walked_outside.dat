According to the Independent, Laura grabbed another gun, a Winchester rifle hidden behind a trunk. L. D. grabbed the Winchester at the same time, and during the struggle for the gun, it went off. A shell passed through Constable Martin's pant legs, grazing him in the thigh, then hit Loney in the hip and entered his abdomen. He <b>walked</b> <b>outside</b> and died a few minutes later.|$|E
5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One {{of the women}} who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. When she told him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and <b>walked</b> <b>outside.</b> Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{the symbols}} , [...] {{can also be}} used to stand for any {{statement}} of our language. For example, [...] can stand for I <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> or I <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> and I look around. The sentence It is necessary that I <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> would look like: [...] The sentence It is possible that I <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> would look like: [...]|$|R
5000|$|For example, [...] can be {{attached}} to a sentence such as I <b>walk</b> <b>outside.</b> The new sentence would look like: I <b>walk</b> <b>outside.</b> The entire new sentence would therefore read: It is necessary that I <b>walk</b> <b>outside.</b>|$|R
50|$|And when I {{say that}} Its {{necessary}} that I <b>walk</b> <b>outside,</b> {{this is the}} same as saying that Its not possible {{that it is not the}} case that I <b>walk</b> <b>outside.</b> Furthermore, when I say that Its not possible that it is not the case that I <b>walk</b> <b>outside,</b> {{this is the same}} as saying that Its necessary that I <b>walk</b> <b>outside.</b>|$|R

25|$|At about 21:40 on {{the evening}} of Saturday of 7 March, four off-duty British {{soldiers}} of the Royal Engineers <b>walked</b> <b>outside</b> the barracks to receive a pizza delivery from two delivery men. As the exchange was taking place, two masked gunmen in a nearby car (a green Vauxhall Cavalier) opened fire with Romanian AKM automatic rifles. The firing lasted for more than 30 seconds with more than 60 shots being fired. After the initial burst of gunfire, the gunmen walked over to the wounded soldiers lying on the ground and fired again at close range, killing two of them. Those killed were Sappers Mark Quinsey from Birmingham and Patrick Azimkar from London. The other two soldiers and two deliverymen were wounded. The soldiers were wearing desert fatigues and were to be deployed to Afghanistan the next day. A few hours later, the car involved was found abandoned near Randalstown, eight miles from the barracks.|$|E
500|$|While Cox {{was working}} with Deerhunter to produce Cryptograms, it was {{considered}} Kranky policy to not print the lyrics of an album in its liner notes. [...] This was a rule enforced by label owner Joel Leoschke, who believed the practice [...] "demystifi {{the experience of a}} rock record." [...] Despite largely agreeing with this sentiment, Cox chose to print the lyrics of Let the Blind Lead, in part because he wanted to [...] "see what they looked like," [...] having ad-libbed the words of every song on their first take. [...] In an interview with Pitchfork Media, Cox described the lyrical origins of each song on Let the Blind Lead; they are largely autobiographical in nature, reflecting life experiences of his. The song [...] "Recent Bedroom" [...] conveys an experience Cox had when his aunt died: [...] "She was in her bedroom, and everybody knew she was about to pass away, and she went out, she faded out, and everybody just started crying." [...] Although he was [...] "overwhelmed" [...] by her death, it did not bring him to tears like the rest of his family. This event is expressed in the song by the lines [...] "I <b>walked</b> <b>outside,</b> I could not cry / I don’t know, I don’t know why". [...] Cox’s inability to cry stemmed from his having been [...] "very involved in drugs" [...] at the time, which he believes eliminated his [...] "childhood instinct…to cry." [...] The song attempts to communicate an emotional vacancy and sense of detachment characterized by [...] "moving from childhood to adolescence".|$|E
5000|$|So {{using the}} symbols and their meaning, the first modal axiom, [...] could stand for: Its {{necessary}} that I <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> if {{and only if}} its not possible {{that it is not the}} case that I <b>walk</b> <b>outside.</b>|$|R
5000|$|But {{the symbol}} [...] {{can be used}} to stand for any {{sentence}} instead of writing out entire sentences. So any sentence such as I <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> or I <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> and I look around are symbolized by [...]|$|R
5000|$|Thus for any {{sentence}} [...] (simple or compound), {{the compound}} sentences [...] and [...] can be formed. Sentences such as It is necessary that I <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> or It {{is possible that}} I <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> would therefore look like [...] and , respectively.|$|R

Immediately the two men then drew their guns, but Peel's arm was unintentionally locked by a shocked Niel, who was tugging his arm and slowing his draw. Bull managed to get off two shots and Peel fell face down into the street. Bull then walked up calmly, and fired a third round into Peel's head, killing him.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson {{died from}} a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at Owl Farm, his [...] "fortified compound" [...] in Woody Creek, Colorado, at 5:42p.m. on February 20, 2005. His son Juan, daughter-in-law Jennifer, and {{grandson}} were visiting for the weekend. His wife Anita, {{who was at the}} Aspen Club, {{was on the phone with}} him as he cocked the gun. According to the Aspen Daily News, Thompson asked her to come home to help him write his ESPN column, then set the receiver on the counter. Anita said she mistook the cocking of the gun for the sound of his typewriter keys and hung up as he fired. Will and Jennifer were in the next room when they heard the gunshot, but mistook the sound for a book falling and did not check on Thompson immediately. Juan Thompson found his father's body. According to the police report and Anita's cell phone records, he called the sheriff's department half an hour later, then <b>walked</b> <b>outside</b> and fired three shotgun blasts into the air to [...] "mark the passing of his father".
