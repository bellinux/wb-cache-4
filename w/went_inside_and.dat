25|$|Bryant {{travelled}} to Forcett Village, arriving {{some time}} around 11:00a.m. He continued down to Port Arthur and was seen driving into Seascape down the Arthur Highway around 11:45a.m. He {{stopped at the}} Seascape guest accommodation site {{that his father had}} wanted to purchase, owned by David and Noelene Martin. Bryant <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> fired several shots, then gagged David Martin and stabbed him. Witnesses testified to different numbers of shots fired at this time. It was stated in court that it was believed that this was the time that Bryant killed the Martins, his first two victims.|$|E
25|$|At the {{breaking}} of camp, Aaron and his sons were to take down the Ark, the table of display, the lampstand, and the service vessels, and cover them all with cloths and skins. Only when Aaron and his sons had finished covering the sacred objects would the Kohathites come and lift them. Aaron's son Eleazar had responsibility for the lighting oil, the aromatic incense, the regular meal offering, the anointing oil, and all the consecrated things in the Tabernacle. God charged Moses and Aaron to {{take care not to}} let the Kohathites die because they <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> witnessed the dismantling of the sanctuary.|$|E
25|$|As Roberts {{drove away}} with Mangum, {{the two women}} began to argue. Roberts pulled over and {{attempted}} to push Mangum out of the car. When that failed, Roberts drove Mangum to a nearby Kroger supermarket, <b>went</b> <b>inside,</b> <b>and</b> told a female security guard that a woman was refusing to leave her car. The guard walked {{to the car and}} asked Mangum to leave, but Mangum remained in the vehicle. The guard said that she did not smell alcohol on Mangum's breath, but thought she might have been under the influence of other drugs. At 1:22 AM, the guard called 911 to report that Mangum refused to leave the car. Police then arrived, removed Mangum from the car and questioned her.|$|E

2500|$|McNamara {{had seen}} enough {{and went to}} the mound. He took the ball from Schiraldi and called on his former closer, Bob Stanley to face Wilson with the tying run ninety feet away from scoring. Stanley had already faced Wilson three times in the series, {{retiring}} him twice. The last time Wilson faced him was in Game 4, and he recorded a single. Stanley got Wilson to keep missing and fouling off pitches, with the count at 2-2 after six pitches. For a second time, the Red Sox were one strike away from victory. [...] But on the seventh pitch, Stanley lost control of a pitch that <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> nearly hit Wilson. Wilson fell over and waved Mitchell in to score the tying run as Gedman could not field the ball in time, while Knight moved into scoring position with what was now the winning run. [...] Interestingly, Stanley appeared to have balked by failing to come to a stop in his [...] "set" [...] position after starting his motion. [...] Had the apparent balk been called, the result would have been virtually the same (with Mitchell scoring and Knight advancing to second), but with Wilson still facing a 2-2 count.|$|E
2500|$|Kirsten {{told police}} he went to Cornell’s room at 12:15a.m., but couldn't access the locked room. He then had a {{telephone}} conversation with Vicky Cornell. [...] "I told Vicky that they wouldn’t come {{open the door and}} she told me to kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found the bedroom door locked. I called the hotel operator and told her that I needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, and I told them that I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She told me that she called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident." [...] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell's neck then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success. Cornell was pronounced dead at 1:30a.m., an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell's wife. It's unknown how long it took the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.|$|E
