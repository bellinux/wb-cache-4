Irrigation with <b>water</b> of different <b>salinity</b> levels was carried out on pot experiments. Differences in water uptake and plant growth; as well as proline, soluble sugar, and Na+ and K+ contents of the plant were quantified. The results showed a negative relationship between increasing <b>water</b> <b>salinity</b> and most of the measured plant growth parameters. Irrigation <b>water</b> <b>salinity</b> has negatively affected growth and biomass accumulation and led to reduced grain yield, water uptake and water productivity.
