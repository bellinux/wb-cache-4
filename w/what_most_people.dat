Just days after his appointment in April 2001, his first match in charge was an F.A Cup semi-final against great rivals Arsenal which Spurs lost 2–1. The following year, Tottenham reached the League Cup final in February 2002; after winning 5–1 against Hoddle's former club Chelsea in the semi-final second leg, Spurs were the favourites but they lost 2–1 to Blackburn Rovers. The club's promising early season form (which saw Hoddle voted Premier League Manager of the Month for October 2001) dwindled away into mediocrity and they finished ninth in the Premiership, an improvement on the previous season's 11th place but considerably less than <b>what</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> had been expecting.|$|E

500|$|In Active Liberty, Breyer {{argues that}} the Framers of the Constitution sought to {{establish}} a democratic government involving the maximum liberty for its citizens. Breyer refers to Isaiah Berlin’s Two Concepts of Liberty. The first Berlinian concept, being <b>what</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> understand by liberty, is [...] "freedom from government coercion". Berlin termed this [...] "negative liberty" [...] and warned against its diminution; Breyer calls this [...] "modern liberty". The second Berlinian concept– [...] "positive liberty"– is the [...] "freedom {{to participate in the}} government". In Breyer's terminology, this is the [...] "active liberty" [...] which the judge should champion. Having established what [...] "active liberty" [...] is, and positing the primary importance (to the Framers) of this concept over the competing idea of [...] "negative liberty", Breyer argues a predominantly utilitarian case for judges making rulings that give effect to the democratic intentions of the Constitution.|$|E

Speaking in 1995, he said, [...] "When it came to recording 'Pride' for The Unforgettable Fire album, Danny [...] was able to pick up from me that I had some interesting ideas but here was a slight lack of focus. My kick drum technique was then, as it is now, completely underdeveloped and I {{never got a chance to}} practice and learn like most people would. In the marching bands, I only used a snare and when I first got a kit, I never learned how to properly use all the elements together. So I went and listened to a basic demo of 'Pride' and tried to play a beat just using the kick and snare. But I couldn't get the kick to do what I wanted, so I got a floor tom down and did what I'd done in the past, which was if I couldn't physically do what was necessary, I'd find another way around it.

500|$|Later in the 18th century, the French philosopher Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, one of {{the leading}} naturalists of the time, {{suggested}} that <b>what</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> referred to as species were really just well-marked varieties, modified from an original form by environmental factors. For example, he believed that lions, tigers, leopards and house cats might all have a common ancestor. He further speculated that the 200 or so species of mammals then known might have descended from as few as 38 original animal forms. Buffon's evolutionary ideas were limited; he believed each of the original forms had arisen through spontaneous generation and that each was shaped by [...] "internal moulds" [...] that limited the amount of change. Buffon's works, Histoire naturelle (1749–1789) and Époques de la nature (1778), containing well-developed theories about a completely materialistic origin for the Earth and his ideas questioning the fixity of species, were extremely influential. Another French philosopher, Denis Diderot, also wrote that living things might have first arisen through spontaneous generation, and that species were always changing through a constant process of experiment where new forms arose and survived or not based on trial and error; an idea that can be considered a partial anticipation of natural selection. Between 1767 and 1792, James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, included in his writings not only the concept that man had descended from primates, but also that, in response to the environment, creatures had found methods of transforming their characteristics over long time intervals. Charles Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, published Zoonomia (1794–1796) which suggested that [...] "all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament." [...] In his poem Temple of Nature (1803), he described the rise of life from minute organisms living in mud to all of its modern diversity.|$|E

2500|$|Canzone Napoletana is <b>what</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> {{think of}} when they think of Neapolitan music.

The winner of the first festival was a song entitled Te voglio bene assaie; it was composed by the prominent opera composer, Gaetano Donizetti. The festival ran regularly until 1950 when it was abandoned. A subsequent Festival of Neapolitan Song on Italian state radio enjoyed some success in the 1950s but was eventually abandoned as well. The period since 1950 has produced such songs as Malafemmena by Totò, Indifferentemente by Mario Trevi and Carmela by Sergio Bruni.

2500|$|Vague {{and general}} ideas of {{evolution}} continued to proliferate among the mid-eighteenth century Enlightenment philosophers. G. L. L. Buffon suggested that <b>what</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> {{referred to as}} species were really just well-marked varieties. He thought {{that the members of}} what was then called a genus (which in terms of modern scientific classification would be considered a family) are all descended from a single, common ancestor. The ancestor of each family had arisen through spontaneous generation; environmental effects then caused them to diverge into different species. He speculated that the 200 or so species of mammals then known might have descended from as few as 38 original forms. Buffon's concept of evolution was strictly limited. He believed there were [...] "internal molds" [...] that shaped the spontaneous generation of each family and that the families themselves were entirely and eternally distinct. Thus, lions, tigers, leopards, pumas and house cats could all share a common ancestor, but dogs and house cats could not. [...] Although Darwin's foreword to his 6th edition of Origin credited Aristotle with foreshadowing the concept of natural selection, he also wrote that [...] "the first author who in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon".|$|E
2500|$|Investment and {{accumulation}} goals: planning how {{to accumulate}} enough money – for large purchases and life events – is <b>what</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> {{consider to be}} financial planning. [...] Major reasons to accumulate assets include, purchasing a house or car, starting a business, paying for education expenses, and saving for retirement. Achieving these goals requires projecting what they will cost, and {{when you need to}} withdraw funds that will be necessary to be able to achieve these goals. [...] A major risk to the household in achieving their accumulation goal is the rate of price increases over time, or inflation. [...] Using net present value calculators, the financial planner will suggest a combination of asset earmarking and regular savings to be invested in a variety of investments. [...] In order to overcome the rate of inflation, the investment portfolio has to get a higher rate of return, which typically will subject the portfolio to a number of risks. [...] Managing these portfolio risks is most often accomplished using asset allocation, which seeks to diversify investment risk and opportunity. [...] This asset allocation will prescribe a percentage allocation to be invested in stocks (either preferred stock or common stock), bonds (for example mutual bonds or government bonds, or corporate bonds), cash and alternative investments. [...] The allocation should also take into consideration the personal risk profile of every investor, since risk attitudes vary from person to person.|$|E
