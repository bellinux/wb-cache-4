25|$|Once {{again there}} were two {{competing}} national women's suffrage organizations, but the result this time <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a division of labor. The NAWSA burnished its image of respectability and engaged in highly organized lobbying at both the national and state levels. The smaller NWP also engaged in lobbying but became increasingly known for activities that were dramatic and confrontational, most often in the national capital.|$|E
25|$|Sheffield Pike. This name is unexplained. Its {{first known}} use {{is by the}} Ordnance Survey in 1859. One {{possibility}} is that it reflects {{the influence of the}} Howard family at Greystoke, the Dukes of Norfolk, who also owned estates in Sheffield, though there is no direct evidence for this explanation. Another possibility is that the original name <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> Sheepfold Pike, and that the pronunciation became corrupted, though again there is no evidence for this. These two explanations need not be mutually exclusive.|$|E

You can go on iTunes, every episode is No. 1, ahead of all these bigger shows. The streams are high, the DVR time-shifting number <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 40%. There’s a much bigger audience for the show than the (Nielsen) numbers might indicate." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{numbers of}} {{performers}} used, mainly dancers, is clearly staggering {{compared to the}} regular comedy or serious play, where the norm <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 10–15 actors plus a few extras. Although actual numbers are generally vague in these mass scene stage directions, dance scenes {{like that of the}} cyclops, and all the cupids who will join them on the floor minutes later, rely on coordination, choreography, and generous collective effects. Of course the many highly paid dancers would be busy in many roles, returning as townspeople after the scene change of Act 3 with most of the gold paint hastily washed off, and entranced looking upwards to see [...] "Mars and Venus meet in the air in their chariots, his drawn by horses, and hers by doves".|$|E
500|$|In Augustine's De Genesi contra Manichæos, on Genesis he says: [...] "To {{suppose that}} God formed {{man from the}} dust with bodily hands is very childish. ...God neither formed man with bodily hands nor did he breathe upon him with throat and lips." [...] Augustine {{suggests}} in other work his theory of the later development of insects out of carrion, and {{the adoption of the}} old [...] or evolution theory, showing that [...] "certain very small animals may not have been created on the fifth and sixth days, but may have originated later from putrefying matter." [...] Concerning Augustine's De Trinitate (On the Trinity), White wrote that Augustine [...] "...develops at length the view that in the creation of living beings there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a growth—that God is the ultimate author, but works through secondary causes; and finally argues that certain substances are endowed by God with the power of producing certain classes of plants and animals." ...|$|E
500|$|Sound editor Bruce Tanis {{explained}} {{the production of}} sound {{that went into the}} episode in an interview with Designing Sound: [...] "In 'Fracture', the villain has created a serum which several characters inject because of a type of post-hypnotic suggestion. He has invented a frequency generator which causes these people to crystallize and then explode. In one of the best scenes all season, Walter and Astrid are in the lab and, using a watermelon for their experiments, are able to determine the exact frequency that the villain’s generator operates on. It <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 68.7 megacycles (I don’t recall exactly), so I used the signal generator plugin and created some tones that started out as 68.7 megacycles. They were simply low-frequency tones on their own so I processed them so that they warbled and chorused and were a bit more mysterious than the straight tone. It ended up being pretty subtle for television, but when Walter identifies the tone as a certain frequency, that’s what’s actually playing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Loos {{returned}} to California just as Griffith, {{who wanted to}} make longer films, was leaving Triangle, and she joined director and future husband John Emerson for a string of successful Douglas Fairbanks films. Loos and company realized that Douglas Fairbanks' acrobatics were an extension of his effervescent personality and parlayed his natural athletic ability into swashbuckling adventure roles. His Picture in the Papers (1916) was noted for its wry style of discursive and witty subtitles: [...] "My most popular subtitle introduced {{the name of a}} new character. The name <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this: 'Count Xxerkzsxxv.' Then there was a note, 'To those of you who read titles aloud, you can't pronounce the Count's name.

Hearing noises, he later put on dry clothes and asked someone what the time was: it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 2:30a.m., the senator recalled.

[...] Twenty years later the figures were six and four. [...] This was a pittance compared with the money that the gentry could make from their wagers: e.g., Lord Frederick Beauclerk remarked that he made some £630 a year from cricket, {{but it was a}} good income compared with those of artisans and labourers: at the time the weekly wage of a farm labourer <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> seven shillings and sixpence. Thus, to take the 1788 season as an example, Beldham played in 10 known matches, his side winning six of them, for which he was paid 42 guineas, or £44 & 2 shillings, or slightly over two and a quarter years wages for a farm worker.|$|E
