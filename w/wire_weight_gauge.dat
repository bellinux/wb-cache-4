40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the technological underpinnings and features of present-day scanning basis <b>weight</b> <b>gauges</b> for papermaking. In addition, the signal {{produced by the}} sensor will be incorporated into {{a discussion of the}} process control system for the paper machine. While the purpose of the gauge is to measure machine-direction (MD) and cross-direction (CD) properties, the incorporation of the gauge’s signal into the larger control system is especially pertinent since the gauge can only measure a compromise element of a true property attribute. Some mention will also be made of non-scanning, full-sheet gauges. HISTORY AND PROGNOSIS In the early 1980 ’s, Walbaum and Lisnyansky gave an excellent review of many of the on-line instruments for paper quality measurements [1]. In the same time period, Pfeifer described on-line sensors for the measurement of basis weight [2, 3]. Certain books, which are typically thought of as text or reference books, also contain discussions of basis <b>weight</b> <b>gauges,</b> such as that by Smook [4].

These factors are directly related to aircraft fuel consumption, speed and range. This project’s focus is on RF front-end electronics. The main goal here is to bring aircraft radio equipment {{as close as possible to}} the antennas in order to minimize <b>wiring</b> <b>weight</b> and complexity. This calls for a drastic volume reduction of the radio equipment. To this end, the system level requirements for the RF front-ends in terms of frequency bandwidths, data rates, etc, are first investigated in order to identify applications where the proposed volume reductions are the most beneficial and feasible. Following this, the focus was on an architectural investigation of alternative topologies that can meet the specification. For each topology considered the front-end-level specification need to be translated to circuit/component level requirements. For each case, performance, cost and technical risk analyses are carried out. Then, the design and prototyping of key RF front-end circuits for the selected architecture are undertaken. The multilayered Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) technology had to be considered as a high risk but more advantageous option in terms of volume/weight reduction. Finally, we aimed at integrating and testing the proposed RF front-end chain, first by characterizing each component individually, and then as a whole front-end subsystem...|$|R

They must remain aligned at liquid He temperatures: cavities to ± 400 µm and solenoids to ± 200 µm after a vertical contraction of ~ 4 mm. A wire position monitor (WPM) system based on a TESLA design has been developed, built, and tested with a prototype cryomodule. The system is based on the measurement of signals induced in pickups by a 215 MHz signal carried by a wire through the WPMs. The wire is stretched between the warm tank walls parallel to the beam axis providing a position reference. The sensors, one per cavity and two per solenoid, are attached to the cold elements to monitor their motion during pre-alignment, pumping and cool down.
