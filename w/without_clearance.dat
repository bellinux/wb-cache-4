25|$|The {{aircraft}} began taxiing without {{communicating with}} the control tower. It maneuvered erratically and entered a runway <b>without</b> <b>clearance.</b> The tower officers tried to make contact, {{but there was no}} response; and the tracking transponders were turned off.

25|$|Clipper Victor, {{which was}} the first Boeing 747 to carry fare-paying {{passengers}} in 1970 (N736PA), was involved in the Tenerife disaster on March 27, 1977, the deadliest aviation accident in history. On that day, Clipper Victor operated a charter flight, PA 1736, from Los Angeles to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, Spain, via New York. The aircraft, along with many other aircraft, diverted to Los Rodeos Airport on Tenerife because of a bomb scare at Las Palmas. After Las Palmas airport reopened, the diverted aircraft began preparations for departure. Clipper Victor was instructed to taxi along the active runway after the preceding KLM. Although visibility was extremely poor due to thick fog, the pilot of the KLM aircraft (also a Boeing 747) commenced takeoff <b>without</b> <b>clearance</b> and collided with the Pan Am airplane still taxiing on the runway. A total of 583 people were killed. 335 passengers on the Pan Am plane died while 61 survived.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{players were}} {{permitted}} to cross <b>without</b> a <b>clearance,</b> not all transfers occurred in this manner, particularly {{in the first years}} of the schism; nevertheless, the changes gave players a stronger bargaining chip in negotiations. If a player demonstrated a willingness to accept a VFL suspension by crossing to the VFA <b>without</b> a <b>clearance,</b> then it was in his VFL club's best interests to grant the clearance in the hope that he might later return, rather than allow him to take a suspension which would prevent that from occurring. Not all clubs followed this pragmatic approach: South Melbourne, for example, made a point of refusing clearances to players unless they had given the club ten years of service, and it consequently lost many players <b>without</b> <b>clearances.</b> Many players still sought clearances, as they were keen to keep their options to return to the VFL open, and some turned down big VFA offers if their clearances weren't granted; Jack Dyer, for example, was denied a clearance to Yarraville in 1940, and he opted not to cross <b>without</b> a <b>clearance</b> because he harboured ambitions to return to be playing-coach of [...]|$|R
2500|$|The legal {{department}} of the publisher of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas said the book could not be published <b>without</b> <b>clearance</b> by Acosta, as references to him were recognizable. Acosta initially refused the clearance, {{saying that he was}} insulted by Thompson's alteration of his race—Thompson had described him as a [...] "300-pound Samoan." [...] He understood, however, that inserting his real name and race would necessitate extensive rewriting and delay publication of the book, so he promised clearance provided that his name and picture would appear on the dustjacket.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most notable}} example {{is that of}} the top Chinese {{scientist}} Qian Xuesen. Allegations were made that he was a communist, and his security clearance was revoked in June 1950. The Federal Bureau of Investigation located an American Communist Party document from 1938 with his name on it, and used it as justification for the revocation. <b>Without</b> <b>clearance,</b> Qian found himself unable to pursue his career, and within two weeks announced plans to return to mainland China, which had come under the government of Communist leader Mao Zedong. The Undersecretary of the Navy at the time, Dan A. Kimball, tried to keep Qian in the U.S., commenting: [...] "It was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a Communist than I was, and we forced him to go." ...|$|E
2500|$|A city-level {{official}} in Liaoning province {{was asked by}} investigators what direction Bo Xilai may have given regarding removing organs from Falun Gong prisoners. The official replied “I was asked {{to take care of}} this task. Party central is actually taking care of this...He [...] was involved quite positively, yeah it seemed quite positive. At that time we mainly talked about it during the meetings within the Standing Committee.” The official hung up after realizing that he had not confirmed the identity of the caller. Another phone call recipient was a medical doctor at a military hospital in Liaoning. When asked about whether Falun Gong practitioners’ organs were ever used in transplant operations at a nearby hospital, the official answered in the affirmative: “All that was processed through the court.” The doctor soon grew uncomfortable with the line of questioning and refused to discuss the issue further <b>without</b> <b>clearance</b> from the hospital’s political division.|$|E

50|$|Ron Wilson (5 June 1915 - 20 September 1984) was {{a former}} Australian rules footballer who played with Melbourne and St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

2500|$|The Tenerife disaster, which {{occurred}} on 27 March 1977, remains the accident {{with the highest}} number of airliner passenger fatalities. 583 people died when a KLM Boeing 747-206B attempted to take off <b>without</b> <b>clearance,</b> and collided with a taxiing Pan Am 747-121 at Los Rodeos Airport on the Canary Island of Tenerife, Spain. [...] No one on the KLM 747 survived while 61 of the 396 passengers and crew on the Pan Am aircraft survived. Pilot error from the KLM aircraft was the primary cause. [...] Owing to a communication misunderstanding, the KLM captain thought he had clearance for takeoff. Another cause was dense fog, meaning the KLM flight crew was unable to see the Pan Am aircraft on the runway until immediately prior to the collision. The accident had a lasting influence on the industry, particularly in the area of communication. An increased emphasis was placed on using standardized phraseology in air traffic control (ATC) communication by both controllers and pilots alike, thereby reducing the chance for misunderstandings. As part of these changes, the word [...] "takeoff" [...] was removed from general usage, and is only spoken by ATC when actually clearing an aircraft to take off.|$|E
