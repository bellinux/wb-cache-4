5|$|H. G. Wells' 1898 novel The War of The Worlds {{included}} a chaotic rush to board trains at Liverpool Street as the Martian machines overran military defences in the West End, {{and described the}} crushing of people under the <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steam engines.|$|E
5|$|The XB-70's {{maiden flight}} was on 21 September 1964. In {{the first flight}} test, between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine had {{to be shut down}} shortly after take-off, and an {{undercarriage}} malfunction warning meant that the flight was flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, the rear <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> port side main gear locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E
5|$|In March 1941, 250 {{officers}} and men from No. 3 Commando {{took part in}} the first large-scale Commando raid, which was launched on four ports in the Lofoten Islands in Norway. The raid, codenamed Operation Claymore, proved to be a considerable success, resulting in the capture of a number of <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German Enigma encoding machine which helped the Allies to decode German radio traffic later in the war, as well as the destruction of a considerable amount of petrol and oil and the capture of several hundred Germans.|$|E

30|$|In <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> sidelong stimulations in {{straight}} lines, wheel and rail contact areas {{are shown in}} Fig.  1 and will generally be focused in <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> and the rail. In passing arch paths, <b>the</b> outer <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front axle <b>of</b> a bogie is diverted {{to a greater extent}} to the flange rather than outer <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back axle one.|$|R
25|$|Rear furrow wheel– It is <b>the</b> rear <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plough, {{which runs}} in the furrow.|$|R
5|$|The front {{landing gear}} is offset to the aircraft's right to allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front landing gear causes the A-10 to have dissimilar turning radii. Turning to the right on the ground takes less distance than turning left. The <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main landing gear partially protrude from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination of gravity and aerodynamic drag can open and lock the gear in place.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, 2010, a Red Line train derailed {{at about}} 10:13am as {{it left the}} Farragut North station in {{downtown}} Washington. After leaving the station, the train entered the pocket track north of the station. As it continued, an automatic derailer {{at the end of}} the pocket track intentionally derailed the train as a safety measure. If the train had continued moving forward on the pocket track, it would have entered the path of an oncoming train. The <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first two cars in the six-car, White-Flint-bound train were forced off the tracks, stopping the train. Almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50am and the NTSB arrived on the scene by noon. Two minor injuries were reported, and a third passenger was taken to George Washington University Hospital. The NTSB ruled the crash was due to the train operator's failure to follow standard procedures and WMATA management for failure to provide proper supervision of the train operator which resulted in the incomplete configuration of the train identification and destination codes leading to the routing of the train into the pocket track.|$|E
25|$|On November 5, 2013, Loewy {{was honored}} with a Google Doodle {{depicting}} a streamlined locomotive bearing a {{resemblance to the}} K4s Pacific #3768 shroud design, using the <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train to form the word Google.|$|E

25|$|The Polish word {{now most}} {{commonly}} used for bicycle – rower originates from Rover bicycles which had both <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same size (previous models usually had one bigger, one smaller – see Penny-farthing, and were called in Polish bicykl, from English bicycle).|$|E
25|$|The {{cars have}} to follow {{specific}} guidelines (e.g. the <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car must be {{in contact with the}} track at all times). The cars are raced on a 20m long track with two lanes, to allow two cars to be raced simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|For {{a reason}} that is not fully understood, the <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> replica were built with very narrow treads. It is {{possible}} that wheels were scaled off a model in the London Science Museum. As a result, it was unable to travel over modern pointwork.|$|E

5|$|Some Heathens {{celebrate}} the eight festivals found in <b>the</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year, {{a tradition that}} they share with Wiccans and other contemporary Pagan groups. Others celebrate only six of these festivals, as represented by a six-spoked <b>Wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> such festivals is criticized by other practitioners, who highlight that this system is of modern, mid-20th century origin and does not link with the original religious celebrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-Christian Germanic world.|$|R
50|$|Dale Jarrett officially {{retired from}} {{full-time}} competition, and handed <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Michael Waltrip Racing No. 44 Toyota Camry to David Reutimann.|$|R
25|$|The {{drive was}} on the {{trailing}} wheels and the slide bars were attached to a motion bracket just behind the leading wheels. The wheels themselves had twelve spokes and very large balance weights. The front pair of <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine were partially enclosed in splashers which did not come above the running plate.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, activist Sébastien Briat, who {{had tied}} himself to train tracks {{in front of}} a {{shipment}} of reprocessed nuclear waste, was run over by the <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train. The event happened in Avricourt, France, and the fuel (totaling 12 containers) was from a German plant, on its way to be reprocessed.|$|E
25|$|Same as the RH {{except for}} the Type F engine. The front body {{was based on the}} SG light truck, there were no doors and the rear of the body was heavily {{customised}} with typical fire appliance accessories (e.g. hoses, axes, ride-on steps, grab bars). In spite of looking like a small truck, the FH24 still used the single rear <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RH passenger car.|$|E

25|$|The line {{operated}} without serious incident until 7 October 2013, when two Variotram railcars derailed within {{the space of}} 20 minutes. Sections of track were replaced in September and it is thought the new track damaged the <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicles. All services were suspended and replaced by buses. Services resumed between The Star and Lilyfield on 18 October, and along {{the full length of}} the line on 30 October.|$|E
25|$|The MiG-21 uses a {{tricycle}} type undercarriage. On most variants {{the main}} landing gear uses tires that are 800mm in diameter and 200mm in width. Only the MiG-21F variants use tires with the size 660x200mm. The <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{main landing gear}} retract into the fuselage after rotating 87° and the shock absorbers retract into the wing. The nose gear retracts forward into the fuselage under the radar.|$|E
25|$|Another story {{talks about}} a wedding {{procession}} during {{which one of the}} <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to early}} Wicca's {{influence}} on Paganism and their syncretic adoption of Anglo-Saxon and Celtic motifs, {{the most commonly}} used English festival names for <b>the</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year tend to be Celtic and Germanic.|$|R

50|$|Aspergilla {{are also}} used in modern paganism, {{particularly}} to cleanse a ritual area in Wicca, {{as part of a}} spell, or during a <b>Wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year festival in contemporary Witchcraft. Lunarized water, saltwater, or rainwater are most typically used.|$|R
25|$|The Chennai MRTS uses 9-car {{electrical}} {{multiple unit}} trains, although the 9-car trains are more prevalent during peak hours and from Aug-2015 onwards all services are 9-cars only. The trains use overhead catenary for power supply and are broad gauge. A 9-car rake is typified by 3 motor coaches each at the front, the middle and the last. The motors are used to run the <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train at a stipulated speed limit. The MRTS coaches have entry and exit on both sides. The EMU coaches are manufactured by the Integral Coach Factory, Chennai.|$|E
25|$|Chinese south-pointing chariots {{may also}} have been very early {{applications}} of differentials. The chariot had a pointer which constantly pointed to the south, no matter how the chariot turned as it travelled. It could therefore be used as a type of compass. It is widely thought that a differential mechanism responded to any difference between the speeds of rotation of the two <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chariot, and turned the pointer appropriately. However, the mechanism was not precise enough, and, after a few miles of travel, the dial could have very well been pointing in the complete opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|The basic design, {{common to}} both models, {{was that of}} a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction with side-by-side seating for two in a fully enclosed cabin. The main gear <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> undercarriage were retractable, and the tailwheel was steerable. The aircraft structure incorporated a framework built up of welded steel tube which extended lengthwise from the engine firewall {{to the rear of the}} cabin, and spanwise from one undercarriage well to the other. Around this framework was a conventional, monocoque fuselage. The MAC-125 was powered by a single 125-hp engine while the MAC-145 production model had a 145-hp engine instead and a larger tail fin.|$|E
50|$|Another {{historical}} victory {{took place}} at the World Cup 2002 in Vincennes, where Varenne won even though <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sulky was broken, setting the world speed record of 2100 metres (unbeaten record 1.10.8 average per kilometer - track 1 kilometer).|$|R
