40|$|ABSTRACT. Skythrenchelys n. gen. {{differs from}} other {{myrophine}} ophichthids in {{the condition of}} its gill openings (moderately elongate and below lateral midline), dentition (large, conical and uniserial), posterior nostril (entirely outside mouth), and other characters. Skythrenchelys zabra n. sp., the type species, is described from India, the Philippines, Indonesia and northern Australia; S. lentiginosa n. sp. is described from the Red Sea. Scolecenchelys Ogilby, previously a subgenus of Muraenichthys Bleeker, is generically distinct {{on the basis of}} differences in dentition (teeth conical and uniserial or biserial vs blunt and multiserial), cephalic pores (2 pores between anterior and posterior nostrils vs 1 pore), and its posterior nostril condition (within vs outside mouth). Valid species of Muraenichthys and Scolecenchelys and their synonyms are identified. CASTLE, P. H. J., & JOHN E. MCCOSKER, 1999.

5000|$|The {{speckled}} <b>worm-eel,</b> [...] Myrophis punctatus, is {{a member}} of the Ophichthidae (snake eel) family. It was described by Christian Frederik Lütken in 1852.

This species has regenerative powers. They grow to a maximum size of 35.3 cm.|$|E
50|$|The Oriental <b>worm-eel</b> is {{of minor}} {{commercial}} interest to fisheries; it is caught {{by hand and}} in nets, and is sold fresh, usually as bait. Its diet consists of invertebrates, small fish and prawns. The IUCN redlist currently lists it as Least Concern, due to its wide distribution and lack of reported threats. It notes, however, that freshwater pollution occurs in its range, and could {{pose a threat to}} the species.|$|E
