2500|$|Cross Cafe in Mumbai was {{formerly}} Hitler's Cross cafe. The business sought {{to attract attention}} by using the Hitler theme, and was decorated with Nazi imagery. Actor Murli Sharma attended the opening party; when asked {{what he thought about}} the name, he said [...] "I am not really agitated as I have not read much about the man. However, from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> Hitler, I find this name rather amusing."

2500|$|Cohen {{showed an}} {{interest}} in Jesus as a universal figure, saying, [...] "I'm very fond of Jesus Christ. He {{may be the most}} beautiful guy who walked the face of this earth. Any guy who says 'Blessed are the poor.

His position cannot be comprehended. It is an inhuman generosity. A generosity that would overthrow the world if it was embraced because nothing would weather that compassion. I'm not trying to alter the Jewish view of Jesus Christ. But to me, in spite of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> the history of legal Christianity, the figure of the man has touched me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 1970, {{after one}} season at Miami, Bo Schembechler offered Burton an {{assistant}} coaching position at Michigan, and Burton accepted. [...] Despite his {{strong ties to}} Miami, Burton recalled {{that he could not}} pass on the opportunity to coach at Michigan: [...] "I left Miami to coach at Michigan because of the challenge and an upward move in the profession."

[...] Burton was the position coach for All-American receivers Jim Smith and Anthony Carter and to running back Jamie Morris. [...] In 1990, Burton said that Morris was favorite Michigan player. Morris gave credit to Burton for his development: [...] "Tirrel was everything to me. He was like my father and mother. He always was in my corner. Bo would get on me, and he would take some of the blame for me. He handled each individual the way he needed to be handled." [...] Burton reported that coaching under Schembechler had been a huge honor: [...] "Bo Schembechler was a great coach. He was from the same mold as Ara ... Bo was demanding of his coaches and his players. I learned most of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> football from Bo." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clancey has {{explained}} this work more simply as follows: “I worked with social scientists (anthropologists, sociologists, and educational psychologists)....We observed people in businesses (such as a customer call center) {{to understand how}} learning naturally occurs. We emphasized how people succeed in doing their work despite having inadequate tools or incomplete procedures, by studying how they helped and learned from each other.” He has also said that his “broad college background in computer science, philosophy, and anthropology...helped me understand the social scientists at the Institute for Research on Learning, so <b>I</b> could relate <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> computer science to what they <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> people.” ...|$|R
