After {{completing}} his studies and returning to Mumbai in 2007, Singh worked for a few years in advertising as a copywriter, with agencies like O and J. Walter Thompson. He then worked as an assistant director, but left it to pursue acting. He then decided to send his portfolio to directors. [...] He would go for all kinds of auditions, but did not get any good opportunities, while only getting calls for minor roles: [...] "Everything was so bleak. It was very frustrating. There were times I would think <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing the right thing or not." ...|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{was drafted}} by the Baltimore Orioles {{in the second round}} of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall. Despite a story written by SABR, Ripken was {{selected}} with the Orioles' predetermined draft pick, not through a forfeited pick from the Boston Red Sox after the Sox selected Dick Drago in the 1977 re-entry draft. The Orioles would select catcher Cecil Whitehead with the pick they received from Boston two picks after Ripken. On deciding to go straight from high school to the professional level, he said, [...] "When the colleges started coming around, Dad and I talked about mostly <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to pursue a career in baseball. If I had the ability, the feeling was to get on with it, and if it didn't work out, start over again in college at 25 or 26." [...] Ripken played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability. The Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding it would be easier for him to transition back to pitching if necessary than it would be for him to start hitting again.|$|E
500|$|As {{a college}} prospect, Rivals.com ranked him 30th nationally among dual-threat quarterbacks, Scouts, Inc. ranked him 33rd nationally among wide receivers, and SuperPrep placed him on its Virginia 33. ESPN {{assessed}} {{him as a}} [...] "do-it-all prospect" [...] and projected him as a wide receiver because of his size and speed. Smith was recruited by Maryland, Penn State, and Virginia Tech. He was shown interest by Virginia, but did not receive a scholarship offer. The Virginia staff, which questioned whether he had recovered his speed after a basketball injury during his junior year, asked Smith to run a 4.5-second 40-yard dash at a Nike combine at Clemson University, which he did. The Virginia staff then asked him to repeat the feat at the University of Virginia campus, but Maryland offered a scholarship, which Smith accepted. He later said, [...] "I kind of hold a grudge against U.Va. a little bit. I'm not afraid to say it. I kind of want {{to show them that}} they questioned my speed and <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to get it back. I want to show them that I'm all healed up." [...] Virginia head coach Al Groh said of the Fredericksburg native before the 2009 game against Maryland, [...] "Clearly if we [...] him being the type of player that he is now, he would be returning kicks for Virginia. So we are not above admitting that there is a player that certainly {{has turned out to be}} superior to what many people thought, including ourselves. He's—regardless of what the circumstances were in the past—he is a superior college football player." ...|$|E

500|$|Persona 4 {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from game critics upon release. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb {{described it as}} [...] "one of the best times I've had with video games, <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> playing by myself or watching someone else play it." [...] Famitsu pointed out that while [...] "there isn't much new from the last game", it favored the changes over the battle system, where the pacing [...] "is quick so it doesn't {{get to be a}} pain", and the ability to control party members [...] "makes play that much easier". IGN on the other hand noted that [...] "the pacing can be somewhat off", and [...] "some things feel repurposed or unaffected from previous games", while praising the game as an [...] "evolution of the RPG series, and an instant classic". It also noted that the soundtrack can be [...] "a bit repetitive". RPGFan's Ryan Mattich recommended Persona 4 as [...] "one of the best RPG experiences of the year", noting that [...] "among the cookie-cutter sequels and half-hearted remakes", the game is [...] "a near flawless example of the perfect balance between 'falling back on what works' and 'pushing the genre forward'." [...] 1UP.com's Andrew Fitch summarized Persona 4 as [...] "some of this decade's finest RPG epics", although the reviewer criticized its [...] "slight loading issues" [...] and the time spent [...] "waiting for the plot to advance". GameTrailers gave the game a score of 9.3, stating it's an exception to the rule of the Japanese role-playing genre, and that it stands out of any other JRPG, including its predecessor, Persona 3. Wired pointed out that while the graphics are not up to par with those of the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, [...] "the clever art style makes up for that". It also praised the game's soundtrack as [...] "excellent, especially the battle music".|$|E

Then, Attarpour told them that, just as your friends have killed our comrades, we have decided to execute you—the brain behind those executions. Jazani and the others began protesting. I {{do not know whether}} it was Attarpour or Colonel Vaziri who first pulled out a machine gun and started {{shooting}} them.

2500|$|In the San Francisco Chronicle, Walter Addiego stated, [...] "I {{fought hard}} against the emotionalism of In America [...] [...] [...] but I lost.

It got to me. I'm still trying to decide <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> won over or worn down— but why not give Sheridan the benefit of the doubt? [...] [...] [...] [...] is clearly drawing on deep personal reserves for this picture, and despite a few sequences when the creative hand seems intrusive, does well by his subject.

2500|$|For Marcel Janco, {{the events}} were an {{opportunity}} to discuss his own assimilation into Romanian society: {{in one of his}} conferences, he defined himself as [...] "an artist who is a Jew", rather than [...] "a Jewish artist". He later confessed his dismay at the attacks targeting him: [...] "nowhere, never, in Romania or elsewhere in Europe, during peacetime or the cruel years of , did anyone ask me <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a Jew or... a kike. [...] Hitler's Romanian minions managed to change this climate, to turn Romania into an antisemitic country." [...] The ideological shift, he recalled, destroyed his relationships with the Contimporanul poet Ion Barbu, who reportedly concluded, after admiring a 1936 exhibit: [...] "Too bad you're a kike!" [...] At around that time, pianist and fascist sympathizer Cella Delavrancea also assessed that Janco's contribution to theater was the prime example of [...] "Jewish" [...] and [...] "bastard" [...] art.|$|E

2500|$|The {{audition}} process proved difficult, {{as some of}} Akingbola's {{close friends}} were also considered for the part. He was dually motivated {{by the prospect of}} financial security, and the role itself. Enthused by the character outline, he tailored his performance to the detailed breakdown he was given, and attended his audition dressed in the style he believed Malick would wear. Akingbola recalls, [...] "They were very open with me, encouraging me to push it further and make him more aggressive." [...] The producers were flexible when it came to his interpretation of the character, and Akingbola believes it was his intense portrayal which secured him the role. He explained: [...] "They were looking for someone to put the flesh on the character, and that's what I did. I even wondered <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> pushing it too much, as people might have wondered how such an extreme person could be a doctor. But I think that's what got me the part in the end – {{they were looking for a}} character who would be in people's faces, be a bit dangerous and speak his mind!" [...] Following his successful audition, Akingbola began filming in September 2010. It took several months for him to become accustomed to the job security; initially he took extra roles before arriving to film Holby City. His first episode as Malick aired in January 2011.|$|E
