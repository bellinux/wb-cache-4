Subsequently, during World War I, the Battle of Liège (which lasted {{much longer than}} the German army had anticipated it <b>would)</b> <b>caused</b> a delay in German advances on France in 1914, allowing the French to reorganize better. To honor the city of Liège for its resistance, and because the city was shelled with Austrian guns (notably the Skoda 305 mm Model 1911), Paris' cafés started renaming the dessert from viennois to liégeois. In Liège itself, the dessert continued {{to be known as}} café viennois for a while.|$|E

In this paper we present an optimization based vision calibration method for errors in model and execution of pan-tilt unit in humanoid robot. This calibration method is constructed as an optimization problem to simultaneously get intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of camera, mechanical installation error, and pan-tilt unit's operation error to guarantee the accuracy of target locating.

40|$|Long-throated flumes provide {{economical}} {{and flexible}} water measurement capabilities {{for a wide}} variety of open-channel flow situations. Primary advantages include minimal head loss, low construction cost, adaptability to a variety of channel types, and ability to measure wide ranges of flows with custom-designed structures. Discharge coefficient of long-throated depends on many parameters such as upstream and downstream slope, step height and throat length. In order to investigate the effects of these parameters on the values of discharge coefficient, in this study a series of laboratory experiments were carried out in a flow measurement flume of rectangular cross section. The experiments carried out with different upstream and downstream slope, two step height (P = 7. 62 and 15. 62 cm), constant throat width (w = 25 cm) and throat length (L = 30. 48 cm). Eleven different models made of Plexiglas were tested in a horizontal flume for large range of discharges. The results of this study indicated the long-throated flume can be used for flow measurement with average of 1. 6 % flow measurement error. Also the results reveled that the decreasing of upstream slope and the increasing of downstream slope <b>would</b> <b>caused</b> the discharge coefficient is increased...|$|E

Hotel businesses are getting further aggressive with plethora of hotels available which honour the customer more options to choose and possess a high buying power decision. The intense rivalry among hotels drives them to be customer-oriented since customer is the king.

Also, this study will {{examine the effects of}} such factors on customer response behaviors. From the result, there are four factors extracted namely: 1) treatment experience, 2) price knowledge, 3) price expectation and 4) price information. Price knowledge was found to affect the customers’ reaction the most. Customers who acquire adequate knowledge about hotel room rates would not respond negatively to the hotel operators.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper {{is focused on the}} surface roughness variation in high speed fine turning of the austenitic stainless steel. Design/methodology/approach: A series of experimental tests have been done to evaluate the possibility of high speed fine turning of the austenitic stainless steel from the surface roughness variation and machining stability. Findings: It was found that, the smaller the feed rate, the smaller the surface roughness value. But when the feed rate smaller than the critical feed rate, the chatter will occurs and the surface roughness of the work piece would be deteriorated. The higher the cutting speed is, the higher the cutting temperature of cutting tool is. The cutting tool will be soften and the surface roughness of the workpiece will be deteriorated. Research limitations/implications: The tool chattering <b>would</b> <b>caused</b> poor surface roughness in high speed fine turning for feed rate smaller than 0. 02 mm/rev. The chatter suppression method must be considered when high speed fine turning of austenitic stainless steel. Originality/value: Most of the stainless steel machining proceeds at low cutting speed because the austenitic stainless steel is a hard machining material. The research result of this paper indicated that high speed fine turning of austenitic stainless steel is possible...|$|E
40|$|Based on Reanalysis {{datasets}} from National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) {{and summer}} rainfall datasets from China National Climate Center (NCC), by using trend analysis and composite analysis methods, {{the relationship between}} the reduction of summer precipitation in North China and northern hemispheric circulation changes was investigated. The results show that summer rainfall in North China had a significant decreasing tendency, especially true since 1965 in which an abrupt change occurred. The northern hemisphere atmospheric circulation at 500 hPa had a remarkable change after 1965, from outstanding meridional circulation to outstanding zonal circulation, leading to upper trough activity to decrease, resulting in the rainfall weather processes caused by upward motion behind trough significantly to reduce. At 500 hPa in Mongolian region, air temperature decreased, resulting in lower troposphere pressure to increase, leading to low pressure activity significantly to decrease and rainfall weather processes influencing North China to reduce. At the same time, the decreased air temperature in 500 hPa <b>would</b> <b>caused</b> the upper troposphere geopotential height to reduce, resulting in high–altitude jet southerly location, the East Asian summer monsoon to weaken, then it was difficult for water vapor transport to cross the Yangtze River valley and reach the North China region, with a southerly summer monsoon rainfall zone.

This research used completely randomized design with one factor that was GA 3 treatment which 0 ppm, 50 ppm, 100 ppm, 150 ppm and 200 ppm concentration. The measuring variables consist of hight, amount of leaves, width of leaves, fresh weight, dry weight, amount of filial, length and amount of stomata, total chlorophyll content and respiration rate. Data was analized by analysis of varians (ANAVA) and was continued by DMRT 5 %. The result of this research showed that treatment 50 ppm of giberellic acid (GA 3) caused the highest of plant growth that was showed by hight plant variabel, fresh weight and dry weight of plant.

Loss of strenght occurs because the chemical composition changes gradually in the cement paste. A fire <b>would</b> <b>caused</b> a fears of the collapse of a building, because the construction of the building is not safe anymore. Therefore the reinforcement of concrete beams need to be reinforced with additional steel bars are fitted crosswise to add the strenght flexure of its and reduce the risk of crack increment. This research is aims to determine the flexure strenght of reinforced beams with the addition of steels are fitted crosswise before and after burned and to compare the flexure srtenght of reinforced concrete beams are testing in laboratory experiments and analytically. Materials used in this study are sand, cement, gravel, water, and steel reinforcement. The conctrete plans based on a comparison of the cement, sand, and gravel is 1 : 2 : 3 that produce f’c = 16, 26 Mpa. The factor of cement water (f. a. s) used is 0, 5. In this research, variations of burning time is 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minute. The result showed that moment capacity of concrete beams without burning is 15, 532 kN. m, moment capacity of concrete beams after burned for 30 minute is 14, 531 kN. m, moment capacity of concrete beams after burned for 60 minute is 12, 495 kN. m, moment capacity of concrete beams after burned for 90 minute is 8, 859 kN. m, moment capacity of concrete beams after burned for 120 minute is 7, 207 kN. m.
