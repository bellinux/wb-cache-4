5|$|All Bismarck's {{resources}} were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria {{to use her}} influence <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>son</b> on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on {{people who did not}} respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too small a stock of loyalty to draw on. As Lord Salisbury told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with what must have been a mixture of pity and triumph, told him that her influence <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>son</b> could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.|$|E
