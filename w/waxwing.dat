5|$|The {{range of}} the Bohemian <b>waxwing</b> {{overlaps}} those of both {{the other members of}} the genus. The cedar <b>waxwing</b> is smaller than the Bohemian; it has browner upperparts, a white undertail and a white line above the black eye patch. Adult cedar waxwings have a yellowish belly, and all ages have less strongly patterned wings than the Bohemian <b>waxwing.</b> The Japanese <b>waxwing</b> is easily distinguished from its relatives; it has a red terminal band to the tail, the black mask extends up the rear of the crest, and there is no yellow stripe or red tips on the wings.|$|E

5|$|The {{waxwings}} are a family, Bombycillidae, of short-tailed stocky {{birds with}} soft plumage, a head crest and distinctively patterned wings and tails. There are three species, the Bohemian, cedar, and Japanese waxwings. DNA studies and shared {{features such as}} a relatively large size, grey underparts and similar undertail patterns suggest that the Japanese and Bohemian waxwings are most closely related within the genus. Although only the cedar and Bohemian waxwings normally have red tips on their wing feathers, this feature is occasionally shown by the Japanese <b>waxwing,</b> suggesting that this was originally a whole-family characteristic that has been lost in one species, rather than an indicator of a close relationship. DNA analysis confirms that the cedar <b>waxwing</b> diverged early from {{the other members of}} the family. Outside the genus, the closest relatives of the waxwings are believed to be the silky-flycatchers, the palmchat, and the grey hypocolius, all of which have sometimes been included in the Bombycillidae.|$|E
5|$|The Bohemian <b>waxwing</b> has a {{circumpolar}} distribution, breeding {{in northern}} regions of Eurasia and North America. In Eurasia, its northern nesting limit is {{just short of}} the treeline, roughly at the 10°C July isotherm, and it breeds south locally to about 51°N. Most birds breed between 60–67°N, reaching 70°N in Scandinavia. The North American subspecies breeds in the northwestern and north central areas of the continent, its range extending southwards beyond the US border in the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The bird life is {{dominated}} by species from the Siberian taiga, which are otherwise not common in Norway. Species inhabiting the park include Siberian jay, pine grosbeak, Bohemian <b>waxwing,</b> common crane and whooper swan. Several species of sparrow and charadriiformes are also common. There are also three species of Falconiformes—rough-legged buzzard, merlin and osprey, the latter which can be seen hunting over Ellenvatn and Ødevatn. The great grey owl and northern hawk-owl are common in years with good access to rodents.|$|E
5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage {{attitude}} control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained {{by means of the}} attitude control system. Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a <b>Waxwing</b> solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Bohemian {{waxwings}} are not brood parasitised by {{the common}} cuckoo or its relatives in Eurasia because the cuckoo's young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet. In North America, the waxwing's breeding range has little overlap with brown-headed cowbird, another parasitic species. Nevertheless, eggs of other birds {{placed in a}} Bohemian waxwing's nest are always rejected. This suggests that in the past, perhaps 3million years ago, the ancestral <b>waxwing</b> was a host of a brood parasitic species, and retains the rejection behaviour acquired then.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{densities of}} this <b>waxwing</b> are {{typically}} {{low compared to}} other passerines, usually less than ten birds per square kilometre (26per square mile) even in good habitat, although up to 35·6birds per square kilometre (92per square mile) {{have been found in}} Russia. One brood each year is normal. Maximum recorded ages are 5years 10months in North America and more than 13years 6months in Europe. The average life expectancy is unknown. Significant causes of death include predation, collisions with windows and cars, and poisoning by road salt consumed when drinking.|$|E
5|$|The Bohemian <b>waxwing</b> (Bombycilla garrulus) is a starling-sized {{passerine}} {{bird that}} breeds {{in the northern}} forests of Eurasia and North America. It has mainly buff-grey plumage, black face markings and a pointed crest. Its wings are patterned with white and bright yellow, and some feather tips have the red waxy appearance that give this species its English name. The three subspecies show only minor differences in appearance. Females are similar to males, although young birds are less well-marked and have few or no waxy wingtips. Although the Bohemian waxwing's range overlaps those of the cedar and Japanese waxwings, it is easily distinguished from them by size and plumage differences.|$|E
5|$|The female Bohemian <b>waxwing</b> is {{very similar}} to the male, but has a {{narrower}} yellow terminal band to the tail, a less defined lower edge to the black throat and slightly less distinctive wing markings. Juveniles are duller than adults, with whiter underparts, only a few red wing tips, no black on the throat and a smaller black face mask. Compared to the nominate subspecies, eastern B. g. centralasiae is paler, greyer and has little reddish-brown behind the bill. The American subspecies B. g. pallidiceps has more colouring on the cheeks and forehead than the nominate form and is otherwise generally duller in appearance.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 260 {{species of birds}} have been recorded, with raptors such as the bald eagle, golden eagle, {{peregrine}} falcon, osprey and several species of hawks residing year round. The harlequin duck is a colorful species of waterfowl found in the lakes and waterways. The great blue heron, tundra swan, Canada goose and American wigeon are species of waterfowl more commonly encountered in the park. Great horned owl, Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, pileated woodpecker and cedar <b>waxwing</b> reside in the dense forests along the mountainsides, and in the higher altitudes, the ptarmigan, timberline sparrow and rosy finch {{are the most likely}} to be seen. The Clark's nutcracker is less plentiful than in past years due to the {{decline in the number of}} whitebark pines.|$|E
5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar <b>waxwing,</b> American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese mitten crab, and New Zealand mud snail.|$|E
25|$|Nyssa sylvatica is an {{important}} food source for many migrating birds in the fall. Its early color change (foliar fruit flagging) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall fruits and berries. The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: American robin, Swainson's thrush, gray-cheeked thrush, hermit thrush, wood thrush, northern cardinal, northern mockingbird, blue jay, red-bellied woodpecker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, northern flicker, pileated woodpecker, eastern phoebe, brown thrasher, eastern bluebird, European starling, scarlet tanager, gray catbird, cedar <b>waxwing,</b> and American crow, all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree's range.|$|E
500|$|The Bohemian waxwing's call {{is a high}} trill sirrrr. It is less {{wavering}} and lower-pitched {{than that}} of the cedar <b>waxwing,</b> and longer and lower-pitched than the call of the Japanese <b>waxwing.</b> Other calls are just variants of the main vocalisation; a quieter version is used by chicks to call parents, and courtship calls, also given during nest construction, have a particularly large frequency range. Although not a call as such, when a flock takes off or lands, the wings make a distinctive rattling sound that can be heard [...] away.|$|E
500|$|The global {{population}} of the Bohemian <b>waxwing</b> has been estimated at more than threemillion birds, and the breeding range covers about 12.8millionkm2 (4.9millionmi2). Although this species' population, as of 2013, appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid nor large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and huge breeding area, this <b>waxwing</b> is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. [...] The woodlands used by this species are well {{to the north of}} major human populations, and the birds can use disturbed habitats, so there are no serious long-term threats to this species.|$|E
500|$|This <b>waxwing</b> is migratory {{with much}} of the {{breeding}} range abandoned as the birds move south for the winter. Migration starts in September in the north of the range, a month or so later farther south. Eurasian birds normally winter from eastern Britain through northern parts of western and central Europe, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and northern China to Japan. North American breeders have a more southeasterly trend, many birds wintering in southeast Canada, with smaller numbers in the north central and northeastern US states. Birds do not usually return to the same wintering sites in successive years. One bird wintering in the Ukraine was found [...] to the east in Siberia in the following year.|$|E
500|$|In some years, this <b>waxwing</b> irrupts {{south of}} its normal {{wintering}} areas, sometimes in huge numbers. The fruit {{on which the}} birds depend in winter varies in abundance from year to year, and in poor years, particularly those following a good crop the previous year, the flocks move farther south until they reach adequate supplies. They will stay until the food runs out and move on again. In {{what may be the}} largest ever irruption in Europe, in the winter of 2004–2005, {{more than half a million}} waxwings were recorded in Germany alone. This invasion followed an unusually warm, dry breeding season. In 1908, an American flock [...] wide was noted as taking two to three minutes to fly over.|$|E
500|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} mature conifers, often spruce although other conifers and broadleaf trees {{may also be}} present. More open, wet areas such as lakes and peat swamps with dead and drowned trees are used for feeding on insects. Lowlands, valleys and uplands are used in Eurasia, although mountains tend to be avoided. However, the North American subspecies nests in Canada at altitudes between [...] Outside the breeding season, the <b>waxwing</b> will occupy {{a wide range of}} habitats as long as suitable fruits such as rowan are available. It may be found by roads, in parks and gardens or along hedges or woodlands edges. It shows little fear of humans at this time. In winter, waxwings roost communally in dense trees or hedges, sometimes with American robins, fieldfares or other wintering species.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the area}} became urban, large mammals {{including}} bobcats, black bears, foxes, cougars, wolves, and elk thrived in the area. Common {{species in the}} 21stcentury include crow, robin, starling, song sparrow, Bewick's wren, house finch, cedar <b>waxwing,</b> violet-green swallow, belted kingfisher, great blue heron, mallard, wood duck, bushtit, black-capped chickadee, raccoon, opossum, nutria, and moles. Less developed areas support black-tailed deer, coyotes, deer mice, voles, bats, western flycatchers, black-headed grosbeaks, orange-crowned warblers, common mergansers, and woodpeckers. Other wildlife in the watershed include beaver, river otter, freshwater mussels, and bald eagles. Johnson Creek and its watershed are home to life forms that, under Oregon law, have been listed as [...] "sensitive" [...] species. These are naturally reproducing native animals that may become threatened or endangered throughout all or any significant part of their range in Oregon. Such animals known {{to live in the}} Johnson Creek watershed include long-toed, northwestern, and Columbia salamanders, red-legged frogs, painted turtles, great horned owls, toads, hawks, and coyotes. A plant found on Powell Butte, tall bugbane (Actaea elata), is also listed as a sensitive species.|$|E
500|$|The Bohemian <b>waxwing</b> was {{described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Lanius Garrulus. The waxwings were moved to their own genus, Bombycilla, by Vieillot in 1808. The genus name Bombycilla comes from the Greek bombux, [...] "silk" [...] and the Modern Latin cilla, [...] "tail"; this is a direct translation of the German Seidenschwanz, [...] "silk-tail", and refers to the silky-soft plumage of the bird. The species name garrulus is the Latin for talkative and was applied to this bird, as [...] "Garrulus Bohemicus", by Conrad Gessner in 1555; the term is {{a reference to a}} supposed likeness to the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) rather than to the waxwing's vocalisations. The English name [...] "waxwing" [...] refers to the bright red tips of the secondary feathers on its wings, which look like drops of sealing wax, while [...] "Bohemian" [...] follows Gessner's usage, and may refer to the Romani, alluding to the bird's wanderings, or to its presumed origin from Bohemia. [...] "Waxwing" [...] and [...] "Bohemian waxwing" [...] were first recorded in 1817, the former as a reference to Vieillot's separation of this bird from the [...] "chatterers".|$|E
500|$|The Bohemian <b>waxwing</b> is a starling-sized bird [...] {{in length}} with a [...] wingspan, {{and an average}} weight of [...] It is short-tailed, mainly brownish-grey, and has a {{conspicuous}} crest on its head. The male of the nominate subspecies has a black mask through the eye and a black throat. There is a white streak behind the bill and a white curve below the eye. The lower belly is a rich chestnut colour and there are cinnamon-coloured areas around the mask. The rump is grey and the tail ends in a bright yellow band with a broad black border above it. The wings are very distinctive; the flight feathers are black and the primaries have markings that produce a yellow stripe and white [...] "fishhooks" [...] on the closed wing. The adult's secondaries end in long red appendages with the sealing wax appearance that gives the bird its English name. The eyes are dark brown, the bill is mainly black, and the legs are dark grey or black. In flight, the waxwing's large flocks, long wings and short tail give some resemblance to the common starling, and its flight is similarly fast and direct. It clambers easily through bushes and trees but only shuffles on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|Gannets {{raise their}} bills high and {{repeatedly}} clatter them, the male puffin nibbles at the female's beak, the male <b>waxwing</b> puts his {{bill in the}} female's mouth and ravens hold each other's beaks in a prolonged [...] "kiss". Billing {{can also be used}} as a gesture of appeasement or subordination. Subordinate gray jay routinely bill more dominant birds, lowering their body and quivering their wings {{in the manner of a}} young bird food begging as they do so. A number of parasites, including rhinonyssids and Trichomonas gallinae are known to be transferred between birds during episodes of billing.|$|E

60|$|It was {{the very}} middle of the summer before Peter Rabbit again saw Dandy the <b>Waxwing.</b> Quite by chance he {{discovered}} Dandy sitting on the tiptop of an evergreen tree, as if on guard. He was on guard, for in that tree was his nest, though Peter didn't {{know it at the}} time. In fact, it was so late in the summer that most of Peter's friends were through nesting and he had quite lost interest in nests. Presently Dandy flew down to a lower branch and there he was joined by Mrs. <b>Waxwing.</b> Then Peter was treated to one of the prettiest sights he ever had seen. They rubbed their bills together as if kissing. They smoothed each other's feathers and altogether were a perfect picture of two little lovebirds.

60|$|There is {{one other}} case which at first sight looks like an exception, but which {{is far from being}} one in reality, and deserves to be mentioned. In the {{beautiful}} <b>Waxwing,</b> (Bombycilla garrula,) the sexes are very nearly alike, and the elegant red wax tips to the wing-feathers are nearly, and sometimes quite, as conspicuous in the female as in the male. Yet it builds an open nest, and a person looking at the bird would say it ought according to my theory to cover its nest. But it is, in reality, as completely protected by its colouration as the most plainly coloured bird that flies. It breeds only in very high latitudes, and the nest, placed in fir-trees, is formed chiefly of lichens. Now the delicate gray and ashy and purplish hues of the head and back, together with the yellow of the wings and tail, are tints that exactly harmonize with the colours of various species of lichens, while the brilliant red wax tips exactly represent the crimson fructification of the common lichen, Cladonia coccifera. When sitting on its nest, therefore, the female bird will exhibit no colours that are not common to the materials of which it is constructed; and the several tints are distributed in about the same proportions as they occur in nature. At a short distance the bird would be indistinguishable from the nest it is sitting on, or from a natural clump of lichens, and will thus be completely protected.|$|E
6000|$|There is one {{objection}} {{some may}} {{make to the}} scheme suggested here which must be noticed. It may be said that even if exotic species able to thrive in our country were introduced {{there would be no}} result; for these strangers to our groves would all eventually meet with the same fate as our rarer species and casual visitors--that is to say, they would be shot. There {{is no doubt that the}} amateur naturalist has been a curse to this country for the last half century, that it is owing to the [...] "cupidity of the cabinet" [...] as old Robert Mudie has it--that many of our finer species are exceedingly rare, while others are disappearing altogether. But it is surely not too soon to look for a change for the better in this direction. Half a century ago, when the few remaining great bustards in this country were being done to death, it was suddenly remembered by naturalists that in their eagerness to possess examples of the bird (in the skin) they had neglected to make themselves acquainted with its customs when alive. Its habits were hardly better known than those of the dodo and solitaire. The reflection came too late, in so far as the habits of the bird in this country are concerned; but unhappily the lesson was not then taken to heart, and other fine species have since gone the way of the great bustard. But now that we have so clearly seen the disastrous effects of this method of [...] "studying ornithology," [...] which is not in harmony with our humane civilization, it is to be hoped that a better method will be adopted--that [...] "finer way" [...] which Thoreau found and put aside his fowling-piece to practise. There can be no doubt that the desire for such an improvement is now becoming very general, that a kindlier feeling for animal, and especially bird life is growing up among us, and there are signs that it is even beginning to have some appreciable effect. The fashion of wearing birds is regarded by most men with pain and reprobation; and it is possible that before long it will be thought that there is not much difference between the action of the woman who buys tanagers and humming-birds to adorn her person, and that of the man who kills the bittern, hoopoe, <b>waxwing,</b> golden oriole, and Dartford-warbler to enrich his private collection.|$|E
