5|$|Unbeknownst to Rollins, Cadena {{wanted to}} switch to guitar, and the band {{was looking for a}} new vocalist. The band was {{impressed}} with Rollins' singing and stage demeanor, and the next day, after a semi-formal audition at Tu Casa Studio in New York City, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist. Despite some doubts, he accepted, in part because of MacKaye's encouragement. His high level of energy and intense personality suited the band's style, but Rollins' diverse tastes in music were a key factor in his being selected as singer; Black Flag's founder Greg Ginn was growing restless creatively and wanted a singer <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> move beyond simple, three-chord punk.|$|E
5|$|A {{legacy of}} the Manhattan Project was the network of {{national}} laboratories, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area to lobby for their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was now at MIT, heard about it, {{he set up a}} rival group at MIT and Harvard. Rabi had discussions with Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> go along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while the Manhattan Project still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to be phased out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups came together in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Rochester and Yale) came together, and on 31 January 1947 a contract was signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which had replaced the Manhattan Project, that established the Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Figard {{spent the}} summer of 1995 working {{at a hotel in}} Fordingbridge, Hampshire, where her cousin Jean-Marc was head waiter, using the {{opportunity}} to improve her English. She returned to the UK in December to spend another two weeks with Jean-Marc. After leaving on Monday, 18 December, she travelled with a family friend employed by a local haulage firm to the French coast, as arranged by her parents, and crossed the Channel the following day, arriving in Ashford, Kent. She intended to travel to Fordingbridge by train; her escort found another French lorry driver, Roger Bouvier, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take her to Chieveley Services near Newbury, Berkshire. When they arrived, Figard tried to phone Jean-Marc to ask him to pick her up, but misdialed. She was offered a lift to Salisbury by the driver of a white Mercedes lorry. Bouvier had reservations about the driver, but let her go with him nonetheless. Figard left the service station with the driver at around 4:30 pm. She never arrived at her destination, and was reported missing.|$|E

5|$|The {{collapse}} of South Vietnamese {{forces in the}} Central Highlands came about {{as a result of}} three major factors. Firstly, during much of the war, President Nguyen Van Thieu’s confidence in the ARVN’s intelligence could not be shaken. However, following the capitulation of Ban Me Thuot, Thieu lost all faith in his own military intelligence agencies, when it became evidently clear that the strength of North Vietnamese forces was far greater than what South Vietnamese intelligence agencies had gathered. Consequently, Thieu completely ignored his own military intelligence and the CIA, and made all military decisions by himself without consulting the Joint General Staff. Thus, when Major-General Pham Van Phu requested that Thieu send reinforcements to bolster the strength of South Vietnamese forces in the Central Highlands, Thieu gave him two options: either carry out the President’s orders, or be replaced by somebody <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> do so. General Phu chose to implement Thieu’s orders and evacuated his units from II Corps.|$|E
5|$|Wormull helped Stevenage {{to reach}} {{the final of the}} FA Trophy in 2002, which they lost 2–0 to {{full-time}} professional club Yeovil Town. While with the club he won his seventh international cap, and maintained his reputation as a good crosser of the ball <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> shoot; in his first two seasons with the club he contributed more shots than any of his teammates, and in his second and third seasons he made most assists. Stevenage began to move towards full-time status before the 2002–03 season. At the end of that season, Wormull submitted a transfer request, because he was struggling to balance work and football commitments. Manager Graham Westley rejected the request, but in April 2004 his contract was cancelled by mutual consent, citing the player's injury record and his difficulties adjusting to the demands of full-time football.|$|E
5|$|By 1873 {{agreement}} {{had been}} reached as to the right-of-way to Voss, but not onwards towards Oslo. On 13 January 1874 Bergen city council started issuing stock for the Voss Line, to begin with 400,000 Norwegian speciedaler (NOK 1.6 million) was issued. In the 1873 parliamentary election the railway supporter Peter Jebsen was elected, spending {{the next few years}} furiously defending the railway. Parliament chose to not issue new railway projects in the 1874 session, and instead make a complete plan for all railway construction in the country—to be proposed by a committee. When the report was launched on 20 March 1875, the Voss Line was not included since it could not show a higher profitability than 1%. During the 1875 session there was not a majority for the Voss Line, partially {{due to the lack of}} capital available for local investors. This was based on a claim from Johan Jørgen Schwartz, the chairman of the committee, that the investment costs were underestimated. This was countered by Nils Henrik Bruun, a constructor from Bergen, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> construct all tunnels on the railway for less than the budgeted sum. When Jebsen in addition was willing to act as personal guarantee for Bruun in case of his death, the majority in the parliament shifted. On 9 June 1875 parliament voted with 61 against 42 to build Vossebanen.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{brought forward}} bank statements {{that showed that}} Cisneros withdrew US$5,000 from a US$100,000 family safety deposit box on July 7, 1992 and March 3, 1993, the morning Fischer was killed. The defense stated {{that there was nothing}} illegal about visiting the safety deposit box or making the withdrawal. They stated that the US$5,000 was for a family trip to Mexico. The prosecution suggested that the money was to pay off the murderers, but they were unable to provide evidence linking the two actions. On May 11, the defense introduced two witnesses to rest their case after six days of prosecution arguments. Most of the testimonies from the prosecution that day were done by Garza, who stated that Martínez never mentioned Cisneros's name as the person of who she was working with to have Fischer killed. Garza stated that he consulted Martínez on his marriage, but that she would interrupt to ask him if he had found anyone <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> carry out her client's request and hurt Fischer. Garza claimed that he had at least four calls from phone booths in San Fernando and Matamoros, two Mexican cities. The defense stated that Garza told the FBI that he made collect calls, but Garza said they were mistaken. He said that making collect calls from Mexico was difficult, though he did not discard the possibility of having made one to Martínez. The prosecution did not enter evidence showing that Garza made calls from Mexico to the U.S., and one of the defense witness showed that Martínez's phone bill did not have any collect calls from Matamoros. The defense stated that Garza made the claim of the phone calls from Mexico to get a reduced sentence, while Garza responded that he was testifying to make sure everyone involved in the murder gets punished. The defense responded by showing the jury letters from Garza's jail stating {{that he was willing to}} cooperate with the FBI in the trial for a reduced sentence. Garza responded by saying that those letters were written by one of his English-literate inmates on his behalf. The other defense witness was a restaurateur who saw Cisneros a few hours after the murder and recalled seeing her behaving normally.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{unstable}} {{state of affairs}} in Massachusetts, Hillsborough instructed Governor Bernard {{to try to find}} evidence of treason in Boston.

Bernard could find no one <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> provide reliable evidence, however, and so there were no treason trials. The possibility that American colonists might be arrested and sent to England for trial produced alarm and outrage in the colonies.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Burns {{was hired}} to kill a jumper horse named Streetwise. This horse was owned by Donna Brown, the ex-wife of former U.S. Olympic rider Buddy Brown, {{who had once been}} a trainer at Paul Valliere's farm in Rhode Island. Because the animal had already {{suffered}} from colic and thus could not be insured against that disease, electrocution was ruled out as a method of murder. Donna Brown insisted that Burns break the animal's leg and make it look like an accident so that the horse would have to be put down by a vet. Burns decided to sub-contract the deed to a man named Harlow Arlie, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> cripple the horse with a crowbar.|$|E

For children who had lost both parents and all siblings, it could take months before a cousin or an uncle could be found <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take in the child.

The tram lines to Lian and Lade (which were not in the streets) were not removed. In 1989 there was another mayoral election for the city council, and Bylista chose not to support the present mayor Per Berge (Labour) and instead chose to support the Conservative candidate Marvin Wiseth, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> allow a private company to operate the trams.|$|E

Throughout her teenage years, she remained active in her church's musical activities, now heavily involved in the adult choir. She joined the Baptists' Young People's Union and the Camp Fire Girls which provided her with some limited musical opportunities. Eventually the directors of the People's Chorus and the pastor of her church, Reverend Wesley Parks, along with other leaders of the black community, raised the money she needed to get singing lessons with Mary Saunders Patterson and to attend South Philadelphia High School, from which she graduated in 1921.|$|E
