5|$|At 08:45 Rivoli, {{which had}} been {{struggling}} to reach the harbour of Trieste, lost her mizzenmast under fire from both Victorious and Weasel. Nearly at the same moment, two of her 36-pounder long guns exploded, killing or wounding 60 men, greatly disorganising and demoralising the others, and forcing Barré to transfer gunners from the upper gun deck to man his lower battery. Fifteen minutes later, with his ship unmanageable and battered, Commodore Barré surrendered. Rivoli had suffered over 400 killed and wounded from her crew of over 800, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> assembled {{for the first time}} a few days before and had never sailed their ship in open water. Losses aboard Victorious were also heavy, with one officer and 25 sailors and marines killed and six officers (including Captain Talbot) and 93 men wounded.|$|E
5|$|Over the winter, with Test {{vacancies}} beckoning, Davidson and Benaud became training {{partners and}} decided to bowl for three hours continuously {{on a daily basis}} through the winter off season. With Ray Lindwall dropped, Davidson and Benaud became Australia's leading paceman and spinner when the team for the 1957–58 tour of South Africa was announced. It was a heavy burden on Davidson, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> taken two Test wickets in an innings four times, and three wickets in a Test match on one occasion. The team was to be led by Ian Craig, who had played only six Tests, and at the age of just 22 years, he was the youngest ever Test captain from any country.|$|E
5|$|Set {{during a}} fictional version of Japan in the Meiji period, Saitō, {{known as the}} , is the former third squad captain of the Shinsengumi, a pro-shogunate force. During the Bakumatsu, {{he had a long}} time rivalry with Himura Kenshin, an assassin of the Imperialist cause. In the series, he is {{initially}} introduced as an antagonist who encounters and once again duels with Kenshin. It is later revealed that Saitō, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> been testing Kenshin's strength, is now a spy agent working for the Meiji Government. After the reveal, Saitō becomes one of the main protagonists of the series, forming an uneasy alliance with Kenshin.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese {{encouraged}} intermarriage {{with the}} local population, and strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church. In 1560, they started proselytising the local Koli, Kunbi, Kumbhar population in Mahim, Worli, and Bassein. These Christians were referred to by the British as Portuguese Christians, though they were Nestorian Christians <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> recently established ties with the Roman Catholic Church. During this time, Bombay's main trade was coconuts and coir. After Antonio Pessoa's death in 1571, a patent was issued which granted Mazagaon in perpetuity to the Sousa e Lima family. The St. Andrew Church at Bandra was built in 1575.|$|E
5|$|The Referendum Party {{decided not}} to contest any of the by-elections {{that took place in}} 1996 and 1997. For the 1997 general election, it hurried its {{selection}} of candidates, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> one interview—and no background checks or screening—before acceptance. The funding for each candidate's official campaign was supplied entirely by the party centre. Candidates were brought to a training day at a Manchester hotel in February 1997, where they were presented with several hours of speeches and given a handbook. Many felt that the event had been a public relations exercise rather than a concerted effort to train candidates.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies (10-3), led by redshirt {{freshman}} running back Ryan Williams and Junior Quarterback Tyrod Taylor, met in Atlanta with the Tennessee Volunteers (7-6) at the Georgia Dome {{to end their}} season right where it had begun against Alabama, who would win the National Championship a week later. Williams, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> moved to number 1 on the depth charts when Darren Evans was injured in the offseason, was looking for 109 yards rushing to pass Kevin Jones’ school-record of 1,647 set in 2003.|$|E

Siddiqui, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> had minor roles in Bollywood up to that time, was surprised {{that for the first time}} he would not have to portray a beggar. Saswata Chatterjee, another Bengali actor, was surprised as well when he was offered the role of the contract killer Bob Biswas.

5|$|The final {{was held}} in Feyenoord Stadium, Rotterdam, with an {{attendance}} of 39,776. Only nine minutes into the game, Villa lost their experienced goalkeeper Jimmy Rimmer to a shoulder injury. He was replaced by 23-year-old reserve goalkeeper Nigel Spink, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> played one match for the club in five years since joining from Chelmsford. Spink went on to make {{one of his best}} performances for the club against the highly experienced Bayern strikeforce, which included Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.

5|$|Two days later, on 2 September 2014, Watford {{confirmed}} {{the appointment of}} former Brighton & Hove Albion head coach Óscar García as the club's new manager and the successor to Sannino, beating off competition from fellow Championship side Leeds United for his services. García, however, resigned from his position as Watford manager on 29 September 2014 for health reasons, having been admitted to hospital with chest pains after the game against Charlton Athletic. Billy McKinlay, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> been appointed first team coach on 26 September 2014, was appointed as his immediate successor {{on the same day}} – his first position in management after spells as a coach with Fulham, and as assistant manager with Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Tătărescu later contrasted his {{diplomatic}} {{approach with}} {{the strategy of}} Barbu Știrbey (<b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> attempted {{an agreement with the}} Western Allies in Cairo, instead of opening relations with the Soviets). Initially meeting with the refusal of Iuliu Maniu and Dinu Brătianu (who decided to invest their trust in Știrbey), he was relatively successful after the Cairo initiative proved fruitless: the two traditional parties accepted collaboration with the bloc formed by the PCR, the Romanian Social Democratic Party, the Ploughmen's Front, and the Socialist Peasants' Party, leading to the formation of the short-lived and unstable National Democratic Bloc (BND) in June 1944. It overthrew Antonescu in August, by means of the successful King Michael Coup.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the report}} of Amr ibn Musa, relayed by al-Tabari, Asad gave command of his battle line to al-Qasim ibn Bukhayt al-Muraghi. The latter placed the Azdi and Tamimi tribal contingents, {{as well as the}} ruler of Juzjan and his {{personal}} guard (shakiriyya) and the contingents of the Syrian districts of Filastin (under Mus'ab ibn Amr al-Khuza'i) and Qinnasrin (under Maghra ibn Ahmar al-Numayri) on the right, while the left was held by the Rabi'ah tribe (under Yahya ibn Hudayn) and the contingent of the districts of Homs (under Ja'far ibn Hanzalah al-Bahrani) and Jordan (under Sulayman ibn Amr al-Muqri). Mansur al-Bajali commanded the vanguard as before, reinforced by the troops of the district of Damascus (under Hamlah ibn Nu'aym al-Kalbi) and the personal retinue of Asad. The khagan, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> 4,000 of his men with him, placed Ibn Surayj and his followers on the right, while the rest of his force consisted not only of his Turgesh but also of contingents from the princes of Transoxiana—al-Tabari implies they were there in person, but this is unlikely—including the rulers of Sughd, Shash (Tashkent), Usrushana, Khuttal, and the Jabghu of Tokharistan.|$|E
5|$|Although {{orders for}} the attack had been hurried and lacking in detail, and the {{strength}} of the defenders unknown, the assaulting force had prevailed, securing the ridge with only limited offensive support. During the fighting one of the B Company platoon commanders, Lieutenant Eric Larsen, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> the week before led the crossing at Kujin, was killed. One of the section commanders, Corporal Jeff Jones, immediately took command of the 5 Platoon assault, moving from section to section across the steep slope to direct their fire, even while under heavy Chinese mortar and machine-gun fire. He was awarded the US Silver Star for his actions. The successful assault opened the road south, enabling the Middlesex battalion, brigade headquarters and a number of supporting units to withdraw down the road through the Australians, followed by the Argylls. 3 RAR remained behind as a rearguard while the British battalions took up new positions, covering the Chongchon River crossing at Anju. Chinese mortars and machine-gun fire continued to fall on 3 RAR, and at 17:00 a round destroyed the A Company headquarters, killing two men and wounding four others, including Chitts who was evacuated by stretcher.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1986–87 season, Rush {{announced}} his intention to leave Liverpool for Italian team Juventus when the season was finished. Rush did not want to leave but the club decided to sell him, as they were short of money due to their expulsion from European competition. Midway through the season, Dalglish signed John Aldridge to replace Rush when he left. Prior to his departure, Rush scored 40 goals. Liverpool finished second in the league behind Everton, and were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round by Luton Town. The club did reach the 1987 Football League Cup Final, but they were beaten 2–1 by Arsenal. At the end of the season, Dalglish signed Peter Beardsley and John Barnes to improve their attack. Liverpool regained the league championship; they did not suffer defeat until their 29th match against Everton, one of two losses during the season. The club had the chance to complete the double, as they reached the final of the FA Cup against Wimbledon. Although favourites against a club <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> {{become a member of the}} Football League eleven years previously, they lost the match 1–0.|$|E
5|$|Brun soon {{sold the}} team on, {{this time to}} Swiss {{financier}} Joachim Luhti, who brought it back into Formula One for the 1989 season. The new Brabham BT58, powered by a Judd V8 engine (originally another of Jack Brabham's companies), was produced for the 1989 season. Italian driver Stefano Modena, who had driven for the team in the 1987 Australian Grand Prix in a one off drive for the team, drove alongside the more experienced Martin Brundle who was returning to Formula One after spending 1988 winning the World Sportscar Championship for Jaguar. Modena took the team's last podium: a third place at the Monaco Grand Prix (Brundle, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> just scraped through pre-qualifying by 0.021 seconds before qualifying a brilliant 4th, had been running third but was forced to stop to replace a flat battery, finally finishing sixth). The team also {{failed to make the}} grid sometimes: Brundle failed to prequalify at the Canadian Grand Prix and the French Grand Prix. The team finished 9th in the Constructors' Championship {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Columbus also traded {{former first}} round draft pick Nikita Filatov to the Ottawa Senators for a third-round {{pick in the}} 2011 Draft. Filatov had {{failed to live up}} to {{expectations}} in Columbus, playing in only 44 games over three seasons scoring six goals. Prior to the start of the season, the Blue Jackets were questioned for not signing a veteran back-up to starting goaltender Steve Mason, as the former Calder Memorial Trophy winner had struggled in consecutive seasons. The Blue Jackets signed Mark Dekanich as the back-up <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> 50 minutes of NHL experience prior to the start of the season. Columbus did sign a veteran Curtis Sanford to be their third string goaltender and to start for their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. Sanford had not played in the NHL since 2009. During training camp, Dekanich suffered a high ankle sprain that was expected to keep him out of the line-up for a month. Additionally, Sanford suffered a groin injury, leaving Allen York as the back-up. York had only played four professional games, all in the AHL, entering the season.|$|E

5|$|Olympus had {{a market}} {{capitalisation}} of ¥673billion on 13 October 2011, immediately before Woodford was sacked. By {{the end of}} the next day, the valuation had fallen to ¥422billion ($5.5billion). Analysts at Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Nomura Securities, concerned about corporate governance issues at the company as well as its balance sheet, all immediately downgraded their stock ratings. Goldman Sachs, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> upgraded its rating in a report dated 12 October, suspended its coverage after Woodford was removed from office. Nomura and JPMorgan announced on 20 October that their coverage of the company was halted. It was reported that Government of Singapore Investment Corp., the Singapore sovereign wealth fund {{which was one of the}} principal shareholders, immediately disposed of its 2percent stake on the first hint of scandal. The share price plunged several days running upon market fears that the shares would be delisted as the company could not meet its reporting mandatory deadline for its quarterly results; in the week to 18 November Nippon Life announced that its stake had been reduced by one-third, from 8.18 percent to 5.11 percent, because of the uncertainty; Mitsubishi reduced its stake from 10 percent to 7.6 percent.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1971 MACV was {{authorized}} to begin detailed planning {{for an attack}} against PAVN Base Areas 604 and 611. The task {{was given to the}} commander of XXIV Corps, Lieutenant General James W. Sutherland, Jr., <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> nine days to submit it to MACV for approval. The operation would consist of four phases. During the first phase U.S. forces inside South Vietnam would seize the border approaches and conduct diversionary operations. Next would come an ARVN armored/infantry attack along Route 9 toward the Laotian town of Tchepone, the perceived nexus of Base Area 604. This advance would be protected by a series of leap-frogging aerial infantry assaults to cover the northern and southern flanks of the main column. During the third phase, search and destroy operations within Base Area 604 would be carried out and finally, the South Vietnamese force would retire either back along Route 9 or through Base Area 611 and exit through the A Shau Valley. It was hoped that the force could remain in Laos until the rainy season was underway at the beginning of May.|$|E
5|$|Robert became Duke of Normandy on 6 August 1027, {{succeeding}} his {{elder brother}} Richard III, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> succeeded {{to the title}} the previous year. Robert and his brother had been at odds over the succession, and Richard's death was sudden. Robert was accused by some writers of killing his brother, a plausible but now unprovable charge. Conditions in Normandy were unsettled, as noble families despoiled the Church and Alan III of Brittany waged war against the duchy, possibly {{in an attempt to}} take control. By 1031 Robert had gathered considerable support from noblemen, many of whom would become prominent during William's life. They included Robert's uncle, Robert the archbishop of Rouen, who had originally opposed the duke, Osbern, a nephew of Gunnor the wife of Duke Richard I, and Count Gilbert of Brionne, a grandson of Richard I. After his accession, Robert continued Norman support for the English princes Edward and Alfred, who were still in exile in northern France.|$|E
