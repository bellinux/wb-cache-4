Michael Johnson, the 200 m and 400 m record holder, personally backed the sprinter, saying that he did not believe that a lack of experience would <b>work</b> <b>against</b> him. Bolt qualified for the 100 m final with times of 9.92 s and 9.85 s in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively.|$|E

Danny {{responds}} to witnessing schoolmates' teasing by kissing Ronnie {{back and then}} punching {{one of them in}} the face when he makes a teasing remark. Danny's reaction summons him to the principal's office; where Miss Pearson (Helene Hatch), his teacher, tells Principal Evans (Raymond Bailey) that Danny will not graduate because of his poor attitude. Mr. Evans is sympathetic, but powerless to help; so Danny decides {{to drop out of school}} to find <b>work,</b> <b>against</b> the wishes of his father, who tries to convince Danny to stay in school.|$|E
5|$|Charles X died in February 1660 and was {{succeeded by}} a regency council—led by {{the queen mother}} Hedvig Eleonora—that ruled {{in the name of}} Charles XI who was only four {{at the time of his}} father's death. Sweden had come close to almost {{complete}} control over trade in the Baltic, but the war revealed the need to <b>work</b> <b>against</b> the formation of anti-Swedish alliances that included Denmark, especially with France, the most powerful state in Europe at the time. There were some successes in foreign policy with the anti-French 1668 Triple Alliance of England, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic.|$|E
5|$|Homosexuals in Miami {{were not}} well-connected or {{experienced}} enough {{to combat the}} coalition led by Bryant, so they invited two political organizers to the city: Ethan Geto from New York City and Jim Foster from San Francisco, {{both of whom were}} gay. Foster and Geto faced battles not only with the Save Our Children campaign, but the disjointed and often closeted gay community in Miami. When organizations outside of Florida promoted boycotting Florida orange juice, Jack Campbell disagreed, worried that an economic backlash in the state would <b>work</b> <b>against</b> local gay men and lesbians. Ruth Shack saw the issue simply, as one of civil rights; Geto and Foster agreed. Bob Kunst soon broke away from the campaign to promote the orange juice boycott, and his views were often printed in the newspapers to Geto's alarm.|$|E

5|$|However, {{these results}} {{also noted that}} the system might be able to <b>work</b> <b>against</b> longer-ranged missiles. Although these {{traveled}} at very high speeds, their higher altitude trajectories made detection simpler, and the longer flight times provided more time to prepare. Both projects were allowed to continue as research efforts, and were transferred to the US Air Force when that force separated from the Army in 1947. The Air Force faced significant budget constraints and cancelled Thumper in 1949 in order to use its funds to continue their GAPA surface-to-air missile (SAM) efforts. The next year Wizard's funding was also rolled into GAPA to develop a new long-range SAM design, which would emerge a decade later as the CIM-10 Bomarc. ABM research at the Air Force practically, although not officially, ended.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} on December 4, 2004, Boustany defeated Mount, 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low voter turnout. Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates <b>work</b> <b>against</b> each other and led to Cravin's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout. The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout. Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W. Bush {{in the presidential election}} against John Kerry in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Society for Individual Rights (SIR) and the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) began to <b>work</b> <b>against</b> police {{persecution}} of gay bars and entrapment in San Francisco. Oral sex {{was still a}} felony, and in 1970, nearly 90people in the city were arrested for having sex in public parks at night. Mayor Alioto asked the police to target the parks, hoping the decision would appeal to the Archdiocese and his Catholic supporters. In 1971, 2,800gay men were arrested for public sex in San Francisco. By comparison, New York City recorded only 63 arrests for the same offense that year. Any arrest for a morals charge required registration as a sex offender.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} two weeks since Sheriff Graham's (Jamie Dornan) death, and the {{citizens}} of Storybrooke continue to mourn. Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) convinces Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) {{she ought to be}} sheriff, but Regina (Lana Parrilla) has already appointed Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito) for the job. Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) suspects Regina is responsible for Graham's death and starts to believe good cannot defeat evil because good plays by the rules. Gold offers Emma his support and reveals to her the town charter which states the Mayor can only choose a candidate for Sheriff and therefore an election must be held. Emma decides to run, so Regina declares Sidney Glass will as well. Henry becomes worried when he finds out Gold is Emma's benefactor, considering how dangerous it is to owe him one favor, let alone two. Regina is furious that Gold would <b>work</b> <b>against</b> her.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry firmly {{believed}} that throwaway clothes were {{the future of}} the industry, and this idea was incorporated into the costumes of The Motion Picture. William Ware Theiss, the designer who created the original television series costumes, was too busy to work on the film. Instead Robert Fletcher, considered one of American theater's most successful costume and scenic designers, was selected to design the new uniforms, suits, and robes for the production. Fletcher eschewed man-made synthetics for natural materials, finding that these fabrics sewed better and lasted longer. As times had changed, the Starfleet uniforms, with their bright reds, blues, greens, and golds, had to be revised: the miniskirts worn by females in the original series would now be considered sexist. Wise deemed the original multicolored uniforms too garish, and Fletcher {{believed that}} the brightness of these old designs would <b>work</b> <b>against</b> believability when seen on the wide screen—the designer's first task was to create new, less conspicuous uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{the late}} 19th century, {{uncontrolled}} crossbreeding created {{a decline in}} the population of purebred Mérens. By the early 20th century, some breeders in L'Hospitalet and Mérens-les-Vals began to <b>work</b> <b>against</b> these crossings with outside breeds and bred only horses with conformation similar to the original Mérens. These breeders wanted to keep alive the traditional Mérens, which they valued for its hardiness and versatility. In 1908, control of breeding was given to the President of the Société d’Agriculture de l’Ariège (Agricultural Society of Ariege), Gabriel Lamarque, who was dedicated to the preservation of the breed. In 1933, the Syndicat d'élevage du Mérens (Breeding Society of Mérens) was created, and in 1948 the first stud book was created {{under the control of the}} French National Stud.|$|E

5|$|The French {{reaction}} to this flurry of reforms was mixed, however. The very zeal of the program might betoken a renascent nationalism that could <b>work</b> <b>against</b> French interests. The debacle of the Battle of Trafalgar had {{made it clear that}} the projected invasion had to be scrapped. The Dutch now began to clamor for economies in the form of the return of the Boulogne flotilla, which annoyed Napoleon, because he still had a use for it. The man who had led that flotilla to Boulogne Carel Hendrik Ver Huell, was now Secretary for the Navy. He had also become a confidant of the emperor, and now engaged in a secret correspondence with Talleyrand and Napoleon. The latter had just concluded the Peace of Pressburg and was busy dividing up Europe in client-kingdoms apportioned to his relatives. He saw a good candidate for such a position in the Netherlands in his brother Louis Bonaparte.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a casting}} {{department}} at Elstree Studios which casts actors for Holby City {{as well as}} Casualty, EastEnders and Doctors. The programme also has two dedicated casting directors who bring in a shortlist of actors for the producer and director to audition.

Mealing appeared {{as the mother of}} a paediatric patient in the show's fourth series, Roberts appeared as the son of a medical professor in Holby City seventh series, and Dhillon appeared as anaesthetist Sunil Gupta in 2001. Roberts believes that his single scene in series seven was enough for him to be called in for the part of Joseph, while in contrast, Dhillon does not believe that his role contributed to his casting as Michael, but instead worried that it would <b>work</b> <b>against</b> him.|$|E
5|$|As Corporal Bill Taylor of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, {{the player}} starts off by playing {{a part in}} D-Day, at the assault of Pointe du Hoc, to destroy a German {{artillery}} battery, and hold it against a massive German counter-offensive in the following mission. Soon after, the player captures a nearby town {{and serves as a}} sniper against mortar crews until reinforcements arrive. The second objective is focused on Hill 400, involving the capture of Bergstein, a disastrous charge at Hill 400's bunkers and the defense against the German counterattack, with the player again performing sniper <b>work</b> <b>against</b> German mortar teams, destroying enemy armor, and generally holding the hill against the counter-offensive, all the while burdened by artillery and overwhelming numbers of German soldiers. The final mission is set amongst the Americans in the Rhine River crossing into Germany. It begins {{as one of the few}} missions with the player immediately under fire, providing cover fire against the Germans until reaching the river banks and then fighting through most of the town. The final fight has the player defeat two German Tiger I's.|$|E

5|$|New {{polls in}} January {{indicated}} voter support was growing for Toomey, who now held a projected nine percentage point lead over Specter and an eight-point lead over Sestak. Specter continued to lead against Sestak in the Democratic primary poll, {{this time by}} a 21-point margin. Some political scientists believed Toomey's gain over Specter {{could be attributed to}} voter distrust of establishment candidates and growing dissatisfaction with the health care proposal pending in Congress. However, some Democratic leaders felt Sestak's challenge to Specter was having a detrimental effect not only to Specter, but to the Democratic party in general and their prospects for ultimately winning the general election. This feeling was enhanced by the growing national support for the Republican party, and especially by the unexpected victory of the Tea Party-backed Republican Scott Brown in a special election for a traditionally Democratic Massachusetts Senate seat. Specter acknowledged to The New York Times that the national political mood might <b>work</b> <b>against</b> him in the primary, but insisted he was not discouraged and expressed confidence in his ability to survive.|$|E
5|$|The artist {{held her}} first solo show in Tunis in 2009, and {{subsequent}} solo shows in Berlin (2010), the Mosaic Rooms of Earl's Court (London, 2014), and the Dallas Contemporary (2015). Kaabi-Linke received the 2009 Alexandria Biennale's Jury Prize and the 2011 Abraaj Group Art Prize. The latter commissioned her 2011 Flying Carpets, which was {{shown at the}} 54th Venice Biennale and later purchased by and exhibited at the New York Guggenheim Museum in 2016. Kaabi-Linke held a residency at the London Delfina Foundation in 2012, where she was inspired after meeting survivors of domestic violence. She won the Discoveries Prize for emerging art at the 2014 Art Basel Hong Kong, where she exhibited with the Kolkatan Experimenter gallery. One of the judges juxtaposed the social content of her <b>work</b> <b>against</b> the political reservations of other exhibitions in the show. Earlier that year, she completed her Meinstein ("My Stone") project {{in the center of}} Neukölln, a borough of Berlin. Her pavement mosaic uses stones that correspond to the national origins of the borough's residents, which is a largely immigrant population. She described her practice, at that time, as an archaeology of contemporary life. As of 2016, Kaabi-Linke is represented by Lawrie Shabibi of Dubai and Experimenter of Kolkata.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the medieval}} common law, {{there was only}} one way to resolve a dispute seeking the {{repayment}} of money or other contract matters; a writ of debt, which only the Court of Common Pleas could hear. This was archaic, did not <b>work</b> <b>against</b> the executors of a will and involved precise pleading; a minor flaw in the documents put to the court could see the case thrown out. By the middle of the 16th century lawyers had attempted to devise an alternative using the action of assumpsit, which was technically a type of trespass due to deceit. The argument was based on the idea that there was an inherent promise in a contract to pay the money, and that by failing to pay the defendant had deceived the plaintiff. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded, with the Court of King's Bench agreeing to hear cases under this piece of legal fiction. The judges of the Common Pleas, however, a more traditional group, rejected this argument and only accepted cases where an actual promise had been made in addition to the contract.|$|E
