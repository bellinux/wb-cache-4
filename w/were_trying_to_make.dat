5|$|Carolyn Dinshaw {{argues that}} the poem {{may have been a}} {{response}} to accusations that Richard II had a male lover—an attempt to reestablish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. In his other poem Cleanness, he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into Gawain in his descriptions of the Green Knight.|$|E
5|$|As several squads {{left the}} hill on a patrol, North Koreans {{attacked}} the main company position behind it. The platoon dropped {{down off the}} ridge into a gully on the left. Some {{of the men in}} the advanced squad made their way back to US lines, but North Koreans captured most near the bottom of Ka-san on September 10 as they <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their way through the North Korean lines. About 30 minutes after D Company had reached Hill 755, an estimated North Korean battalion launched an attack down the slope running south to Hill 755 from the crest of Hill 902. The company to turned back this attack. That night, North Korean mortar and small arms fire harassed the company and there were several small probing North Korean attacks.|$|E
5|$|That night Jones and {{the eight}} men with him {{stayed in the}} ravine just under the crest. Without his radio he could not {{communicate}} {{with the rest of}} the company which he thought had been destroyed or driven off the hill. The next day when American fighter planes strafed the hilltop it confirmed his belief that no D Company men were there. Some of the men in the advanced squad made their way back to US lines, but North Koreans captured Jones and the eight men with him near the bottom of Ka-san on September 10 as they <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their way through the North Korean lines. This account of the 3rd Platoon explains why, except for the 3d Squad which rejoined D Company that evening, it was out of the action and off the crest almost as soon as it arrived on top, unknown to Kennedy and the rest of the company at the time.|$|E

25|$|In November 1988, Harbourside's lease was {{transferred}} to Luna Park Investments Pty Ltd. A year later, after no efforts {{had been made to}} repair and reopen Luna Park, and several submissions to replace most or all of the amusement park with high-rise apartment blocks and hotels, the New South Wales State Government issued an ultimatum to the company - open Luna Park by 1 June 1990, or lose the lease. Despite this ultimatum, Luna Park Investments did little to prepare the site. Rides were moved around, repainted, and renamed, to give the appearance that the new owners <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an effort. The directors kept putting forward excuses to try to gain an extension, even declaring a trade union ban on their own site. Four days after the government ultimatum passed, the lease was terminated and the Luna Park Reserve Trust was established. Soon after this, the National Heritage Trust added several buildings on the site to its list of protected structures.|$|E

500|$|Britten, like Elgar and Walton before him, {{was signed}} up {{by a major}} British {{recording}} company, and performed a considerable proportion of his output on disc. For the Decca Record Company he made some monaural records in the 1940s and 1950s, followed, with the enthusiastic support of the Decca producer John Culshaw, by numerous stereophonic versions of his works. Culshaw wrote, [...] "The happiest hours I have spent in any studio were with Ben, for the basic reason {{that it did not}} seem that we <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> records or video tapes; we were just trying to make music." ...|$|E

500|$|Rings Around the World was the Super Furry Animals' {{first album}} for Epic Records {{following}} the demise, in 1999, {{of their previous}} label Creation {{and the success of}} 2000's Mwng, which was issued on the band's own label, Placid Casual. Singer Gruff Rhys has stated that the band aimed to make a [...] "laid back and sort of wiped clean" [...] record with Rings.... In a 2008 interview with Uncut Rhys described the album as [...] "a very ambitious project" [...] stating that [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a blockbuster album {{that was going to be}} like The Eagles ... We <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> utopian pop music that had pretensions of being progressive and exciting." [...] Rings... was originally going to be called Text Messaging is Destroying the Pub Quiz as We Know It and released as a double album containing 75–90 minutes of material with Rhys stating that he was [...] "into the excess of it, that was the whole point". The group eventually decided against the idea but, drawn by the technical capabilities of the format and the desire to do something that had never been done before, produced a DVD version of Rings..., making it the first album to be simultaneously released on CD and DVD. The DVD features a surround sound mix alongside music videos and remixes and was made possible only by the financial backing of Epic.|$|E
500|$|In April 1933, {{during the}} Great Depression, International President Ida Jackson visited All Saints Industrial School in Lexington, Mississippi. She found {{difficult}} {{conditions in the}} Mississippi Delta. Some of the teachers {{did not have an}} education past the seventh grade. African Americans <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a living sharecropping on plantation land as agricultural prices continued to fall. In summer 1934, Ida Jackson initiated the Summer School for Rural Teachers to train future teachers. She worked with a total of 22 student teachers and 243 school children. In addition, she held night classes for 48 adults. By obtaining 2600 books for the school's library, Jackson made it [...] "the largest library owned by white or colored in all Holmes County." ...|$|E
500|$|Blaster Master {{was created}} by Yoshiaki Iwata (credited as Fanky.), who would also direct the reimagining [...] The game was made by a {{part-time}} development team of about five people, which included a main programmer, sub-programmer, lead designer, character designer, and sound programmer. Iwata did the game's opening sequence and designed the map, overall layout, and bosses; and he oversaw all phases of the game's development. In a 2010 interview, Iwata said: [...] "we <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the best action game to date, with all that entails. With SOPHIA (the game’s vehicle), we wanted to bring to life a sense of action that incorporated all 360° of the environment {{in a way that}} players hadn’t really experienced up to that point. Along with that, we wanted large, expansive maps so that we could support that vision." ...|$|E

500|$|Glenn Close, who was {{directed}} by Josh Weinstein, was convinced to do the episode partially because of James L. Brooks. Mona Simpson was designed in a way {{so that she would}} somewhat resemble Homer in her face, such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Mona Simpson's crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of, as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because she came back to help Mr. Burns. The character was named after Richard Appel's wife at the time, the novelist Mona Simpson. When Mona gets in the van, her voice is done by Pamela Hayden because Glenn Close could not say [...] "d'oh!" [...] properly and thus they used the original temp track recorded by Hayden.|$|E
500|$|Whiteread's agent Karsten Schubert said, [...] "The {{whole affair}} was a non-event. They {{achieved}} nothing {{and they were}} left looking like real prats." [...] Peter Chater, a director of Schubert's agency concurred; he called Drummond and Cauty [...] "cowards". [...] "It was obviously a publicity stunt. What sort of statement they <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> I don't know. If it was {{anything to do with}} the relationship between art and money it was pretty crass. The KLF made a fortune from a couple of successful singles. Artists aren't in that position. Threatening to set light to £40,000 is pretty obscene." [...] Former Factory Records boss Tony Wilson applauded the group, however. [...] "The K Foundation is a very peculiar avant garde group whose ideas are as valid anything the Turner people do," [...] he told NME. [...] "Since when has there been laws governing what constitutes art, or an artistic statement? OK, so a lot of people don't understand what Bill and Jimmy are trying to say, but how many people know exactly what Rachel Whiteread's trying to say with her art?" ...|$|E
500|$|Mona Penelope Simpson (née Olsen), {{voiced by}} Glenn Close, is Homer's {{deceased}} long-lost mother and Abe's estranged first wife. Her first major appearance was in [...] "Mother Simpson" [...] where she reveals {{that she was}} forced to abandon her family after being caught up in the hippie movement and participated in various acts of activism. The writers used this episode as an opportunity to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. Prior to the seventh season, Mona Simpson had only made two brief flashback appearances, the first being season two's [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] and the second being season six's [...] "Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy" [...] and in both episodes she was voiced by Maggie Roswell. Mona dies in the episode [...] "Mona Leaves-a", as Homer struggles {{to come to terms with}} her death. The character is named after writer Richard Appel's wife, whose maiden name is Mona Simpson. Mona was designed in a way so that she has little bit of Homer in her face, such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque. Glenn Close recorded original material for another episode, season fifteen's [...] "My Mother the Carjacker". Mona also has a speaking appearance in season ten's [...] "D'oh-in in the Wind", this time voiced by Tress MacNeille.|$|E

500|$|In 1947, Feller {{announced}} that he would pitch in the Cuban winter league during the off-season, but Commissioner Chandler ruled no major leaguer could play in Cuba. Feller said he would donate his profits from playing in the Cuban winter league to the American Major League players' pension fund: [...] "I want to prove I'm not going to Cuba for any selfish interest but because there is a principle involved and that is the right of any ball player to work at his chosen profession". Feller also believed it was [...] "grossly unfair" [...] that major leaguers who were U.S. citizens could not play in winter leagues but Latin Americans were permitted. Indians owner and president Bill Veeck said, [...] "I have no comment on Bob's outside activities. I don't know whether they've hurt him or not. But I do know this. The great majority of the people of Cleveland think they've hurt him." [...] Feller's barnstorming business savvy and endorsement details {{made him one of the}} wealthiest players of his time but he claimed his off-season exhibitions and barnstorming were necessary to pay for increased medical expenses for his family. His first wife developed anemia after giving birth to their second child when she was given the wrong type of blood during transfusions; she subsequently became addicted to the prescribed medication for her condition. Feller was trying to make up lost earnings as a result, since he missed out on over $200,000 in salary when he served in the Navy; he missed more than three major league seasons. Feller's biographer John Sickels suggested: [...] "They <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money, but part of it was also, he felt that the black players weren't necessarily getting a fair chance and that he wanted to sort of showcase it. And seeing those, I think, those exhibition games helped people realize that the Negro League players were just as good as the Major League players." ...|$|E
