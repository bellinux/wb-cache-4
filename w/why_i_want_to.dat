500|$|Obama's {{goal for}} his Inaugural speech was {{to stir the}} {{following}} response among Americans: [...] "This is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go into public service and be a better politician. This is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go home and be a better parent, better worker, better citizen." ...|$|E
500|$|When Anders and Tyrol {{detonate}} {{the bomb}} {{at the beginning}} of the episode, one of the Number Three (D'anna) models was to film a propaganda film in front of Laura Roslin's (Mary McDonnell) school at the time, but that was cut. Also, Jammer (Dominic Zamprogna) was originally considered the suicide bomber at the end, but was changed to Duck because he had less to live for after his wife's death. In the original drafts, the resistance was not planning suicide bombings, but [...] "freaking the Cylons out" [...] by imprisoning many of them in a secret underground prison, torture them for information, and leave them alive instead of killing them, as they would resurrect otherwise. This would make the Cylons worry about their missing comrades. However, Moore later realized that suicide bombings would be [...] "really potent and really powerful." [...] When writing the scenes involving Duck leading to the suicide bombing, Moore got [...] "emotionally caught up in it," [...] adding [...] "as I was writing these scenes of him standing in the police ranks, we know he's got the belt on. What's he gonna do? And then, oh my God, he actually does it. I mean, it's really horrifying stuff. But it's true. That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do it. It really happens. People do this." [...] The producers were initially worried that the Sci Fi Channel would not allow the inclusion of the bombing scene, but to Moore's surprise, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern did not object to it.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{during the}} 1980s, Rather gained further renown for his {{forceful}} and skeptical {{reporting on the}} Iran-Contra affair, which eventually led to an on-air confrontation with then Vice President George H. W. Bush: Bush referred to Rather's [...] "dead air incident" [...] saying, [...] "I {{want to talk about}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be President, why those 41 percent of the people are supporting me. And I don't think it's fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. How would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York?" [...] Rather ignored Bush's comment.|$|E

6000|$|... "Indigestion," [...] he said reflectively. [...] "We eat {{too much}} on board ship, and the dinner was very long and heavy. I told you so, that's why I'm taking--I mean <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> take exercise." ...|$|R
60|$|So I {{told them}} about my journey. They were puzzled. They did not quite {{understand}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> walk. But they were delighted {{with the idea of}} going to Lugano and Como and then to Milan.|$|R
2500|$|In January 2007, a {{resolution}} was approved in the House of Representatives opposing President George W. Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq. Bachmann voted [...] "No". However, before supporting the proposed surge, Bachmann {{called for a}} full hearing, saying, [...] "The American people deserve to hear and understand the merits of increasing U.S. troop presence in Iraq. Increased troop presence is justifiable if that measure would bring a swift conclusion to a difficult conflict." [...] She hesitated to give a firm endorsement, calling the hearings [...] "a good first step in explaining to the American people the course toward victory in Iraq". When pressed, {{she said she had}} not come to any conclusion on the matter, saying, [...] "I don't believe we have all of the information in front of us. As a member of Congress that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go to Iraq as quickly as I can. I want to get the best information in front of me." ...|$|E
60|$|And rather touched. That is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> give a cure with my refusal.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, my dear Mr. Wilkinson," [...] {{said the}} doctor, as if delighted at a coincidence; [...] "and Mr. Turnbull, too. <b>Why,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> speak to Mr. Turnbull." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{find out}} if you could do any magic," [...] said the little Kansas girl. [...] "I'm sure I can't; and I'm sure Button-Bright can't; and the only magic the shaggy man has is the Love Magnet, which won't help us much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Catharine," [...] he asked, {{a little}} reprovingly, [...] "was it {{necessary}} {{to have such a}} crowd here--at any rate until after Monday? You know that I don't interfere as a rule, but there were special reasons <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be as quiet as possible until after Maraton had left." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{has made}} the statement: [...] "I had two reasons <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> come to Germany: firstly, my {{interest}} in pursuing a career to use and reinforce the experience gained in my apprenticeship and secondly, to gain an insight into the 'typical' German attitudes - the inflexible sense of duty, discipline, diligence, and ambition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's exactly <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do {{something}} about Ogden. If he's allowed to go on as he is at present, he will grow up exactly like Jimmy Crocker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True?" [...] laughed Lane, grimly. [...] "Yes, it's true.... I won't last long, Pepper, {{according}} to Doctor Bronson. That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make hay while the sun shines." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I own {{the next}} ranch, that's <b>why.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> turn my cattle an' sech in the two. Besides that, it ain't natural {{for a man}} to stand by an' see others a-usin' of his things." ...|$|E
60|$|YANK--[With another wink.] Aw, dat's aw right, see. [Then made a bit resentful by the {{suspicious}} glances from all sides.] Aw, can it! Youse needn't put me trou de toid degree.

6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} don't {{understand}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{go to this}} particular party so much," [...] went on Aunt Beatrice shyly. [...] "I'll tell you why--if you won't laugh at me. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see John Reynolds--not to talk to him--oh, I dare say he wouldn't remember me--but just to see him. Long ago--fifteen years ago--we were engaged. And--and--I loved him so much then, Margaret." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have {{a chat with}} you, major," [...] Ezra said, having first opened the door {{suddenly}} and glanced out as a precaution against eavesdroppers. [...] "I have to be cautious, because what I have to say affects {{the interest of the}} firm. I wouldn't for the world have any one know about it except yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do I want?" [...] {{repeated}} the merchant, looking behind {{him to make}} sure that Booth had not followed him. [...] "What do I want? <b>Why,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> help you, Strong, that's what I want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I DO," [...] {{said the}} stranger, {{with his former}} composure, [...] "and I reckon that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know who wrote those verses called 'Underbrush,' signed 'White Violet,' in your last number. They're pow'ful pretty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never should, Mr. Holmes. But my wife does. It is {{frightening}} her to death. She says nothing, but I can see terror in her eyes. That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sift {{the matter to}} the bottom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, {{how can you}} {{say such}} a thing as that?" [...] she asked, liking him for his resentment of {{conditions}} that he found humiliating, while her heart leaped remorseful to her lips for having imposed them. [...] "You know very well <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> delay; and you know that--that--if--I had done anything to wound you, I never could forgive myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can do a}} {{good deal}} already, I am no trouble to any one, am I? I can go {{all over the house}} and park by myself, and find all my own goods without any one's help, and I'll do more in time, so as to be no bother to any one, and I do believe now they like to have me at home. Don't you remember, Marian," [...] and he lowered his voice confidentially, one reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go to Australia, and make a fortune?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Malinche; {{but that}} is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see you first alone. You {{remember}} that I told you all about the Spaniards, and how they owned the islands, and would some day surely come to Mexico; but that I belong to another white people, who are forbidden by the Spaniards, under pain of death, to come to these parts. They must not know that I am not of their nation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not in his}} outfit. My job's with Miss Sampson. She's fine, but the old man? Nit! He's {{been after}} me for weeks. I won't last long. That's one reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> start up for myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|He hesitated, {{obviously}} embarrassed but determined. [...] "There is one question," [...] he said, [...] "which I should {{very much}} like to ask you. It will sound impertinent. I don't mean it so. I can't explain exactly <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know, but I have a reason." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have tried}} {{all sorts of}} things, and that is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> by the great {{position}} of ruler of a country. I have been in turn reporter, editor, publisher, author, lawyer, burglar. I have worked my way up, and wish {{to continue to do}} so.|$|E
500|$|Millburn is a biologist. Spall {{auditioned for}} another role, but Scott <b>wanted</b> him <b>to</b> play Millburn. On his casting, Spall said [...] "Alien {{is one of}} the best films ever made, and it's a real buzz to be in a space suit on an Alien set with Ridley Scott coming and {{speaking}} to you.

5000|$|On New Year's Eve 2008, Watkins {{took part}} in a concert for Kidney Wales Foundation and stated that his reasons for being {{involved}} were {{as a result of his}} mother needing a kidney transplant: [...] "Having that direct experience is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get more involved with Kidney Wales and organise a fundraising concert on New Year's Eve."

40|$|Every epoch, {{as is well}} known, is {{a season}} for humanism, {{because there is no}} epoch which does not take up the theme of man and along with it also the {{problems}} that he lives. Not surprisingly, the literature on the subject is vast and there is no century that passed in the history of mankind without crossing this theme. This explains <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> give this reflection the title “footsteps of man, traces of thought”...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Before I {{tell you}} <b>why,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{know what you}} would do--in a certain case which I am unwilling even to suppose.

6000|$|... "I think {{better of}} MYSELF than that," [...] said Jeff, {{with a certain}} wild, half-hysterical laugh, [...] "and that is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go.

6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she answered, briskly. [...] "You {{must be a}} man of {{the world}} enough to know that.

60|$|Algernon. I'm afraid I'm not that. That is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> reform me. You {{might make}} that your mission, if you don't mind, cousin Cecily.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mouse dear," [...] she said, hesitatingly, [...] "the reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{have you}} come out here, <b>why</b> <b>I</b> couldn't sleep, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> tell you how ashamed I am for having been peevish, being petulant, last night.
