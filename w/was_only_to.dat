5|$|Prior to 1912, {{challenges}} {{could take}} place at any time, given the appropriate rink conditions, and it was common for teams to defend the Cup numerous times during the year.

5|$|Although the {{original}} plan had been to demolish the old fortifications of Rethymno and move the inhabitants into the Fortezza, it {{was too small to}} house the entire city. The walls along the landward approach to the city were left intact, and the Fortezza became a citadel housing the Venetian administration of the city. It <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> be used by the inhabitants of the city {{in the case of an}} Ottoman invasion. Over the years, a number of modifications were made to the fortress. Nonetheless, it was never truly secure as it lacked a ditch and outworks, and the ramparts were rather low.|$|E
5|$|During the {{challenge}} cup period, {{none of the}} leagues that played for the trophy had a formal playoff system to decide their respective champions; whichever team finished in first place after the regular season won the league title. A playoff would only be played if teams tied for first-place in their leagues {{at the end of}} the regular season. Challenge games were played until 1912 at any time during hockey season by challenges approved and/or ordered by the Stanley Cup trustees. In 1912, Cup trustees declared that it <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> be defended {{at the end of the}} champion team's regular season.|$|E

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{compete to}} become VP under Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) by seducing her after {{work at the}} hotel bar. For most of the night, Packer {{seems to be the}} most successful, so Dwight has Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) spike Packer's beer with his asthma inhaler, which causes Packer to vomit and leaves Dwight alone with Nellie. Dwight {{eventually}} succeeds in seducing Nellie as she asks for a key to his room. Dwight scratches off the magnetic strip on his hotel card before giving it to Nellie, stating the seduction <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> gain approval and that he does not intend to have sex with her.|$|E
5|$|MEF {{commander}} Major General Richard Zilmer {{responded to}} press queries about {{the statement that}} Anbar Province was lost. Zilmer said that he agreed with the assessment, but added that his mission <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> train Iraqi security forces. He added {{that if he were}} asked to achieve a wider objective he would need more forces, but that sending more Americans to Anbar would not pacify the province—that the only path to victory was for the Sunnis to accept the Government of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|On 8 September 2007, Chaser members Taylor and Andrew Hansen {{launched}} a competing fireworks display {{to coincide with}} the official APEC fireworks display, which <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> be viewed by the APEC officials.

The team lit up a large screen with the text Screw APEC. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode; and in the DVD commentary on the episode Morrow said the display was hard to orchestrate and not cheap.|$|E

5|$|The Assembly was {{strictly}} {{under the control}} of Parliament, and <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> debate topics which Parliament directed. Assembly members were not permitted to state their disagreements with majority opinions or share any information about the proceedings, except in writing to Parliament. Parliament chose William Twisse, an internationally respected theologian, to be the Assembly's prolocutor or chairman. Due to Twisse's ill health, Cornelius Burges, whom Parliament appointed as one of several assessors, served as prolocutor pro tempore for most of the Assembly. Twenty-two appointed members of the Assembly died before 1649, and they along with those who did not attend for other reasons were replaced by another nineteen members. Three non-voting scribes were also added in 1643.|$|E
5|$|The station {{building}} on Railton Road was opened in 1862 by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. Initial service <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> Victoria, but by 1869 services {{ran to the}} City of London, King's Cross, Kingston via Wimbledon, and Kent, including express trains to Dover Harbour for continental Europe. The arrival of the railways transformed Herne Hill from a wealthy suburb with large residential estates into a densely populated urban area.|$|E
5|$|Furious {{arrived back}} in the UK in April 1942 {{and spent the next}} three months working up. In August she was {{detailed}} to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in Operation Pedestal, but she <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> sail far enough with them to allow her 38 Supermarine Spitfires to reach Malta. This she did, just as Eagle was torpedoed, but Furious turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south-east of the Balearic Islands. After this mission Furious was sent back to Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before Operation Torch, and she arrived on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on the 29th before returning to Gibraltar to participate in Torch.|$|E

5|$|In March 1937, {{the then}} Director of Operations Group Captain Robert Saundby, {{complained that the}} role for Coastal Command in war, namely {{supporting}} the bomber offensive, and second, the support of naval forces along the British coastline, were too limited and {{was in danger of}} diverting the Command from its main concern: ASW. In October the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) Air Vice Marshal Richard Peirse confirmed that there was no formal role for the service or location of its units. Peirse did reverse the decision to have strategic bombing support as the primary function. This was changed to trade defence. Coastal Command <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> be used for other purposes if trade routes were suffering little interference and the intensity of air attack on Britain, or air attacks on enemy targets, required all available air units for those purposes. However, in December 1937, the Naval and Air Staffs met again and changed the priority to North Sea reconnaissance. The Naval Staff insisted that surface commerce raiders presented the greatest danger, and aircraft could prove decisive only in locating enemy warships. ASW remained in third place, after direct co-operation with surface fleets. In December 1938, this was changed again, and ASW moved up to second priority. In August 1939 it was moved to first priority. When Coastal Command went to war, its first task was to co-operate with the Navy to prevent enemy vessels from escaping into the North Sea and Atlantic Oceans. Secondly, it was to provide ASW support where and when it could. These steps are significant as the language indicates a change from passive reconnaissance of enemy warships and submarines to an active directive which involved the attack of the vessels by Coastal Command aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Of these three, the Kiama was a 104-ton paddle steamer {{that entered}} service {{with the company}} in 1855. Purpose-built in Glasgow in 1854, she took 144 days to arrive in Australia, and she served the South Coast until 1876 when she was sold and {{converted}} into a hulk. Prior to sale she had been lengthened from her original 123 feet to 154 feet, and her tonnage increased to 111 tons. The Nora Creina, on the other hand, was lighter at 93 tons, and was locally built in Sydney. She was sold by the company in 1861. The third of the original three vessels, Illawarra, had been constructed at Waterford in 1849 with a net weight of 166 tons, but, like the Nora Creina, she <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> remain with the new company until 1861 when she was sold.|$|E
5|$|The band {{met at the}} Londonderry Hotel on Park Lane, {{overlooking}} the park, where they had booked a tenth-floor suite, and proceeded to the park in the armoured personnel carrier, together with their two official photographers, Michael Cooper and Spanish Tony Sanchez. They alighted from the carrier into a caravan-trailer behind the stage. Jagger, his face heavily made up and with a studded leather collar around his neck, was clad in a white dress. He had borrowed the dress, which had been made for Sammy Davis Jr. at the Mr. Fish boutique, and wore it to Prince Rupert Lowenstein's white ball, where he had shown it to Princess Margaret. Jagger <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> wear it for half-an-hour at the Hyde Park concert, after which he tore it off to reveal a violet T-shirt and white loon pants.|$|E

5|$|The {{lateness}} of her casting forced Durance {{to start}} filming {{only three days}} after being hired, with no {{time to prepare for}} the role. Under the initial agreement, Durance <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> portray the character for a total of four episodes, but, after a discussion with Peter Roth over how they planned to use the character on the show—insisting that she and Clark would not be having a romantic relationship—the feature film division then cleared the character for more episodes. After the character was cleared for more episodes, the creative team decided to plant her in the Kent home so that she could provide a constant annoyance to Clark. To separate the physical appearance of Lana and Lois from each other, the producers had highlights added to Durance's hair, as she and Kristin Kreuk both shared a similar brunette coloring.|$|E
5|$|On 18 May Ursúa {{requested}} three missionaries {{to support}} the expedition from the Franciscan provincial superior, friar Antonio de Silva; by 30 May three friars were ready to join the Spanish force, accompanied by a lay brother {{who had not yet}} taken vows. In addition, Silva sent another group of Franciscans led by friar Andrés de Avendaño, who was accompanied by another friar and a lay brother. This second group <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> remain with García while convenient for them to do so, and were to continue onwards independently to Nojpetén to make contact with the Itzas, with the tacit approval of Ursúa. In fact Avendaño and his party left Mérida on 2 June, a week before the party assigned to García. On 23 June Ursúa received a message informing him of the occupation of Sakb'ajlan (Dolores del Lakandon) by Guatemalan troops. By this time García was at Tzuktok', near the Kejache border. Although Ursúa's purported plan, as authorised by the Spanish crown, was to build a road uniting Yucatán with Guatemala, he now realised that he was in a race to conquer the Itza kingdom; President Barrios of Guatemala had reached Sakb'ajlan and was returning to Santiago to prepare another expedition, and Guatemalan soldiers had already reached the lakeshore of Petén Itzá. Any linking road to Dolores del Lakandon would have passed through sparsely inhabited territory; instead the Yucatecan surveyor plotted a route due south directly to the lake where it could connect with the south road via Cahabón in Verapaz. This route would leave Dolores del Lakandon and the Lakandon Ch'ol isolated to the west. Ursúa issued new orders to García dissimulating his desire to conquer the Itza. His letter ordered García to link up with President Barrios at Dolores del Lakandon, and gave him a precise route that would take him instead to the lake. A short time after receiving these orders, García ordered the construction of a fort at Chuntuki, some 25 leagues (approximately 65miles or 105km) north of Lake Petén Itzá. This would serve as the main military base for the Camino Real ("Royal Road") project; the supply base was at Kawich, under the command of Juan del Castillo y Arrué. On 27 July Ursúa authorised the creation of three new militia companies of 25 men apiece to reinforce García. Two were Spanish companies and one was a mixed-race company consisting of mestizos and pardos.|$|E
