That 2 ̆ 7 s because the {{drainage}} canal superficiality clog due to garbage, the channel capacity is not large enough and the pump capacity is not sufficient. Johar is at a height that is almost equal to the sea surface which land subsidence periodically, so as to Johar area, water flows through a drainage pump with Kali Semarang as an elongated catch. The method we used to handle the flood of Pasar Johar is by calculating the flood discharge, isolate the area around the elevation of the road which serves as a dike, enlarge the channel that is not enough, enlarge the channel that is not enough and made sluice in preparation if the pump can not operated. From the calculation, some channels have increased flow capacity. Type of partner channels with bony concrete / precast planned to increase the capacity of Existing stream channel is the channel type C with a width of 1000 mm and 1000 mm high channels. There are 5 channel capacity should be increased. To remove the water from the drainage channel used pumps which located in the drainage pump house. Pump house planned 3 units main pump installed and 1 unit reserved. Maximum discharge for each pump is 0. 35 m 3 /second. Drainage channels connected to the house by using the channel pump. When only light rain occurred, simply lit one pump only. While in the event of heavy rain, so can lit two or three pumps. Thus the application of more efficient pump.

By contrast, potable water supply systems operate under pressure to distribute water up through buildings, and do not require a continuous downward slope in their piping.|$|R
40|$|Many DOE {{facilities}} have several miles of <b>waste</b> <b>pipe</b> {{systems that are}} internally contaminated with various and often undetermined radio nuclides. Unfortunately, currently acceptable alpha detection technologies are inefficient, time consuming, and do not address the problems presented by small diameter or curved pipes. In general, the problem of detecting alpha contamination on the inside surface of pipes {{is complicated by the}} fact that alphas do not penetrate the pipe walls. Unlike their conventional counterparts, alpha detectors based on ion transport technology sense alpha particles by collecting the ions created in ambient air as the particle loses its kinetic energy. The ions inside the pipe are transported by a fan-generated air current to an electrode inside the detector, which is attached to one end of the pipe. The collected charge at the electrode is proportional to the number of ions created inside the pipe, which in turn is proportional to the number of alphas emitted. Typically, monitoring for alpha contamination inside pipes or ductwork involves disrupting the operation to access as much surface area as possible for standard alpha monitoring. The detector based on ion transport technology effectively minimizes such disruption and in many circumstances will allow for in situ monitoring of a system that might otherwise not be practically accessible to standard methods...|$|E

We need to rethink production to make it cleaner and more sustainable by improving our accounting (Bainbridge, 2006). As the eminent British economist A. C.

If the market were complete, any attempt at separate environmental and social accounting would not be necessary, and Milton Friedman’s (1970) dictum, “A company’s only responsibility is to increase profits for stockholders ” might suffice. However, the flawed and incomplete market we have today, with enormous uncounted costs and incorrectly attributed costs, performs very poorly. It considers only a small fraction of the total transaction cost, leaving many “externalities ” out of the picture (Bainbridge 1983, 2004, 2006; Antheaume, 2004). If full costs were known many current market transactions would not occur, and we would face a much more hopeful, secure and sustainabl...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA major UK initiative, {{entitled}} ‘Mapping the Underworld’, {{is seeking}} to address the serious social, environmental and economic consequences arising from an inability to locate accurately and comprehensively the buried utility service infrastructure without resorting to extensive excavations. Mapping the Underworld aims to develop and prove the efficacy of a multi-sensor device for accurate remote buried utility service detection, location and, where possible, identification. One of the technologies to be incorporated in the device is low-frequency vibro-acoustics, and application of this technique for detecting buried infrastructure is currently being investigated. Here, the potential for making a number of simple point vibration measurements in order to detect shallow-buried objects, in particular plastic pipes, is explored. Point measurements can be made relatively quickly {{without the need for}} arrays of surface sensors, which can be expensive, time-consuming to deploy, and sometimes impractical in congested areas. At low frequencies, the ground behaves as a simple single-degree-of-freedom (mass–spring) system with a well-defined resonance, the frequency of which will depend on the density and elastic properties of the soil locally. This resonance will be altered by the presence of a buried object whose properties differ from the surrounding soil. It is this behavior which can be exploited in order to detect the presence of a buried object, provided it is buried at a sufficiently shallow depth. The theoretical background is described and preliminary measurements are made both on a dedicated buried pipe rig and on the ground over a domestic <b>waste</b> <b>pipe.</b> Preliminary findings suggest that, for shallow-buried pipes, a measurement of this kind could be a quick and useful adjunct to more conventional methods of buried pipe detection...|$|E
