5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low <b>working</b> <b>temperature</b> leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E
5|$|Cylinder working {{pressure}} is specified at a reference temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified maximum safe <b>working</b> <b>temperature,</b> often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified {{working pressure}} stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the reference temperature.|$|E

Also, the sulfur in the gypsum reacts with iron, making it unsuitable for casting ferrous materials.|$|E
25|$|While Newcomen engines brought {{practical}} benefits, {{they were}} inefficient {{in terms of}} the use of energy to power them. The system of alternately sending jets of steam, then cold water into the cylinder meant that the walls of the cylinder were alternately heated, then cooled with each stroke. Each charge of steam introduced would continue condensing until the cylinder approached <b>working</b> <b>temperature</b> once again. So at each stroke part of the potential of the steam was lost.|$|E

25|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. In the first practice session, {{which took place in}} dry and sunny weather conditions, Hamilton was fastest with a time of one minute and 26.187 seconds, six-tenths of a second faster than Button in second who held the fastest time until Hamilton's lap and Rosberg third. Alonso was fourth-fastest, ahead of Magnussen in fifth and Vettel sixth. Kimi Räikkönen, Pérez, Daniil Kvyat and Nico Hülkenberg rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. During the session, where several drivers noted the hard compound tyre took longer than ancipitated to reach their optium <b>working</b> <b>temperature,</b> and multiple drivers went off the track while acquainting themselves with their low-downforce set-ups, Ricciardo had trouble with his DRS and his session ended early when he entered the pit lane with a suspected energy recovery system problem and Magnussen struggled with rear-braking issues.|$|E

500|$|Although pure silica is a {{perfectly}} viable glass and glass fiber, it must be worked with at very high temperatures, which is a drawback unless its specific chemical properties are needed. It is usual to introduce impurities into the glass {{in the form of}} other materials to lower its <b>working</b> <b>temperature.</b> These materials also impart various other properties to the glass that may be beneficial in different applications. The first type of glass used for fiber was soda lime glass or A-glass ("A" [...] for the alkali it contains). It is not very resistant to alkali. A newer, alkali-free (<2%) type, E-glass, is an alumino-borosilicate glass. C-glass was developed to resist attack from chemicals, mostly acids that destroy E-glass. T-glass is a North American variant of C-glass. AR-glass is alkali-resistant glass. Most glass fibers have limited solubility in water but are very dependent on pH. Chloride ions will also attack and dissolve E-glass surfaces.|$|E

2500|$|The {{addition}} of lead oxide to glass raises its refractive index and lowers its <b>working</b> <b>temperature</b> and viscosity.

2500|$|In {{medieval and}} early modern Europe, lead glass {{was used as}} a base in {{coloured}} glasses, specifically in mosaic tesserae, enamels, stained-glass painting, and bijouterie, where it was used to imitate precious stones. Several textual sources describing lead glass survive. In the late 11th-early 12th century, Schedula Diversarum Artium (List of Sundry Crafts), the author known as [...] "Theophilus Presbyter" [...] describes its use as imitation gemstone, and the title of a lost chapter of the work mentions the use of lead in glass. The 12–13th century pseudonymus [...] "Heraclius" [...] details the manufacture of lead enamel and its use for window painting in his De Coloribus et artibus Romanorum (Of Hues and Crafts of the Romans). This refers to lead glass as [...] "Jewish glass", perhaps indicating its transmission to Europe. A manuscript preserved in the Biblioteca Marciana, Venice, describes the use of lead oxide in enamels and includes recipes for calcining lead to form the oxide. Lead glass was ideally suited for enamelling vessels and windows owing to its lower <b>working</b> <b>temperature</b> than the forest glass of the body.|$|E
2500|$|The {{addition}} of lead oxide to potash glass also reduces its viscosity, rendering it more fluid than ordinary soda glass above softening temperature (about [...] ), with a working point of [...] The viscosity of glass varies radically with temperature, {{but that of}} lead glass is roughly 100 times {{less than that of}} ordinary soda glasses across <b>working</b> <b>temperature</b> ranges (up to [...] ). From the glassmaker’s perspective, this results in two practical developments. First, lead glass may be worked at a lower temperature, leading to its use in enamelling, and second, clear vessels may be made free from trapped air bubbles with considerably less difficulty than with ordinary glasses, allowing the manufacture of perfectly clear, flawless objects. When tapped, lead crystal makes a ringing sound, unlike ordinary glasses. Consumers still rely on this property to distinguish it from cheaper glasses. Since the potassium ions are bound more tightly in a lead-silica matrix than in a soda-lime glass, the former when struck absorbs more energy. This causes the lead crystal to oscillate, thereby producing its characteristic sound. Lead also increases the solubility of tin, copper, and antimony, leading to its use in colored enamels and glazes. The low viscosity of lead glass melt is the reason for typically high lead oxide content in the glass solders.|$|E
40|$|Growing the {{oxide scale}} on the {{zirconium}} cladding of fuel elements in pressured-water reactors (PWR) {{is caused by}} the current of oxygen anions off the waterside to the metal through the layer of zirconia and by the strictly equal inverse electronic current.

It is shown that the electronic resistivity of zirconia is not limiting the zirconium oxidation at <b>working</b> <b>temperatures.</b> For gaining this limitation, a metal of lesser valence than zirconium has to be added to this oxide scale up to 15 %.
