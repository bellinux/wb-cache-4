5|$|Kriosian {{ambassador}} Briam (Tim O'Connor) {{comes on}} board the Enterprise with some cargo, ready for a peace ceremony with the Valtian. As the ship heads to the rendezvous, they save two Ferengi from a failing ship. Despite security being assigned, the Ferengi enter the cargo bay and deactivate the stasis field on Briam's cargo, revealing a young Kriosian woman named Kamala (Famke Janssen). With the Ferengi secured, it is revealed that she is an empathic metamorph who can sense what males around her desire and react appropriately. She was being brought as an arranged marriage to the Valtian representative. Kamala is generating pheromones that can affect males around her, which was <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> kept in stasis until the ceremony.|$|E

5|$|In another vision Scully lies on a {{table and}} is visited by her {{deceased}} father. Mulder, sitting with Melissa in the hospital cafeteria, is asked by a woman for change for the cigarette machine. When she says that a pack of Morleys is already there and leaves, Mulder opens it and finds the Cigarette Smoking Man's address inside. Mulder bursts into the Cigarette Smoking Man's home and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know why Scully was taken instead of him. The Cigarette Smoking Man claims he likes the both of them, which is <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> returned; he reveals that he told Skinner it was Mulder who shot {{the man in the}} parking lot, although he didn't believe this to be true, incidentally revealing himself as unaware of who did shoot the man, namely X. He tells Mulder that he'll never know the truth if he kills him, and Mulder decides not to.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on {{sleeping}} pills after she burned all her pictures of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in the oven on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits the mother who was convicted twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is a walk-in, a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, but she has no idea where they are. After hearing this, Mulder believes his mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins to think that the alien abduction never happened, and that his mother figured this out, which is <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E

5|$|Marsden reappears on Albert Square in 2009 when Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) is murdered. She {{arrives on}} the scene when several people say they suspect Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), but Marsden waits before {{questioning}} her, and questions the Mitchells first. She makes a televised appeal for witnesses and later interviews Phil, but he is provided an alibi by his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). A few days later, a red fingernail is found {{at the scene of}} the murder; Marsden visits the female locals, checking their hands. Seeing an upset Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), knowing that she is vulnerable and lives with Shirley, she talks to Heather about Christmas Day and Heather accidentally tells Marsden that Phil wasn't there. Marsden interviews Phil and later visits his home, asking to see the clothes he was wearing on Christmas Day. Shirley shows her a clean shirt; Marsden closes the laundrette, hoping anyone with blood-stained clothes will not be able to wash them. After a tip-off Marsden arrests Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); Sam accuses her mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), of the murder. Marsden confirms that she was there to talk to Peggy, questioning Peggy and Sam at the police station. Peggy is released without charge; however, Sam is detained for jumping bail.

She asks Janine <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> out in the cold on Christmas Day, and asks if Janine knows where Archie's laptop as it had gone missing.|$|E
5|$|Social worker Elena Rosas (Charise Castro Smith) {{is found}} shot {{dead in a}} motel. When Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) looks through her autopsy scan, she notices Elena had brain surgery and gets a shock when she realizes that Elena {{was one of her}} {{patients}} as she used to be a neurosurgeon, however she cannot remember her, just the procedure. Megan speaks with Elena's father Armando (Tony Plana), who remembers Megan from the surgery, and tells her that Elena saw Megan as a role model, due to Elena's mother early death. After speaking with Elena's boss Jeremy Nicholls (Edoardo Ballerini), he states that he cannot understand why Elena was in a motel, as she had no appointments near that location. Traces of breast milk are found on Elena's shirt, showing she was near a baby when she died, which leads them to Holly Bennett (Yaya DaCosta), one of Elena's clients. She reveals that her baby nearly got taken away due to her drug addicted boyfriend, and that whilst Elena was visiting her baby vomited on her, but left in a hurry before she could clean it up. Megan and Detective Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) visit Armando to ask if Elena was in a relationship; hence <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in a motel. They find out that it is Jeremy, but he says that Elena ended their relationship hours before she died.|$|E

25|$|The Bureau’s {{creation}} became controversial on Capitol Hill. In December 1920, a U.S. House appropriations subcommittee questioned Van Winkle and District Commissioner Charles W. Kutz. Subcommittee members Rep. George Tinkham (a Republican from Massachusetts) (and Rep. Thomas U. Sisson, a Democrat from Mississippi) objected that Congress had {{not specifically}} appropriated {{funds for a}} bureau of policewomen. Colonel Kutz responded that Congress had specifically appropriated funds for police officers, and “there {{is nothing in the}} law that requires that policemen shall be of the male sex.” During the hearing, Tinkham, an opponent of women’s suffrage, asked Van Winkle dozens of questions. When asked <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing this work, she replied, “because I have nothing else to do; it is my job in life.” Ultimately, the Subcommittee did not withhold the Bureau’s appropriation.|$|E

25|$|Chrissie Wellington {{has said}} she has two passions in life: sport and development. In her victory speech at the 2007 Hawaii Ironman, she {{referred}} to her experience teaching at Beaver Country Day School near Boston, where she first noticed the difference that sport can make to children's lives. She also noted, from her experience in Nepal, how sport can bring conflict-affected communities together. In an interview, her coach Brett Sutton said: She has kicked around for years through South East Asia, working for underprivileged people. That's <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in Nepal. Already this year she has done clinics in Thailand and the Philippines and now sponsors a young Filipino athlete to attend our group for the coach to work some magic. I think her win could be the catalyst for the sport in South East Asia.|$|E
25|$|Gagé and D'Albret remark an {{accentuation}} of the matronal {{aspect of}} Juno Regina that {{led her to}} be the most matronal of the Roman goddesses {{by the time of the}} end of the republic. This fact raises the question of understanding <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> able of attracting the devotion of the matronae. Gagé traces back the phenomenon to the nature of the cult rendered to the Juno Regina of the Aventine in which Camillus played a role in person. The original devotion of the matronae was directed to Fortuna. Camillus was devout to her and to Matuta, both matronal deities. When he brought Juno Regina from Veii the Roman women were already acquainted with many Junos, while the ancient rites of Fortuna were falling off. Camillus would have then made a political use of the cult of Juno Regina to subdue the social conflicts of his times by attributing to her the role of primordial mother.|$|E
25|$|Six {{weeks earlier}} in the Camelot dungeon, David, Hook, Merlin and Belle waste {{no time at all}} in {{defeating}} Arthur's guards, with Hook impressed by Merlin's ability to see the future. They then reach the cell where Lancelot and Merida are being held, with Merlin telling the others that it is enchanted. Belle then gives Merlin a book of spells and makes the bars disappear. Merida tells the rescuers that Arthur took the wisps which she needed to find her brothers, so Merlin suggests that they need to come up with another way to find them. When Belle asks Merida <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in the dungeon, Merida tells her that the wisps led her to the sea, but the boat she hid out in belonged to Arthur, and that when he found her he then threw her in the cell. Merida then knocks Belle out with a rock and hours later Bell awakes to find herself in a rowboat with Merida. Belle learns that Merida needs Belle's magic to find her brothers. She further explained that the clans kidnapped her brothers so they can force her to relinquish the throne as she is not married.|$|E
