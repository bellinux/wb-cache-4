5|$|Dishonored 2 is an action-adventure stealth {{game played}} from a first-person perspective. After playing as Empress Emily Kaldwin during the prologue, players {{may decide to}} play either as Emily or as Corvo Attano (the protagonist from the {{previous}} game). Side missions unlock alternate methods of assassination, non-lethal approaches and paths to navigate the main mission. Both characters wield swords, pistols, crossbows, a retractable blade, grenades and mines—all of which are upgradable. Upgrades may be purchased at black market shops found throughout the levels, and blueprints scattered across levels unlock new potential upgrades. Coin is required to buy these upgrades, which again may be found throughout a level or gained from other collectibles, like stealing paintings. Players can choose whether to play stealthily or not, and can finish the game without taking a life. Health elixirs and food consumables <b>will</b> <b>restore</b> health, while mana elixirs replenish mana.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} Gangers have regrouped, led by Ganger Cleaves. She realizes {{that she is}} {{suffering}} from the same terminal illness that the human Cleaves is suffering, and questions their need to kill their counterparts. The group is spurred on by Ganger Jennifer who insists the humans must die. As Ganger Cleaves orders her group to stay {{one step ahead of}} the humans, the Ganger Jennifer kills the real Jennifer, and then stages a fight with another Ganger Jennifer to fool Rory that she is the human version. Ganger Jennifer leads Rory to a console, claiming it <b>will</b> <b>restore</b> power when instead it disables the cooling system for the acid, making it dangerously unstable. She then convinces Rory to lead the human group into the acid storage chamber and traps them inside; crewman Jimmy is killed trying to stall the acid release.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII, Lightning reaches Anima {{along with}} Hope, Sazh Katzroy, and Oerba Dia Vanille, {{three of the}} {{surviving}} Purge exiles. When they find Serah, she turns to crystal. Lightning and the party fight Anima and are marked as l'Cie when PSICOM, Cocoon's main military force, destroys Anima. Skeptical of Snow's resolve to save her sister, Lightning abandons him and Serah, {{both of whom are}} then rescued by Oerba Yun Fang and a rogue Cocoon military force called the Cavalry. Lightning ends up traveling with Hope. During their time together, Lightning inadvertently summons Odin, and she unknowingly supports Hope's plan to assassinate Snow by protecting and training him. Throughout the game, Lightning struggles to deal with her nature as a l'Cie, her anger at being made Cocoon's enemy, and her guilt at disbelieving Serah's story. After overcoming these issues, she acknowledges Snow's relationship with Serah and his faith that they <b>will</b> <b>restore</b> her. When they kill the Sanctum fal'Cie Orphan to save Cocoon, Lightning, Serah and the party except for Vanille and Fang are allowed to return to their normal lives: Vanille and Fang form a crystal pillar to stop Cocoon from colliding with Gran Pulse.|$|E

5|$|The novel's protagonist is Lucius, {{a man who}} {{has been}} magically {{transformed}} into a donkey. In the eleventh and last book of the novel, Lucius, after falling asleep on the beach at Cenchreae in Greece, wakes to see the full moon. He prays to the moon, using the names of several moon goddesses known in the Greco-Roman world, asking her to restore him to human form. Isis appears in a vision before Lucius and declares herself the greatest of all goddesses. She tells him that a festival in her honor, the Navigium Isidis, is taking place nearby, and that the festival procession carries with it garlands of roses that <b>will</b> <b>restore</b> his human form if he eats them. After Lucius becomes human again, the high priest at the festival declares that he has been saved from his misfortunes by the goddess, and that he will now be free of the inquisitiveness and self-indulgence that drew him into many of his earlier misadventures. Lucius joins the local temple of Isis, becomes her devoted follower, and eventually undergoes initiation.|$|E

25|$|Similar scenes {{appear in}} many post-New Kingdom temples, {{but this time}} the events they depict involve the gods alone. In this period, most temples were {{dedicated}} to a mythical family of deities, usually a father, mother, and son. In these versions of the story, the birth is that of the son in each triad. Each of these child gods is the heir to the throne, who <b>will</b> <b>restore</b> stability to the country. This shift in focus from the human king to the gods who are associated with him reflects a decline in the status of the pharaoh in the late stages of Egyptian history.|$|E
25|$|The Book records {{a series}} of visions {{received}} by the 6th-century BC prophet Ezekiel, a priest of Solomon's Temple, who was among the captive during the Babylonian exile. The exile, he tells his fellow captives, is God's punishment on Israel for turning away, but God <b>will</b> <b>restore</b> his people to Jerusalem when they return to him. After this message of reassurance, chapters , the Gog oracle, tell how Gog of Magog and his hordes will threaten the restored Israel but will be destroyed, after which God will establish a new Temple and dwell with his people {{for a period of}} lasting peace (chapters 40–48). The Gog oracle, as internal evidence indicates, was composed substantially later than the chapters around it.|$|E

25|$|The {{last time}} Natural England {{surveyed}} {{the condition of}} Wanister Bog, it was losing water through a breach in the surrounding bund and, despite active management, the wetland was being invaded by Salix scrub and saplings. To remedy this, Durham County Council has gained approval for a 10-year programme which will involve fencing the bog and introducing highland cattle. It is hoped {{that a combination of}} grazing and trampling by the cattle <b>will</b> <b>restore</b> the bog to a favourable condition. Grazing is already being used successfully on the adjacent Daisy Hill LNR, but could not be introduced to Wanister Bog any earlier because Waldridge Fell is common land and approval to fence off part of the common could not be sought until other management options had been tried and shown to be ineffective.|$|E
25|$|The Puranas {{are clear}} on the Kshatriya lineage of Chandragupta Maurya. The Matsya Purana {{describes}} a King Moru, who <b>will</b> <b>restore</b> kshatriya rule in India and found the Morya (or Maurya) dynasty (which would be followed by the Shunga Empire). The Vishnu Purana also mentions King Moru, who would reestablish kshatriya rule in India by destroying the shudra Nanda. The Vayu Purana states that the Yuga Morya dynasty would restore the Suryavansha in India and be followed by the Shunga Empire. The medieval commentator Ratnagarbha, in his commentary on the Vishnu Purana, concludes that Chandragupta {{is the son of}} a Nanda emperor. However, the Vishnu Purana maintains that Chandragupta has link to the Nanda kings; a militant Brahmin (Chanakya) would protect dharma (religion), uprooting the Shudra Nanda {{with the help of a}} royal man(Chandragupta) with a claim to be emperor of India.|$|E
25|$|In cool climates (such as in {{the high}} Arctic or at high elevations), the depth of a scrape nest can be {{critical}} to both the survival of developing eggs and the fitness of the parent bird incubating them. The scrape must be deep enough that eggs are protected from the convective cooling caused by cold winds, but shallow enough that they and the parent bird are not too exposed to the cooling influences of ground temperatures, particularly where the permafrost layer rises to mere centimeters below the nest. Studies have shown that an egg within a scrape nest loses heat 9% more slowly than an egg placed on the ground beside the nest; in such a nest lined with natural vegetation, heat loss is reduced by an additional 25%. The insulating factor of nest lining is apparently so critical to egg survival that some species, including Kentish plovers, <b>will</b> <b>restore</b> experimentally altered levels of insulation to their pre-adjustment levels (adding or subtracting material as necessary) within 24 hours.|$|E

25|$|Its remit {{includes}} several large-scale projects {{which have been}} developed through the partnership.

The project <b>will</b> <b>restore</b> habitats and remove obstacles such as weirs which prevent animals from freely moving between sections of the river. The decrease in pollution is also hoped to increase beach quality {{in places such as}} Instow, which failed water quality tests in 2012, one of only sixteen beaches in the South West to fail. A Nature Improvement Area proposed to protect and enhance the catchment of the River Torridge—home of Tarka the Otter in Henry Williamson's book of the same name—was chosen by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) as one of twelve nationally important landscapes which will receive funding to restore and recreate ecosystems in the area. Other large projects work to use the natural environment to offset the negative impacts of human activities within the Biosphere.|$|E
