5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, {{the course of the war}} had gone <b>well</b> <b>for</b> Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had {{achieved}} spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria.|$|E

5|$|Demosthenes {{was born}} in 384 BC, {{during the last year}} of the 98thOlympiad or {{the first year of the}} 99thOlympiad. His father—also named Demosthenes—who belonged to the local tribe, Pandionis, and lived in the deme of Paeania in the Athenian countryside, was a wealthy sword-maker. Aeschines, Demosthenes' {{greatest}} political rival, maintained that his mother Kleoboule was a Scythian by blood—an allegation disputed by some modern scholars. Demosthenes was orphaned at the age of seven. Although his father provided <b>well</b> <b>for</b> him, his legal guardians, Aphobus, Demophon and Therippides, mishandled his inheritance.|$|E
5|$|For the 1909 season, MacLaren {{worked to}} improve his fitness prior to that summer's Test series against Australia. Jackson was first choice to lead the England team, {{but when he was}} unavailable, MacLaren was {{appointed}} captain, to the approval of critics and the public. MacLaren began the season <b>well</b> <b>for</b> Lancashire, and as Australia struggled in their early tour matches, England began the Tests as favourites to win. England won the low-scoring first match; the press praised MacLaren's deployment of fielders.|$|E

5|$|Hašek played {{increasingly}} <b>well</b> <b>for</b> the Senators {{up until}} the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. During the season, he reached 300 career wins, and his GAA and save percentage were the second-best in the league. Upon departure to Turin, Hašek's equipment was accidentally left behind in Ottawa. This caused Hašek to miss a number of practices with the Czech National team. At the Winter Olympics, he injured his right adductor muscle while making a save in the first qualifying match against Germany, forcing {{him to leave the}} game after only 9 minutes and 25 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Herodius– Featured in God of War comic #4, Herodius was {{a warrior}} {{from the village}} of Thera. Poseidon chose Herodius as his {{champion}} in Ares' wager. His village was stricken with a plague, cast by Poseidon so that Herodius would search for the Ambrosia. Herodius was killed by Kratos, which did not go <b>well</b> <b>for</b> Poseidon.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the revolt}} was also fuelled by a general feeling of discontent and humiliation at the {{failures}} of the Angeloi, especially in terms of foreign policy. This much is evident from the— albeit embellished— account of the eyewitness Nicholas Mesarites, whereby John Komnenos's supporters proclaimed that henceforth everything would go <b>well</b> <b>for</b> Romania, that her enemies would be vanquished, and that the kings of all the earth would come to pay homage to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|In some cases, these {{algorithms}} can {{be extended}} to other, non-perfect, classes of graphs as <b>well.</b> <b>For</b> instance, in a circle graph, the neighborhood of each vertex is a permutation graph, so a maximum clique in a circle graph can be found by applying the permutation graph algorithm to each neighborhood. Similarly, in a unit disk graph (with a known geometric representation), there is a polynomial time algorithm for maximum cliques based on applying the algorithm for complements of bipartite graphs to shared neighborhoods of pairs of vertices.|$|E
5|$|In the beginning, {{everything}} seemed to go <b>well</b> <b>for</b> the new Emperor, who even tried {{to set up a}} new dynasty by conferring the title of Augusta upon his wife Aelia Zenonis and creating his son Marcus, Caesar, and later Augustus; however, due to his mismanagement as emperor, Basiliscus quickly lost most of his supporters.|$|E
5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} work <b>well</b> <b>for</b> the deprotonation {{of all types}} of salts, providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium used to make the lithium amide. Titration of lithium amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation {{of all types of}} salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E

After regaining the rights to the album through a lawsuit, Uncle Tupelo released a remastered version in 2003 through Legacy Records, expanded to include six bonus tracks.|$|E
5|$|Other {{businessmen}} reaped great rewards in retail, shipping, entertainment, lodging, or transportation. Boardinghouses, food preparation, sewing, {{and laundry}} were highly profitable businesses often run by women (married, single, or widowed) who realized men would pay <b>well</b> <b>for</b> a service {{done by a}} woman. Brothels also brought in large profits, especially when combined with saloons and gaming houses.|$|E
5|$|Other {{possibilities}} exist, as <b>well.</b> <b>For</b> example, immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody {{to one or}} more proteins {{of interest}} that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, and is more amenable to large-scale studies.|$|E
