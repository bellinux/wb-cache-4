Glass-Polyesters exhibited variations in fracture intensity, with characteristic shaving brush failure modes. The glass-epoxy composites while not exhibiting any total failure, showed local delamination below and around the notch-root region. Carbon-epoxy specimens showed typical brittle fracture indicating clear transverse fibre breakage, leading to specimen separation into two halves. Fibre pull out noted in exposed and uncoated specimens after impact, {{appears to be a}} favoured failure mode in these composites. The Izod impact strength of coated glass-polyesters degraded in the order Araldite PZ- 985 E coated, Epoxy-Polyamide coated (EPPA) and Polyurethane coated (PU) for immersion at 298 degree K, while the order changed to PU-coated, PZ- 985 E coated and EPPA-coated for immersion at 333 degree K...|$|E

The particles diffuse through the material to form Pt particle surfaces, which may serve as catalyst support layers.

Such gold or platinum nanoparticles can be smaller than 1 nm even <b>without</b> employing <b>surface</b> <b>coatings.</b> Au nanoparticles in different CDCs (TiC-CDC, Mo2C-CDC, B4C-CDC) have been successfully used as catalyst for carbon monoxide oxidation without {{the presence of a}} traditional oxide support.|$|R
40|$|While {{microarray}} {{technology has}} provided a versatile and high-throughput analytical tool for many research purposes, poor cross-platform assay dataset correlation has prevented the technology from finding common usage for real-world applications due to difficulties regarding the ability to validate results obtained on different platforms. Although large-scale investigations in the literature have demonstrated that cross-platform dataset correlation can be increased through the implementation of standardized interlaboratory probes, assay methodology, and analysis techniques, the degree of cross-platform concordance achievable remains significantly limited due to inherent differences in the platforms themselves. Much of the inherent cross-platform differences limiting the extent of cross-platform dataset comparability lies with dissimilar surface properties between platforms, resulting in differential probe and target behaviors. To overcome these limitations regarding cross-platform dataset comparability, the {{development and use of}} multifunctional substrate-independent <b>surface</b> <b>coatings</b> was explored as a method to eliminate the initial differences in cross-platform surface properties and their effects on microarray performance. Specically, two types of substrate-independent <b>surface</b> <b>coatings</b> were examined: an electrostatically self-assembled polyelectrolyte multilayer and a self-polymerized polydopamine film. The results of this investigation determined that both multifunctional substrate-independent <b>surface</b> <b>coatings</b> were capable of depositing onto a broad range of materials and converting their surface properties into the properties of the coating itself. Additionally, when using these <b>surface</b> <b>coatings</b> as a common cross-platform interface, it was possible to obtain highly concordant microarray datasets between platforms constructed from glass, mica, silicon, and polymer. In particular, multianalyte DNA and protein dose-response assays performed on platforms with substrate-independent <b>surface</b> <b>coatings</b> yielded significantly higher correlation coefficients in comparison to platforms <b>without</b> substrate-independent <b>surface</b> <b>coatings.</b> Furthermore, it was shown how the surface properties of the multifunctional substrate-independent <b>surface</b> <b>coatings</b> can be manipulated through chemical modication in order to tailor and optimize microarray performance to suit specific applications. Utilization of substrate-independent <b>surface</b> <b>coatings</b> in such a manner can provide researchers and manufacturers with a simple, yet effective, method to standardize microarray fabrication across different platforms while still enabling sustainable development of the technology in terms of platform material, design, and application...|$|R

40|$|Depth {{profiling}} studies (laser ICP-MS) of ions (Cl-, Na+, Mg 2 +) in concrete-based {{material can}} be used to provide useful information on the migration paths of these ionic species. In particular, deterioration of concrete through infiltration of chloride could lead to costly corrosion problems with serious impact on the environment. Many modeling studies on concrete matrices depend on the tortuosity of these transport paths. Our work showed that dispersion paths of ionic species in concrete are intermittent and sporadic, suggesting that applications of simplifying assumptions in treatment of such data could lead to appreciable perturbations in related mathematical models. This paper examines the capability of using a high resolution ICP-MS laser ablation technique to track Cl– migration in concrete samples in the presence of other ions such as Na+ and Mg 2 +. Cationic migration in such materials is underexplored and data in this particular area could contribute to modeling studies. Concrete bricks (with and <b>without</b> <b>surface</b> <b>coatings)</b> were specially prepared in cubic configurations and allowed to saturate in a ponding medium (sea water). The study subsequently examined the distribution of Cl–, Na+ and Mg 2 + with depth in protected (epoxy coated) and unprotected cored concrete slivers (5 mm diameter; 2 mm thick) using an 80 µm- diameter laser beam coupled to an ICP-MS instrument. The laser (213 nm) was programmed to ablate a total depth of 50 µm at each point at 5 -µm intervals. The results in unprotected samples indicated that chloride intensity showed a general decline with depth, suggesting that mobility of the chloride is a function of its interaction with the concrete matrix. In some cases ‘hotspots’ were observed at certain points indicating that transport of the intruding ion was limited. No significant mobility was observed in coated samples. The depth-profiling results for Na+ and Mg 2 + were somewhat unexpected. Strong similarities in their spectra purported that the matrix was indifferent to charge and size of the ion. Our experimental data further showed that the matrix itself offers natural protection to the reinforced steel rebars by limiting chloride and metal diffusion at certain locations. Clearly, if the composition of these protective environments within the concrete could be simulated on a larger scale and introduced into the matrix it would offer scope for extended research in this area. Our work would be of definite interest to materials and environmental research; and mechanistic studies on aggregates...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effect of surface {{coatings}} on the fatigue behaviour of two engineering alloys; the AISI P 20 steel and the Al 7075 -T 6, which are most commonly used to manufacture plastic injection molds, and in aerospace structures respectively. These alloys are studied for their fatigue life behaviour with and <b>without</b> <b>surface</b> <b>coatings</b> {{in the presence of}} machined notches, fastener holes, or clamped region which induces fretting wear. The selected surface coatings are; (1) physical vapour deposition (PVD) coatings which are most commonly used in tool applications for the AISI P 20 steel, and (2) electroless Ni-P (EN) coatings as the coating provides a uniform deposition at low process temperatures, which is beneficial for the studied aluminium alloy. First, an investigation was conducted on the fatigue performance of both studied alloys in the presence of stress raisers (notch, fretting, and a combination of notch and fretting). Fatigue tests for both alloys revealed a more dominant effect from notches compared to the fretting wear conditions. However, fractographic analyses confirmed the presence of cracks initiating from the fretting damaged surface of the combined notch and fretting fatigue Al 7075 -T 6 test specimens. Significant fretting wear marks were also observed for the combined notch and fretting fatigue AISI P 20 tool steel specimens. In the second part of this study, the fatigue behaviour of TiAlN and TiAlN/CrN PVD coatings deposited on a v-notched AISI P 20 steel was investigated. The major findings are as follows: • Unlike the un-notched (smooth) coated specimens, which are known to exhibit great improvements in fatigue life at high cycle fatigue, considerable reductions in fatigue life of the coated notched specimens were observed. This was understood to be due to the coating's brittleness at the notch tip, which induces fatigue crack initiations. • The effectiveness of the PVD coatings in resisting fretting fatigue failure of the AISI P 20 tool steel was also investigated. A significant increase in fretting fatigue life of both PVD coatings was observed. Both PVD coatings showed a beneficial compressive residual stress and substantial increases in its resistance to plastic deformation (H 3 /E 2) as well as surface hardness compared to the uncoated AISI P 20 tool steel. Finally, the fatigue behaviour of EN coated Al 7075 -T 6 fastener holes with symmetrical through slits was studied. Uncoated open-hole, EN coated open-hole, uncoated bolted hole and EN coated bolted hole specimens were fatigue tested. The major findings are as follows: • The S-N curves that were produced, showed improvements in the fatigue life due to the combined beneficial properties introduced by depositing the EN coating and bolt clamping. • The fretting fatigue life of the EN coated Al 7075 -T 6 specimens tested at high cycle fatigue was significantly improved. The harder EN coated surface was found to reduce the contact stress due to the clamping pressure and thus assisted in improving the fretting fatigue life. The EN coated surface was also found to decrease the friction coefficient which assisted in mitigating surface wear damage, thus reducing the probability for fretting cracks to initiate...|$|E
40|$|High-temperature (> 600 degrees C) {{reactive}} vaporization of Cr from chromia and {{stainless steels}} in oxidizing environments is an industrially relevant phenomenon {{that has been}} {{and will continue to}} be studied extensively for decades. Recently, many experimental techniques have been developed to measure Cr vaporization from stainless steel interconnect (IC) components within solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems. Many of these techniques are based on an experimental method known as the transpiration method, which is used to generate Cr vapors and subsequently collect them for quantitative analysis. However, vapor collection and analysis methods differ significantly between investigators within the community, as does the array of alloys (with and <b>without</b> protective <b>surface</b> <b>coatings),</b> temperatures, flow rates, and water vapor pressures used in experimentation.

40|$|We {{report a}} novel, {{practical}} technique for the concerted, simultaneous determination {{of both the}} adhesion force of a small structure or structural unit (e. g., an individual filament, hair, micromechanical component or microsensor) to a liquid and its elastic properties. The method involves the creation and development of a liquid meniscus upon touching a liquid surface with the structure, and the subsequent disruption of this liquid meniscus upon removal. The evaluation of the meniscus shape immediately before snap-off of the meniscus allows the quantitative determination of the liquid adhesion force. Concurrently, by measuring and evaluating the deformation of the structure under investigation, its elastic properties can be determined. The sensitivity of the method is remarkably high, practically limited by {{the resolution of the}} camera capturing the process. Adhesion forces down to 10 µN and spring constants up to 2 N/m were measured. Three exemplary applications of this method are demonstrated: (1) determination of the water adhesion force and the elasticity of individual hairs (trichomes) of the floating fern Salvinia molesta. (2) The investigation of human head hairs both with and <b>without</b> functional <b>surface</b> <b>coatings</b> (a topic of high relevance in the field of hair cosmetics) was performed. The method also resulted in the measurement of an elastic modulus (Young’s modulus) for individual hairs of 3. 0 × 10 5 N/cm 2, which is within the typical range known for human hair.
