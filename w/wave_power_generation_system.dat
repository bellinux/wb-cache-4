30|$|In this paper, a {{bidirectional}} driven float-type <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>system</b> with a SRG is proposed. Two ratchet {{wheels are}} equipped, and the driving pulley 6 can rotate the SRG rotor in one direction. With this design, the modified WEC can always convert wave energy to mechanical energy, whether the float rises or falls. Then the captured energy {{is transformed into}} electrical energy. From the mechanical perspective this improves the generating efficiency. Also, the float can be controlled {{to keep pace with}} the wave when a suitable current reference value is set according to the wave conditions. This achieves maximum power point tracking and the generating efficiency is further improved. A simulation model is developed to verify the electrical energy generation ability of this WEC design and to demonstrate the feasibility of applying SRG in a <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{dynamic model}} for a {{bidirectional}} driven float-type <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>system</b> design is presented in this paper. The gravity, buoyancy and drag force acting on the wave energy converter (WEC) are all analyzed. The analytical expression of the torque applied on the rotor is given based on a linear model of the switched reluctance generator (SRG). The SRG usually rotates with low velocity in the WEC system. In this situation, current chopping control (CCC) is adopted with fixed turn-on angle and turn-off angle control mode to have a quick response for SRG. Further, {{in order to make}} the float keep in phase with the wave so as to improve the power generation efficiency, the reference current is dynamically adjusted according to the wave motion at all working stages. Then maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of system is achieved. A simulation model is developed in MATLAB for the bidirectional driven float-type <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>system</b> with real wave statistical characteristics taken into account. Simulation results show that the WEC can output desired torque periodically with high efficiency and good adaptability. Therefore, the feasibility of applying a SRG in a WEC is also verified.|$|E

30|$|Ocean {{wave energy}} has huge potential, {{and it is}} more stable and {{predictable}} than wind and solar power [5]. Ocean energy is stored in the ocean in various forms, such as tides, temperature gradient, waves and ocean currents, etc. From the 1970 s, many wave energy converters (WECs) have been invented [6]. With wave energy converters, the wave energy can be extracted into different forms of energy to be stored or used [7]. However, {{only a small amount}} of WEC equipment went through rigorous testing on the open sea [8]. Among these converters, Duck, French Flexible Bag, Clam, Archimedes Wave Swing (AWS), and Oscillating Water Column (OWC) technologies are more popular than other wave energy conversion technologies. At the same time, different control strategies have been implemented for the corresponding WECs [5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. At present, the OWC system is possibly considered to be the most reliable type of WEC because of its good structural strength [15]. However, it still has not been widely utilized for wave energy conversion due to its low efficiency and other economic reasons. In 2003, Hadano proposed a float-type <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>system</b> for off-shore use with many advantages, such as high efficiency, easy maintenance, and good mobility and adaptability [4]. The structure of this WEC is smart, in which the float moving in the vertical direction is used to capture the wave energy. The captured energy is then transmitted to the generator with rotational motion. It is noted that the proposed float-type <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>system</b> can extract energy only when the sea wave is rising, or when it is falling, which gives low efficiency. Therefore, it deserves more attention and further development [16].|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes the <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>system</b> of new OWC (Oscillating Water Column) type. The {{weaknesses}} of the previous OWC system are the high-cost structure due to a massive air chamber required to withstand the high pressure, and low efficiency of the special turbine which converts bidirectional airflow into unidirectional rotation of the shaft. In this paper, the new system consisting of a unidirectional turbine and a ratchet mechanism is devised. When the water level is rising the turbine does not work i. e. it rotates freely, which has an advantage that high pressure does not occur inside an air chamber; when the water level is descending the turbine works to generate electric power. Therefore, the air chamber can be lighter and of lower cost {{than that of the}} previous system and the efficiency of the turbine is definitely higher than the bidirectional turbine used in the previous OWC system. Consequently, the proposed system has much higher cost performance than the previous OWC system...|$|E

40|$|Ocean {{wave power}} can be a {{significant}} source of large&# 8208;scale, renewable energy for the US electrical grid. The Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) conservatively estimated that 20 % of all US electricity could be generated by wave energy. Ocean Power Technologies, Inc. (OPT), with funding from private sources and the US Navy, developed the PowerBuoy� to generate renewable energy from the readily available power in ocean waves. OPT's PowerBuoy converts the energy in ocean waves to electricity using {{the rise and fall of}} waves to move the buoy up and down (mechanical stroking) which drives an electric generator. This electricity is then conditioned and transmitted ashore as high&# 8208;voltage power via underwater cable. OPT's <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>system</b> includes sophisticated techniques to automatically tune the system for efficient conversion of random wave energy into low cost green electricity, for disconnecting the system in large waves for hardware safety and protection, and for automatically restoring operation when wave conditions normalize.

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{interests}} and high requirements in low-speed linear drives, the linear machines possessing high force density, high power density and high efficiency feature become in great demands for the linear direct-drive applications. There are many available linear machine topologies, but their performances for exhibiting the high-force density capability dissatisfy the industrial requirements. In order {{to solve this}} problem, the new machine topologies emphasizing on high force density are explored and studied. The objective of this thesis is to present the design, analysis, and application of permanent magnet (PM) linear machines which can offer a higher force density at the same magnetic loading and electric loading than the conventional machines. Although in recent years there are many emerging advanced PM rotational machines for direct-drive rotational drives, the development of advanced PM linear machines for direct-drive linear drives is sparse. In spite of the motion type of electric machines, the inherent operating principle is the same. By studying and borrowing concepts of the high torque density rotational electric machines, the linear machine morphologies of the promising candidates are designed and analyzed. The problems and side effects resulting from the linearization are discussed and suppressed. Two main approaches for machine design and analysis are developed and applied, namely the analytical calculation and the finite element method (FEM). By analytically solving the magnetic field problem, {{the relationships between the}} field quantities and the machine geometry are unveiled. With the use of analytical calculation, the machine design and dimension optimization are conveniently achieved. With the use of FEM, the machine design objective and its electromagnetic performance are verified and evaluated. Finally, the proposed low-speed PM linear machine is applied for direct-drive wave power generation.
