Conceptualized by Johnson, {{it was created}} around its title when she experienced a long wait. She later elaborated: [...] "I think I was leaving some hibachi spot and I think they had a long wait and I was like “ain’t enough hours in a day for this. I’m hungry, I need to eat now.” I kept saying 24/7, 24/7 and I was like <b>what</b> <b>about,</b> <b>what</b> comes after seven, oh yea eight. I literally think like that. So I’m like “25/8”... {{that sounds like a}} song. It’s a dope title but what does it mean." ...|$|E

40|$|Some {{journalists have}} {{been around long enough}} to witness the {{evolution}} of media: from newspapers and typewriters to radio and television to computers and web sites. The basic way we work is changing. Work has changed from that leisurely coffee break to craft that perfect lede and nutgraph to the quick trip to a coffeehouse with Wi-Fi to send over the latest update. Today 2 ̆ 7 s journalists also are coping with other typesof changes that hit other industries long ago. Downsizing. Early retirement. Job elimination. Job restructuring. Corporate takeovers. Change, in other words, is getting personal. Change forces you to come to reality with the blunt force of WAM (<b>What</b> <b>about</b> me?)

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I focus on dismissivism in metaphysics. Some {{philosophers}} argue {{that at least}} some metaphysical disputes are not substantial, and as a consequence should be dismissed. In this work I restrict my attention to metaphysics and focus on debates about existence and grounding. In particular I am interested in finding out whether {{there is a difference between}} the possible options available for dismissing debates <b>about</b> <b>what</b> there is and the possible options available for dismissing debates <b>about</b> <b>what</b> grounds what. I will delve into this in two different steps. First of all I explore the possibility to dismiss debates <b>about</b> <b>what</b> there is, and as a case study I analyse the debate between three-dimensionalism and four-dimensionalism. Secondly I delve into whether it is possible to dismiss debates <b>about</b> <b>what</b> grounds what, thanks to the discussion of another case study, i. e. the debate between tropes ontologies and universals ontologies. It is worth exploring the nature of dismissivism, because it bears on the future of philosophy. If philosophy has to have a future, we have to make sure {{that at least some}} disagreements within it are substantial. My conclusions will be that metaphysical debates <b>about</b> <b>what</b> there is can be dismissed for a variety of reasons (semantic, epistemic, [...] .). I also argue there is no general formula to find out whether a specific debate should be dismissed. On the other hand I argue that debates <b>about</b> <b>what</b> grounds what should be dismissed. I offer two distinct arguments in favour of my claim. Firstly, I argue that disputants are having a verbal dispute when they talk <b>about</b> <b>what</b> grounds what, and thus their disagreement is non genuine. Secondly, I argue that the notion of grounding is underspecified, because it cannot be properly distinguished from causation...|$|R

But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> democracy? <b>What</b> <b>about</b> political regimes? Are they taken into account by private banks when they decide whether to invest in a country? Put another way, do private banks have democratic political preferences? In this article, we focus on cross-border lending from international bank(er) s. The questions asked are as follows. Do bank(er) s react positively (that is by increasing their lending) when an emerging democracy appears? Do we witness increased bank lending after democratic transitions? Lastly, is there any relation between democratic consolidation and bank lending?...|$|R

5000|$|Philosopher Paul Boghossian {{has also}} written against social constructionism. He follows Ian Hacking's {{argument}} that many adopt social constructionism because of its potentially liberating stance: if things are {{the way that they}} are only because of our social conventions, as opposed to being so naturally, then {{it should be possible to}} change them into how we would rather have them be. He then states that social constructionists argue that we should refrain from making absolute judgements <b>about</b> <b>what</b> is true and instead state that something is true in the light of this or that theory. Countering this, he states: But it is hard to see how we might coherently follow this advice. Given that the propositions which make up epistemic systems are just very general propositions <b>about</b> <b>what</b> absolutely justifies what, it makes no sense to insist that we abandon making absolute particular judgements <b>about</b> <b>what</b> justifies what while allowing us to accept absolute general judgements <b>about</b> <b>what</b> justifies what. But in effect this is what the epistemic relativist is recommending.|$|R
