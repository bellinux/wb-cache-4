25|$|The axis of {{symmetry}} of a two-dimensional figure is a line such that, if a perpendicular is constructed, any two points lying on the perpendicular at equal distances from the {{axis of symmetry}} are identical. Another <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it {{is that if the}} shape were to be folded in half over the axis, the two halves would be identical: the two halves are each other's mirror image. Thus a square has four axes of symmetry, because there are four different ways to fold it and have the edges all match. A circle has infinitely many axes of symmetry passing through its center, for the same reason.|$|E

Smith rejects the culture/nature dichotomy, and suggests that a politics of recognition is an appropriate <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> relationships. She draws upon feminist and ecofeminist literature to conceive of recognition theory beyond intersubjective self/other relations, allowing recognition beyond a human self, a concept which she challenges. Smith seeks to show that recognition theories should not be considered [...] "soft" [...] or [...] "naive" [...] as accounts of justice, and instead that they offer an appropriate mode for thinking about ecological and animal injustices.|$|E

2500|$|In {{developing}} his {{approaches to}} teaching and fencing, Sollee used his understanding {{of a wide range}} of subjects, including boxing, martial arts and psychology, and his experience teaching fencing to the blind at the Carroll Center. Sollee taught well over a thousand students at the Carroll Center helping people regain their orientation in space. As part of the effort to work on teaching approaches, Sollee and Johan Harmenberg came up with a new <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> épée fencing starting with the three [...] "Sollee conjectures". Sollee and his students collaboratively worked on these conjectures and the associated new paradigm. Harmenberg implemented these ideas and won both the World Fencing Championships and the Olympic gold medal in épée at the 1980 Summer Olympics. It also worked for those who learned and helped to further develop Sollee's ideas by working with Johan Harmenberg away from MIT, e.g. Björne Väggö, who won the Silver medal in épée in the 1984 Olympics.|$|E
2500|$|The slot-and-state syntax in MCell {{can also}} be used to model multimeric {{proteins}} or macromolecular complexes. When used in this way, a slot is a placeholder for a subunit or a molecular component of a complex, and the state of the slot will indicate whether a specific protein component is absent or present in the complex. A <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> this is that MCell macromolecules can have several dimensions: A [...] "state dimension" [...] and one or more [...] "spatial dimensions". The [...] "state dimension" [...] is used to describe the multiple possible states making up a multi-state protein, while the spatial dimension(s) describe topological relationships between neighboring subunits or members of a macromolecular complex. One drawback of this method for representing protein complexes, compared to Meredys, is that MCell does not allow for the diffusion of complexes, and hence, of multi-state molecules. This can in some cases be circumvented by adjusting the diffusion constants of ligands that interact with the complex, by using checkpointing functions or by combining simulations at different levels.|$|E
