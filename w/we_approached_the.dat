I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E

Working with producer Steve James, they began recording songs in studios and kitchens, then signed a deal with Universal Music. In May 2001 their fourth album, The Go was issued, which peaked at No.54 on the ARIA Albums Chart, No.10 on the Australasian Albums Chart and No.8 on the Alternative Albums Chart. It, too, received favourable reviews, with The Sunday Telegraphs Kathy McCabe declaring: [...] "It would be a travesty if this album didn't elevate Skunkhour to their deserved position of Australia's best funk-rock band. They achieve a harder edge and energy in these songs, without sacrificing the groove".|$|E

[...] He then abandoned the buglers and fell on the neck of the first drummer. [...] For a moment the drum stood between him and the object of his affections, but eventually he managed to plant two loud kisses on the drummer’s cheeks. [...] Then he made for the general-in-chief. [...] There was a sudden hush, as when an orchestra falls silent {{at the end of a}} dance. [...] He recovered himself, solemnly clicked his heels, and saluted General Brière de l’Isle. [...] We recognised Captain de Borelli.|$|E
