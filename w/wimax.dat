25|$|The home {{broadband}} {{and voice}} service {{is powered by}} <b>WiMAX</b> (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) technology. Ooredoo Oman was first to deploy 3G+ in Oman {{and is the only}} operator to deploy <b>WiMAX</b> commercially in Oman.|$|E
25|$|Surendra Babu Mandava and Arogyaswami Paulraj founded Beceem Communications in 2004 {{to produce}} MIMO-OFDM {{chipsets}} for <b>WiMAX.</b> The company {{was acquired by}} Broadcom in 2010. <b>WiMAX</b> was developed {{as an alternative to}} cellular standards, is based on the 802.16e standard, and uses MIMO-OFDM to deliver speeds up to 138 Mbit/s. The more advanced 802.16m standard enables download speeds up to 1 Gbit/s. A nationwide <b>WiMAX</b> network was built in the United States by Clearwire, a subsidiary of Sprint-Nextel, covering 130 million points of presence (PoP) by mid-2012. Sprint subsequently announced plans to deploy LTE (the cellular 4G standard) covering 31 cities by mid-2013 and to shut down its <b>WiMAX</b> network by the end of 2015.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 {{the city}} {{was one of the}} first to be {{connected}} to the <b>WiMAX</b> network.|$|E
25|$|OFDM is {{extensively}} used in wireless LAN and MAN applications, including IEEE 802.11a/g/n and <b>WiMAX.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2007 LTT company {{started to}} provide ADSL+2 with 512 kbit/s {{downstream}} for home users, also it {{launched in the}} beginning of 2009 the <b>Wimax</b> called Libya Max which provides internet wireless.|$|E
25|$|It is {{expected}} that NTRA will award two licenses for international gateways using open technology and deploy <b>WiMax</b> technology enabling the delivery of last-mile wireless broadband access {{as an alternative to}} ADSL.|$|E
25|$|American {{wireless}} carrier Nextel Communications {{field tested}} wireless broadband network technologies including Flash-OFDM in 2005. Sprint purchased the carrier in 2006 {{and decided to}} deploy the mobile version of <b>WiMAX,</b> {{which is based on}} Scalable Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (SOFDMA) technology.|$|E
25|$|Grameenphone Ltd. and Huawei won the Green Mobile Award at the GSMA Mobile Awards 2009. In March 2009, the <b>Wimax</b> Forum {{announced}} {{four new}} members to its Board of Directors including Thomas Lee, the Vice Director of the Industry Standards Department at Huawei.|$|E
25|$|The Howard Government's $2 billion {{broadband}} {{plan would}} see regional areas to get <b>WiMAX</b> wireless and ADSL2+ broadband. At {{no cost to}} the tax-payers, the private sector would tender to build a FTTN broadband network in built-up areas capable of delivering internet speeds of up to 50Mbps.|$|E
25|$|Longer range {{communications}} {{have been}} proposed using infrastructure networks such as <b>WiMAX</b> (IEEE 802.16), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or 3G. Long-range communications using these methods are well established, but, unlike the short-range protocols, these methods require extensive and very expensive infrastructure deployment. There is lack of consensus as to what business model should support this infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Caltrain {{announced}} that wireless internet access (using <b>WiMAX)</b> {{would be available}} on trains at no additional charge, {{by the end of}} 2007. Caltrain invested more than $1 million in researching and testing WiFi in 2006. The Caltrain Board of Directors voted at their August 30, 2007 meeting to keep the project from proceeding by rejecting both bids to provide the service, citing both bids not meeting the expectation of Caltrain.|$|E
25|$|In recent 3GPP and <b>WiMAX</b> standards, MU-MIMO {{is being}} treated {{as one of the}} {{candidate}} technologies adoptable in the specification by a number of companies, including Samsung, Intel, Qualcomm, Ericsson, TI, Huawei, Philips, Nokia, and Freescale. For these and other firms active in the mobile hardware market, MU-MIMO is more feasible for low-complexity cell phones with a small number of reception antennas, whereas single-user SU-MIMO's higher per-user throughput is better suited to more complex user devices with more antennas.|$|E
25|$|The NSN brand {{identity}} was launched at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona in February 2007 as {{a joint venture}} between Nokia (50.1%) and Siemens (49.9%), although it is now wholly owned by Nokia. It provides wireless and fixed network infrastructure, communications and networks service platforms and professional services to operators and service providers. It focuses on GSM, EDGE, 3G/W-CDMA, LTE and <b>WiMAX</b> radio access networks, supporting core networks with increasing IP and multiaccess capabilities and services.|$|E
25|$|Wireless {{broadband}} in Australia is widespread, {{with many}} point-to-point fixed wireless broadband providers serving broadband-poor regional and rural areas, predominantly with Motorola Canopy and <b>WiMAX</b> technologies. Telstra's 2006 {{introduction of the}} Next G HSPA network (which reportedly covers 99% of the Australian population as of September 2008) with speeds advertised of being up to 14 Mbit/s stimulated investment in wireless broadband by competitors Optus, Vodafone and Hutchison Telecommunications, who are presently expanding their HSPA networks to cover 96–98% of the Australian population.|$|E
25|$|The {{terrestrial}} carrier is an OFDM QPSK signal, {{cousin to}} <b>WiMax</b> and LTE, with {{the particular feature}} {{that more than one}} transmitter operates on the same frequency, forming a single frequency network. A number of transmitters can be placed around a city to create coverage that is less subject to fading than if a single transmitter were used. The satellite signal is QPSK. Both satellite and terrestrial signals have hierarchical modulation superposed on the original signal, a measure created to add bandwidth at a small expense in the satellite link budget for decoding the core audio content.|$|E
25|$|Nortel {{initially}} {{hoped to}} re-emerge from bankruptcy, implementing a retention bonus plan {{in an effort}} to retain its top executives during the restructuring period. These bonuses, totaling US$45 million, were targeted at 1,000 executive positions. At the end of January 2009, Nortel announced that it would be discontinuing its <b>WiMAX</b> business and its agreement with Alvarion. Nortel subsequently sold its Layer 4–7 application delivery business to Israeli technology firm Radware for $18 million, after Radware had initially placed a stalking horse bid. Nortel had acquired the application switch product line in October 2000 when it purchased Alteon WebSystems.|$|E
25|$|Digicel {{entered the}} {{broadband}} market in 2010 by offering <b>WiMAX</b> broadband, capable {{of up to}} 6 Mbit/s per subscriber. To further their broadband share post-LIME/FLOW merger in 2014, the company introduced a new broadband service called Digicel Play, which is Jamaica's second FTTH offering (after LIME's deployment in selected communities in 2011). It is currently only available in the parishes of Kingston, Portmore and St. Andrew. It offers speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s down, 100 Mbit/s up via a pure fibre optic network. Digicel's competitor, FLOW Jamaica, has a network consisting of ADSL, Coaxial and Fibre to the Home (inherited from LIME) and only offers speeds up to 100 Mbit/s. FLOW has committed to expanding its Fibre offering to more areas in order to combat Digicel's entrance into the market.|$|E
25|$|Access network: The {{user can}} {{connect to the}} IP-core of NGN in various ways, most of which use the {{standard}} Internet Protocol (IP). User terminals such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and computers can register directly on NGN-core, {{even when they are}} roaming in another network or country. The only requirement is that they can use IP and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Fixed access (e.g., Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable modems, Ethernet), mobile access (e.g. W-CDMA, CDMA2000, GSM, GPRS) and wireless access (e.g.WLAN, <b>WiMAX)</b> are all supported. Other phone systems like plain old telephone service and non-compatible VoIP systems, are supported through gateways. With the deployment of the NGN, users may subscribe to many simultaneous access-providers providing telephony, internet or entertainment services. This may provide end-users with virtually unlimited options to choose between service providers for these services in NGN environment.|$|E

In August 2008 PTCL has also launched its IPTV service named PTCL Smart TV in Jhelum.|$|E
2500|$|In radio, multiple-input and multiple-output, or MIMO (pronounced [...] or [...] ), is {{a method}} for {{multiplying}} the capacity of a radio link using multiple transmit and receive antennas to exploit multipath propagation. MIMO has become {{an essential element of}} wireless communication standards including IEEE 802.11n (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.11ac (Wi-Fi), HSPA+ (3G), <b>WiMAX</b> (4G), and Long Term Evolution (4G). More recently, MIMO has been applied to power-line communication for 3-wire installations as part of ITU G.hn standard and HomePlug AV2 specification.|$|E

The 3G, 3G+ and 4G networks allow the digital opening up of the city of Rodez. The various road works, in the city centre, and especially in the historic heart, allowed new internet loops of very high-speed to be built between 2011 and 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} the Internet in India started with launch of {{services}} by VSNL on 15 August 1995. They were able to add about 10,000 Internet users within 6 months. However, for the next 10 years the Internet experience in the country remained less attractive with narrow-band connections having speeds less than 56 kbit/s (dial-up). In 2004, the government formulated its broadband policy which defined broadband as [...] "an always-on Internet connection with download speed of 256 kbit/s or above." [...] From 2005 onward {{the growth of the}} broadband sector in the country accelerated, but remained below the growth estimates of the government and related agencies due to resource issues in last-mile access which were predominantly wired-line technologies. This bottleneck was removed in 2010 when the government auctioned 3G spectrum followed by an equally high-profile auction of 4G spectrum that set the scene for a competitive and invigorated wireless broadband market. Now Internet access in India is provided by both public and private companies using a variety of technologies and media including dial-up (PSTN), xDSL, coaxial cable, Ethernet, FTTH, ISDN, HSDPA (3G), WiFi, <b>WiMAX,</b> etc. at a wide range of speeds and costs. As per IAMAI India will have the world's second largest number of Internet users with over 300 million by December 2014.|$|E
