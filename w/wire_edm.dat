40|$|Abstract: Micro {{holes are}} useful in {{reducing}} the size of pilot hole in <b>wire</b> cut <b>EDM.</b> Micro EDM is useful in creating MEMS components, for producing micro holes, machining very hard materials, and in many other applications. Since the features to be machined are small and require high accuracy, the current level is low and must be precisely controlled. In conventional EDM, the current levels are high {{as well as the}} voltage required. Mainstream EDMs use voltage levels of about 150 V and currents of up to 50 A. As a result of higher currents, the electrode gets locally melted and there is welding of the workpiece and electrode. There are also the problems of stray arcing. Moreover, uncontrolled discharge cannot be allowed in micro machining. Thus, a different power supply is required for micro EDM. This paper discusses the step-by-step deSvelopment of a suitable power supply to fulfill these requirements. Pulsed DC power supply is a critical component for achieving the required parameters of accuracy, finish and size of micro holes via EDM process...|$|R
