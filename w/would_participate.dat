5|$|After {{the failure}} of naval attacks, {{it was decided that}} ground forces were {{necessary}} to eliminate the Turkish mobile artillery and allow minesweepers to clear the waters for larger vessels. The British Secretary of State for War, Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, appointed General Sir Ian Hamilton to command the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF) that was to carry out the mission.

5|$|Although the PanzerI <b>would</b> <b>participate</b> {{in almost}} every major Nationalist {{offensive}} of the war, the Nationalist army began to deploy more and more captured T-26 tanks to offset their disadvantage in protection and firepower. At one point, von Thoma offered up to 500pesetas for each T-26 captured. Although the Panzer I was initially able to knock out the T-26 at close range—150meters (165yd) or less—using an armor-piercing 7.92millimeter bullet, the Republican tanks began to engage at ranges where they were immune to the machine guns of the PanzerI.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games {{were held}} in Cardiff. The event was (to date) the biggest {{sporting}} event ever held in Wales; however, {{it would not have}} been possible without the financial support given by the WRU and the Cardiff Athletic Club. Both the opening and closing ceremonies took place at Cardiff Arms Park, plus all the track and field events, on what had been the greyhound track. It would turn out to be the last time that South Africa <b>would</b> <b>participate</b> in the Games until 1994. South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth Games in 1961.|$|E

It {{would take place}} well after the ceasefire. It {{is known as the}} Battle of Rumaila. Iraqi Republican Guard forces were engaged within the Hammar Marshes of the Tigris–Euphrates river system in Iraq while attempting to reach and cross the Lake Hammar causeway and escape northward toward Baghdad on Highway 8. Most of the five-mile-long Iraqi caravan of several hundred vehicles was first boxed into a kill zone and then {{in the course of the}} next five hours systematically devastated by the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, including its armored forces, by AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, and nine artillery battalions.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{invasion}} of Afghanistan in December 1979 and threatened {{boycott of the}} 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow led organizers to consider again postponing the Canada Cup. While Eagleson initially favoured allowing the tournament to go ahead regardless of the political situation, he ultimately agreed that Hockey Canada should again postpone the Canada Cup after the Canadian Government joined the Olympic boycott. A brief effort to move the tournament to Sweden was quickly put down when Eagleson informed them that neither Hockey Canada nor the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) <b>would</b> <b>participate</b> in such an event.|$|E
5|$|Gunn ascribes {{much of his}} goalkeeping {{success to}} the support of Belgian Marc De Clerck, a {{specialist}} goalkeeping coach at Aberdeen. At a time when few British teams provided such training, De Clerck introduced Gunn and Scottish international keeper Jim Leighton to what were then innovative training techniques. The goalkeepers <b>would</b> <b>participate</b> in special drills whilst training {{with the rest of}} the squad. Gunn also notes the influence of Aberdeen coach Teddy Scott, who taught the value of hard work and dedication; Gunn also served as a boot boy for Alex McLeish. Leighton's presence meant that Gunn played only 21 games for Aberdeen. He made his debut against Hibernian at Pittodrie on 30 October 1982, and went on to keep four clean sheets for the club. Despite being rivals for a first-team place, Gunn had an excellent relationship with Leighton that included joining Leighton's family for a meal once a week.|$|E

5|$|Howarth's next {{international}} call-up {{came over}} a year later when being selected for the under-18s for a match against Luxembourg on 27 April 2000, this time being one of two players with clubs below the top two divisions. He debuted after coming on as a 60th-minute substitute for Evans, in a 2–0 victory for England. Howarth was then called up for a friendly with Israel on 1 September, {{although he did not}} feature as Evans was chosen to start. In September 2000, he was named in the team that <b>would</b> <b>participate</b> in a 2001 UEFA European Under-18 Championship qualifying mini-tournament hosted in Ancona, Italy. He failed to appear in the first match against Andorra on 7 October 2000, but made his first start in the next match, a 5–0 victory over the Faroe Islands on 9 October. Howarth was excluded from the line-up for the final match against Italy, which England won to progress to the intermediate qualifying round.|$|E
5|$|In 15–16th-century French and English {{depictions of}} {{relationships}} between women (Lives of Gallant Ladies by Brantôme in 1665, John Cleland's 1749 erotica Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, L'Espion Anglais by various authors in 1778), writers' attitudes spanned from amused tolerance to arousal, whereupon a male character <b>would</b> <b>participate</b> to complete the act. Physical relationships between women were often encouraged; men felt no threat as they viewed sexual acts between women to be accepted when men were not available, and not comparable to fulfillment that could be achieved by sexual acts between men and women. At worst, if a woman became enamored of another woman, she became a tragic figure. Physical and therefore emotional satisfaction was considered impossible without a natural phallus. Male intervention into relationships between women was necessary only when women acted as men and demanded the same social privileges.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Brazilian and Russian {{authorities}} conducted {{talks on}} the possible acquisition of the Su-27M. In 2001, the Brazilian government launched the F-X tender, the objective of which was to procure at least twelve aircraft to replace the Brazilian Air Force's ageing aircraft, primarily the Mirage IIIs. Since the Brazilian government was also looking to develop the country's aerospace and defence industries, Sukhoi partnered with the Brazilian defence contractor Avibras during the tender. The two companies submitted the Su-27M to the US$700-million tender, and included an offset agreement wherein the Brazilian industry <b>would</b> <b>participate</b> in the manufacturing of certain aircraft equipment. The tender was suspended in 2003 because of domestic political issues and then scrapped in 2005, pending the availability of new fighters. The Su-27M was preferred over the next favourite, the Mirage 2000BR; had the aircraft been purchased, {{it would have been}} the first heavy fighter delivered to Latin America.|$|E
