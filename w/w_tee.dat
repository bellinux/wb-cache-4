40|$|Abstract. By {{exploiting}} conformal maps to vertically slit {{regions in}} the complex plane, a re-cently developed rational spectral method [T. <b>W.</b> <b>Tee</b> and L. N. Trefethen, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 28 (2006), pp. 1798 – 1811] is able to solve PDEs with interior layer-like behavior using significantly fewer collocation points than traditional spectral methods. The conformal maps are chosen to “enlarge the region of analyticity ” in the solution: an idea which can be extended to other numerical methods based upon global polynomial interpolation. Here we show how such maps can be rapidly computed in both periodic and nonperiodic geometries and apply them to some challenging differential equations.

40|$|An obligately anaerobic, fastidious, slowly growing, spiral, gram-negative {{bacterium}} was {{isolated from the}} blood of a 75 -year-old man with acute onset of pyrexia. The patient responded rapidly to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Extensive investigation failed to detect a focus for the infection. Phenotypically, the organism was consistent with Desulfovibrio species. Microscopic investigation revealed an organism with a vibrioid or spirillioid morphology with rapidly progressive motility {{by means of a}} single polar flagellum. Biochemically, the organism produced large amounts of H 2 S and contained desulfovirdin. The 16 S rRNA gene sequence of the organism was found to be most similar to those of members of the genus Desulfovibrio, with identical sequence homology to the newly proposed species described by Tee et al. (<b>W.</b> <b>Tee,</b> M. Dyall-Smith, W. Woods, and D. Eisen, J. Clin. Microbiol. 34 : 1760 - 1764, 1996). This is a second unrelated isolation of this novel species from two widely different locations in Australia. The two isolates show some phenotypic differences, indicating that they are different strains of the same species...|$|E
