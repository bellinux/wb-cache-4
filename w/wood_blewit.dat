5000|$|Clitocybe nuda - <b>wood</b> <b>blewit</b> - {{a common}} edible {{distinguished}} {{in part by}} its lilac hue ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>blewit</b> {{has been}} {{cultivated}} in Britain, the Netherlands and France. Cultivated wood blewits are {{said not to}} taste as good as wild wood blewits.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} known as the <b>wood</b> <b>blewit.</b> Cooke called it the amethyst lepista, John Sibthorp called it the blue-gilled agaric in his 1794 work Flora Oxoniensis, ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>blewits</b> are {{generally}} regarded as a good edible, but they are known to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. This is particularly likely if the mushroom is consumed raw, though allergic reactions are known even from cooked blewits. It is therefore important to cook <b>wood</b> <b>blewits</b> before eating, as consumption of raw specimens could lead to indigestion. <b>Wood</b> <b>blewits</b> contain the sugar trehalose, which is edible for most people.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>blewits</b> can be {{confused}} with certain purple species of the genus Cortinarius, including the uncommon C. camphoratus, many {{of which may be}} poisonous. Cortinarius mushrooms often have the remains of a veil under their caps and a ring-like impression on their stem. <b>Wood</b> <b>blewits</b> can be easily distinguished by their odor, as well as by their spore print. <b>Wood</b> <b>blewits</b> have a light (white to pale pink) spore print; Cortinarius species produce a rusty brown spore print after several hours on white paper. Their brown spores often dust their stems and objects beneath them.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>wood</b> <b>blewits</b> {{and field}} blewits are {{generally}} regarded as edible, but they are known to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. This is particularly likely if the mushroom is consumed raw, though allergic reactions are known even from cooked <b>blewits.</b> <b>Wood</b> <b>blewits</b> contain the sugar trehalose, which is edible for most people.|$|R
50|$|German mycologist Paul Kummer {{placed it}} in the genus Tricholoma in 1871, {{the same year that}} English {{botanist}} Mordecai Cubitt Cooke {{placed it in}} Lepista. It was known by these names for many years, with some authors accepting Lepista and while others retained the <b>wood</b> <b>blewit</b> in Tricholoma. In 1969 Howard E. Bigelow and Alexander H. Smith reviewed Lepista and reclassified it as a subgenus of Clitocybe Finnish mycologist Harri Harmaja has called for the sinking of Lepista into Clitocybe, with C. nebularis as the type species of the latter genus. Hence the <b>wood</b> <b>blewit</b> is classified as either Lepista nuda or Clitocybe nuda.|$|E
50|$|Many species {{originally}} described within Tricholoma {{have since}} been moved to other genera. These include the <b>Wood</b> <b>blewit</b> (Clitocybe nuda), previously Tricholoma nudum, blewit (Clitocybe saeva), previously Tricholoma personatum, and St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa) previously Tricholoma gambosum.|$|E
50|$|Blewit {{refers to}} two {{closely related species}} of edible agarics in the genus Clitocybe, the <b>wood</b> <b>blewit</b> (Clitocybe nuda) and the field blewit or blue-leg (C.saeva). Both species are treated by some {{authorities}} as belonging to the genus Lepista.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>blewits</b> can be {{preserved}} {{in olive oil}} or white vinegar after blanching.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, male satin bowerbirds collect blue {{objects to}} {{decorate}} their bowers with. A young male {{was reported to}} have collected <b>wood</b> <b>blewits</b> to this end near Braidwood in southern New South Wales.|$|R
50|$|In most mycologists' opinion, the blewits are {{considered}} excellent mushrooms, despite their coloration. Blewits can be eaten as a cream sauce or sautéed in butter, {{but it is}} important not to eat them raw, which could lead to indigestion. They can also be cooked like tripe or as omelette filling, and <b>wood</b> <b>blewits</b> also make good stewing mushrooms.|$|R
50|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>blewit</b> {{is found}} in Europe and North America and is {{becoming}} more common in Australia, where {{it appears to have}} been introduced. It is a saprotrophic species, growing on decaying leaf litter. In the United Kingdom, it appears from September through to December.|$|E
50|$|Lepista personata (also {{recognised}} as Lepista saeva, Clitocybe saeva and Tricholoma personatum, and {{commonly known}} as the field blewit and blue-leg) is a species of fungus. It is commonly found growing in grassy areas across Europe and is morphologically related to the <b>wood</b> <b>blewit</b> (Lepista nuda).|$|E
50|$|Recent {{molecular}} {{work has}} shown the genus to be polyphyletic, with many members seemingly distantly related and other fungi, such as the field blewit and <b>wood</b> <b>blewit,</b> now known as Clitocybe saeva and C. nuda respectively, are more closely related. As C. nebularis is the type species, those most distantly related to it {{would be likely to}} be reclassified in the future.|$|E
50|$|In this leg's Roadblock, {{one team}} member {{had to find}} a store display {{containing}} three different types of mushrooms (grey oysters, <b>wood</b> <b>blewits,</b> and shiitake). Using one of the baskets they picked up at the train station, they then had to enter an underground mushroom farm, find the same three types of mushrooms, and collect 10 of each variety. If they found the correct three mushroom types, the shopkeeper would give them their next clue.|$|R
50|$|This {{mushroom}} {{can range}} from lilac to purple-pink. Some North American specimens are duller and tend toward tan, but usually have purplish tones on the stem and gills. The gills {{are attached to the}} short, stout stem. Mature specimens have a darker color and flatter cap; younger ones are lighter with more convex caps. <b>Wood</b> <b>blewits</b> have a very distinctive odor, which has been likened by one author to that of frozen orange juice.|$|R
50|$|Soil {{analysis}} of soil containing mycelium from a <b>wood</b> <b>blewit</b> (Clitocybe nuda) fairy ring under Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in southeast Sweden yielded fourteen halogenated {{low molecular weight}} organic compounds, three of which were brominated and the others chlorinated. It is unclear whether these were metabolites or pollutants. Brominated compounds are unknown as metabolites from terrestrial fungi.|$|E
50|$|Clitocybe nuda, {{commonly}} known as the <b>wood</b> <b>blewit</b> and alternately described as Lepista nuda, is an edible mushroom native to Europe and North America. Described by Pierre Bulliard in 1790, it was also known as Tricholoma nudum for many years. It is found in both coniferous and deciduous woodlands. It is a fairly distinctive mushroom that is widely eaten, though there is some caution about edibility. Nevertheless, it has been cultivated in Britain, the Netherlands and France.|$|E
50|$|The variety lilacina {{is similar}} in shape but tinted lilac all over, with an ochre-brown flush on the cap umbo and {{the base of the}} stem. It has a strong mealy or earthy odour. This variety could be mistaken for the edible {{amethyst}} deceiver (Laccaria amethystina), although the latter species has a fibrous stipe, a fruity smell and lacks the ochre-coloured umbo. It is a similar coloration to the <b>wood</b> <b>blewit,</b> although mushrooms of that species generally grow much larger.|$|E
50|$|A 2015 genetic {{study found}} that the genera Collybia and Lepista were closely related to the core clade of Clitocybe, but that all three were polyphyletic, with many members in {{lineages}} removed from other members of the same genus and instead more closely related to the other two. To complicate matters, the <b>wood</b> <b>blewit</b> is not closely related to the type species of Lepista, L. densifolia. Alvarado and colleagues declined to define the genera but proposed several options and highlighted the need for a wider analysis.|$|E
5000|$|The French mycologist Pierre Bulliard {{described}} the <b>wood</b> <b>blewit</b> {{in his work}} Herbier de la France in 1790 as Agaricus nudus, reporting that it was common in the woods all year. He wrote of two varieties: one whose gills and cap are initially light violet and mature to burgundy, while the other has vine-coloured gills that intensify in colour with age. He added that the first variety was often confused with Cortinarius violaceus, though it has a [...] "nude" [...] cap and no spidery web veil unlike the other species. [...] English naturalist James Bolton gave it the name Agaricus bulbosa—the bulbous agaric—in his An History of Fungusses growing about Halifax in 1791. He noted that it was rare in the region, though had found some in Ovenden.|$|E
