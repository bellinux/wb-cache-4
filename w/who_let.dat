In {{the final game of}} the tournament versus Sweden, Canada suffered a 6–4 loss and finished fourth overall for the tournament, missing out on their opportunity for a bronze medal that would have come with a win versus Sweden.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to kick off. Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross {{from the left}} wing to Roy Bentley, <b>who</b> <b>let</b> off a shot that was barely pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the 12th minute, England had six clear shots on goal but could not convert, with two shots hitting the post, one just going over the top, and another brilliantly saved by Borghi.|$|E
5|$|The {{land was}} {{granted to the}} Bishop of Worcester {{as part of the}} Kingdom of Mercia before the Norman conquest.

Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the estate was granted to Ralph Sadler <b>who</b> <b>let</b> it to tenants until 1675.

5|$|Products {{collected}} from living horses include mare's milk, used {{by people with}} large horse herds, such as the Mongols, <b>who</b> <b>let</b> it ferment to produce kumis. Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling. Drinking their own horses' blood allowed the Mongols to ride for {{extended periods of time}} without stopping to eat. The drug Premarin is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares' urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone replacement therapy. The tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.|$|E
5|$|The next Standard History was the Book of Han, {{compiled}} by Ban Biao (354 CE), his son Ban Gu (3292 CE), {{and his daughter}} Ban Zhao (45116 CE). Unlike Sima's private and independent work, this history text was commissioned and sponsored by the Han court under Emperor Ming (r. 5775 CE), <b>who</b> <b>let</b> Ban Gu use the imperial archives. This set a significant precedent {{for the rest of}} the Standard Histories, since the historian was now virtually unable to criticize his ruling patron. The Book of Han covered the history of China left off from Sima's work during Emperor Wu's reign up until the middle Eastern Han. Although the Records of the Three Kingdoms included events in late Eastern Han, no history work focused exclusively on the Eastern Han period until the Book of Later Han was {{compiled by}} Fan Ye (398445 CE).|$|E
5|$|The Pennington {{family owned}} Pennington Hall from about 1200 {{until they were}} {{replaced}} by the Bradshaw or Bradshaighs in 1312. The Bradshaws held the manor until 1703 when John, {{the last of the}} male line died. Pennington Hall was rebuilt in 1748 by the then owner Samuel Hilton and in 1807 sold to the Gaskell family of Thornes, Wakefield, <b>who</b> <b>let</b> it to a succession of tenants. Around 1840 James Pownall, a founder member of the silk manufacturing firm, Bickham and Pownall, was tenant. Later occupants were Charles Jackson, cotton manufacturer, Jabez Johnson, and F.W. Bouth founder of Bouth's Mill in 1862, The last resident was the brewer, George Shaw. On 3 December 1919 George Shaw & Co Ltd offered the hall and grounds to the people of Leigh. The gift was accepted and opened to the public on 25 August 1920. The hall was converted to a museum and art gallery in 1928 but was demolished in 1963. The grounds are now Pennington Park.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Rider was MP for Maidstone in 1690 {{and from}} 1696 to 1698. He {{carried out a}} number of {{alterations}} to the house and its grounds between 1685 and 1690. Following his death in 1698, the estate was inherited by his son Sir Barnham Rider, MP for Maidstone from 1722 to 1727, and then his son, Thomas Rider. The second Thomas Rider left the house to his cousin Ingram Rider in 1786. In 1805, Ingram Rider left it to his son Thomas Rider, MP for Kent and West Kent from 1831 to 1835. The third Thomas Rider rebuilt parts of the house and extended and re-landscaped the park. On his death in 1847, he left the house to his nephew, also Thomas Rider, <b>who</b> <b>let</b> the house to a series of tenants. From 1903 to 1998, the house was occupied by the Winch family, firstly as leaseholders then, from 1960, as freeholders. The Winches sold the house in 1998; it remains in private ownership and belongs to the Kendrick family.|$|E
5|$|During Edward II's reign (1307–1327) {{there was}} {{relatively}} little {{activity at the}} Tower of London. However, {{it was during this}} period that the Privy Wardrobe was founded. The institution was based at the Tower and responsible for organising the state's arms. In 1321, Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere became the first woman imprisoned in the Tower of London after she refused Queen Isabella admittance to Leeds Castle and ordered her archers to fire upon Isabella, killing six of the royal escort. Generally reserved for high-ranking inmates, the Tower was the most important royal prison in the country. However it was not necessarily very secure, and throughout its history people bribed the guards to help them escape. In 1322 Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, was aided in his escape from the Tower by the Sub-Lieutenant of the Tower <b>who</b> <b>let</b> Mortimer's men inside. They hacked a hole in his cell wall and Mortimer escaped to a waiting boat. He fled to France where he encountered Edward's Queen. They began an affair and plotted to overthrow the King. One of Mortimer's first acts on entering England was to capture the Tower and release the prisoners held there. For three years he ruled while EdwardIII was too young to do so himself; in 1330, Edward and his supporters captured Mortimer and threw him in the Tower. Under EdwardIII's rule (1312–1377) England experienced renewed success in warfare after his father's reign had put the realm on the backfoot against the Scots and French. Amongst Edward's successes were the battles of Crécy and Poitiers where King John II of France was taken prisoner, and the capture of the King David II of Scotland at Neville's Cross. During this period, the Tower of London held many noble prisoners of war. EdwardII had allowed the Tower of London to fall into a state of disrepair, and by the reign of EdwardIII the castle was an uncomfortable place. The nobility held captive within its walls were unable to engage in activities such as hunting which were permissible at other royal castles used as prisons, for instance Windsor. EdwardIII ordered that the castle should be renovated.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of the couple's courtship, Mozart began making visits to Baron Gottfried van Swieten, <b>who</b> <b>let</b> him examine his {{extensive}} collection of manuscripts of work by Bach and Handel. Mozart was excited by this material, and he prepared a number of compositions in Baroque style. An important impetus was Constanze, who apparently fell in love at this time with Baroque counterpoint. This is known from a letter Mozart wrote to his sister Nannerl on 20 April 1782. The letter was accompanied by a manuscript copy of the composer's Fantasy and Fugue, K. 394.|$|E
