40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this thesis argues that {{allowing}} greater immigration from poor countries to rich countries is a promising way to alleviate global poverty. Since guest <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> may be a politically realistic way of increasing immigration from poor countries to rich countries, then if the argument in chapter one is successful, there are strong reasons for {{people who care about}} reducing global poverty to support increased guest <b>worker</b> <b>programs.</b> However, some philosophers argue that guest <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> are unjust because they are likely to cause worrisome relational inequalities between guest workers and full citizens. The second chapter of this thesis argues that these relational egalitarian arguments against guest <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> fail, and that there are in fact strong relational egalitarian reasons to support increased guest <b>worker</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R
50|$|There is a {{consensus}} among legal experts that America’s guest <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> have had unintended negative consequences. Since {{the establishment of the}} Bracero <b>Program,</b> America's guest <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> have been accused of creating abusive working conditions, withholding payments, lowering wages for domestic farm workers, and providing inadequate incentives for workers to return to their home countries. Many trade associations, such as the Associated Builders and Contractors and the National Electrical Contractors Association, oppose guest <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> because of their economic consequences, while labor groups, such as Laborers' International Union of North America, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, are sensitive to the American guest <b>worker</b> <b>program's</b> history of rights violations.|$|R

40|$|Some of {{the most}} vexing and {{persistent}} questions in U. S. immigration policy involve whether and how to design programs to admit temporary workers. These questions often prompt disagreement, even among those who otherwise agree on many aspects of immigration law and policy. To address these questions, this Article starts with {{a brief overview of}} temporary worker admissions in U. S. immigration law today, and then summarizes the main points typically made by supporters and skeptics. It next identifies key questions for those who would design temporary <b>worker</b> <b>programs.</b> The main part of the Article then explains how analysis of temporary <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> generally reflects some combination of four broad perspectives. One perspective evaluates temporary <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> as a force in the U. S. economy that benefits many citizens and permanent residents but disadvantages others. A second perspective views admission of temporary workers not only in comparison to its traditional foil — admission of permanent residents — but also to immigration outside the law. A third perspective analyzes temporary worker admissions not only as a vital facet of immigration law, but also as essential to international economic development. A fourth perspective assesses temporary admissions in the context not just of immigration law, but also of citizenship, especially by looking at the integration of future generations. Comparing and evaluating these four perspectives can shed light on current debates by broadening and deepening analysis of temporary <b>worker</b> <b>programs.</b> Overall, the broad assessment provided by a balanced combination of these perspectives generally suggests cautious support for temporary <b>worker</b> <b>programs,</b> but only if they are carefully designed and coordinated with initiatives outside of immigration law. ...|$|R

The amendment failed with 53 votes (60 votes were needed because the amendment was not germane to the underlying bill).

2500|$|For {{those who}} enter the US {{illegally}} across the Mexico–United States border and elsewhere, migration is difficult, expensive and dangerous. Virtually all undocumented immigrants have no avenues for legal entry to the United States due to the restrictive legal limits on green cards, and lack of immigrant visas for low-skilled workers. Participants in debates on immigration in the early twenty-first century called for increasing enforcement of existing laws governing illegal immigration to the United States, building a barrier along {{some or all of}} the [...] Mexico-U.S. border, or creating a new guest <b>worker</b> <b>program.</b> Through much of 2006 the country and Congress was immersed in a debate about these proposals.
