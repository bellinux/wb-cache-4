5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the world, could only think of one way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so {{that she would have to}} step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E
5|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{monument}} depicts the theme {{of a young man}} called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory. It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, with his left hand still on the plow handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak. Her face is impassive as she bestows the sword upon the farmer <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> hand while her right hand holds her pike.|$|E

25|$|By 1962, {{she begins}} using bright colors and allude to floral and plant-like shapes. These works are compositionally similar to her {{monochrome}} images {{due to their}} large size and rhythmic nature with no central focal point. The palette of these images often contrast one another and allude to tropical landscapes or plants. She continued working in this style until she suffered an aneurysm, fell, and broke her right wrist in 1963, the wrist she used to paint with. Since she still wanted to work, she painted <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> hand instead. To overcome working with her non-dominant hand, she often would directly apply paint from a tube to the canvas rather than using a brush, causing there to be large patches of white canvas on the surfaces of the images. The gesture and the physicality of these works is more restrained since she is working <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> hand.|$|E
25|$|The work {{represents}} {{at least}} four nude women (or bathers) relaxing in a highly abstract landscape with vegetation and a small body of water visible through reflections and from {{the woman on the}} left whose legs are submerged from the knees down. The central figure holds the trunk of a tree <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> arm and a woman with her right, forming a tight central mass. The two nudes at the center, treated in a light color, stand-out against a darker background. They are flanked on both sides by a standing and a sitting nude.|$|E
25|$|The nude {{woman is}} in fact not perched side-saddle on the horse. As others have pointed out (Antliff and Leighten), and as emerges upon close examination, the nude woman is seated on {{what appears to be}} a {{rectangular}} block or cube, perhaps a model's pedestal (visible to the left). The horse occupies the upper right-hand quadrant as if observed from above. Its head is turned toward the monumental nude while she strokes the horses right ear <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> hand. She cups her hand underneath the horse's mouth, as if feeding the horse a piece of fruit.|$|E

25|$|On March 12, 2011, Giffords's husband {{informed}} her that six {{other people had}} been killed in the attack on her, but he did not identify who they were until months later. In late April, Giffords's doctors reported that her physical, cognitive, and language production abilities had improved significantly, placing her in the top 5 percent of patients recovering from similar injuries. She was walking under supervision with perfect control of her left arm and leg, and able to write <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> hand. She was able to read and understand, and spoke in short phrases. With longer efforts, she was able to produce more complex sentences.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Mother Bernard, MacKillop was once more elected unopposed as {{superior}} general in 1899, a position she held until her own death. During the later {{years of her life}} she had many problems with her health which continued to deteriorate. She suffered from rheumatism and after a stroke in Auckland, New Zealand in 1902, became paralysed on her right side. For seven years, she had to rely on a wheelchair to move around, but her speech and mind were as good as ever and her letter writing had continued unabated after she learned to write <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> hand. Even after suffering the stroke, the Josephite nuns had enough confidence in her to re-elect her in 1905.|$|E
25|$|Her 2001 {{season was}} {{dominated}} by injury, including a left foot stress fracture which forced her withdrawal from twelve tournaments, including the French Open and Wimbledon. She underwent surgery in April. She reached her second career grand slam quarterfinals, at the Australian Open. Kournikova then withdrew from several events due to continuing problems <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> foot and did not return until Leipzig. With Barbara Schett, she won the doubles title in Sydney. She then lost in the finals in Tokyo, partnering with Iroda Tulyaganova, and at San Diego, partnering with Martina Hingis. Hingis and Kournikova also won the Kremlin Cup. At {{the end of the}} 2001 season, she was ranked No. 74 in singles and No. 26 in doubles.|$|E

500|$|... "She is able {{to shoot}} two balls from her {{crossbow}} one after another and make the second ball strike the first and break it in mid-air. Another trick she {{can do is to}} place a ball on the ground, and, by pulling the bow backwards <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> hand, while her right hand draws the bow from behind her back, hit it. Out of a hundred shots, she does not miss a single one.|$|E
500|$|Both {{sides of}} the florin were {{redesigned}} following the accession of Victoria's son, Edward VII, each design being created by the Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint, George William de Saulles. [...] The florin of King Edward VII was minted every year from 1902 to 1910. Its specifications remained at 11.3 grams weight and 28.5 millimetres diameter. The obverse shows the right-facing head of the King, inscribed ,, while the other side features what Coincraft's Standard Catalogue of English and UK Coins deems [...] "a most unusual and original reverse". [...] It shows a windswept figure of Britannia standing holding a shield <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> hand and a trident with her right, and inscribed , with the date below. [...] Peter Seaby, in his history of British coinage, described the figure of Britannia as [...] "standing on some mythical ancient ship which could hardly be sea-worthy under her weight", but [...] "a pleasing composition".|$|E

500|$|In the Vishnudharmottara Purana, Kubera is {{described}} {{as the embodiment of}} both Artha ("wealth, prosperity, glory") and Arthashastras, the treatises related to it—and his iconography mirrors it. Kubera's complexion {{is described}} as that of lotus leaves. He rides a man—the state personified, adorned in golden clothes and ornaments, symbolizing his wealth. His left eye is yellow. He wears an armour and a necklace down to his large belly. The Vishnudharmottara Purana further describes his face to be inclined to the left, sporting a beard and mustache, and with two small tusks protruding from the ends of his mouth, representing his powers to punish and to bestow favours. His wife Riddhi, representing the journey of life, is seated on his left lap, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> hand on the back of Kubera and the right holding a ratna-patra (jewel-pot). Kubera should be four-armed, holding a gada (mace: symbol of [...] dandaniti—administration of justice) and a shakti (power) in his left pair, and standards bearing a lion—representing Artha and a shibika (a club, the weapon of Kubera). The nidhi treasures Padma and Shankha stand beside him in human form, with their heads emerging from a lotus and a conch respectively.|$|E
500|$|The double-tiered, {{white marble}} {{fountain}} {{rests on a}} concrete base. [...] The upper basin of the fountain, which is approximately [...] high and [...] wide and weighs 15 tons, {{is supported by a}} 8-ton shaft adorned with three allegorical figures, the Arts of Ocean Navigation. [...] The figures, which are approximately [...] tall and [...] wide and weigh 12 tons, represent the Sea, the Stars and the Wind. [...] The Sea is represented by a female figure with long hair holding a boat in her right hand while caressing a seagull on her shoulder <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> hand. [...] Her left foot rests on a dolphin. [...] The Stars is a nude female figure with long hair holding a globe in her left hand and is faced downward.

2500|$|Hill and Benjamin {{also created}} a charity challenge, modeled after the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, known as [...] "Layup4Lauren".
