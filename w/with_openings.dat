5|$|Following the urgings of Superintendent George {{and various}} {{official}} enquiries, new workshops were built to provide increased useful employment for prisoners. The western workshops, located between the entry complex and the Female Division, were built from 1900–1901 of squared limestone rubble <b>with</b> <b>openings</b> dressed in brick. An open saw-tooth roof with southern skylights covered the five spaces {{designed for the}} five traditional workshops: tailors, bookbinders, shoemakers, mat makers and painters. The two northern shops were later amalgamated by removing the dividing wall.|$|E
5|$|Moore's {{signature}} form is a reclining figure. Moore's {{exploration of}} this form, {{under the influence}} of the Toltec-Mayan figure he had seen at the Louvre, was to lead him to increasing abstraction as he turned his thoughts towards experimentation with the elements of design. Moore's earlier reclining figures deal principally with mass, while his later ones contrast the solid elements of the sculpture with the space, not only round them but generally through them as he pierced the forms <b>with</b> <b>openings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers {{at the base of the}} wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall <b>with</b> <b>openings</b> that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{new steel}} section known as {{triangular}} web profile (TriWP) was studied by previous researcher to replaced flat web (FW) steel section for better resistance on bending behaviour. In {{order to reduce}} the weight of TriWP steel section for economic purposes opening on the web steel section is introduced. This paper described the study on the bending behaviour in major axis and mainly focus on the effect of opening on the TriWP, effect of the web thickness on triangular web profile <b>with</b> <b>opening</b> (TriWP <b>with</b> <b>opening)</b> steel section and effect of different type of opening shape on TriWP <b>with</b> <b>opening.</b> The TriWP <b>with</b> <b>opening</b> steel section <b>with</b> 200 × 100 × 6 × 3 mm size was analyze using finite element analysis. From finite element analysis it can be observed that the deflection on TriWP steel section is less compared to that TriWP <b>with</b> <b>opening</b> steel section. The different of deflection between TriWP <b>with</b> <b>opening</b> steel section and TriWP steel section is less than 1 mm. The deflection of the section based on manual calculation is 1. 292 mm which is less than 8. 33 mm, deflection limit of the section. Therefore TriWP <b>with</b> <b>opening</b> can resist and carry the same load as TriWP steel section can carry.

5|$|The outer bailey is {{the southernmost}} {{feature of the}} castle; it is {{pentagon}} shaped and there are five towers spaced along the wall, three of which are at corners. North of the outer bailey is the middle bailey which is an irregular polygon; like the outer bailey, {{the wall of the}} middle bailey is studded with towers. The towers allowed the garrison to provide enfilading fire. In the fashion of the time, most of the towers in the curtain walls of the middle and outer baileys were cylindrical. Château Gaillard {{was one of the first}} castles in Europe to use machicolations—stone projections on top of a wall <b>with</b> <b>openings</b> that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall. Machicolations were introduced to Western architecture as a result of the Crusades. Until the 13thcentury, the tops of towers in European castles had usually been surrounded by wooden galleries, which served the same purpose as machicolations. An Eastern innovation, they may have originated in the first half of the 8thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The prison's {{workshops}} provided {{activities and}} training for the prisoners. They also reduced the cost of maintenance, repairs, and construction by providing an in-house service. The original workshop was a blacksmith's shop, {{one of the first}} buildings to be constructed on the prison site. Later known as the East Workshops, other workshops included carpenter's, plumber's and painter's, a printing office, and from the 1850s, a metal shop. The West Workshops were built {{at the start of the}} twentieth century, providing more work for prisoners through a paint shop, mat maker, shoe maker, book binder and tailor shop. The five western workshops are a single storey squared limestone rubble building <b>with</b> <b>openings</b> dressed in brick, with an open saw-tooth roof with southern skylights, concealed behind a parapet wall. In 1993 the western workshops were adapted for use as TAFE art workshops.|$|E
5|$|They first {{prepared}} a cheval de frise to prevent British ships from sailing up the Hudson and outflanking the American position. For {{more than a}} month, the troops transported boulders from the heights of Manhattan {{to the edge of}} the river, where they loaded them into a collection of hulks and cribs made of timber and stretched it across the river. When the cheval de frise was finished, they began work on the fort. Little soil covered the rocky surface, so men had to haul soil up from the low ground. They were unable to dig the customary ditches or trenches around the fort. The fort was built in the shape of a pentagon with five bastions. The main walls were made of earth, constructed with ravelins <b>with</b> <b>openings</b> for guns from every angle. The fort enclosed a total of three to four acres. The troops built an abbattis around the fort. After the barracks were finished in September, all the troops in the area were placed under the command of Major General William Heath. Washington established his headquarters near the fort.|$|E

25|$|Some {{designs of}} dress shoes {{can be worn}} by either gender. The {{majority}} of dress shoes have an upper covering, commonly made of leather, enclosing most of the lower foot, but not covering the ankles. This {{upper part of the}} shoe is often made without apertures or openings, but may also be made <b>with</b> <b>openings</b> or even itself consist of a series of straps, e.g. an open toe featured in women's shoes. Shoes with uppers made high to cover the ankles are also available; a shoe with the upper rising above the ankle is usually considered a boot but certain styles may be referred to as high-topped shoes or high-tops. Usually, a high-topped shoe is secured by laces or zippers, although some styles have elastic inserts to ease slipping the shoe on.|$|E

25|$|Other body casts {{which were}} used in decades past to protect an injured spine {{or as part of}} the {{treatment}} for a spinal deformity (see scoliosis) which are rarely seen today include the Minerva cast and Risser cast. The Minerva cast includes the trunk of the body (sometimes extending down only so far as the rib cage) as well as the patient's head, <b>with</b> <b>openings</b> provided for the patient's face, ears, and usually {{the top of the head}} and hair. The Risser cast was similar, extending from the patient's hips to the neck and sometimes including part of the head. Both of these casts could, with care and the doctor's permission, be walked in during convalescence. However, in some cases the Risser cast would extend into one or more pantaloons, in which case mobility was far more restricted.|$|E
25|$|The {{available}} {{space for}} air and moisture in wood {{depends on the}} density and porosity of wood. Porosity is the volume fraction of void space in a solid. The porosity {{is reported to be}} 1.2 to 4.6% of dry volume of wood cell wall (Siau, 1984). On the other hand, permeability {{is a measure of the}} ease with which fluids are transported through a porous solid under the influence of some driving forces, e.g. capillary pressure gradient or moisture gradient. It is clear that solids must be porous to be permeable, but it does not necessarily follow that all porous bodies are permeable. Permeability can only exist if the void spaces are interconnected by openings. For example, a hardwood may be permeable because there is intervessel pitting <b>with</b> <b>openings</b> in the membranes (Keey et al., 2000). If these membranes are occluded or encrusted, or if the pits are aspirated, the wood assumes a closed-cell structure and may be virtually impermeable. The density is also important for impermeable hardwoods because more cell-wall material is traversed per unit distance, which offers increased resistance to diffusion (Keey et al., 2000). Hence lighter woods, in general, dry more rapidly than do the heavier woods. The transport of fluids is often bulk flow (momentum transfer) for permeable softwoods at high temperature while diffusion occurs for impermeable hardwoods (Siau, 1984). These mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E
500|$|Calostoma is a genus of 29 {{species of}} gasteroid fungi in the {{suborder}} Sclerodermatineae. Like other gasteroid fungi, Calostoma {{do not have}} the spore discharge mechanism associated with typical gilled fungi (ballistospory), and instead have enclosed spore-bearing structures. Resembling round, orange to red gelatinous puffballs on thick stalks, species have been collected in regions of deciduous, temperate, tropical or subtropical forests. They have a worldwide distribution, including eastern North America, Asia, and Australasia. The common name given to some species, [...] "prettymouth", alludes to the bright red fruit bodies <b>with</b> <b>openings</b> that may somewhat resemble lips.|$|E

500|$|Suillus brevipes is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Suillaceae. First {{described}} by American mycologists in the late 19th century, it {{is commonly known as}} the stubby-stalk or the short-stemmed slippery Jack. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) produced by the fungus are characterized by a chocolate to reddish-brown cap covered with a sticky layer of slime, and a short whitish stipe that does not have either a partial veil or prominent dark or colored glandular dots. The cap can reach a diameter of about , while the stipe is up to [...] long and [...] thick. Like other bolete mushrooms, S.brevipes produces spores in a vertically arranged layer of spongy tubes <b>with</b> <b>openings</b> that form a layer of small yellowish pores {{on the underside of the}} cap.|$|E
500|$|The Chicago Tribunes Pulitzer Prize-winning {{architecture}} critic Blair Kamin spoke glowingly of {{the pavilion}} upon its August 4, 2009, completion, describing it as [...] "a virtuoso display of structure, space and light" [...] with an [...] "arresting combination of naturalistic forms and alien shapes, plus a dazzling video installation". He notes that pavilion resembles a conch shell <b>with</b> <b>openings</b> like shark's mouths. By daylight the pavilion is enticing, but {{the use of}} sunlight limits the multimedia duality to dusk and until the park's closing, when the 7.5 minute video is able to be seen on the pavilion's inner surface. He felt that the pavilion succeeded in enticing the viewer to envision a better future for Chicago in a manner like Burnham did himself. [...] Kamin is very wary of the public's likelihood of damaging the pavilion. [...] His concerns were born out quickly as stanchions were required to curb human nature.|$|E
500|$|Native warriors {{primarily}} used arrows or darts with obsidian points. They {{also used}} spears and wooden swords edged with inset flakes of sharp stone (similar to the Aztec macuahuitl), stone-bladed knives, and slings. In response to Spanish incursions, native communities resorted to the fortification of their settlements with palisades and ditches. Palisades were built from rough courses of heavy wood, <b>with</b> <b>openings</b> for shooting arrows. They strengthened their fortifications with towers, {{and laid out}} camouflaged pits around the walls as a further defence. The construction of fortified settlements was not common in Honduras until after Spanish contact, although fortifications were known from contact with Maya groups to the west. In Honduras their construction was a specific response to Spanish incursions, and they were often built hastily. Fortifications at the Maya town of Ticamaya in the Ulúa valley were strong enough to frustrate several Spanish assaults. [...] The Spanish considered the Lenca fortress at the Peñol de Cerquín as formidable as any they had seen in Europe. When attacked in their fortified mountaintop strongholds, they would roll large boulders down the mountainside onto the attacking forces. When the natives {{became aware of the}} hostile intentions of the Spanish, they often abandoned their settlements and fled to inaccessible regions.|$|E
