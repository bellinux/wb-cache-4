25|$|There were {{conditions}} to who the CIA wanted to enlist, {{and they had}} specific uses that they <b>wanted</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Cubans that they brought aboard to the Cuban Opposition Front. They were supposed to restore the Cuban constitution that was made in 1940, they must be pro-Western and anti-Communist, they must be relatively politically neutral, {{and be able to}} gather other Cuban's support. Their purpose was summarized to three points, a beacon to attract other anti-Castro groups, a scapegoat in case covert operations were discovered, and to act as a potential replacement to Castro after his fall. As early as June 1960, there were 500 Cuban exiles being trained as paramilitary members in order to execute the Bay of Pigs, with some of those exiles being trained in Panama. This was due, partially, to the Soviet Union and its increasing amount of weaponry, along with a much larger influence of the Communist Party in Cuba.|$|E

[...] Amid contractual disputes with Klein, they formed their own record company, Rolling Stones Records. Sticky Fingers (UK No. 1; US No. 1), released in March 1971, the band's first album on their own label, featured an elaborate cover design by Andy Warhol. The cover of the album was anAndy Warhol photograph of a man in tight jeans (from the waist down) featuring a functioning zipper. When unzipped, it revealed the subject's underwear, imprinted with a saying – [...] "This Is Not Etc." [...] In some markets, an alternate cover was released due to the zippered cover's offensive nature at the time. The Stones' Decca catalogue is currently owned by Klein's ABKCO label.|$|E
