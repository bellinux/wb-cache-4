5|$|Greyhound racing was {{introduced}} to Belle Vue in 1926, in the UK's first purpose-built greyhound stadium, constructed {{at a cost of}} £22,000. It was built on land leased by Belle Vue to the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA), a company chaired by Sir William Gentle, who was also the chairman of Belle Vue (Manchester) Ltd. The site was sold to the GRA in 1937, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> it had to be used for greyhound racing.|$|E
5|$|In September 1916, Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT) {{received}} {{authorization to}} build two boats of the class, U-48 and U-49, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> the boats {{be built in}} Budapest with final assembly at the Pola Navy Yard. These first two boats, which comprised one-third of the six submarines under construction in 1916, were followed by orders for U-58 and U-59 before the war's end.|$|E
5|$|Leicester having {{returned}} to England, in February 1587 Elizabeth signed Mary's death warrant, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> it be not carried out until {{she gave her}} approval. As {{there was no sign}} of her doing so, Burghley, Leicester, and a handful of other privy councillors decided to proceed with Mary's execution in the interest of the state. Leicester went to Bath and Bristol for his health; unlike the other privy councillors involved, he escaped Elizabeth's severe wrath on hearing the news of Mary's death.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of Shafik's efforts women were granted {{the right to vote}} under the {{constitution}} of 1956, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso,</b> however, <b>that</b> they be literate, which was not a prerequisite for male voting.|$|R
5000|$|Started as the Assegaaibosch {{farmstead}} in 1790, it {{was subsequently}} altered substantially by its various occupants. In 1817 Lord Charles Somerset granted {{the land to}} Wouter Eduard Wium, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> special <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> he plant oak trees, and the area now includes many huge oaks.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, an {{organization}} called Artists Assistance Services rented out apartments in the Bretton Hall to people in <b>the</b> arts, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> unusual <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> {{they would have to}} share the use of <b>the</b> space <b>with</b> a [...] "cultural activity" [...] such as a karate class.|$|R
5|$|Apart from a {{short period}} doing {{contract}} surveying for the New Zealand Company in March 1849, Brunner remained unemployed and wrote numerous letters to his contacts. His former travelling companion, William Fox, and Dillon Bell, chief agent of the New Zealand Company, also sought to find him a job and through them, {{he was able to}} find work as a clerk with the Canterbury Association between September 1849 and February 1850. He returned to Nelson in May 1850 and secured full-time employment as a surveyor with the New Zealand Company, but <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> {{he would be able to}} take on private work which did not interfere with his duties. To supplement his income Brunner began to take on architectural commissions.|$|E
5|$|In 1613 James I {{returned}} the castle to Thomas Howard, the Earl of Suffolk, but the castle was now derelict and {{he chose to}} live at Audley End House instead. Thomas's son, Theophilus Howard, fell heavily into debt and sold the castle, the estate and the former Great Park to Sir Robert Hitcham in 1635 for £14,000; as with several other established parks, such as Eye, Kelsale and Hundon, the Great Park was broken up turned into separate estates. Hitcham died the following year, leaving the castle and the manor to Pembroke College in Cambridge, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> the college destroy the internal castle buildings and construct a poorhouse on the site instead, operating {{under the terms of}} the recently passed Poor Law.|$|E
5|$|Prince George's County {{officials}} {{continued to}} worry that cutbacks in federal funding for mass transit might lead to the cancellation of the four proposed stations (Southern Avenue, Naylor Road, Suitland, and Branch Avenue) in the county. Prince George's officials vetoed in July 1981 any further expenditure of Metro's construction funds unless Metro diverted $100 million from the Red Line extension in Montgomery County to Glenmont and began the immediate purchase of land and rights-of-way in Prince George's County. Metro agreed a month later to the plan, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> $90 million per year would be spent to begin work on the inner-city portion of the Green Line (the Gallery Place, Waterfront, and Navy Yard stations).|$|E

2500|$|In 1969, {{he asked}} {{permission}} of Reynolds and Werber, still his partners, to lease the group's name. They assented <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>provisos</b> <b>that</b> Shane assemble {{a group of}} comparable musical quality to the two original configurations and that [...] "New" [...] be appended to the name. Shane organized two troupes {{under the name of}} [...] "The New Kingston Trio." [...] The first consisted of guitarist Pat Horine and banjoist Jim Connor in addition to Shane and lasted from 1969 to 1973, the second including guitarist Roger Gambill and banjoist Bill Zorn from 1973 until 1976. Shane tried to create a repertoire for these groups that included both expected Kingston Trio standards like [...] "Tom Dooley" [...] and [...] "M.T.A." [...] but also more contemporary songs, including country and novelty tunes. The attempt did not meet with any significant success. Though both of these groups made a limited number of recordings and television appearances, neither generated very much interest from fans or the public at large.|$|R
5|$|The {{seat of the}} Prince of Monaco was {{established}} on the Rocher de Monaco (Illustration 5) as a fortress in 1191 when the harbour, that is today lined by Monte Carlo, was acquired by the Republic of Genoa. The harbour and its immediate area {{were given to the}} Genoese by the Emperor Henry IV <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> the Genoese protect the coastline from piracy. Further territory was ceded to the new owners by the Council of Peille and the Abbaye de Saint Pons. In 1215 work began on a new fortress, comprising four towers connected by ramparts protected by a curtain wall. This forms the core of the present palace.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1911, a year before he was due to leave the school, Heseltine had tired of life at Eton. Without a clear plan for his future, he asked his mother if he could live abroad for a while. His mother wanted {{him to go to}} university, and then either into the City or the Civil Service, but she agreed to his request <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> he would resume his {{education}} later. In October 1911 he proceeded to Cologne to learn German and to study piano at the conservatory. In Cologne Heseltine produced his first few songs which, like all his earliest works, were highly imitative of Delius. The piano studies went poorly, although Heseltine expanded his musical experiences by attending concerts and operas. He also experimented with general journalism, publishing an article in Railway and Travel Monthly on the subject of a disused Welsh branch line.|$|E
5|$|In 444 BC, the {{conservative}} {{and the democratic}} factions confronted {{each other in a}} fierce struggle. The ambitious new leader of {{the conservative}}s, Thucydides (not {{to be confused with the}} historian of the same name), accused Pericles of profligacy, criticizing the way he spent the money for the ongoing building plan. Thucydides initially managed to incite the passions of the ecclesia regarding these charges in his favor. However, when Pericles took the floor, his resolute arguments put Thucydides and the conservatives firmly on the defensive. Finally, Pericles proposed to reimburse the city for all questionable expenses from his private property, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> he would make the inscriptions of dedication in his own name. His stance was greeted with applause, and Thucydides was soundly, if unexpectedly, defeated. In 442BC, the Athenian public voted to ostracize Thucydides from the city for 10 years and Pericles was once again the unchallenged ruler of the Athenian political arena.|$|E
50|$|A {{field is}} a {{commutative}} ring {{in which there}} are no nontrivial proper ideals, so that any field is a Dedekind domain, however in a rather vacuous way. Some authors add the requirement that a Dedekind domain not be a field. Many more authors state theorems for Dedekind domains <b>with</b> <b>the</b> implicit <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> they may require trivial modifications for the case of fields.|$|R
50|$|Jokers are wild cards {{played the}} same way as jacks <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{additional}} <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> player names the suit to be followed thereafter, and the next player loses his/her turn and draws four cards (The jokers were introduced in 2015 and are based on the Wild Draw 4 cards from Uno)) If a joker is the turncard, it is returned to the drawing pack and another turned instead.|$|R
50|$|After {{difficult}} negotiations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Belgian government, Wiertz {{was able}} to realize his dream to turn his last studio into a museum for his works. The Belgian State bought {{a piece of land}} and funded the construction of a huge hall to accommodate the painter's monumental works. In exchange, Wiertz donated all his works to <b>the</b> Belgian State, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> express <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> they should remain in his studio both during and after his lifetime.|$|R
5|$|At Money in the Bank 2011, Randy Orton {{defended the}} World Heavyweight Championship against Christian. The storyline {{started on the}} May 6 episode of SmackDown when Orton {{defeated}} Christian to become the champion {{less than a week}} after Christian had won the title. At Capitol Punishment on June 19, Orton defeated Christian to retain the title despite illegally pinning Christian. On the June 24 episode of SmackDown, Christian demanded another attempt at the title from SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long; his demand was granted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> he could defeat Kane. Christian lost the match against Kane by disqualification after interference from Mark Henry. Long then made a tag team match for later that same episode, pitting the team of Christian and Henry against Kane and Orton with a similar stipulation; Henry pinned Orton in the bout. Afterward, Long offered Henry an attempt at the title if Henry could defeat Orton again. Henry lost the match after Christian engineered a distraction. This set up a match between Orton and Christian for the title at Money in the Bank. On the July 8 episode of SmackDown, Christian's lawyers in the storyline added a stipulation to the match that if Orton was disqualified or there were poor officiating, he would lose the title to Christian.|$|E
5|$|During his convalescence, he {{was visited}} by the General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters), Generalleutnant Adolf Galland, who offered Graf command {{of his old}} unit, JG52. Graf {{accepted}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> his Roten Jäger football team went with him. Once criticized for its low scoring rate early in the war, it was now the pre-eminent Geschwader, with over 10,000 victories. His return was celebrated with a welcome dinner at its headquarters in Kraków, southern Poland, on 20 September 1944. He was officially appointed on 1 October. Ongoing weakness in his left arm kept Graf on the ground. In {{the two years since}} he had left the Eastern Front, {{the quantity and quality of}} the Soviet pilots had greatly improved, as had their equipment. For the remainder of the war he oversaw his three separated fighter groups shuttled up and down the front, in emergency responses to each new Soviet offensive. Several times the crews had to evacuate as Soviet tanks and artillery were shelling their airfield. The German fuel crisis severely curtailed the amount of flight-time. Consequently, the November total for the wing of only 369 Soviet aircraft shot down was the lowest monthly total of the eastern campaign. As the winter weather got worse, the lull allowed Graf to organise a football match between his Roten Jäger and a local Kraków team, watched by 20,000 German soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22, 1810; it was debated whether the viceroy should {{continue}} in office, and if not, who should replace him. The first opinion was from Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, who held that Cisneros should continue and that, if all of Spain was conquered by France, peninsulars were meant to rule in the Americas. Castelli made a counter-argument, based on {{the doctrine of the}} retroversion of the sovereignty of the people that he had already employed in the defense of Paroissien. He insisted that {{in the absence of a}} legitimate authority, sovereignty should be returned to the people; they should govern themselves. The idea of dismissing the viceroy ultimately prevailed, but as Buenos Aires had no authority to decide unilaterally the new form of government, they would elect a provisional government. A congress of deputies called from all other cities would take the final decision. However, there were disputes over who should exercise the provisional government: some argued that the Cabildo should do so, and others that it should be a Junta. Castelli bowed to Saavedra's proposal to form a Junta, but <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> the procurator of the Cabildo, Julián de Leiva, had a decisive vote in the appointment. By adding this proviso, Castelli sought to add the former supporters of Martín de Álzaga, such as Mariano Moreno, Domingo Matheu, and Leiva himself.|$|E
5000|$|For Ken Wilber in Spectrum of Consciousness (1977), the Void is {{not mere}} nothingness, and is {{therefore}} distinct from {{something that can be}} subsumed into the category of nihilism, and is instead [...] "reality before we slice it up into conceptualism". Here he explores the idea of Sunyata, which cannot be [...] "called void or not void; or both or neither" [...] but can be referred to as 'the Void' <b>with,</b> again, <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> it exists beyond the limit of language.|$|R

25|$|A {{limited number}} of parishes in the Anglican Diocese of Toronto have been {{authorized}} to bless same-sex unions. Rather than crafting a specific rite of blessing, the Archbishop of Toronto issued guidelines setting rules and restrictions on blessings. Blessings must not resemble too closely a marriage rite, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> specific <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> no form of blessing used for marriage in the official rites of the Anglican Church of Canada or {{other parts of the}} Anglican Communion may be used with same-sex couples.|$|R
5|$|After {{the release}} of The Castle of Cagliostro, Miyazaki began working on his ideas for an {{animated}} film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book Rowlf and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights. Around that time, Miyazaki was also approached {{for a series of}} magazine articles by the editorial staff of Animage. During subsequent conversations, he showed his sketchbooks and discussed basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with editors Toshio Suzuki and Osamu Kameyama, who saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Two projects were proposed: , to be set in the Sengoku period; and the adaptation of Corben's Rowlf. Both were rejected, as the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga, and the rights for the adaptation of Rowlf could not be secured. An agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that</b> it would never be made into a film. The manga—titled Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind—ran from February 1982 to March 1994. The story, as re-printed in the tankōbon volumes, spans seven volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages. Miyazaki drew the episodes primarily in pencil, and it was printed monochrome in sepia toned ink. Miyazaki resigned from Telecom Animation Film in November 1982.|$|E
