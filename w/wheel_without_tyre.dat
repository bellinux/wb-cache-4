2500|$|The L21 {{originally}} had a fixed undercarriage with solid plywood <b>wheel</b> <b>without</b> <b>tyres,</b> like {{those on the}} L15, mounted on an axle which passed through the fuselage on rubber blocks. [...] To absorb vibrations when the engines were at full power for take-off, these wheels were then fitted [...] with tyres but the final undercarriage arrangement had rubber tyred, spoked wheels on a single, faired, rubber sprung axle held below the fuselage {{by a pair of}} very short V struts to the lower longerons on each side.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} {{motoring}} days when series production {{did not yet}} exist the process of acquiring a new vehicle needed two major decisions, selection of a vehicle manufacturer and selection of a coachbuilder. Already accustomed to ordering carriages from a coachbuilder, the buyer would select an automobile manufacturer which might supply their own catalogued bodies but which {{would be expected to}} provide primarily only a bare [...] "chassis". This [...] "chassis" [...] would be delivered by the manufacturer to the coachbuilder of the buyer's choice. The [...] "chassis" [...] would be a rolling chassis which included the chassis frame, drivetrain (engine, gearbox, differential, axles, wheels), brakes, suspension, complete steering system including the wheel, radiator, scuttle and dashboard. The manufacturer delivered the chassis with lighting system, spare <b>wheel(s)</b> (but probably <b>without</b> <b>tyres),</b> front and rear mudguards and (later) bumpers. The very easily damaged honeycomb radiator, later enclosed and protected by a shell, became the main visual element identifying the chassis' brand. The manufacturer retained an element of control over bodies. Bodies not approved by the chassis manufacturer would lose the chassis manufacturer's chassis warranties.|$|R
5000|$|Both engine {{capacities}} {{were offered}} {{on the first}} VB Commodores which appeared in 1978. The 253 version was not available in the VK Commodore range, released in 1984, but continued in Holden WB commercials until their cessation in late 1984. In 1985, the special editions modified by Holden and their official after-market tuner, Peter Brock's HDT Special Vehicles, began introducing the [...] version of the engine, created to slip underneath the 5,000 cc engine capacity cut-off in Group A touring car regulations, allowing Commodore competitors to run at a lower competition weight. This slight shrinking of the traditional Holden 308 saw the Group A Commodore's racing weight drop from 1400 to 1325 kg. Due to the complex Group A regulations, this also allowed the racing cars to run bigger <b>wheels</b> and <b>tyres</b> <b>without</b> any drop in power. Indeed, the VK Commodore SS Group A {{was one of the}} fastest cars in the world of Group A racing when it hit the tracks in 1986.|$|R

50|$|The two-wheel tractor is less {{manoeuvrable}} {{than the}} monowheel tractor, as two <b>wheels</b> <b>without</b> a differential cannot pivot around as well within a confined factory.
