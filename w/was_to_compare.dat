25|$|The Ives–Stilwell {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} by Herbert Ives and G.R. Stilwell first in 1938 and with better accuracy in 1941. It was designed to test the transverse Doppler effect – the redshift of light from a moving source in a direction perpendicular to its velocity—which had been predicted by Einstein in 1905. The strategy <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> observed Doppler shifts with what was predicted by classical theory, and look for a Lorentz factor correction. Such a correction was observed, from which was concluded that the frequency of a moving atomic clock is altered according to special relativity.|$|E
25|$|The OPERA {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} capture how neutrinos switch between different identities, but Autiero realized the equipment {{could be used to}} precisely measure neutrino speed too. An earlier result from the MINOS experiment at Fermilab demonstrated that the measurement was technically feasible. The principle of the OPERA neutrino velocity experiment <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> travel time of neutrinos against travel time of light. The neutrinos in the experiment emerged at CERN and flew to the OPERA detector. The researchers divided this distance by the speed of light in vacuum to predict what the neutrino travel time should be. They compared this expected value to the measured travel time.|$|E
25|$|A main aim of {{this study}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> if {{foodborne}} illness incidence had increased over time. In this study, similar methods of assessment were applied to data from circa 2000, which showed that the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis had not changed significantly over time. Two key estimates were the total number of gastroenteritis episodes each year, and the proportion considered foodborne. In circa 2010, it was estimated that 25% of all episodes of gastroenteritis were foodborne. By applying this proportion of episodes due to food to the incidence of gastroenteritis circa 2000, there were an estimated 4.3 million (90% CrI: 2.2–7.3 million) episodes of foodborne gastroenteritis circa 2000, although credible intervals overlap with 2010. Taking into account changes in population size, applying these equivalent methods suggests a 17% decrease in the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis between 2000 and 2010, with considerable overlap of the 90% credible intervals.|$|E

500|$|Light was {{associated}} with Mary and the Incarnation from the 9th century. Millard Meiss notes that, from the 12th century a common way to convey the conception <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> light passing through glass {{to the passage of}} the Holy Spirit through the body of the Virgin. St. Bernard likened it to sunshine explaining in this passage: [...] "Just as the brilliance of the sun fills and penetrates a glass window without damaging it, and pierces its solid form with imperceptible subtlety, neither hurting when entering nor destroying when emerging; thus the word of God, the splendor of the Father, entered the virgin chamber and then came forth from the closed womb." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{in-depth}} study of Mishneh Torah underwent a revival in Lithuanian Judaism {{in the late}} 19th century. The Lithuanians did not {{use it as a}} source book on practical halakha, as they followed the Ashkenazi authorities such as Moses Isserles and the Aruch ha-Shulchan. [...] Instead they used it as a guide to Talmudic interpretation and methodology. [...] Given the fact that the Mishneh Torah entirely omits these topics, this reading seems paradoxical and against the grain. [...] Their method <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the Talmudic source material with Maimonides' final decision, in order to reconstruct the rules of interpretation that must have been used to get from one to the other.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] (Die Niklashauser Fahrt), Fassbinder co-writes and co-directs with Michael Fengler. This avant-garde film, {{commissioned}} by the WDR television network, was shot in May 1970 and it was broadcast in October the same year.The Niklashausen Journey [...] was loosely based on the real-life of Hans Boehm, a shepherd who in 1476 claimed that the Virgin Mary called him to foment an uprising against the church and upper classes. Despite a temporary success, Boehm's followers were eventually massacred and he was burned at the stake. Fassbinder's intention was to show how and why revolutions fail. His approach <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the political and sexual turmoil of feudal Germany {{with that of the}} contraculture movement and the protests of 1968.

2500|$|Operation Prairie Flat {{was a test}} {{involving}} the detonation of a [...] spherical surface charge of TNT to evaluate airblast, ground shock and thermal effects of nuclear weapons. Since TNT charges produce roughly double the airburst effect of nuclear weapons, it allowed testing {{the equivalent of a}} [...] nuclear weapon surface burst. It was a continuation of the technical co-operation (Canada, United States, Great Britain) series of tests sponsored jointly by the respective governments. Similar to previous tests, a large number of projects were carried out simultaneously due to the infrequent opportunity and cost of large explosives tests – the United States alone conducted 39 projects. The resulting airblast also allowed testing various targets at a range of overpressures to verify how structures resist effects of nuclear weapons. These included troop field shelters, fiberglass manholes, foxhole overhead covers, blast valves and electrical generators. Debris fracturing and transport were also tested as part of the effort to understand nuclear blast effects on Nike-X anti-ballistic missile sites. An additional goal of the test <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the blast with the previous Distant Plain Event 6 that used an equivalent but smaller [...] configuration in order to study scaling factors.|$|E
2500|$|It {{took time}} for the Californian wine {{industry}} to recover from this setback. By the 1960s, California was primarily known for its sweet port-style wines made from Carignan and Thompson Seedless grapes. However {{a new wave of}} winemakers soon emerged and helped usher in a renaissance period in California wine with a focus on new winemaking technologies and emphasizing quality. Several well-known wineries were founded in this decade including Robert Mondavi, Heitz Wine Cellars and David Bruce Winery. As the quality of Californian wine improved, the region started to receive more international attention. A [...] moment for the industry occurred in 1976 when British wine merchant Steven Spurrier invited several Californian wineries to participate in a blind tasting event in Paris. It <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the best of California with the best of Bordeaux and Burgundy - two famous French wine regions. In an event known as The Judgment of Paris, Californian wines shocked the world by sweeping the wine competition in both the red and white wine categories. Throughout the wine world, perspectives about the potential of California wines started to change. The state's wine industry continued to grow as California {{emerged as one of the}} world's premier wine regions.|$|E
