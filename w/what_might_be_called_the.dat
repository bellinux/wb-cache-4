Beiderbecke [...] "lived very briefly [...] in <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> servants' entrance to art," [...] Ferguson wrote. [...] "His story is a good story, quite humble and right."

500|$|While {{a student}} at the University of Vienna in 1913-14, Moreno {{gathered}} a group of prostitutes as a way of discussing the social stigma and other problems they faced, starting <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> first [...] "support group". [...] From experiences like that, and as inspired by psychoanalysts such as Wilhelm Reich and Freud, Moreno began to develop psychodrama. After moving to the United States in 1925, Moreno introduced his work with psychodrama to American psychologists. [...] He began this work with children, and then eventually moved on to large group psychodrama sessions that he held at Impromptu Group Theatre at Carnegie Hall. These sessions established Moreno's name, not only in psychological circles, but also among non-psychologists. [...] Moreno continued to teach his method of psychodrama, leading sessions until his death in 1974.|$|E

2500|$|... "New materialism" [...] has {{now become}} its own {{specialized}} subfield of knowledge, with courses being offered on the topic at major universities, as well as numerous conferences, edited collections, and monographs devoted to it. Jane Bennett’s book Vibrant Matter (Duke UP, 2010) has been particularly instrumental in bringing theories of monist ontology and vitalism back into a critical theoretical fold dominated by poststructuralist theories of language and discourse. Scholars such as Mel Y. Chen and Zakiyyah Iman Jackson, however, have critiqued this body of new materialist literature for its neglect in considering the materiality of race and gender in particular. Other scholars such as Hélene Vosters have questioned whether there is anything particularly [...] "new" [...] about this so-called [...] "new materialism", as Indigenous and other animist ontologies have attested to <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> [...] "vibrancy of matter" [...] for centuries.|$|E
2500|$|... "Social thriller" [...] (often {{appearing}} in quotes) {{was being used}} {{as early as the}} 1970s to [...] retrospectively describe political neo-noir cinema. An early example comes from cinema writer Georges Sadoul's characterization of El Wahsh ("The Monster"), an Egyptian crime film entered into the 1954 Cannes Film Festival. Sadoul sums up the film as [...] "a social thriller based on an authentic police case about police pursuit of a drug-addicted gangster." [...] Sadoul goes on to describe the film's documentary style and backdrop of life in the Egyptian countryside. Other early uses of the term can be found in depictions of French New Wave films, such as The Nada Gang, Claude Chabrol's 1974 film Inspired by the May 1968 events in France. In their book, French Culture Since 1945, Malcolm and Martin Cook wrote that [...] "Chabrol's career has been almost exclusively devoted to <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> 'social thriller'—films using a suspense format often akin to that of Hitchcock to comment on the deviousness and duplicity of French society." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ships {{and boats}} have been {{included}} in art from almost the earliest times, but marine art only began to become a distinct genre, with specialized artists, {{towards the end of the}} Middle Ages, mostly in the form of the [...] "ship portrait" [...] a type of work that is still popular and concentrates on depicting a single vessel. [...] As landscape art emerged during the Renaissance, <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> marine landscape became a more important element in works, but pure seascapes were rare until later. [...] Marine painting was a major genre within Dutch Golden Age painting, reflecting the importance of overseas trade and naval power to the Dutch Republic, and saw the first career marine artists, who painted little else. [...] In this, as in much else, specialist and traditional marine painting has largely continued Dutch conventions to the present day. [...] With Romantic art, the sea and the coast was reclaimed from the specialists by many landscape painters, and works including no vessels became common for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|The use of Buddhist {{sources in}} reconstructing {{the life of}} Ashoka has had a strong {{influence}} on perceptions of Ashoka, {{as well as the}} interpretations of his Edicts. Building on traditional accounts, early scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the Buddhist monastic institution. Some scholars have tended to question this assessment. Romila Thappar writes about Ashoka that [...] "We need to see him both as a statesman in the context of inheriting and sustaining an empire in a particular historical period, and as a person with a strong commitment to changing society through <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> propagation of social ethics." [...] The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources are the Ashokan Edicts, and these do not explicitly state that Ashoka was a Buddhist. In his edicts, Ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time: Buddhism, Brahmanism, Jainism, and Ajivikaism, and his edicts addressed to the population at large (there are some addressed specifically to Buddhists; {{this is not the case}} for the other religions) generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept. For example, Amartya Sen writes, [...] "The Indian Emperor Ashoka in the third century BCE presented many political inscriptions in favor of tolerance and individual freedom, both as a part of state policy and in the relation of different people to each other".|$|E
2500|$|This {{is because}} Georgian has yet {{another level of}} split ergativity. In the aorist series, intransitive verbs behave differently. Second {{conjugation}} verbs behave as would normally be expected in an ergative language: the subject is declined in the least-marked case, the nominative case (terminologically equivalent in this instance to absolutive cases in other languages). Third conjugation verbs behave as if they belonged to an accusative system: the most-marked case (the ergative) marks the subject. The division between second and third conjugations is a convenient way to remember the difference, but in fact they both contain intransitive verbs, and as a whole the behaviour of these verbs follows an active alignment. In an active language, intranstive verbs are subdivided into two classes. The division is usually based on semantic criteria regarding {{the nature of the}} subject and the verb; for example, if the subject identifies an agent (an active or intentional performer of the action of the verb), then it might be marked with one case (e.g. the ergative), while if the subject identifies an experiencer of the event or one who does not actively initiate it, then it might be marked with another case (e.g. the absolutive or nominative). <b>What</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> [...] "most active" [...] case, then, marks the subject of a transitive verb, while the [...] "least active" [...] or [...] "most patientive" [...] case is that used to mark a direct object. This is precisely what happens in Georgian, in the restricted environment of the second or third conjugation verbs in the aorist series.|$|E
