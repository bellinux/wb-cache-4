25|$|On its creation, British Railways' assets {{included}} the narrow gauge Vale of Rheidol Railway in Ceredigion, Wales. Although {{built as a}} working railway, this line was by that time already principally a tourist asset. British Rail continued to operate the line, using steam locomotives, well beyond the <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>standard</b> gauge steam. The line's three steam locomotives became the only steam engines to receive TOPS serial numbers, and the only steam engines to be painted in BR Rail Blue livery and carry the double arrow logo. The Vale of Rheidol Railway was privatised in 1989 and continues to operate as a private heritage railway.|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of levetiracetam (LEV) with extended-release sodium valproate (VPA-ER) and controlled-release carbamazepine (CBZ-CR) as monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Methods This unblinded, randomised, 52 -week superiority trial (NCT 00175903) recruited patients (≥ 16  years of age) with ≥ 2 unprovoked seizures in the previous 2  years and ≥ 1 in the previous 6  months. The physician chose VPA or CBZ as preferred standard treatment; each patient was randomised to standard treatment or LEV. The primary outcome was time to treatment <b>withdrawal</b> (LEV vs <b>standard</b> antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)). Analyses also compared LEV with VPA-ER, and LEV with CBZ-CR.

40|$|Background. Quality {{indicators}} for colonoscopy have been developed, but the uptake of these metrics into practice is uncertain. Our aims were to assess physician perceptions regarding colonoscopy quality measurement and {{to quantify the}} perceived impact of quality measurement on clinical practice. Methods. We conducted in-person interviews with 15 gastroenterologists about their perceptions regarding colonoscopy quality. Results from these interviews informed {{the development of a}} 34 -question web-based survey that was emailed to 1, 500 randomlyselected members of the American College of Gastroenterology. Results. 160 invitations were undeliverable, and 167 out of 1340 invited physicians (12. 5 %) participated in the survey. Respondents and nonrespondents did not differ in age, sex, practice setting, or years since training. 38. 8 % of respondents receive feedback on their colonoscopy quality. The majority of respondents agreed with the use of completion rate (90 %) and adenoma detection rate (83 %) as quality indicators but there was less enthusiasm for withdrawal time (61 %). 24 % of respondents reported usually or always removing diminutive polyps solely to increase their adenoma detection rate, and 20 % reported prolonging their procedure time to meet <b>withdrawal</b> time <b>standards.</b> Conclusions. A minority of respondents receives feedback on the quality of their colonoscopy. Interventions to increase continuous quality improvement in colonoscopy screening are needed...|$|R
40|$|This review {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} potential usefulness of naloxone as a treatment option for opiate dependency. Naloxone {{has been used for}} years as an emergency room treatment for the management of opiate overdose. It has also been used to effect rapid opiate withdrawal, however its benefits have not been compares with those from <b>standard</b> <b>withdrawal</b> regimens. A combination of buprenorphine and naloxone has recently been used and {{has been shown to be}} effective as a maintenance treatment with the naloxone reducing the risk of buprenorphine misuse. The review suggests that the data on naloxone safety and its potential uses are limited, but that preliminary results suggest that it may be useful.

40|$|Background The {{standard}} way to {{stop smoking}} is to stop abruptly on a quit day with no prior reduction in consumption of cigarettes. Many smokers feel that reduction is natural and if reduction programmes were offered, many more might take up treatment. Few trials of reduction versus abrupt cessation have been completed. Most are small, do not use pharmacotherapy, and {{do not meet the}} standards necessary to obtain a marketing authorisation for a pharmacotherapy. Design/Methods We will conduct a non-inferiority randomised trial of rapid reduction versus standard abrupt cessation among smokers who want to stop smoking. In the reduction arm, participants will be advised to reduce smoking consumption by half in the first week and to 25 % of baseline in the second, leading up to a quit day at which participants will stop smoking completely. This will be assisted by nicotine patches and an acute form of nicotine replacement therapy. In the abrupt arm participants will use nicotine patches only, whilst smoking as normal, for two weeks prior to a quit day, at which they will also stop smoking completely. Smokers in either arm will have <b>standard</b> <b>withdrawal</b> orientated behavioural support programme with a combination of nicotine patches and acute nicotine replacement therapy post-cessation. Outcomes/Follow-up The primary outcome of interest will be prolonged abstinence from smoking, with secondary trial outcomes of point prevalence, urges to smoke and withdrawal symptoms.

40|$|Although {{detoxification}} cannot, in itself, {{be considered}} a treatment for addiction, {{it is one of}} the most pivotal phases. In order to facilitate entry into recovery and/or rehabilitation programs, a detoxification treatment has to be experienced as easy and safe by the patient. In consideration of the many inconveniences related to <b>standard</b> <b>withdrawal</b> treatments, there is an interest in developing alternative pharmacological strategies. The main rationales for using anticonvulsants in substance-abuse patients are their lack of addiction potential, evidence support a role of kindling mechanisms in withdrawal syndromes and their efficacy in comorbid psychiatric disorders. The available data currently support the utilization of carbamazepine as a treatment for detoxification from benzodiazepines, alcohol and opiates, and as a useful agent to reduce cocaine consumption. The use of valproate is well corroborated for alcohol detoxification and it seems to be a promising treatment for the reduction of cocaine use; however, it has been found to be ineffective against benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Some preliminary data suggest that lamotrigine could be useful in opiate and cocaine dependence. Gabapentin shows potential as a treatment for cocaine dependence, and some case reports have stimulated interest in this agent for alcohol and benzodiazepine detoxification. Due to its particular pharmacological profile, topiramate is one of the most interesting newer anticonvulsants. It has been found to be efficacious in opiate and possibly benzodiazepine detoxification and also has theoretical potential as a preventive therapy...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{investigated}} (1) {{a possible}} {{relationship between the}} functional activity of the endocannabinoid system and the facilitation of pain processing in migraineurs with medication-overuse headache, and (2) the effect of withdrawal treatment on both. BACKGROUND: The endocannabinoid system antinociception effect includes prevention of nociceptive pathways sensitization. The sensitization of the pain pathways has been demonstrated to be pivotal {{in the development and}} maintenance of chronic form of migraine, including medication-overuse headache. METHODS: We used the temporal summation threshold of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex to explore the spinal cord pain processing, and the platelet activity of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase to detect the functional state of the endocannabinoid system in 27 medication-overuse headache subjects before and 10 and 60 days after a <b>standard</b> <b>withdrawal</b> treatment and compared results with those of 14 controls. RESULTS: A significantly reduced temporal summation threshold and increased related pain sensation was found in subjects before withdrawal treatment when compared with controls. A significant fatty acid amide hydrolase activity reduction coupled with a significant improvement (reduction) in facilitation of spinal cord pain processing (increase in temporal summation threshold and reduction in related pain sensation) was found in medication-overuse headache subjects at both 10 and 60 days after withdrawal treatment when compared with medication-overuse headache subjects before withdrawal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a marked facilitation in spinal cord pain processing in medication-overuse headache before withdrawal treatment when compared with controls. Furthermore, the acute reduction of the fatty acid amide hydrolase activity coupled with a reduction of the facilitation in pain processing immediately (10 days) after withdrawal treatment and its persistence 60 days after withdrawal treatment could represent the consequence of a mechanism devoted to acutely reduce the degradation of endocannabinoids and aimed to increase the activity of the endocannabinoid system that results in an antinociceptive effect...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop an {{evidence-based}} approach to the post-marketing withdrawal of medicinal products when harms are attributed to their use. Methods: Electronic and non-electronic searches were conducted to identify medicinal products withdrawn from the market because of adverse reactions. Data relating to the time periods between launch, first adverse reaction reports and withdrawals, the mechanism through which the adverse reactions occurred, and the countries of <b>withdrawal</b> were extracted. <b>Standard</b> criteria were used to document the levels of evidence used by drug regulators to make the withdrawal decisions; scatter plots and two-by-two tables used to explore the trends over time. A previously published algorithm {{was used to examine}} the justification for withdrawals. To examine the benefits and harms of medicinal products before regulatory approval, searches were conducted on drug regulatory websites and scientific databases. The Cochrane criterion was used to examine the risk of bias, Review Manager Software for meta-analysis, and GRADE criterion to rate the quality of evidence. Results: Improvements in pharmacovigilance over the past six decades have resulted in quicker detection of harms caused by approved medicinal products; however, there have not been corresponding improvements in how quickly harmful products are withdrawn from the market following the reports of harms. Harmful drugs are significantly less likely to be withdrawn in low resource settings. The quality of evidence in drug trials for which regulatory approval decisions are based is on the whole, poor. There is a lack of consistency in the methods used by drug regulators to assess the harms of medicinal products before granting marketing licences. Conclusions: Universally accepted guidelines for deciding when to withdraw approved medicinal products from the market should be developed. Pharmacovigilance systems in low-resource settings should be strengthened. The methods used to assess harms in clinical trials require improvement. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background and aim: The {{usefulness}} of high definition colonoscopy plus i-scan (HD+i-SCAN) for average-risk colorectal cancer screening {{has not been}} fully assessed. The detection rate of adenomas and other measurements such {{as the number of}} adenomas per colonoscopy and the flat adenoma detection rate have been recognized as markers of colonoscopy quality. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the diagnostic performance of an HD+i-SCAN with that of standard resolution white-light colonoscope. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected screening colonoscopy database. A comparative analysis of the diagnostic yield of an HD+i-SCAN or standard resolution colonoscopy for average-risk colorectal screening was conducted. Results: During the period of study, 155 / 163 (95. 1 %) patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 56. 9 years. Sixty of 155 (39 %) colonoscopies were performed using a HD+i-SCAN. Adenoma-detection-rates during the <b>withdrawal</b> of the <b>standard</b> resolution versus HD+i-SCAN colonoscopies were 29. 5 % and 30 % (p = n. s.). Adenoma/colonoscopy values for standard resolution versus HD+i-SCAN colonoscopies were 0. 46 (SD = 0. 9) and 0. 72 (SD = 1. 3) (p = n. s.). A greater number of flat adenomas were detected in the HD+i-SCAN group (6 / 60 vs. 2 / 95) (p <. 05). Likewise, serrated adenomas/polyps per colonoscopy were also higher in the HD+i-SCAN group. Conclusions: A HD+i-SCAN colonoscopy increases the flat adenoma detection rate and serrated adenomas/polyps per colonoscopy compared to a standard colonoscopy in average-risk screening population. HD+i-SCAN is a simple, available procedure that can be helpful, even for experienced providers. The performance of HD+i-SCAN and substantial prevalence of flat lesions in our average-risk screening cohort support its usefulness in improving the efficacy of screening colonoscopies...|$|R
40|$|Androgen <b>withdrawal</b> is the <b>standard</b> {{treatment}} for advanced prostate cancer. Although this therapy is initially effective, nearly all prostate cancers become refractory to it. Approximately 15 % of these castration-resistant prostate cancers harbour a genomic amplification at 10 q 22. The {{aim of this}} study was to explore the structure of the 10 q 22 amplicon and to determine the major driving genes. Application of high-resolution array-CGH using the 244 k Agilent microarrays to cell lines with 10 q 22 amplification allowed us to narrow down the common amplified region to a region of 5. 8 megabases. We silenced each of the genes of this region by an RNAi screen in the prostate cancer cell lines PC- 3 and 22 Rv 1. We selected genes with a significant growth reduction in the 10 q 22 amplified cell line PC- 3, but not in the non-amplified 22 Rv 1 cells, as putative target genes of this amplicon. Immunohistochemical analysis of the protein expression of these candidate genes on a tissue microarray enriched for 10 q 22 amplified prostate cancers revealed vinculin as the most promising target of this amplicon. We found a strong association between vinculin gene amplification and overexpression (p > 0. 001). Further analysis of 443 specimens from across all stages of prostate cancer progression showed that vinculin expression was highest in castration-resistant prostate cancers, but negative or very low in benign prostatic hyperplasia (p > 0. 0001). Additionally, high tumour cell proliferation measured by Ki 67 expression was significantly associated with high vinculin expression in prostate cancer (p > 0. 0001). Our data suggest that vinculin is a major driving gene of the 10 q 22 amplification in prostate cancer and that vinculin overexpression might contribute to prostate cancer progression by enhancing tumour cell proliferation...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this casebook, like others in the Ius Commune Series, is to help uncover common roots, notwithstanding differences in approach, of the European legal systems, {{with a view to}} strengthening the common legal heritage of Europe. It covers the big legal families in the EU and contains judgments from the supreme courts and other courts of the Member States. In view of the importance of EC legislation (eg harmonisation directives and regulations) in this field, the consumer law casebook contains much material derived from Community law, such as extracts from directives (eg on unfair contract terms, distance selling, doorstep selling, product liability, unfair commercial pratices etc) and judgments of the ECJ and national court decisions. Furthermore, attention is paid to the way in which, when interpreting EC directives in the consumer field, the ECJ refers to concepts common to the legal systems of the Member States and how the courts of the Member States incorporate the concepts found in the directives (as interpreted by the ECJ) in their legal systems. The casebook also compares harmonised and pre-harmonised law, especially in the case law of the Member States. It concentrates on private law in the field of consumer protection but also addresses topics, in particular in the field of enforcement, that are primarily a matter of public law.
