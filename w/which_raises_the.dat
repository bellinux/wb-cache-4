5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil <b>which</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> problem that, if an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God exists, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil in the world would make the existence of God improbable. The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. Heat is {{constantly}} lost from the body. Food products reach {{the heart and}} are processed into new blood, releasing fire during metabolism, <b>which</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> blood temperature too high. That raises the heart temperature, causing lung volume to increase, in turn raising the airflow at the mouth. The cool air brought in through the mouth reduces the heart temperature, so the lung volume accordingly decreases, restoring the temperature to normal.|$|E
5|$|A common {{criticism}} {{of the game is}} its short length. Episode One takes roughly 4–6 hours to complete, <b>which</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> issue of whether the game justifies its price. Computer Games Magazine argued the futility of reviewing the game due to its episodic nature; as the first part of a three-part story arc, it is difficult to judge it when divorced from the final product. Game Revolution expressed disappointment at a lack of new features such as environments and weapons.|$|E

5|$|The Augustinian theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil, <b>which</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> concern that if God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into question God's nature or his existence– he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does not exist. Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence. The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world ex nihilo (out of nothing), but maintains that God did not create evil and is not responsible for its occurrence. Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the privation of good– the corruption of God's good creation.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{vehicles}} are themed {{to look like}} cars from a classic dark ride, and like the previous Back to the Future attraction, the vehicles feature fake wheels and gull-wing doors. Each dome features 12 8-passenger ride vehicles arranged with 3 cars on the first level, 5 on the second and 4 on the third. Each vehicle is mounted on a motion platform atop a scissor lift, <b>which</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> vehicle 9 feet into the dome. The motion platforms are capable of a total motion of three feet. In addition to the motion-based ride vehicles, riders also feel water effects, smoke, mist, and experience lighting effects and scents. As of 2017, the smoke and water effects only work on a few vehicles at the Florida location.|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} into {{the reconstruction of the}} consonants of Middle Mongol has engendered several controversies. Middle Mongol had two series of plosives, but there is disagreement as to which phonological dimension they lie on, whether aspiration or voicing. The early scripts have distinct letters for velar plosives and uvular plosives, but as these are in complementary distribution according to vowel harmony class, only two back plosive phonemes, */k/, * (~ *, *) are to be reconstructed. One prominent long running disagreement concerns certain correspondences of word medial consonants among the four major scripts (UM, SM, AM, and Ph, which were discussed in the preceding section). Word medial /k/ of Uyghur Mongolian (UM) has, not one, but two correspondences with the three other scripts: either /k/ or zero. Traditional scholarship has reconstructed */k/ for both correspondences, arguing that */k/ got lost in some instances, <b>which</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> question of what the conditioning factors of those instances were. More recently, the other obvious possibility has been assumed, namely that the correspondence between UM /k/ and zero in the other scripts points to a distinct phoneme, /h/, which would correspond to the word-initial phoneme /h/ that is present in those other scripts. /h/ (sometimes also called /x/) is sometimes assumed to derive from *, which would also explain zero in SM, AM, Ph in some instances where UM indicates /p/, e.g. debel > Khalkha deel.|$|E

25|$|According {{to the law}} of {{conservation}} of energy, no energy is destroyed due to friction, though it may be lost to the system of concern. Energy is transformed from other forms into thermal energy. A sliding hockey puck comes to rest because friction converts its kinetic energy into heat <b>which</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> thermal energy of the puck and the ice surface. Since heat quickly dissipates, many early philosophers, including Aristotle, wrongly concluded that moving objects lose energy without a driving force.|$|E

25|$|Advocates {{of unions}} {{claim that the}} higher wages that unions demand can be paid for through company profits. However, as Milton Friedman pointed out, profits are only very rarely high enough. 80% of {{national}} income is wages, and only about 6% is profits after tax, providing very little room for higher wages, even if profits could be totally used up. Moreover, profits are invested leading {{to an increase in}} capital: <b>which</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> value of labor, increasing wages. If profits were totally removed, this source of wage increase would be removed.|$|E

25|$|The {{absorption}} {{cycle is}} similar to the compression cycle, except for the method of raising the pressure of the refrigerant vapor. In the absorption system, the compressor is replaced by an absorber which dissolves the refrigerant in a suitable liquid, a liquid pump <b>which</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> pressure and a generator which, on heat addition, drives off the refrigerant vapor from the high-pressure liquid. Some work is needed by the liquid pump but, for a given quantity of refrigerant, it is much smaller than needed by the compressor in the vapor compression cycle. In an absorption refrigerator, a suitable combination of refrigerant and absorbent is used. The most common combinations are ammonia (refrigerant) with water (absorbent), and water (refrigerant) with lithium bromide (absorbent).|$|E
25|$|Given the {{disagreements}} {{about the}} structure of the insect head, on which most effort has been spent, {{it is no surprise that}} the potential homologies between it and other arthropods, notably the chelicerates, are also very controversial. From after the second world war to the 1980s a commonly accepted model of arthropod evolution was that the extant euarthropods were polyphyletic, i.e. the main lineages had evolved independently from soft-bodied, annelid-like ancestors, following the work of Tiegs and especially Sidnie Manton. In this view, most of the head structures would also be convergent, and thus there was no point looking for specific homologies between major groups. However, the monophyletic theory of arthropod origins has since decisively gained the upper hand, <b>which</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> problem of head homology once more.|$|E
25|$|More {{rarely a}} {{defect in the}} magnet can cause a quench. When this happens, that {{particular}} spot is subject to rapid Joule heating from the enormous current, <b>which</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> temperature of the surrounding regions. This pushes those regions into the normal state as well, which leads to more heating in a chain reaction. The entire magnet rapidly becomes normal (this can take several seconds, {{depending on the size}} of the superconducting coil). This is accompanied by a loud bang as the energy in the magnetic field is converted to heat, and rapid boil-off of the cryogenic fluid. The abrupt decrease of current can result in kilovolt inductive voltage spikes and arcing. Permanent damage to the magnet is rare, but components can be damaged by localized heating, high voltages, or large mechanical forces.|$|E

25|$|Former Minister for Social Affairs Mr Othman Wok in his {{autobiography}} mentioned {{that he had come}} to know from one of the reporters from the Utsan Melayu that the latter had already known about the potential riots even before the outbreak of the riots <b>which</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> suspicions of the UNMO leaders of orchestrating this riot. Othman also makes references to some key important political meetings which took place among the Malay community in Singapore the politicians in Singapore to express their grievances. Accounts from the meetings prove that the Malays in Singapore had no major grievances and that UMNO’s Secretary-General Syed Ja’afar was responsible for instigating them. Some of the matters brought up by the Malay community included infrastructural issues that Malay schools faced and these issues were contrary to what the UMNO and Utusan Melayu had portrayed.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{material}} launched need not be delivered to its eventual orbit immediately, <b>which</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> possibility that high efficiency (but slower) engines could move SPS material from LEO to GEO at an acceptable cost. Examples include ion thrusters or nuclear propulsion. Power beaming from geostationary orbit by microwaves carries the difficulty that the required 'optical aperture' sizes are very large. For example, the 1978 NASA SPS study required a 1-km diameter transmitting antenna, and a 10km diameter receiving rectenna, for a microwave beam at 2.45GHz. These sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths, although they have increased atmospheric absorption and even potential beam blockage by rain or water droplets. Because of the thinned array curse, {{it is not possible}} to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites. The large size of the transmitting and receiving antennas means that the minimum practical power level for an SPS will necessarily be high; small SPS systems will be possible, but uneconomic.|$|E
