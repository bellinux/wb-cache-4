In the present <b>work,</b> <b>slip</b> casting colloidal process, {{which is used to}} fabricate high performance structural ceramics, has been introduced into the preparation for magnesia-carbon refractory with selection of suitable dispersant. The results indicated that the curve of zeta-potential of magnesia was similar with that of carbon just containing dispersant and the homogenized mixtures were attained under a controlling of low pH value. Three kinds of preparing routes for green bodies were designed, and all of the final densities and the resultant hardness of sintered bodies using colloidal process were superior to these of the specimen using conventional dry pressing, whereas its high green density can be plausibly observed in dry pressing body because of high compaction pressure used...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the rate of}} occurrence of accidents and their causes in mining and quarry sites in East Coast Malaysia. There are two methods {{that were used in}} this study. The secondary data technique was used by gathering all accident reports from Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) in East Coast Malaysia, and Social Security Organization (SOCSO), Malaysia. The data was used to identify the causes, while the method to identify the rate of accident occurrences is questionnaires. Descriptive tools of statistics such as frequency, percentage and mean were used for the analysis. The study reveals that accidents occur at a low rate at the mining and quarry sites in Malaysia. Different causes of accident were identified such as flying objects or debris, untidy sites, failure of vehicles, pinched while performing <b>work,</b> <b>slip</b> and trip at work areas, faulty equipment and machinery, negligence of workers or operator’s errors, work at sharp edges, and fall from height.

40|$|Can {{there be}} a general {{theoretical}} perspective on civil society 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in transitional justice? This article considers this question in its application to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Within the study of transitional justice and conflict resolution, civil society - a notoriously plastic concept - can be understood narrowly as rights-oriented groups working “for” peace, but the term is equally available to describe a broader array of communities that can either promote or prevent peace and justice. It is, in fact, quite difficult to sustain a theoretical distinction between them, because transitional justice does not escape the dictates of politics - of differing human desires expressed through power. Efforts to memorialise imply conflict over the particular memories to be privileged; claims for reparations are not only demands for justice, but for material redistribution that in turn may promote conflict. A narrow view of civil society problematically assumes we even know - let alone agree on - what constitutes positive change. In {{the context of the}} Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that is a fraught proposition. Both an accurate definition of civil society and the valence of justice <b>work</b> <b>slip</b> beyond the narrow confines of the received model 2 ̆ 7 s assumptions: both Jewish and Palestinian groups mobilise a spectrum of resources from political engagement, to overseas support, to violent self-help. On both sides, civil society groups are instrumentalised to advance not an agenda of peace or justice in some abstract sense but a parochial claim that, seen from the other side, is, in fact, an obstacle to resolution. Indeed, there may be no peace or justice initiatives that can be analytically separated from efforts the purpose and effect of which is the very opposite of our conventional understanding of the field. The range from vocal activism to violent action, the spectrum of activation, commitment and radicalism, must be understood as fraught but connected and unbroken - as, at most, a kind of punctuated continuum. The real work performed by civil society in promoting agendas of peace and justice cannot properly be understood without locating it in a defensible theoretical and empirical framework. Imagining a narrow civil society risks skewing our analysis ofwhat civil society can do and actually does in relation to conflict. Civil society can clear the path to peace, or can provide the principal obstacles to it - it can simultaneously do both. In this it very much shares the ambiguous, multivalent profile of its classic counterpart: politics in the public sphere...|$|E

40|$|This {{book review}} {{critically}} examines a recent work by Robert Shiller, {{one of the}} world 2 ̆ 7 s leading economists. Shiller’s Finance and the Good Society reflects on contemporary financial institutions and offers principles for incrementally improving them. It fails to recognize the possibility that finance needs more than cosmetic reform. The field of law and economics often brings the insights of behavioral economists like Shiller to current regulatory debates. This review takes the reverse approach, offering a lawyer’s perspective on Shiller’s theories. We can only hope to reform the finance sector by addressing power dynamics among boards, CEOs, traders, and investors. To the extent it fails to address how law contributes to these power dynamics, Shiller’s <b>work</b> <b>slips</b> into an unconvincing idealism...|$|R

40|$|Introduction This {{position}} paper reflects {{my desire to}} capitalize on the excellent work done by others in the area of operating systems research. The best {{way to do this is}} by sharing source code so that others can directly evaluate work that is reported in the literature. This approach would address the problem that technical papers about software rarely explain all the details required for others to reimplement the work. Overall descriptions are given, performance results are presented, and an occasional interface is defined. This is all done in an ad-hoc, non-machine-readable way, so the <b>work</b> <b>slips</b> by and others reinvent out of necessity. In reality, software is defined by the code itself, and this is rarely distributed or studied in its own right. The wide success of UNIX, for example, was largely due to the distribution of the source code so that others could modify and enhance the original work. The drawback of the UNIX sources is that they are encumbered by license...|$|R

There was also a high probability a device would fail intermittently, which meant the computations had to be performed multiple times and the results compared in order to assure the results were correct.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to develop a {{calculation}} method for slipping parameters of friction clutches (of the <b>slipping</b> <b>work</b> and time) in tractor gearboxes at various gear overlaps and for different friction clutches installation on the shafts. The work has used theoretical and experimental research methods: the former were based on methods of analytical mechanics and motion theory of wheeled and tracked vehicles, while the latter assumed testing full-sized prototypes of friction clutches and friction clutches in gearboxes. The work has brought the following results: a universal acceleration diagram has been offered for a tractor unit at shifting gears with different overlaps, valid for any relation between the gearing time and friction clutch slipping; based on the mathematical models of acceleration of the tractor unit, we have developed a generalized calculation method for parameters of the friction clutch slipping (of the <b>slipping</b> <b>work</b> and time), when shifting gears with different overlaps, at starting off a tractor unit and at bench tests of friction clutches and friction clutches in gearboxes. The scientific novelty {{of the work is}} in development of the following: - A theoretical acceleration diagram of a tractor unit with gear shifting in the gearbox with different overlaps; - A mathematical acceleration model of a tractor unit and friction clutch slipping in the gearbox at gear shifting with different overlaps, and when starting a tractor unit off; - A generalized calculation method for parameters of the friction clutch slipping (of the <b>slipping</b> <b>work</b> and time), when shifting gears in the gearbox with different overlaps, when starting a tractor unit off and at bench tests of friction clutches and friction clutches in the gearbox. Conclusions: The developed universal acceleration mathematical model for a tractor unit at gear shifting in the gearbox with different overlaps, and of its acceleration at starting off, allows defining – at the designing stage of gearboxes with friction clutches – their <b>work</b> and <b>slipping</b> time, and the acceleration time of a tractor unit, which may lead to designing reliable friction clutches and gearboxes with friction clutches. The proposed calculation method of the work of the friction clutch slipping in the gearbox at bench tests allows transferring test results into the operation loading mode, and, therefore, to perform fine-tuning of gearboxes with friction clutches at bench tests. </p...|$|R
