40|$|AbstractIslamic {{banking and}} finance are {{areas that have}} {{attracted}} attention, especially after the recent global financial crisis. While the existing literature highlights a significant shift in consumers’ behaviour with regard to bank selection, it does not investigate the motives behind such moves. Understanding customers’ preferences to deposit their money into Islamic banks are crucial for banks operating in such a highly competitive industry. Having {{a good understanding of}} the real motives behind customers’ preferences will help banks to understand customers better. Besides, improving the bank's liquidity issues, it contributes to the growth of the country's economy. Thus, this paper explores the findings from a qualitative data through a face to face interview on factors influencing customers’ preferences for deposit products in Islamic banks. These results will eventually be used for developing a survey questionnaire for future empirical research. The face-to-face interview revealed that sharia compliance, returns, confidence and trust, security, transparency, flexibility of <b>withdrawal</b> <b>scheme</b> were among the determining factors that influence customers’ preferences in making decisions.

A total of 131 patients (out of a cohort including 844 patients) from 7 academic and 14 regional centres in the Netherlands were identified in whom treatment was tapered after at least 2 years of clinical and biochemical remission. Relapse was defined as alanine-aminotransferase levels (ALT) three times above the upper limit of normal and loss of remission as a rising ALT necessitating the reinstitution of drug treatment. During follow-up, 61 (47 %) patients relapsed and 56 (42 %) had a loss of remission. In these 117 patients, 60 patients had fully discontinued medication whereas 57 patients were still on a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>scheme.</b> One year after drug withdrawal, 59 % of the patients required retreatment, increasing to 73 % and 81 % after 2 and 3 years, respectively.

40|$|Human {{alteration}} {{of the land}} surface hydrologic cycle is substantial. Recent studies suggest that local water management practices including groundwater pumping and irrigation could significantly alter the quantity and distribution {{of water in the}} terrestrial system, with potential impacts on weather and climate through land atmosphere feedbacks. In this study, the authors incorporated a groundwater <b>withdrawal</b> <b>scheme</b> into the Community Land Model, version 4 (CLM 4). To simulate the impact of irrigation realistically, they calibrated the CLM 4 simulated irrigation amount against observations from agriculture censuses at the county scale over the conterminous United States. The water used for irrigation was then removed from the surface runoff and groundwater aquifer according to a ratio determined from the county-level agricultural census data. On the basis of the simulations, the impact of groundwater withdrawals for irrigation on land surface and subsurface fluxes were investigated. The results suggest that the impacts of irrigation on latent heat flux and potential recharge when water is withdrawn from surface water alone or from both surface and groundwater are comparable and local to the irrigation areas. However, when water is withdrawn from groundwater for irrigation, greater effects on the subsurface water balance are found, leading to significant depletion of groundwater storage in regions with low recharge rate and high groundwater exploitation rate. The results underscore the importance of local hydrologic feedbacks in governing hydrologic response to anthropogenic change in CLM 4 and the need to more realistically simulate the two-way interactions among surface water, groundwater, and atmosphere to better understand the impacts of groundwater pumping on irrigation efficiency and climate...|$|E

40|$|The study {{intends to}} measure the contributors’ {{response}} from the initiative launched by EPF that permits the hajj registration through savings in EPF. The study incorporates questionnaire 5 Likert scale format which distributed to 350 EPF contributors within the Klang Valley region of which 174 were filled and returned. It is consistent with Roscoe (1975) who suggests to have a sample sizes of larger than 30 and less than 500 to minimize committing Type II errors. Klang Valley was chosen due to availability of significant white collar workers which displays a significant presence of middle and high income families which associates with private sector workers since they are the main contributors’ for EPF. All variables display meaningful relationship with each other but {{as shown in the}} regression analysis, the main variable that really influences one’s attitude towards the hajj <b>withdrawal</b> <b>scheme</b> is the perceived convenience of the program itself. The contradictory issue in this study is on the permission of hajj registration itself; whereby the permission is only for registration and not to the extent of withdrawal the money for the hajj except if the contributor has reached the age of 55. In other word, the authors view it as a non holistic approach. The findings are useful for the EPF to enhance its initiative by allowing physical withdrawal of money from the account 1 once the depositor gets the hajj call-up even though the person has not meet the age of 55. The limitation of the study can arise from the demographic influence pertinent to other areas in the country.

Anthropogenic pressures twinned with drought impacts have exacerbated water management challenges. This article assesses the cumulative consequences of upstream anthropogenic pressures and drought spells on temporal river flow regimes for the downstream country. The size and complexity of problems confronting transboundary river watersheds makes it necessary to use a representative example basin to study the problems and potential solutions. The Diyala (Sīrvān) river basin, which shares dozens of transboundary watersheds between Iraq and Iran, has been selected as a representative case study. A subset of the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) was utilised and climate variability was considered in assessing the combined effect of various forms of upstream human-river regulations and climatic conditions on natural flow regimes in the downstream state. Findings indicated that the anthropogenic river-regulation coupled {{with the impact of}} drought periods have noticeably modified the natural flow paradigm. The yearly average runoffs, which are no longer available for the downstream country, have soared to very high levels, particularly over the last fifteen years. More adverse impacts were detected in the non-rainy season. Findings reveal also that damming and considerable water diversion to large-scale irrigation projects in the upstream state are the main regulations affecting the management of shared water resources in the downstream country...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of variable labor supply raises some fundamental issues {{in analyzing the}} targeting of poverty alleviation programs in developing countries.

40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} {{the significance of}} induction with high doses of pegylated interferon α- 2 b (Peg-IFNα- 2 b) and the predictability of sustained virologic response (SVR) in naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. Methods. 188 consecutive naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C were enrolled in a randomised controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomised to receive either Peg-IFNα- 2 b 3. 0 mcg/kg QW x 12 weeks followed by 1. 5 mcg/kg QW x 36 weeks plus 800 - 1200 mg ribavirin (Arm A) or Peg-IFNα- 2 b 1. 5 mcg/kg QW x 48 weeks plus 800 - 1200 mg ribavirin (Arm B). HCV-RNA was obtained at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48 and 72 weeks. Differences between schemes were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier curves. Predictability of SVR was assessed by two-way contingency table analysis and ROC curve analysis. Results. From 176 patients, 75 had genotype 1, 15 genotype 2, 75 genotype 3 and 11 genotype 4. No statistical significance emerged in HCV-RNA positivity, side effects and <b>withdrawals</b> between <b>schemes.</b> Patients with genotype 1 achieved lower SVR (46. 6 %) in comparison to patients with genotypes 2 / 3 (94. 1 %, p< 0. 001) and 4 (90. 9 %, p= 0. 002). The most appropriate time for estimation of SVR for genotype 1 is week 8 (accuracy= 0. 84, AUC= 0. 90) while predictability increases with time in genotypes 2 / 3, reaching maximum accuracy= 0. 93 and AUC= 0. 76 at week 16. Conclusion. Induction with high doses of Peg-IFNα- 2 b does not preclude better outcome and rapid virologic response at 4 weeks of treatment sufficiently predicts SVR.

30|$|Therefore given Ethiopia’s non-accession status, {{international}} trade regimes {{have implications for}} China-Ethiopia trade. China {{being one of the}} dominant trading partner of the WTO and Ethiopia an aspiring least developing countries (LDC) it largely depends on bilateral agreements, sometimes enjoys quota- and duty free access to a number of major export markets including the USA (under the African Growth and Opportunities Act, AGOA), and the EU (under the Everything But Arms initiative, EBA), and with China. In the short term such preferential trade relations may be working, but in the long term this is subject to change. Ethiopia is believed to be enjoying access to markets which appears favorable than operating under WTO rules. It has been argued that the preferences which Ethiopia enjoys, with China, AGOA, EBA and others schemes can be withdrawn at will. However there is an argument that <b>withdrawal</b> from such <b>schemes</b> could damage the reputation of the withdrawing country. Therefore, becoming a member of WTO by countries such as Ethiopia could provide scope for the predictability of trade strategies of the country and also have strong implications for its transparency in its trade with China. The assumption here is the fact that if Ethiopia is admitted as a member of WTO like China it would lead to the expectation that the trade behaviors of countries will be more predictable and transparent. This is also important because the {{international trade}} regimes besides representing the interest of industrialized countries could also advance the interests of developing countries at a multilateral level, beyond the bilateral schemes. In the words of Bienen, (2010 : 25) “if Ethiopia remained outside of the WTO it would be barred from entering into these negotiations and representing its own interests – {{while at the same time}} being affected by the negotiation outcomes”.|$|R
40|$|After a {{long period}} of convergence, Central, East and Southeast Europe {{experienced}} a deep recession in 2009. The relatively moderate GDP decline (- 3. 6 %) on average for the new EU member states (NMS) reflects Poland's weight in the group, the only EU country to have recorded positive GDP growth last year (Albania and Kazakhstan registered positive growth rates as well - see Table). In most other countries the catching-up process was interrupted, in particular the Baltic States were thrown several years back - more than Russia and Ukraine. The most conspicuous response to the crisis was a radical depletion of inventories and, closely related to this, a dramatic improvement in net exports since the contraction of imports was much larger than that of exports. This, together with less profit realized by foreign companies operating in the region, resulted in a sizeable reduction of current account deficits. Most countries in the region have emerged from the trough of the crisis already at the end of 2009. Several leading indicators point to a modest upswing. Poland's growth will once again boost the NMS average in 2010, while the rate of expansion in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia will be meagre. Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria are still expected to stagnate in 2010, the Baltic States will record further negative growth rates - just as Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan will rebound more strongly. We expect all countries in the region to be growing again only by 2011. That growth may accelerate slightly in 2012, but will in general be slower than in the pre-crisis period. The main prerequisite of an upturn is a marked recovery in global trade, including a rise in demand for imports from the region. Increases in private consumption {{are not likely to be}} very pronounced as long as employment fails to grow. Investment will not act as a strong engine of growth either. Given the generally weak rebound of economic activities, unemployment will continue to rise, probably peaking in 2010, before falling slowly to pre-crisis levels. The most vulnerable group of workers affected by the crisis are again those with low skills. China's economy expanded at a rate of 8. 7 % in 2009, more than earlier expected. This fast growth despite a slump in exports was due to massive government stimulus measures driving investment and supporting private consumption. With the expansionary fiscal policy still in place and foreign demand picking up, the Chinese economy may grow even faster in the coming years. There are several downward risks to our forecast. The revival of financial intermediation may turn out to be sluggish. With the upturn of economic activities more firms may find it difficult to secure funding. <b>Withdrawal</b> of demand-supporting <b>schemes</b> and the need to consolidate fiscal balances may delay or weaken recovery in the EU and put a brake on export-driven growth of the region. A possible revival of cross-border capital flows would again exert strong pressure on exchange rate appreciation - with all the familiar negative effects. The main risk associated with the current problems in Greece is that the extension of the euro area may be delayed. That may well cross the plans of those NMS that have based their medium-term economic strategy on the earliest possible adoption of the euro. 'Redirecting the growth model?' Until the recent economic crisis, the countries of Central, East and Southeast Europe benefited for {{a long period}} from a process of 'catching-up' based on two pillars (i) a high degree of liberalization of trade, capital movements and financial market integration, and (ii) membership in the EU or the prospects of either accession or a strong association with the EU. Both these two sets of factors will still be in operation also after the crisis, but there will be some significant changes in the way the 'integration growth model' will function. A combination of both changed external conditions (for example slow growth in main export markets, more difficult EMU entry) as well as internal behavioural responses to the crisis (for example more difficult financing conditions, increasing savings rates of the household sector, constraints of fiscal spending) will shape the growth paths of the region. The paper elaborates on policy issues that arise from the necessary 'redirecting of the growth model' the need for countercyclical fiscal policy, the importance of an adjustment in the real exchange rate and getting the credit system going in the short and medium run, as well as the issue of changes in regulatory frameworks and shared responsibilities in an integrated financial market context. The EU can play important roles in assisting these economies in their adjustments to the new situation and allowing them to return as quickly as possible to a sustainable catching-up growth path.
