5000|$|As a result, the “Lost Continental” must be {{classified}} {{not as a}} unique surviving copy of an issue, but a unique surviving variant of an issue—an issue that may still exist in 100,000 or more normal-paper examples—which would make it rare, but not inordinately so. By ironic contrast, only about 2,000 copies were produced of the earliest National Banknote version of the 24¢ Scott stamp—the issue incised with the H grill (Scott #142).
