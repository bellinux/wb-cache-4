25|$|In general, though, Machen {{thoroughly}} disliked {{work at the}} newspaper, and it {{was only}} the need to earn money for his family which kept him at it. The money came in useful, allowing him to move in 1919 to a bigger house <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>garden,</b> in St John's Wood, which became a noted location for literary gatherings attended by friends such as the painter Augustus John, D. B. Wyndham Lewis, and Jerome K. Jerome. Machen's dismissal from the Evening News in 1921 came as a relief in one sense, though it caused financial problems. Machen, however, was recognized as a great Fleet Street character by his contemporaries, and he remained in demand as an essay writer for much of the twenties.|$|E

25|$|When {{his sisters}} {{could no longer}} cope with his erratic and {{occasionally}} violent behaviour, he was finally committed, in 1924, to a pauper ward of Springfield Mental Hospital in Tooting. A year later, he was discovered there and his circumstances were widely publicized, leading to appeals from such figures as H. G. Wells and the personal intervention of the Prime Minister. Wain {{was transferred to the}} Bethlem Royal Hospital in Southwark, and again in 1930 to Napsbury Hospital near St Albans in Hertfordshire, north of London. This hospital was relatively pleasant, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>garden</b> and colony of cats, and he spent his final 15 years there in peace. While he became increasingly deluded, his erratic mood swings subsided, and he continued drawing for pleasure. His work from this period is marked by bright colours, flowers, and intricate and abstract patterns, though his primary subject remained the same. He is buried in his father's grave at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green, London.|$|E
25|$|The {{main feature}} of Lions Park {{is a series}} of long terraces, formed by boulder walls and garden beds that descend the steep slope falling from Canberra Terrace. A number of trees are planted {{throughout}} this area, including wind-stunted endemic Eucalypt species and Grevillea robusta. Along the Canberra Terrace boundary is a small car park <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>garden</b> bed at the southern end. A sandstone block in this garden displays a plaque containing historical information about the lighthouses. To the east of the garden bed is a boulder set in a round concrete footing with a memorial plaque dedicated to World War II servicemen attached (erected 1991). With the exception of the memorial, none of the remainder of these elements is considered to be of state-level cultural heritage significance. It is the extent of the largely undeveloped site (part of the original lighthouse reserve) that is significant, rather than the elements that comprise the park.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, 19 July, Carey scrambled {{on three}} occasions {{and participated in}} two patrols covering Allied shipping in the Channel. On the fourth sortie he was scrambled at 16:55 to intercept enemy aircraft off Selsey Bill. The squadron engaged Bf 109s from III./Jagdgeschwader 27. During the engagement Carey claimed to have scored hits on two and to have shot down one. It is possible Carey's victim was Leutnant Erbo Graf von Kageneck who was wounded. The battle had been expensive. Two 43 Squadron Hurricanes were lost. Flight Lieutenant John W.C Simpson was wounded and bailed out of Hurricane P3140 with and injured foot. He broke a collar bone as he collided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>garden</b> fence. Sergeant J. A Buck was killed after he baled out. Carey heard him radio that he {{was wounded in the}} leg and intended to parachute out. Buck's body was later washed onto the beach; he had apparently drowned. In his combat report, Carey stated that he followed his victim down through cloud and observed oil and wreckage on the water—but this was probably Simpson's Hurricane. Kageneck was the only loss admitted by the Germans. He managed to return to France wounded. No mention of Kageneck's damaged Bf 109 was made in German records.|$|E

500|$|Einar Jolin {{was born}} 7August 1890 in Stockholm. He {{was the son}} of {{professor}} Severin Jolin and grandson of actor Johan Christopher Jolin. He grew up on Kammakargatan 45 in the Jolinska Huset (Jolin Residence), a three-story townhouse <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>garden,</b> built by his grandfather. Jolin grew {{up in the middle of}} Stockholm close to Tegnérlunden, Adolf Fredrik Church and Vasaparken, which may have influenced his depiction of houses, roof tops, and views of Stockholm in his paintings. Jolin loved his house with its exotic furnishings. For interior paintings, he often selected props from things in the house [...] Gustavian and Empire style furniture, Chinese embroideries and East Indian tableware. Other residents in the house were his parents, brother Eric, sisters Ingrid and Signe, grandmother Mathilde Wigert-Jolin and his aunt, artist Ellen Jolin (1854–1939) who was the first to teach Jolin the basic techniques of painting.|$|E
500|$|As Vassar developed, {{the area}} around the Fonteyn Kill was {{gradually}} built up. The old mill became the college's pumping station, capable of pumping [...] each day. An ice house was also in place just south of the kill by 1867, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>garden</b> storehouse upstream of Vassar Lake on the stream's west side. During the winter, ice was cut from Vassar Lake and moved to the college's Main Building to keep the school's supply of food cold. Conflict occasionally arose between students who desired a smooth skating rink and staff at the college who were tasked with refrigerating Vassar's foodstuffs. In 1916, the college built its Shakespeare Garden, using seeds from many plants referenced in William Shakespeare's plays, just north of the stream. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Edith Roberts Environmental Laboratory was developed south of the kill, across from the Shakespeare Garden. The college constructed Olmsted Hall along the stream in 1972 and more recently, the Bridge for Laboratory Sciences which opened in 2016.|$|E
