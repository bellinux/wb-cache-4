5|$|Although {{interests}} in human anatomy {{had a long}} tradition in the Western world, a forensic book such as Song Ci's did not appear in Western works until Roderic de Castro's book in the 17th century. There have been several modern books published about Song Ci's writing and translations of it into English. This includes W.A. Harland's Records of <b>Washing</b> <b>away</b> of Injuries (1855), Herbert Giles' The Hsi Yuan Lu, or Instructions to Coroners (1924), and Dr. Brian E. McKnight's The <b>Washing</b> <b>Away</b> of Wrongs: Forensic Medicine in Thirteenth-Century China (1981).|$|E
5|$|August 20, 1939– Tuckerton {{receives}} 14.8inches (376mm) of precipitation, {{which is}} the wettest known tropical cyclone in the state. The storm also causes major flooding in the Pine Barrens, <b>washing</b> <b>away</b> a historic village and derailing a train in Chatsworth.|$|E
5|$|The gorge is {{susceptible}} to flooding. In the Chew Stoke flood of 1968 {{the flow of water}} washed large boulders down the gorge, damaging the cafe and entrance to Gough's Cave and <b>washing</b> <b>away</b> cars. In the cave itself the flooding lasted for three days. In 2012 the B3135, the road through the gorge, was closed for several weeks following damage to the road surface during extensive flooding.|$|E

5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} {{on south}} Samar on December10, Hibok-Hibok erupted {{six times in}} rapid succession, worsening the effects of both the typhoon and the volcano. Amy had also made landfall on an area impacted by a second typhoon three weeks prior. Strong winds displaced and destroyed residences and uprooted trees, while torrential rainfall caused rivers to overflow, resulting in the flooding of sugarcane fields and the <b>washing</b> <b>away</b> of bridges. Radio communications to and between most of the central Philippine islands were disrupted.|$|E
5|$|Government {{officials}} in Sri Lanka issued a last-minute evacuation order for potentially affected areas, though few received the evacuation order. The cyclone hit {{the eastern and}} western coastlines with powerful waves, wrecking 25fishing boats in eastern coastal towns and <b>washing</b> <b>away</b> 109 boats near Puttalam. Eight people were left missing and feared dead. The cyclone was accompanied with a storm surge as made landfall that flooded areas up to 330feet (100m) inland. While crossing the country, the cyclone dropped between 4 and 8inches (100 to 200mm) of precipitation, compounding the effects of severe monsoonal flooding from the previous month. Wind gusts from the cyclone reached 110mph (175km/h) near where it made landfall.|$|E

5|$|Portions of Central America also {{experienced}} flooding {{related to the}} rains, causing landslides and <b>washing</b> <b>away</b> bridges and roads. Over 100,000people in the region had to leave their homes, and there were 70deaths in Central America. In Guatemala, 12people died related to the flooding, including two due to cholera from stagnant waters. Officials declared a red alert in Honduras, which mobilized the army for potential relief work and caused Red Cross shelters to open; the alert was dropped after rainfall eased on October8. About 6,500people evacuated in Honduras after four rivers flooded, which damaged or destroyed several houses. About 6,000 people had to evacuate in Sula Valley in the northern portion of the country, after the government released water from the El Cajón Dam. Damage was estimated at $1.5million (14million pesos), and there were 34deaths. Due to people having to evacuate, several schools were closed. The country was severely affected by Hurricane Mitch only a year prior, and bridges that were rebuilt after the hurricane were again destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{decisive action}} on the Virginia Peninsula spurred President Abraham Lincoln to order McClellan's army to move into {{positions}} close to Richmond. By May30, McClellan had begun moving troops across the Chickahominy River, the only major natural barrier that separated his army from Richmond. However, heavy rains and thunderstorms {{on the night of}} May30 caused the water level to swell, <b>washing</b> <b>away</b> two bridges and splitting the Federal army in two across the Chickahominy. In the subsequent Battle of Seven Pines, Confederate general-in-chief Joseph E. Johnston sought to capitalize on the bifurcation of McClellan's army, attacking the half of the Union Army that was stuck south of the river. Johnston's plan fell apart, and McClellan lost no ground. Late in the battle, Johnston was hit in the right shoulder by a bullet and in the chest by a shell fragment; his command went to Maj. Gen. Gustavus W. Smith. Smith's tenure as commander of the Army of Northern Virginia was short. On June1, after an unsuccessful attack on Union forces, Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederacy, appointed Robert E. Lee, his own military adviser, to replace Smith as the commander-in-chief of the Confederate armies.|$|E
5|$|While {{stalling}} {{north of}} Luzon, Goni enhanced the southwest monsoon across the Philippines, resulting in rainfall and gusty winds across the western {{portion of the}} nation. The storm spawned seven tornadoes, one of which damaged or destroyed ten houses in Carranglan, Nueva Ecija. Rough seas swamped a motor boat near Banton Island, forcing the crew of seven to swim ashore. Across Luzon, flooding caused landslides in 13locations, including a mountain slope in Mankayan, Benguet, that buried three mining camps, killing 13miners. More than 100policemen and miners searched through the mud for survivors. Water levels quickly rose in rivers across Luzon, <b>washing</b> <b>away</b> 14flood control systems, including one dyke. Swollen rivers also inundated several bridges and washed away one in Santa, Ilocos Sur, that left 5,100people isolated. At three dams, water gates were opened after flood levels reached critical heights. Across Luzon, trees were knocked down and the power supply was disrupted; all electrical service was restored by September1, or 11days after the storm's closest approach. In total, Typhoon Goni damaged 5,742houses, of which 188 were completely destroyed. Total damages amounted to ₱4.5billion ($96.6million USD), split roughly evenly between agricultural and infrastructural impacts. In Ilocos Norte province in northwestern Luzon, damage was estimated at ₱1.8billion ($38.7million USD). Overall, Typhoon Goni killed 33people and left 9missing in the Philippines, mostly due to landslides or drownings, and injured 24others.|$|E

5|$|In New York and {{northern}} New Jersey, the storm system left the most coastal damage since the 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane. Numerous boats were damaged or destroyed, killing two people off Staten Island. High winds swept a man off a bridge, killing him. High waves flooded {{the beach at}} Coney Island. In Sea Bright, New Jersey, waves washed over a seawall, forcing 200 people to evacuate. Further inland, the Hudson, Passaic, and Hackensack rivers experienced tidal flooding. Outside Massachusetts, damage was heaviest in southern New Jersey, where the cost was estimated at $75 million (1991 USD). Across the area, tide heights reached their highest since the 1944 hurricane, leaving severe coastal and back bay flooding and closing many roads. The storm caused significant beach erosion, with 500,000 cubic yards (382,000 cubic meters) lost in Avalon, as well as $10 million damage to the beach in Cape May. The presence of a dune system mitigated the erosion in some areas. There was damage to the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Fire Island National Seashore was affected, <b>washing</b> <b>away</b> an entire row of waterfront houses in towns like Fair Harbor. Following the storm, there was a moratorium on clamming in the state's bays, due to contaminated waters. Along the Delmarva Peninsula, there was widespread water damage to homes, including ten affected houses in Sandbridge Beach, Virginia. Tides in Ocean City, Maryland, reached a record height of , while elsewhere the tides were similar to the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, in <b>Washing</b> <b>Away</b> Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing (2006), {{the results}} {{indicated}} that a person washing his or her hands is an action that helps resolve post-decisional cognitive dissonance, because the mental stress usually was caused by the person's ethical–moral self-disgust, which is an emotion related to the physical disgust caused by a dirty environment.|$|E
25|$|The <b>washing</b> <b>away</b> of topsoil and {{deposits}} of silt and gravel meant that harbors and ports {{needed to be}} moved, causing further burden upon the economy.

25|$|Lake Bonneville, a pluvial lake, burst catastrophically in the Bonneville Flood about 14,500 years ago, due to {{its water}} {{overflowing}} and <b>washing</b> <b>away</b> a sill composed of two opposing alluvial fans which had blocked a gorge. Lake Bonneville was not a glacial lake, but glacial age climate change determined the lake level and its overflow. The first scientific report of a megaflood (Gilbert, 1890) describes this event.|$|E
