His height was reported variously as , , and [...] Heikkinen was described by the Detroit News as a “pigmy” compared to Michigan’s last great guard, Albert Benbrook, who was [...] and more than [...] He was also described as “the stock atom,” and the “pint-sized” lineman. But Heikkinen viewed his size as an asset: “My size had been a help rather than a hindrance. It is easier for a small man {{to pull out of}} the line and run interference than a big one. I had no trouble out-charging big men; it was the small men <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> all the trouble.” ...|$|E

Fripp {{had never}} played as a session {{musician}} at that point, but had enjoyed listening to The Least We Can Do... and was persuaded to take part by Anthony. Jackson recalled that Fripp [...] "set up all of his stuff, put his headphones on, and started searing away." [...] Fripp played the guitar part twice, having never heard the track before, and a composite of both takes appears on the final recording. Fripp has subsequently introduced Anthony as [...] "the guy <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> my first session" [...] at events. Fripp would collaborate again with Van der Graaf Generator on their next album, Pawn Hearts, released the following year.|$|E

500|$|In the 1920s, Pullin was {{included}} in the Births and deaths section of Wisden, a rarity for non-players, due to his standing as a reporter. Wisden described him {{as one of the greatest}} authorities on cricket. Pullin retired in 1931. Although his reputation was later obscured by writers such as Neville Cardus, Allison believes that [...] "Pullin's greatest achievement was to define the role of the journalist in sport as the critic, popularizer, and interpreter of a particular team to its public." [...] Cardus himself wrote that Pullin [...] "was one of the first writers <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> help and counsel when I began to write on cricket. He belonged to the dignified old school of cricket journalism and had much in common with Sydney Pardon, though he was always the hard-headed Yorkshireman. He kept his mind on the game, had no use for frills, and despised modern stunting." ...|$|E
500|$|Yankee outfielder Bob Cerv {{recalled}} of the rivalry, [...] "I {{always remember}} the games when Pierce and Ford would lock up. Those were great ballgames – 2–1, 3–2. Usually, if they'd get beat, Mantle would {{hit a home}} run." [...] New York outfielder Hank Bauer noted, [...] "The guy <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> the most problem – I know he gave 'em to me, and I think he gave 'em {{to most of us}} – was Billy Pierce." [...] Tommy Byrne, who pitched for the Yankees for most of his career from 1943 to 1957 but played for Chicago {{for the first half of}} the 1953 season, said, [...] "Pierce was sneaky fast, a good breaking ball. He was tough. For several years there he was right up there on a par with Ford." [...] Sportswriter Bill Madden recalled in 1982, [...] "Always it was Pierce against Whitey Ford and always, to me, that seemed like an unfair matchup. They were your classic 'stylish' left-handers, equal in guile and guts, but Ford had those howitzers of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Bill Skowron and Hank Bauer behind him, while Pierce came armed with popguns. Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and Minnie Miñoso supported him with hustle and chink singles and I always marveled at the fact that Pierce could duel Ford on even terms despite those odds." [...] Ironically, the Yankees tried to acquire Pierce in the early 1950s when Ford was in the military, but White Sox general manager Frank Lane proposed that New York give up Bauer, first baseman Joe Collins and second baseman Jerry Coleman in exchange for Pierce and outfielder Al Zarilla, and ended talks when Yankees GM George Weiss suggested the Yankees send minor leaguers instead.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the war Monash had {{acquired}} an outstanding reputation for intellect, personal magnetism, management and ingenuity. He also won the respect and loyalty of his troops: his motto was [...] "Feed your troops on victory". Monash was regarded with great respect by the British – a British captain on the staff of William Heneker's 8th Division described Monash as [...] "a great bullock of a man ... though his manners were pleasant and his behaviour far from rough, I have seen few men <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> such a sensation of force ... a fit leader for the wild men he commanded". Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery later wrote: [...] "I would name Sir John Monash as the best general on the western front in Europe".|$|E
2500|$|He [...] had {{a little}} Wild West {{aggregation}} that visited the camps and did a tremendous business.

He could do a bum act with a rope that an ordinary man couldn't get away with, and make the audience think it was great, so I used to study him by the hour, and from him I learned the great secret of the show business—knowing when to get off. It's the fellow who knows when to quit that the audience wants more of.|$|E

The only person <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> some moral support, after I'd bowled the six overs, was Keith Stackpole, he was vice-captain. He ran up and said, 'It's not easy first-up, 'Wok'.

2500|$|Obama and Clinton {{were in a}} {{statistical}} dead heat in Texas, according to a poll released February 25, 2008. During Obama's sweep of February's post-Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses, the March 4 primaries of Texas and Ohio were seen as a firewall for the Clinton campaign. In early polls for these states, Clinton held double digit leads in polls for those states, {{but by the end}} of February Obama had started to erode Clinton's lead in her key demographics, and her lead had been reduced to single digits in some polls. In response to Obama's increases, Clinton's campaign began to increase their attacks on him, including an accusation of plagiarism due to similarities in Obama's campaign speeches and campaign speeches of Obama's campaign's national co-chair and Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick, although Patrick specifically stated he told Obama to use it. During the February 21, CNN-Univision debate in Austin, Texas Obama responded to the accusation by saying, [...] "The notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who's one of my national co-chairs, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> the line and suggested that I use it, I think is silly." [...] Clinton received a round of boos from the crowd when she responded, [...] "Lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can believe in; it's change you can Xerox." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{completing}} his BA degree in English Literature from the Government College, Lahore (then in British India, now in Pakistan), Dev Anand left his home-town for Bombay {{in the early}} 1940s. He began {{his career in the}} military censor's office at Churchgate, for a monthly salary of Rs. 165. Later he joined as a clerk in an accounting firm for a salary of Rs. 85. He joined his older brother, Chetan, {{as a member of the}} Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA). Dev Anand aspired to become a performer after seeing Ashok Kumar's performance in films like Achhut Kanya and Kismet. [...] Dev Anand quoted in an interview that [...] "I remember when I gate-crashed into the office of the man <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> the first break, he kept looking at me– Babu Rao Pai of Prabhat Film Studios. At that time he made up his mind that this boy deserves a break and later mentioned to his people that ‘this boy struck me because of his smile and beautiful eyes and his tremendous confidence.'" [...] Then he was soon offered the lead role in Prabhat Films' Hum Ek Hain (1946), a film about Hindu-Muslim unity, where Dev Anand played a Hindu boy and was paired opposite Kamala Kotnis. While shooting the film in Pune, Anand befriended the actor Guru Dutt. Between them, they agreed that if one of them were to become successful in the film industry, he would help the other also to be successful. They formed a mutual understanding that when Anand produced a film, Dutt would direct it and when Dutt directed a film, Anand would act in it.|$|E
