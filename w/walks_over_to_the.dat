25|$|The {{official}} Ram Jam {{was started}} by the Alumni Association in 2003 and has grown to become the large pregame football tailgating parties they are today. During the fall semester outside the Legrand Alumni Center, students, alumni, and community members park their cars {{in the parking lot}} and hang out around the center to grill and socialize. The events also feature local bands to provide entertainment, free food and refreshments, bounce houses and other games for kids, and alcoholic beverages for those 21 and up. The Ram Band, the ASU dance team, the Angelettes, and the ASU Cheerleaders also perform and everyone <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stadium prior to the game.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Hilson {{lounging}} in her bed. Upset by her partner, she <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> closet and rips down {{all of his}} clothes. The video then cuts to Hilson {{sitting in a chair}} at a beauty salon, where she gets a new haircut and dyes her hair from black to blonde. She later begins a choreographed routine with her girlfriends, who appear to also have been mistreated by their men. The women then march down Auburn Avenue before they head home to throw their men's clothes off the balcony. The video received mixed to positive reviews. Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy was positive and called it a [...] "beautifully shot portrait of a woman {{on the edge of a}} nervous breakdown", and The Fader writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd regarded it as an accurate representation of how women act when they are [...] "wronged by dudes". On the other hand, Robbie Daw of Idolator deemed it tiresome, calling it a [...] "visual snoozefest". He wrote, [...] " [...] goes to a salon, orders up Rihanna's Rated R haircut and sasses men who are wrongin' the ladies. Hey, girlsâ€”her love has a limit! But so does our patience for this [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, who had previously directed Rihanna videos for [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Drive". The video was shot in Venice, Los Angeles on April 3, 2008. The video begins with Rihanna {{standing in front of}} a black backdrop for the opening of the song. As the first verse starts, the scene is intercut with another of Rihanna looking out the window at her boyfriend and standing behind the front door as he approaches and asks to come in. As Rihanna walks way from the door singing the lyrics [...] "Don't tell me you're sorry cos you're not", the viewer realizes that her boyfriend has perhaps done something wrong and been unfaithful. During the first chorus and second verse, Rihanna is shown in a different outfit, this time sitting in a silver Porsche in a garage. As Rihanna pulls out of the garage and onto the street, her ex-boyfriend walks alongside the car as she drives and begs her to forgive him; she pulls away. For the bridge, Rihanna is shown sitting on a bed as well as in front of the black backdrops as she reads a text message from her ex-boyfriend, who asks to meet her. During the last chorus, Rihanna appears in a different outfit and walks into a lounge, where she puts some clothes on a table and then sits on a sofa. As her ex-boyfriend walks in, the singer gets up and <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clothes, where she withdraws some matches and strikes one, dropping it on what is made aware to be some of her ex-boyfriend's clothes. As the song comes to and end, Rihanna walks out of the room whilst he tries to put out the fire.|$|E

6000|$|... "With that he riz up," [...] {{continued}} Dan'l, {{ignoring his}} sister, [...] "and, takin' them counterfeit notes from my hand, sez he: 'Them notes belong to ME now,' sez he, 'and I'm goin' to destroy 'em.' And {{with that he}} <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fire as stiff as a poker, and held them notes in it until they were burnt clean up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was that}} wretch {{on top of}} the house, a-fixin' his old rods and hammerin' away for dear life. He'd brought his ladder over the side fence, where the dog, a-barkin' and plungin' at the boy outside, couldn't see him. I stood dumb for a minute, an' then I know'd I had him. I rushed into the house, got a piece of well-rope, tied it to the bull-dog's collar, an' dragged him out and {{fastened}} him to the bottom rung of the ladder. Then I <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front fence with Lord Edward's chain, for I knew that if he got at that bull-dog there'd be times, for they'd never been allowed to see each other yet. So says I to the boy, 'I'm goin' to tie up the dog, so you needn't be afraid of his jumpin' over the fence,'--which he couldn't do, or the boy would have been a corpse for twenty minutes, or may be half an hour. The boy kinder laughed, and said I needn't mind, which I didn't. Then I went to the gate, and I clicked to the horse which was standin' there, an' off he starts, as good as gold, an' trots down the road. The boy, he said somethin' or other pretty bad, an' away he goes after him; but the horse was a-trottin' real fast, an' had a good start." ...|$|E

6000|$|The patient {{enters the}} consulting-room. [...] "Doctor," [...] he says, [...] "I {{have a bad}} pain." [...] "Where is it?" [...] "Here." [...] "Stand up," [...] says the doctor, [...] "and put your arms up above your head." [...] Then the doctor goes behind the patient and strikes him a {{powerful}} blow in the back. [...] "Do you feel that," [...] he says. [...] "I do," [...] says the patient. Then the doctor turns suddenly and lets him have a left hook under the heart. [...] "Can you feel that," [...] he says viciously, as the patient falls over on the sofa in a heap. [...] "Get up," [...] says the doctor, and counts ten. The patient rises. The doctor looks him over very carefully without speaking, and then suddenly fetches him a blow in the stomach that doubles him up speechless. The doctor <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window and reads the morning paper for a while. Presently he turns and begins to mutter more to himself than the patient. [...] "Hum!" [...] he says, [...] "there's a slight anaesthesia of the tympanum." [...] "Is that so?" [...] says the patient, in an agony of fear. [...] "What can I do about it, doctor?" [...] "Well," [...] says the doctor, [...] "I want you to keep very quiet; you'll {{have to go to}} bed and stay there and keep quiet." [...] In reality, of course, the doctor hasn't the least idea what is wrong with the man; but he DOES know that if he will go to bed and keep quiet, awfully quiet, he'll either get quietly well again or else die a quiet death. Meantime, if the doctor calls every morning and thumps and beats him, he can keep the patient submissive and perhaps force him to confess what is wrong with him.|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{the first}} eight-and-forty hours after Mr. Warrington's {{departure}} passed pretty cheerily at Tunbridge Wells, and Friday arrived, when the sermon {{was to be}} delivered which we have seen Mr. Sampson preparing. The company at the Wells were ready enough to listen to it. Sampson {{had a reputation for}} being a most amusing and eloquent preacher; and if there were no breakfast, conjurer, dancing bears, concert going on, the good Wells folk would put up with a sermon. He knew Lady Yarmouth was coming, and what a power she had in the giving of livings and the dispensing of bishoprics, the Defender of the Faith of that day having a remarkable confidence in her ladyship's opinion upon these matters;--and so we may be sure that Mr. Sampson prepared his very best discourse for her hearing. When the Great Man is at home at the Castle, and <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little country church, in the park, bringing the Duke, the Marquis, and a couple of Cabinet Ministers with him, has it ever been your lot to sit among the congregation, and watch Mr. Trotter the curate and his sermon? He looks anxiously at the Great Pew; he falters as he gives out his text, and thinks, [...] "Ah! perhaps his lordship may give me a living!" [...] Mrs. Trotter and the girls look anxiously at the Great Pew too, and watch the effects of papa's discourse--the well-known favourite discourse--upon the big-wigs assembled. Papa's first nervousness is over: his noble voice clears, warms to his sermon: he kindles: he takes his pocket-handkerchief out: he is coming to that exquisite passage which has made them all cry at the parsonage: he has begun it! Ah! What is that humming noise, which fills the edifice, and causes hob-nailed Melibaeus to grin at smock-frocked Tityrus? It is the Right Honourable Lord Naseby snoring in the pew by the fire! And poor Trotter's visionary mitre disappears with the music.|$|E

5000|$|Groucho Marx parodies {{this play}} in the 1930 Marx Brothers film, Animal Crackers.

50|$|However, {{he never}} gets {{past the first}} step, as his {{jackhammer}} vibrates enough to pull the coyote into the hole. When the power cord stretches enough to unplug the jackhammer, the coyote climbs out and finds himself vibrating sporadically.

5000|$|In the tie-in comic to Young Justice, Perry is at Bibbo's Diner, where Bibbo {{comments}} {{on the behavior of}} his other guests, but Perry doesn't respond. Five years later, Perry was at {{the front door of the}} Daily Planet when a spaceship launched a device that hovered over Metropolis, burrowing into the ground. Perry <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crater and watches as it starts digging a hole through the ground.|$|E
50|$|By {{testing the}} potion on himself, he {{transforms}} into Mr. Edward Hyde, {{a young and}} handsome, but also murderous and lecherous man. Soon, Hyde becomes bored with conventional debauchery and when his eyes catch Kitty, he decides he must have her. When Kitty rejects him, Hyde rapes her and leaves her unconscious. When Kitty wakes up in the bed, she immediately notices that Hyde has scratched her neck in various places. Distressed, Kitty <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> table where she finds a note written to her. When Kitty goes {{into the other room}} looking for Paul, she looks in to find out that her lover has been bitten by a venomous snake. To Kitty's misfortune, Paul is dead. Kitty <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patio, puts her leg over the balcony, covers her ears in response to the loud music playing from the party and allows herself to fall off the balcony and through the glass roof covering the party guests. Hyde frames his other self for these crimes.|$|E
