Anything on Henry's body would disappear with his body during each death. Miller felt that Henry's naked rebirth in water would be an interesting <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> show's protagonist alive during the series by completing the death and rebirth process; the nakedness would create several comedic moments within the series. Miller intended to use Henry's death and rebirth process sporadically after the first two episodes so that the series would focus on Henry's long life.|$|E

25|$|Crowned (1989) tackles {{a similar}} theme, {{but from the}} {{perspective}} of the founding fathers. The film, based on a play by author Yaakov Shabtai (adapted by Ephraim Sidon and Ram Loevy), is an intense comedy based on the final days of the biblical King David. As his life approaches its end, he faces the most difficult task of his forty-year reign—giving up his crown to the next generation. Or perhaps he might even find a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> crown for himself.

25|$|Insulin is {{produced}} {{and stored in}} the body as a hexamer (a unit of six insulin molecules), while the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, {{which serves as a}} <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available. The hexamer-monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection. The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons; however, the monomer is a much faster-reacting drug because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size. A fast-reacting drug means insulin injections do not have to precede mealtimes by hours, which in turn gives people with diabetes more flexibility in their daily schedules. Insulin can aggregate and form fibrillar interdigitated beta-sheets. This can cause injection amyloidosis, and prevents the storage of insulin for long periods.|$|E

He began his political career as a nationalist, modernizer, and proponent of a strong national government and protective tariffs. By the late 1820s, his views reversed and he became a leading proponent of states' rights, limited government, nullification, and opposition to high tariffs—he saw Northern acceptance of these policies as the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> South in the Union.

500|$|The code of many {{projects}} {{has to be}} modified to suit the GPU processing of Titan, but each code is required to be executable on CPU-based systems so that projects do not become solely dependent on Titan. OLCF formed the Center for Accelerated Application Readiness (CAAR) to aid with the adaptation process. It holds developer workshops at Nvidia headquarters to educate users about the architecture, compilers and applications on Titan. CAAR {{has been working on}} compilers with Nvidia and code vendors to integrate directives for GPUs into their programming languages. Researchers can thus express parallelism in their code with their existing programming language, typically Fortran, C or C++, and the compiler can express it to the GPUs. Dr. Bronson Messer, a computational astrophysicist, said of the task: [...] "...an application using Titan to the utmost must also find a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> GPU busy, remembering all the while that the GPU is fast, but less flexible than the CPU." [...] Moab Cluster Suite is used to prioritize jobs to nodes to keep utilization high; it improved efficiency from 70% to approximately 95% in the tested software. Some projects found that the changes increased efficiency of their code on non-GPU machines; the performance of Denovo doubled on CPU-based machines.|$|E

500|$|In 1840 {{the playwright}} Friedrich Hebbel wrote a poem in German titled [...] "Requiem", its Latin title {{alluding}} to [...] "" [...] (eternal rest), {{the first words}} of the Mass for the Dead. The poem opens with an apostrophe to a [...] "soul" [...] in a plea, [...] "" [...] (Soul, forget them not, soul, forget not the dead). These words appear to echo various psalms, such as , [...] "Bless the Lord, O my soul". Hebbel, however, evokes an [...] "eternal rest" [...] that is distinctly non-religious: the poem offers no metaphysical reference, Christian or otherwise, but calls for remembrance as the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> dead alive. The first lines, in which the speaker calls upon the soul not to forget the dead, are repeated in {{the centre of the}} poem and again at its conclusion, as a refrain that sets apart two longer sections of verse. The first of these sections describes how the dead, nurtured by love, enjoy a final glow of life. In contrast, the latter section portrays a different fate for souls that have been forsaken: who are relegated to an unending, desolate struggle for renewed existence. The musicologist Katherine FitzGibbon notes that the speaker of this narrative is not identified, but may be [...] "a poetic narrator, divine voice, or even the dead".|$|E

Matt Rooney at JoBlo.com called the teaser great, and [...] "a great <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> buzz going for" [...] Deadpool 2 despite not actually revealing anything about that film.

After years of research, and key milestones such as the Genesis Effect in [...] and the Stained Glass Knight in Young Sherlock Holmes, the group, which then numbered 40 individuals, was spun out as a corporation in February 1986 by Catmull and Smith. Among the 38 remaining employees, there were also Malcolm Blanchard, David DiFrancesco, Ralph Guggenheim and Bill Reeves, who {{had been part of}} the team since the days of NYIT. Tom Duff, also an NYIT member, would later join Pixar after its formation. With Lucas' 1983 divorce, which coincided with the sudden dropoff in revenues from Star Wars licenses following the release of Return of the Jedi, they knew he would most likely sell the whole Graphics Group. Worried that the employees would be lost to them if that happened, which would prevent the creation of the first computer animated movie, they concluded that the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> team together was to turn the group into an independent company. But Moore's Law also said that the first film was still some years away, and they needed to focus on a proper product while waiting for the computers to become powerful enough.
