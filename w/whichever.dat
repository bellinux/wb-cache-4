5|$|Although Pat Nixon was a Methodist, she and {{her husband}} {{attended}} <b>whichever</b> Protestant Church was nearest to their home, especially after moving to Washington. They attended the Metropolitan Memorial Methodist Church because it sponsored her daughters' Brownie troop, occasional Baptist services with the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, and Norman Vincent Peale's Marble Collegiate Church.|$|E
5|$|Religion is {{intended}} as a comfort, a solace, a necessity to the soul's welfare; and <b>whichever</b> form of religion furnishes the greatest comfort, the greatest solace, it is the form which should be adopted be its name what it will.|$|E
5|$|Score Entertainment {{created a}} Sonic X {{collectible}} card game for two players, released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over {{one at a}} time; <b>whichever</b> card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; <b>whichever</b> player has the most rings {{at the end of}} the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with Sonic characters than like a wholly Sonic-based product.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} itself is based around a striking honeycomb frontage, modelled on close-up images of an insect's eye, and is illuminated {{at night in}} a variety of colours that reflect the mood of <b>whichever</b> show is playing at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} initially {{followed through}} with this recommendation but the move was widely disapproved of by scholars of Japanese affairs including Cortazzi and {{thanks in part to}} their protests the Foreign Affairs Ministry eventually agreed to revive Japan Echo as an online magazine, which would be produced on an annual basis by <b>whichever</b> company put forward the best bid.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the loaned {{locomotives}} {{and passenger}} carriages, the LNC owned its dedicated hearse vans outright. Despite this, {{they were always}} painted in <b>whichever</b> colour scheme was currently in use by the LSWR (SR after 1923), to match the livery of the passenger cars and locomotives loaned to the LNC.|$|E
5|$|Absolute {{structured}} {{the song}} using doo-wop records as a template. The format was for Emma Bunton {{to sing the}} high part, Melanie Brown, Victoria Beckham, and Halliwell singing the lower and middle parts, and Chisholm adding the ad-libs. The song was recorded in a caravan {{in the middle of}} mayhem. Wilson and Watkins doggedly worked on it with <b>whichever</b> of the group's members were available from the filming set at any given point. A considerable amount of production work was required afterward before the track reached its final form.|$|E
5|$|According to some scholars, the Black Stone was {{the same}} stone that Islamic {{tradition}} describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. This led to a debate about whether the Black Stone's greeting comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, whether the stone was a living creature or an inanimate object. <b>Whichever</b> was the case, the stone was held to be a symbol of prophethood.|$|E
5|$|But from <b>whichever</b> it is made, {{whether from}} oats, barley or wheat, it harms {{the head and}} the stomach, it causes bad breath and ruins the teeth, it fills the stomach with bad fumes, {{and as a result}} anyone who drinks it along with wine becomes drunk quickly; but it does have the {{property}} of facilitating urination and makes one's flesh white and smooth.|$|E
5|$|Claiborne and Haw {{promoted}} Jesus for President {{by going}} on a U.S. speaking tour of 30 cities. The tour {{led up to the}} 2008 United States presidential election, and the book tour was suggestive of a third party candidate campaign for Jesus. The authors' speeches did not attempt to sway their audiences towards or away from any particular candidates, but rather encouraged them to endorse <b>whichever</b> candidates supported Christian values.|$|E
5|$|King Artaxerxes {{thinks it}} {{just that the}} cities in Asia should belong to him, as well as Clazomenae and Cyprus among the islands, and that the other Greek cities, both small and great, should be left independent, except Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros; and these should belong, as of old, to the Athenians. But <b>whichever</b> of the two parties does not accept this peace, upon them I will make war, in company with those who desire this arrangement, both by land and by sea, with ships and with money.|$|E
5|$|Lead vocalist and saxophonist Haynes (who {{sometimes}} sang {{through a}} bullhorn), guitarist Paul Leary, dual drummers Coffey and Nervosa (the latter briefly replaced by Cabbage), and <b>whichever</b> bassist {{happened to be}} filling in at the time, had a visual aspect. As with their music, their appearance was exceptionally non-conventional in the early days, including sideways mohawks, dreadlocks, unnaturally colored hair, and the like.|$|E
5|$|Predecessor and {{successor}} queries can {{be performed}} with rank queries. Once the rank of the target value is known, its predecessor is the element at the position given by its rank (as {{it is the largest}} element that is smaller than the target value). Its successor is the element after it (if it is present in the array) or at the next position after the predecessor (otherwise). The nearest neighbor of the target value is either its predecessor or successor, <b>whichever</b> is closer.|$|E
5|$|The myth's {{religious}} importance {{extended beyond}} the funerary sphere. Mortuary offerings, in which {{family members or}} hired priests presented food to the deceased, were logically linked with the mythological offering of the Eye of Horus to Osiris. By analogy, this episode of the myth was eventually equated with other interactions between a human and a being in the divine realm. In temple offering rituals, the officiating priest took {{on the role of}} Horus, the gifts to the deity became the Eye of Horus, and <b>whichever</b> deity received these gifts was momentarily equated with Osiris.|$|E
5|$|A {{characteristic}} of Douglas's work is {{his attention to}} both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from <b>whichever</b> style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building. However, {{in the cases of}} Rowden Abbey and StMichael and All Angels Church, Altcar, the entire buildings were timber-framed.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the third largest party, Clegg had {{announced}} that the Liberal Democrats would enter talks with <b>whichever</b> party held the greater number of seats. A series of meetings with the Conservatives began shortly after the hung parliament was announced, and continued over the weekend after the election. Negotiations were also held with the Labour Party. The Scottish National Party (SNP) signalled its willingness to join Labour and the Liberal Democrats in government {{as part of a}} rainbow coalition, but it quickly became clear that Gordon Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen as a major obstacle to formulating a Labour–Liberal Democrat deal.|$|E
5|$|CMLL {{has been}} forced to declare the {{championship}} vacant four times. Each time, the reigning champion left CMLL without losing a match and the championship to <b>whichever</b> successor CMLL picked. Under normal circumstances, wrestlers give notice, or their contract is not renewed, and the championship transitions to a different wrestler. In the case of Cien Caras, Steel, and Héctor Garza, their departures from the company were so sudden and unexpected that no plans were in place and CMLL had to organize a tournament to determine the next champion. In Máximo Sexy's case he was fired from the company while still the champion, causing the championship to be vacated as a result.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s, {{students}} in Philadelphia schools began {{the day with}} reading the Protestant version of the Bible. On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, {{wrote a letter to}} the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version of the Bible, used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teaching while at school. As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no child should be forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read <b>whichever</b> version of the Bible their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against the Bible used in Protestant devotionals.|$|E
5|$|During the {{challenge}} cup period, {{none of the}} leagues that played for the trophy had a formal playoff system to decide their respective champions; <b>whichever</b> team finished in first place after the regular season won the league title. A playoff would only be played if teams tied for first-place in their leagues {{at the end of}} the regular season. Challenge games were played until 1912 at any time during hockey season by challenges approved and/or ordered by the Stanley Cup trustees. In 1912, Cup trustees declared that it was only to be defended {{at the end of the}} champion team's regular season.|$|E
5|$|From 2012 to 2015, the {{two teams}} competed in the I-40 Cup Series, a season-long, 16-game series between the clubs. <b>Whichever</b> of the two won the most games played between them was {{declared}} the winner and received a trophy cup to keep until the next season. The losing team donated game tickets to a charity selected by the winner. The Sounds won the inaugural 2012 contest (9–7), and Memphis won the 2013 series (7–9). The teams tied the 2014 and 2015 series (both 8–8); the Redbirds retained the title in both instances. The teams discontinued the trophy cup, friendly wager, and promotional references to the Series after 2015.|$|E
5|$|Guilty Gear X2 offers eight modes: Arcade, Survival, M.O.M. (an {{acronym for}} Medal of Millionaires), Mission, Story, Trainning, Versus 2P and Versus CPU. The Arcade Mode allows the player {{to fight against}} several enemies until reach the final fight against the boss. On the Survival Mode, the player {{continuously}} battle against enemies until reach the 500th and final level or die, <b>whichever</b> comes first. Medal of Millionaires is a variation in which the player earn medals by performing combos. In the Mission Mode, there are 50 challenges, in which the player fight with and against a predetermined character; the player character have handicaps such as being prevented from jumping, poisoned or start a fight with half of health.|$|E
5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in <b>whichever</b> state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E
5|$|In February 313, Constantine {{met with}} Licinius in Milan, where they {{developed}} the Edict of Milan. The edict stated that Christians {{should be allowed}} to follow the faith without oppression. This removed penalties for professing Christianity, under which many had been martyred previously, and returned confiscated Church property. The edict protected from religious persecution not only Christians but all religions, allowing anyone to worship <b>whichever</b> deity they chose. A similar edict had been issued in 311 by Galerius, then senior emperor of the Tetrarchy; Galerius' edict granted Christians the right to practise their religion but did not restore any property to them. The Edict of Milan included several clauses which stated that all confiscated churches would be returned as well as other provisions for previously persecuted Christians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the colonial}} period, {{most of the}} {{surviving}} Chajoma were forcibly settled in the towns of San Juan Sacatepéquez, San Pedro Sacatepéquez and San Martín Jilotepeque {{as a result of}} the Spanish policy of congregaciones; the people were moved to <b>whichever</b> of the three towns was closest to their pre-conquest land holdings. Some Iximche Kaqchikels seem also to have been relocated to the same towns. After their relocation some of the Chajoma drifted back to their pre-conquest centres, creating informal settlements and provoking hostilities with the Poqomam of Mixco and Chinautla along the former border between the pre-Columbian kingdoms. Some of these settlements eventually received official recognition, such as San Raimundo near Sacul.|$|E
5|$|Judges in a High Court are {{appointed}} by the President of India {{in consultation with the}} Chief Justice of India and the governor of the state. High Courts are headed by a Chief Justice. The Chief Justices are ranked fourteenth (in their state) and seventeenth (outside their state) in the Indian order of precedence. The number of judges in a court is decided by dividing the average institution of main cases during the last five years by the national average, or the average rate of disposal of main cases per judge per year in that High Court, <b>whichever</b> is higher.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} {{role-playing}} {{games of the}} 16-bit era, Secret of Mana displays a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The game features three such characters: the hero, the girl, and the sprite, named Randi, Primm, and Popoi outside the initial North American and European releases. The player can choose to control each of the characters at any time; <b>whichever</b> character is currently selected, the other two companions are controlled via artificial intelligence. The game may be played simultaneously by up to three players, {{made possible by the}} Super Multitap accessory for the Super NES console. The Virtual Console version of the game supports three-player gameplay via additional GameCube controllers or Classic Controllers.|$|E
5|$|The council met on December 14 {{to appoint}} representatives to the Confederacy's unicameral {{provisional}} congress. Those appointed would serve {{for only two}} months, as the provisional congress was replaced with a permanent bicameral legislature on February 17, 1862. Kentucky was entitled to two senators and 12 representatives in the permanent Confederate Congress. The usual day for general elections being passed, Governor Johnson and the legislative council set election day for Confederate Kentucky on January 22. Voters were allowed to vote in <b>whichever</b> county they occupied on election day, and could cast a general ballot for all positions. In an election that saw military votes outnumber civilian ones, only four of the provisional legislators were elected to seats in the Confederate House of Representatives. One provisional legislator, Henry Burnett, {{was elected to the}} Confederate Senate.|$|E
5|$|The first Championship {{was awarded}} at a Cardiff show in 1928, to {{a red and}} white Pembroke bitch named Shan Fach. The breeds {{continued}} to be judged together until 1934, when The Kennel Club recognised each breed separately. In that initial registration, some 59 Cardigans and 240 Pembrokes were listed in the pedigree books. The decisions about the breed to which each dog belonged were sometimes left to the owners, who were free to choose <b>whichever</b> they felt was the most appropriate. The first dog to be named Best in Show at an open conformation show was Ch. Bowhit Pivot.|$|E
5|$|The hamstrung Regency proved {{unable to}} resolve {{disputes}} and rivalries between {{national and local}} political factions. Believing that granting provincial and local governments greater autonomy would quell the growing dissent, the General Assembly passed a constitutional amendment in 1834, called the Ato Adicional (Additional Act). Instead of ending the chaos, these new powers only fed local ambitions and rivalries. Violence erupted throughout the country. Local parties competed with renewed ferocity to dominate provincial and municipal governments, as <b>whichever</b> party dominated the provinces would also gain control over the electoral and political system. Those parties which lost elections rebelled and tried to assume power by force, resulting in several rebellions.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Masonic brotherhood {{probably}} descends from a 16th-century {{legal definition}} of a brother as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a Volume of Sacred Law, <b>whichever</b> book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In Progressive continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the 1852 {{agreement}} and Act of Parliament establishing the London Necropolis Company, the LSWR (after 1923 the SR) provided the locomotives and crew for London Necropolis Railway operations. There was no dedicated LNC locomotive, and the trains were worked by <b>whichever</b> suitable engine happened to be available. (Before the 1864 improvements to Necropolis Junction, locomotives rarely entered the cemetery branch line itself and the trains were generally hauled along the branch line by horses.) Towards the end of the railway's operations in the 1930s the route was almost always worked by LSWR M7 class locomotives, usually No.255.|$|E
5|$|Ajay {{ends up in}} Yuma's {{mountain}} prison, {{from which}} he manages to escape. In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because of his affections toward Ajay's late mother. The Golden Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the Golden Path. <b>Whichever</b> leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other {{to prevent them from}} starting another civil war, and Ajay can choose to either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the Golden Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades was {{a leading}} {{supporter}} of the Sicilian Expedition, and scholars have argued that, had that expedition been under Alcibiades's command instead of that of Nicias, the expedition might not have met its eventual disastrous fate. In the years when he served Sparta, Alcibiades {{played a significant role}} in Athens's undoing; the capture of Decelea and the revolts of several critical Athenian subjects occurred either at his suggestion or under his supervision. Once restored to his native city, however, he played a crucial role in a string of Athenian victories that eventually brought Sparta to seek a peace with Athens. He favored unconventional tactics, frequently winning cities over by treachery or negotiation rather than by siege. Alcibiades's military and political talents frequently proved valuable to <b>whichever</b> state currently held his allegiance, but his propensity for making powerful enemies ensured that he never remained in one place for long; and by the end of the war which he had helped to rekindle in the early 410s, his days of political relevance were a bygone memory.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Bede wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica, {{there were two}} common ways of {{referring}} to dates. One was to use indictions, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of <b>whichever</b> kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date {{would have to be}} given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the Anno Domini method invented by Dionysius Exiguus. Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in De Temporum Ratione, his work on chronology, is the main reason why it is now so widely used. Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle, contained in De Temporum Ratione, was developed from Dionysius Exiguus’ famous Easter table.|$|E
5|$|At the trial, Archibald Macdonald, {{representing}} the prosecution, argued that Paine's work served only to inflame the populace and distribute radical ideas to those without {{the experience to}} understand them in context. Erskine's reply opened with a defence {{of the freedom of}} lawyers to represent <b>whichever</b> clients came to them, and followed with an exposition of his views {{on the nature of the}} freedom of the press—arguing that the publication of radical tracts served only to improve the government by highlighting its weaknesses, and could not be seditious if published in good faith. Despite Erskine's speech later receiving a rapturous response, Paine was found guilty before Macdonald replied. The verdict was seen by the government as legitimising their repression of radicalism, and paved the way for the 1794 Treason Trials, in which Erskine played a prominent role.|$|E
5|$|During the {{election}} period, a candidate is {{not permitted to}} spend more than $600,000 or 30 cents for each person on the electoral register, <b>whichever</b> is the greater amount. For the 2017 election, {{based on the number of}} electors as at 28 August 2017, {{the election}} expenses limit was $754,982.40. It amounts to an illegal practice to pay to transport voters to or from the poll; or to pay a voter for the use of premises to display a notice, unless the voter is an advertising agent or the transaction is carried out in the ordinary course of business. It is also an illegal practice for a person to borrow or lend, hire or rent out, or use any motor vehicle to convey voters other than himself and his family members to or from the poll. Committing an illegal practice is a criminal offence, the penalty for which is a fine of up to $2,000 and disqualification for three years from being a voter or a candidate for Parliament or the office of President.|$|E
