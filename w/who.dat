5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the children <b>who</b> watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds <b>who</b> watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds <b>who</b> did not; children from low-income households <b>who</b> were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households <b>who</b> watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children <b>who</b> watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those <b>who</b> did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children <b>who</b> watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E
