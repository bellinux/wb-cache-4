40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{functional}} identities of legal witness, legal victim, and legal perpetrator and their co-construction in the forensic interviews that take place after allegations {{of child sexual abuse}} have been made. I argue that while these are inter-related identities, the focus of their constitution and the direction of their constructional dependencies is determined by the event context. Nineteen transcripts of forensic interviews involving children ages 3 to 12 were collected during a three-month period at a children's center in a western state. Legal witness as an identity of performance, is constituted in performance. Interview processes socialize children to these performances. Ritualized sequences within interviews also provide evidence that children have the qualities required of a legal witness. Children are constructed as legal victims in interview processes that establish they have been acted upon according to specific actions defined in the law. This mutually constitutes the legal perpetrator. Children, however, resist both interpellation as a legal victim and elements of the process of the interview affecting how they are perceived as legal witnesses. Analysis also reveals {{that the purpose of the}} interview within the extended legal process inherently shapes the accounts and narratives that are co-produced. The addition of a third interview participant is also considered. Second interviewers provided a complex co-construction process that can support the constitution of the legal <b>witness</b> <b>identity.</b> Relatives of the child also provide a complex process. If they are perceived as co-authoring the narratives or accounts, however, they may negatively affect the legal <b>witness</b> <b>identity.</b> The addition of an interpreter can facilitate the child's co-construction as a legal witness. As pre-trial events, forensic interviews are not subject to trial requirements for trained interpreters. In the case considered here, the untrained interpreter produced language that was less precise, more personal, and had the potential to affect the legal implication of questions. Finally, I discuss the therapeutic, theoretical, and the social, cultural, and political implications of the study...|$|E

40|$|While in {{political}} debates identity is often considered as given, scholars of social sciences {{concentrate on the}} formation of new and particularly transnational identities. Insights from nationalism reveal mechanisms of identity formation but European integration has taken its own way. We introduce different concepts of identity formation on the European level arguing that multiple identities are common and may take different forms. To observe identity formation, {{it is not only}} useful to look at elite and mass surveys but also to consider the public sphere. Though media are predominantly national, different studies show that their coverage Europeanizes. We think that valuable empirical evidences of European identities can be gathered from comparative media analyses focusing on common European frames and references made to a European imagined community. These identity formation processes take place in different policy fields. We argue that foreign policy is particularly appropriate to <b>witness</b> <b>identity</b> narratives at work. In search for a role in world politics, the EU has to revisit its fundamental values thereby contributing to European identity formation.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{becoming}} an adult in contemporary times is fragmented and unequal, shaped by chance, choice and timing. "Unfolding lives" presents a unique approach to understanding {{the changing face of}} youth transitions, addressing the question of how gender identities are constituted in late modern culture. The book follows individual lives over time, enabling the reader to <b>witness</b> gender <b>identities</b> in the making and breathing new life into static analytic models. At the heart of the book are vivid in-depth accounts of four young lives, emblematic of broader biographical trends. They reveal how inequalities and privileges are made in new and unexpected ways, through practices such as falling in love, coming out, acting out and religious conversion. A focus on temporal processes and changing meanings captures {{what it feels like to}} be young and shows the creative ways that young people navigate the conflicting and changing demands of personal relationships, schooling, work and play. "Unfolding lives" is also a demonstration of a method-in-practice, describing how longitudinal material can be analysed and animated to realise the relationship between personal and social change. Written in an accessible style that breaks the conventional academic mould, "Unfolding lives" is a compelling and provocative read. The book will be an essential text for students and academics involved in youth and gender studies as well as those interested in new directions in qualitative research methods and writing...|$|R
5000|$|This {{may arise}} before charges against a person are brought, {{normally}} {{in respect of}} pre-trial proceedings. For example, if police conclude that a crime has been committed and that action {{needs to be taken}} to identify the perpetrator, such as the interrogation of a <b>witness</b> or an <b>identity</b> parade, such an action is taken {{in the presence of a}} judge because the rights of the (still unidentified) criminal suspect cannot otherwise be adequately protected during the evidence gathering. Normally, a defendant enjoys the right to be present or represented by an attorney during the interrogation or identity parade. But where the defendant is not yet identified, in order to secure full legality and impartiality, a judge is present. This ensures the admissibility of the resulting evidence will not be successfully challenged during the trial. Typically, this situation might involve a dying witness, not expected to be available later for cross-examination at a trial by or on behalf of the defendant.|$|R
40|$|This study investigates stage props as {{alternate}} stage {{representations of}} female characters. Since the 1970 s, {{a great deal}} has been written independently about both stage props and about women on the early modern stage, but the two are seldom discussed together. Recent theater criticism has sought to establish a link between stage props and their broader social utility outside the theater, while gender criticism has investigated the paradoxical position of early modern women as both subject and object, particularly in regard to women as consumers and commodities. This work draws together these two lines of investigation in order to highlight the substitution that often occurs between female characters and "female" stage props. The traditional relationship between character and prop, in which the prop is firmly situated {{as an extension of}} character, exists as a specifically masculine relationship seldom available to female characters. I focus on {{the way in which the}} frequent disappearance of female characters within plays allows women to be represented by one or another of a small group of "female" props like rings, necklaces and other trinkets. The readings of the plays of Shakespeare, Thomas Kyd, Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton and Cyril Tourneur suggest that in order to <b>witness</b> female <b>identity</b> in its fullness, attention must be paid not only to interpersonal relationships between gendered subjects, but to the relationships visualized between female subject and object as well. "Female" stage props function as a means of furthering the understanding of how female subjectivity differs from that of male subjectivity on the early modern stage...|$|R
40|$|Turn on {{the radio}} or click play; your {{favorite}} song begins to fill your ears. You bob your head and maybe sing along, but do you question why you like the music you are hearing? Many research studies indicate that people’s emotional states dictate their music preference; however, music preference is determined {{by a combination of}} a person’s self view and the culture they are immersed in. As technology advances and the music delivery system evolves, music is able to be played more and with the option of new genres and songs. My theory is, picture a world without music, and you will <b>witness</b> an <b>identity</b> crisis and silence consuming mostly everyone. This paper explores how people’s values and self-views are shifting due to the correlation between the transformation of the music delivery system and the evolution of culture to a more technology driven world. In order to understand the connections between music preference and personality, I looked at research studies that focused on neurological responses to music, psychology of music, and human identity in connection to music. With this research, I divided music listeners into two categories of active and passive listeners. I found that the juxtaposition of a human’s need to be an individual while still fitting in with a group shapes how a person projects their values in their environment. Overall, the techno-centric world that we live in has produced a human desire of instant gratification in a disposable world, acting as an umbrella over the understandings as to why people like the music that they do.

50|$|In some cases, {{laboratory}} mix-ups (misidentified gametes, {{transfer of}} wrong embryos) have occurred, leading to {{legal action against}} the IVF provider and complex paternity suits. An example {{is the case of}} a woman in California who received the embryo of another couple and was notified of this mistake after the birth of her son. This has led to many authorities and individual clinics implementing procedures to minimise the risk of such mix-ups. The HFEA, for example, requires clinics to use a double <b>witnessing</b> system, the <b>identity</b> of specimens is checked by two people at each point at which specimens are transferred. Alternatively, technological solutions are gaining favour, to reduce the manpower cost of manual double witnessing, and to further reduce risks with uniquely numbered RFID tags which can be identified by readers connected to a computer. The computer tracks specimens throughout the process and alerts the embryologist if non-matching specimens are identified. Although the use of RFID tracking has expanded in the USA, it is still not widely adopted. However, In other cases there has been not mix-up of embryos or gametes, but the intentional use of embryos of another couple or gamete donor, without informed consent of parents, both: receptors or donors. Some of these cases are taking a legal and judicial course.|$|R

This paper aims to analyze the current international system in terms of challenging the U. S. hegemony; the conclusion being favorable to the status-quo. In the first part of this paper, I will make an analysis of the last 20 years of American hegemony. My investigation is based on the concepts of the realistic and liberal theories. Then, based on the imperial overexpansion theory and on the critical theory, I will review the key moments of the American hegemony challenge. The analysis will emphasize the military conflicts in which U. S. were involved since the end of the Cold War and their un-civilizing influence on the international relations. In the last part I will try to evoke the risks of overturning the existing world order, making a parallel with the period before the Second World War. Thus, because of the weakening of the U. S. and the challenges they face, the present economic crisis could find justification for the totalitarian regimes and for the nationalist effervescence which marked the period of the Great Depression of 1932 and the Second World War. In conclusion, I will try to argue a favorable response for the title of this paper...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in many developments that the old cannot coexist with the new especially when our city is under rapidly development pressure for elevating the city competitiveness. Many decayed urban districts have neglected the importance of urban redevelopment. As a result, many featured streetscapes are disappearing. There are many discussions and a huge public noise on protecting some commemorative old districts because those unique streets are our local identities and living cultures. There are two well known urban renewal projects recently - Lee Tung Street and Wing Lee Street. The first one is completely demolished while the second one has escaped from bulldozer thanks for an award-wining film. These two cases exactly indicate that the fate of all decayed districts are either completely demolished or completely preserved. Frankly, it is sad to <b>witness</b> our local <b>identities</b> losing bit by bit, but the decayed urban districts are definitely needed to be regenerated to enhance better living qualities. This thesis aims to examine a landscape approach to reimage a streetscape for Lee Tung Street renewal project, exploring {{in a new way}} to sustain the unique street culture. Intangible value is significant in streetscape. It is an image of a city and a section of a city development history. The demolition of Lee Tung Street has destroyed part of the development history and has erased a section of the city memory. The proposed model aims to reframe the missing link in urban content and to sustain the intangible heritage of Lee Tung Street. published_or_final_versionArchitectureMasterMaster of Landscape Architectur...|$|R

In this project I aim to bring greater understanding of how subjectivities are shaped through embodied experiences of diaspora and the diasporising of home (Brah, 1996). I have explored my own passage from India to Mozambique and finally to Australia, to illustrate in a testimonial way how diaspora can be lived, embodied and experienced in the flesh.

40|$|In the {{following}} thesis, I present The Autobiography of Malcolm X {{as told to}} Alex Haley by Malcolm X and The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin as educational texts that productively open space for student exploration {{of religion in the}} high school classroom. Although similarly celebrated for their leadership and insight during the civil rights and black power movements, Malcolm X and James Baldwin held distinctive views as to the usefulness of religion in ameliorating racial injustice in the United States. For example, the Nation of Islam informed, gave language to, and sustained Malcolm’s perspective on race in America. Following his religious experience, however, Baldwin concluded that religion is a mask behind which we hide from our desire to love dangerously. Baldwin’s account of dangerous love offers a way to understand Malcolm’s second religious conversion, in which he moves closer toward radical reflexivity. Malcolm’s religious transformation models the challenging process of multicultural education, which encourages rearrangement of thought and reassessment of <b>identity.</b> <b>Witnessing</b> this transformation, students too engage in the process of multicultural education by questioning their own narratives of religion. Unlike race and gender, the study of religion is infrequently considered as crucial content in the field of multicultural education. By proposing that students read these texts in tandem to explore the nature of religion, I encourage a rather perplexing learning experience that deeply mystifies the notion of “truth. ” In doing so, I show how the challenge of defining religion is entirely fitting for multicultural education in that it encourages constant questioning, learning through crisis, and critical exploration of self. Finally, I include a tangible resource for educators who are interested in using these texts to discuss religion in the classroom...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} examine how the meaning of {{corporate}} identity was constructed through the corporate advertisements that were published in Nigeria's national press media between 1970 and 2005 by the major operators in the Nigerian banking industry. In order to accomplish this task, this research has been divided into ten chapters. The first chapter introduces the research. It conceptualises a research question and provides an overall trajectory for this thesis. Chapter two established four ontologically grounded reasons for pursuing this research from the social constructionist perspective and chapter three sought {{to examine how}} the meaning of corporate identity was constructed (in theoretical literature) between 1970 and 2008. Chapter four presents {{an analysis of the}} construction of the meaning of the concept of corporate identity in the Nigerian banking industry between 1970 and 2005. Chapter six concerns research methodology and the specific research method drawn to address the question being investigated in this research. Chapters seven and eight presents the empirical findings and chapter nine makes an attempt to establish what has been accomplished in the process of this research by discussing its outcomes. Chapter ten concludes the thesis. It considers the contributions emerging from this research and its implications in terms of relevance for corporate identity theory and practice. In addition, it examines the limitations of the research as well as possible future research directions of this study. Finally, the thesis ends with a summary and conclusion. Findings from this research indicate the emergence of four new scholarships, namely generic, distinctive, innovative and transformative corporate personalities. Importantly, the outcome of this study provides ample evidence to argue that the industry construction of the meaning of corporate <b>identity</b> <b>witnessed</b> an ongoing flow of changes and stabilities, which run through these new scholarships.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} (re) production and circulation of geographical {{knowledge about the}} conjectured Great Southern Continent – {{one of the most}} enduring geographical ideas in the western world {{despite the fact that it}} did not exist, other than in books, maps and the human mind. The study examines how the fantastic Continent managed to survive - and even thrive – as an imaginary in Britain despite the absence of any hard evidence. The selected timeframe 1760 - 1777 covers a period of considerable flux in terms of cultural, imperial and global <b>identities,</b> <b>witnessing</b> a rapid expansion in geographical knowledge, provided in part by the voyages of Captain James Cook and the unprecedented rise of the British popular press who deliver this ‘news’ to the public. Using the twin archives of The Gentleman’s Magazine and daily, tri-weekly and weekly newspapers, this study critically examines the ways in which the landscapes of the Continent were variously imagined, represented and understood by the British public over the final seventeen years of the its ‘life’, ‘death’ and ‘re-birth’ as the Antarctic. Specifically, it interrogates the mechanisms used by the press to (re) produce a public imaginary for the emerging South, and the roles played by the Continent in mid-to-late eighteenth century polite society. The thesis shows how the Continent’s status as an enduring geographical myth renders it an important touchstone in an imaginative global cartography held by the eighteenth century British public. It illustrates how external spaces are powerful constructs for internal identities and epistemologies. The ultimate revelation that this provincea aurea was a barren wilderness of sea and ice triggered arguably one the most important cultural shifts in the Western geographical and imperial imagination since the discovery of the Americas – and, the thesis contends, provided an important proving ground in the battle between traditional scholarly speculation and the empiricism characterising the new scientific method...|$|R
