They also recognised the validity of species such as P. lipidus, P. tienshanensis, and P. sui. A 2004 paper by Chinese paleontologist Tao Deng and colleagues also recognised three distinct genera. Some western writers have similarly used names otherwise considered invalid since the 1989 revision, but <b>without</b> <b>providing</b> detailed analysis and justification.|$|E

5|$|On 1 October, Galbraith {{informed}} Croatian President Franjo Tuđman of {{the plan}} <b>without</b> <b>providing</b> any details. Similarly, Ahrens and Eide informed RSK president Milan Martić. Although early Z-4 Plan negotiations were planned without actually disclosing the plan to Croatia and the RSK, elements {{of the plan}} were leaked to Belgrade and Zagreb newspapers in mid-October. According to Florence Hartmann, in October representatives of Tuđman and those of Serbian president Slobodan Milošević met in Graz, Austria to discuss the proposed reintegration of the RSK into Croatia and {{their opposition to the}} Z-4 Plan. Tuđman disliked the plan because it envisaged a Serb state in Croatia, while Milošević saw it as a dangerous precedent that could be applied to majority non-Serb or ethnically-mixed regions of rump Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo, Vojvodina and the Sandžak.|$|E

Population from {{this research}} is all class X students of State-owned Senior High School of Surakarta Town. Sample in this research is taken with the technique of Cluster Random Sampling Method. Instrument of data collecting used in this research is documentation, questionnaires and test. Technique of analysing the data used in this research is Analysis of Variance of Two Way Classification with Different Cell Frequency. This study concludes that: (1) learning strategy which is provided by the problem posing model of learning is the same effective with the learning strategy <b>without</b> <b>provided</b> by the problem posing model of learning, (2) the mathematics learning achievement of students at high motivation group is better than the mathematics learning achievement of students at the medium motivation group, the mathematics achievement learn of students at high motivation group is better than the mathematics learning achievement of students at low motivation group, and the mathematics achievement learn of students at medium motivation group is better from the mathematics learning achievement of students at low motivation group. (3) at high motivation group, the learning achievement of learning strategy which is provided by the problem posing model of learning is the same with the learning strategy <b>without</b> <b>provided</b> by the problem posing model of learning, (4) at medium motivation group, the learning achievement of learning strategy provided with the problem posing model of learning is the same with the learning strategy <b>without</b> <b>provided</b> by problem posing model of learning, (5) at low motivation group also, the learning achievement of learning strategy provided with the problem posing model of learning is the same with the learning strategy <b>without</b> <b>provided</b> by the problem posing model of learning...|$|R

5|$|After {{three years}} in development, the game was {{progressing}} slowly, and it was unknown {{when it would be}} finished. Activision set a series of deadlines for the project's development to ensure Troika would have sufficient time to effectively test the game, though these milestones were repeatedly extended, and Bloodlines eventually ran over budget. In 2003 Activision intervened, ordering that the game be ready for release in the next few months, and even advancing more money to Troika to complete its work on The Temple of Elemental Evil for Atari, freeing the Troika team to work on Bloodlines exclusively. Activision eventually issued an ultimatum that the project be finished within months, on September 15, 2004. Troika delivered a version of Bloodlines on the required date; due to its scale, the game underwent three weeks of testing. Activision decided that the game was suitable for release, but was contractually bound to withhold Bloodlines until after the debut of Half-Life 2 in November 2004. Troika convinced Activision to use the delay to fund further development; the additional budget was not enough to pay all of Troika's staff, and some employees worked unpaid to complete the project. This version underwent another three weeks of testing to become the final release code; the game was still unfinished when Activision forced its release. Bloodlines creative director Jason Anderson blamed Activision, saying that the publisher took the game from Troika <b>without</b> <b>providing</b> enough time to test and polish it. During the nearly four years of development, he estimated that the team worked overtime for all but two months.|$|E
