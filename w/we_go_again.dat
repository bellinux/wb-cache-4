6000|$|I obeyed her, {{and away}} <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>again,</b> the rain now coming down hard and fast.

6000|$|... "It didn’t take us {{long to get}} aboard agin, and {{the ladies}} fairly mobbed the skipper. Tom Hall swore as ’ow Mrs. Prendergast tried to kiss him, an’ the fuss they made of him was ridiculous. I heard the clang of the {{telegraph}} in the engine-room soon as the boats was hoisted up, the engines started, and off <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|I jumped in, and off <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>again</b> {{over the}} sweet-scented plain,--now {{on a good}} bit of road, now on a bad; often forsaking the track altogether, and {{occasionally}} plunging into holes that knocked our heads against the hood, and tried our springs to the uttermost, till evening at last found us among the hills, where a rough-and-ready inn afforded us shelter for the night.|$|R
60|$|On <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>again</b> bearing with us the god's skin, having first {{stuffed the}} head, {{hands and feet}} (these, I mean the hands and feet, had been cleaned out by the ants) with wet moss in order to {{preserve}} their shape. It was no light burden, at least so declared Brother John and Hans, who bore it between them upon a dead bough from the fallen tree.|$|R
500|$|For Lovato's second studio album, Here <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Again,</b> Jeff Miers from The Buffalo News wrote, [...] "Unlike {{so many of}} her Disney-fied peers, Lovato {{can really}} sing... {{refreshing}} [...] to mask any lack of natural ability." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{her first}} studio album, Don't Forget, Lovato did not {{collaborate}} with the Jonas Brothers on Here <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Again</b> as {{she wanted to}} see what her sound would be like without their input. [...] "They were the only people I'd ever written with. Once I wrote with different people, I wanted to go with that", she told the New York Daily News. She said that her first album was [...] "very Jonas" [...] and that Here <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Again</b> is [...] "a little bit more like what's coming from my heart. It's more me." [...] However, Lovato did work with Nick Jonas on the song [...] "Stop the World". The majority of the album was produced by John Fields, who also handled production on Don't Forget. Other tracks were produced by SuperSpy, Gary Clark, Andy Dodd and Adam Watts. [...] "Catch Me" [...] is the only song on the album for which Lovato received sole writing credit. In an interview with The New York Times, she revealed that she wrote it in her room and that it means more to her {{than the rest of the}} album.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Simon Vozick-Levinson graded {{the album}} B− and praised the [...] "hard-edged" [...] tracks such as [...] "Got Dynamite", calling them {{suggestions}} of [...] "a direction that might set her apart {{in years to}} come". Houston Chronicle critic Joey Guerra rated the album three stars and wrote: [...] "Despite the Disney machine's presence, Here <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Again</b> doesn't rely too heavily on 'tween trends, instead relying on Lovato's penchant for rock-drama and teaming her with a slew of older, established acts." [...] Kerri Mason of Billboard praised the album for not relying heavily on production and Auto-Tune, calling Lovato [...] "a natural talent who could really take flight after outgrowing Disney". Mason wrote that the album includes [...] "quiet surprises" [...] and potential hits, particularly praising the title track and [...] "Catch Me". Jeff Miers from The Buffalo News rated Here <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Again</b> {{two and a half}} stars out of four, writing: [...] "Unlike so many of her Disney-fied peers, Lovato can really sing, and part of what makes her sophomore effort appealing is the lack of in-studio vocal manipulation." [...] Miers wrote that it is [...] "refreshing" [...] that Lovato does not need Auto-Tune [...] "to mask any lack of natural ability". He concluded by calling the album [...] "safe and pretty predictable, but also incredibly catchy".|$|E
500|$|... "Here We Go Again" [...] {{is a song}} {{performed}} by American singer Demi Lovato. It was written by Isaac Hasson, Lindy Robbins and Mher Filian and produced by SuperSpy, for Lovato's second studio album of the same name. It was released as the album's lead single on June 23, 2009, through Hollywood Records. The song was the only single from Here <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Again</b> released in North America. [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] is a power pop song with guitar lines and pop hooks and the lyrics speak of the protagonist's on-off relationship with a hesitant boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|...

60|$|We cantered on {{over the}} plain, till the garden and the farm looked in the {{distance}} like ships at sea, and rode among the bushes that crowned a rising ground. We set up some guinea-fowl and other birds, and startled a hare, but let them go, as our aim was steenboks. The little boks, however, {{were not on the}} knoll that day, so away <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>again</b> at a gallop until the garden and the farm went down on the horizon.|$|R

500|$|... "Remember December" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Demi Lovato for her second studio album, Here <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Again.</b> It was written by John Fields, Lovato and Anne Preven, and produced by Fields. The song was released in Europe as the album's second and final single on January 18, 2010 through Hollywood Records. [...] "Remember December" [...] adapts power pop and synthpop genres and diverges from Lovato's usual pop rock sound. The lyrics describe the protagonist's attempt to remind her boyfriend of the good times of their relationship. Lovato described the song's sound {{as an example of}} what she wanted her future music to sound like.|$|E
500|$|Allison Stewart of The Washington Post {{referred}} {{the album}} to as a [...] "smart, bristly, busy sophomore disc", writing that [...] "Too {{much of it}} apes Avril Lavigne, with the standard shouted choruses and hiccupped verses that are beginning to sound very '03." [...] Stewart named [...] "Every Time You Lie" [...] and [...] "World of Chances" [...] as [...] "direction signs pointing to a much more interesting career". Awarding the album five out of ten points, Cody Miller of PopMatters was mixed in his review and said that Lovato [...] "desperately wants to be Kelly Clarkson", writing [...] "Lovato can't work miracles with mediocre pop songs like Clarkson, but the young singer-actress has a bigger range than any of her contemporaries, and {{a better sense of}} on-record charisma." [...] Miller was mixed regarding album's content, saying that [...] "there's nothing that really separates the tracks from each other. Most of the album's up-tempo numbers just blend together." [...] He concluded his review: [...] "Here <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Again</b> isn't perfect by any means, and when compared to someone like Clarkson or Pink, it's obvious the young singer has lots of work ahead of her if she wants to truly cement herself as a serious, viable pop/rock artist outside of the Disney mold. But given the context, Here <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Again</b> is certainly enjoyable to some scale." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album 3 stars out of five, saying [...] "Lovato has chops and spunk akin to a fellow Texas pop singer, though her voice doesn't churn with Kelly Clarkson's gutsy heart yet." ...|$|E

60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>again</b> to the {{hospital}} we saw a nursing sister. She told us that Blanche seemed a little better, and she went in to ask if she would see her husband.
