5|$|For Halloween II, Zombie {{decided to}} focus more on the {{connection}} between Laurie and Michael, and the idea they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of Halloween II, it is about change. Zombie wanted to look at how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and Michael, and provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the e¤ects of anti-speculative taxation on the short-term carry trade in Asian emerging market countries {{by building a}} simple welfare-based insurance model <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Tobin <b>tax.</b> This model provides the optimal level of international reserves <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Tobin <b>tax</b> in Asian emerging market economies and shows that <b>a</b> Tobin <b>tax</b> on the short-term carry trade improves {{the welfare of the}} economies. In addition, the model explains that <b>a</b> Tobin <b>tax</b> is the key solution to the puzzle of the excessive accumulation of international reserves in Asian emerging market economies. <b>A</b> Tobin <b>tax</b> is operating as a self-insurance tool from the severe damage of sudden stops of capital inows during a 8 ̆ 5 nancial crisis.

This system persisted, with minor modifications, until India's independence in 1947. Under this new system, the malangis sold the salt to the agents at a particular price, initially fixed at 2 rupees a maund <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> of 1.1 to 1.5 rupees a maund.

In the Tyrolean state election on 8 June 2008 the former ÖVP member Fritz Dinkhauser led his newly founded Citizens' Forum Tyrol to become the second-largest party, causing large losses to ÖVP and SPÖ and small losses to the Greens. Following this, internal criticism within the SPÖ of Gusenbauer grew, leading to the decision to designate infrastructure minister Werner Faymann as its new party leader.
