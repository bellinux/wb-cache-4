50|$|To gain {{membership}} of the EU, the Council of Ministers must agree (by unanimous vote) to open negotiations. Prospective countries must then adopt, implement and enforce all existing EU laws which are divided into 35 fields (chapters). Before closing each chapter (that is, confirming a country's compliance with those laws), it must be agreed unanimously at the Council of Ministers. As responsibility for presenting a country as ready for negotiations to start or that a chapter has been closed, the President of the European Commission is able to influence the process. Junker confirmed that no more enlargement will occur before 2019 (although negotiations <b>will</b> <b>continue).</b> <b>After</b> <b>this</b> time enlargement may continue.|$|E

At hand was a new media task: with creative freedom, redesign the SJR’s website to fit {{the parameters of the}} new management, with considerations for the challenged journalism industry, its principles, workflow, the guidelines of web development and visual communication, and a budget. The website and which software to use became critical points in this attempt to streamline old school journalism with new media practices. The objective was to simplify content delivery for the reader and the writer or publisher, both visually and practically, while experimenting with new ways to help SJR profit. The result extends the literature on the uses of Wordpress as journalism and media production evolve...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal for}} this work was to aid the process of {{designing}} EPS for ESTCube- 2. The larger satellite needs more power and therefor the EPS of ESTCube- 2 in not sufficient. During the process of this work following goals were achieved: *Easy to use testing platform to speed the testing of voltage converters was designed and manufactured; *Software to control and record data from this platform was designed; *The measurement range of the testing platform was validated and calibrated; *Four voltage converter testing modules were designed and manufactured; *Efficiency of these converters was measured; *Efficiency of these converters in load balancing mode was measured providing data of the efficiency of balancing circuit; The data collected from both tests provides valuable information for future tests. Based on current data, the best overall performance was seen with the LTC 3603 voltage converter. The same chip also showed the smoothest performance with the load balancing circuit. The testing <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>after</b> defending <b>this</b> thesis. Further testing must be concluded to determine parameters like converter output ripple, emission of EMI and behavior in temperature chamber...|$|R
40|$|To {{address the}} {{scientific}} {{objectives of the}} project we have successfully applied for substantial amounts of observing time with ROSAT which are accompanied by observations with earthbound telescopes and with IUE. Data analysis and publication of the results <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> grant has ended. A first analysis of pointed ROSAT observations has revealed that besides the regular accretion a hitherto unknown burst-like accretion onto magnetic white dwarfs exists. A theoretical interpretation of these soft X-ray bursts is still pending. The ROSAT all-sky survey and subsequent optical identification work has doubled the census of known AM Her systems. We expect that further analysis of these systems will significantly improve the physical understanding of accretion onto magnetic white dwarfs. After these initial studies the project was terminated in Berlin and will be continued in Goettingen with the same staff (reference no. 50 OR 9210) Available from TIB Hannover: D. Dt.

40|$|Some {{people believe}} that betting and {{gambling}} {{will be one of}} the major parts of mobile commerce (m-commerce). Many betting situations are dependent on correct and timely information. This information does not necessarily have to be formalized. This is one of the reasons why people who bet at a trotting track is an interesting group to study. One other interesting aspect of this is that the track is a mobile context, which the player visits for a limited time and during this visit wanders between different places. The purpose of this master thesis is to answer the following question: is a mobile information service a way to lower the transaction costs for retrieving information connected to gambling at a trotting track. The theoretical framework is based on theories from e-commerce, marketing and mobility and mobile IT use. In order to answer our question we have conducted an ethnographical inspired study at the Åby Trotting Track in Mölndal. Our results have indicated that there are two general types of information, official and unofficial. It is also possible to divide the players into two general categories depending on the number of information sources used and how this information was used in order to make the betting decision. One another important finding is that there is a need for a personalization of the information that origins from official channels. Based on our findings we have conducted the first two steps in developing a prototype. A web based trotting service (Trotting Pal) designed for Ipaq handheld computers has been designed. The development of this prototype <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> master thesis has been completed. From our results we draw the conclusion that a mobile service can lower the transaction costs that arise in connection to information search. A mobile service also gives the possibility to personalization of the official information and at the same time makes it easier to spread and obtain unofficial information...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to find a}} new gasket {{material}} to be used in frequency converters manufactured by ABB. The new material has to comply to RoHS directive, because this material is going to replace the currently used material, which is not RoHS compliant. The material is going to be used in conditions, where it may be subjected to chemicals and especially oils, so it should have a good resistance to both. In addition to finding the material, this thesis considers factors affecting elastomer’s swelling in oil. Some requirements were set for the gasket material. The hardness of the material should not be over 60 Shore A and its tear strength should not be less than 23 kN/m. The material should also have a fire classification minimum of V 1. The most important criterion was the oil resistance. Gasket material should not swell more than 25 percent from its initial volume when immersed in oil. The literature part of this thesis consists of introducing four material groups which have such properties which are required from the gasket material and considers those properties. These four groups are thermoplastic polyurethanes, styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene, thermoplastic vulcanizate elastomers and co-polyester based elasto-mers. The literature part also discusses the factors which help estimate the amount of swelling based on the structure of the thermoplastic elastomer. The experiment part of this thesis introduces immersion tests which have been used to determine oil resistance of the test materials. Six materials were tested, the names of the materials are confidential, they are coded to be Materials A, B, C, D, E and F. From these results, the best suited material for the new gasket material was elected. Also from the results, it was possible to determine dependence of swelling on volume, area, vo-lume/area ratio and density of the sample. One suitable material was found in addition to a few others that require more test-ing. The only geometrical factor found to contribute materials swelling was volume/area ratio. Once the graph is made for a certain material, it helps to predict the swelling of a sample with a certain volume/area ratio made from the same material. The tests made for this thesis <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> thesis is completed. Some new sample geometries and new materials will be tested. /Kir 1...|$|E
