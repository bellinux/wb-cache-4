5|$|Numerous smaller strikes {{occurred}} in the Congo later in the war, though not on the same scale as in 1941. In 1944 strikes broke out in Katanga and Kasaï, provoked by the conscription of workers for the mines and deteriorating <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> In 1945, riots and strikes occurred among the black dockworkers in {{the port city of}} Matadi.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{families}} were {{banished from the}} Palm Island in 1957 for {{taking part in a}} strike organised to protest against the Dickensian <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> imposed by the Queensland Government under the reserve system. Athlete Cathy Freeman's mother, Cecilia Barber, and the family of strike ringleader Frederick William Doolan including Billy Doolan Jnr. were among those banished from the island.|$|E
40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} systems {{are widely used}} to monitor the <b>working</b> <b>condition</b> of equipment, generating a vast amount and variety of telemetry data in the process. The main task of surveillance focuses on analyzing these routinely collected telemetry data to help analyze the <b>working</b> <b>condition</b> in the equipment. However, with the rapid increase in the volume of telemetry data, it is a nontrivial task to analyze all the telemetry data to understand the <b>working</b> <b>condition</b> of the equipment without any a priori knowledge. In this paper, we proposed a probabilistic generative model called <b>working</b> <b>condition</b> model (WCM), which is capable of simulating the process of event sequence data generated and depicting the <b>working</b> <b>condition</b> of equipment at runtime. With the help of WCM, {{we are able to}} analyze how the event sequence data behave in different working modes and meanwhile to detect the working mode of an event sequence (<b>working</b> <b>condition</b> diagnosis). Furthermore, we have applied WCM to illustrative applications like automated detection of an anomalous event sequence for the runtime of equipment. Our experimental results on the real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: By using {{particle}} flow code (PFC 2 D), influence {{mechanism of}} isolation layer to granular media flow was studied by simulating two ore-drawing modes of filling mining method (<b>working</b> <b>condition</b> I) and synchronous filling shrinkage method(working condition II). After analyzed simulation results, some laws were gotten: (1) by the fitting process conducted on released volume and height, {{it is found}} that the relationship of released volume and height was power equation, which is same as the stochastic medium theory for ore-drawing; (2) The released volume, the size in most width of loosing body and the location of <b>working</b> <b>condition</b> II was both bigger than those of <b>working</b> <b>condition</b> I; (3) the radius of curvature of drawn-funnel of <b>working</b> <b>condition</b> II was bigger than those of <b>working</b> <b>condition</b> I, but the volume of residual ore was opposite. Analysis shows that the isolation layer reduced the contact force in ore drawing regional, made the porosity bigger, so as to improve liquidity. The results provide a theoretical reference for the changes in underground mining techniques and ore-drawing control...|$|R
5|$|The Nation Alliance Party was {{guided by}} a support for multiculturalism. Specifically, the party sought to {{increase}} translation services for people who could not read or speak English or people whose first language is not English, equivalency of academic standards, more supportive immigration services that assist transition into Canadian society, and better <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> for recent immigrants and migrant labourers.|$|E

5|$|The women {{worked from}} 8:30a.m. to 3:30p.m. daily – not long hours – but the <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> were {{probably}} unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost {{attention to the}} scales' balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets the women would file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in a very hot working environment. Workers relied on water coolers to provide relief {{from the heat and}} avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> than many other American women workers in the late nineteenth century.|$|E

However, further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of One World Trade Center, including 34 not reported to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Workers also left post-9/11-related graffiti at the site, which are supposed to symbolize rebirth and resilience.|$|E

5|$|Although Du Bois {{generally}} endorsed socialist principles, {{his politics}} were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, Du Bois endorsed Democrat Jimmy Walker {{for mayor of}} New York, rather than the socialist Norman Thomas, believing that Walker could do more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views. Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support {{back and forth between}} the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve <b>working</b> <b>conditions,</b> or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{increase}} in jobs for women has had benefits in policy changes for families with working parents, there has been debates about {{the conditions of the}} work places. In Mexico, there is an influx of the maquila industry, which produces products that will be sold in the developed nations. The mostly female workforce is often exploited by having unsafe <b>working</b> <b>conditions,</b> and stress is a major cause of many illnesses of these women.|$|E

5|$|By {{becoming}} chef de canton, Houphouët assumed {{responsibility for}} the administration of Akouè, a canton which comprised 36 villages. He also {{took charge of the}} family plantation—at the time {{one of the most important}} in the country—and worked to diversify its rubber, cocoa and coffee crops. He soon became one of Africa's richest farmers. On 3 September 1944, he established, in cooperation with the colonial administration, the African Agricultural Union (Syndicat agricole africain, SAA). Under his presidency, the SAA brought together African farmers who were dissatisfied with their <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> and worked to protect their interests against those of European planters. Anti-colonialist and anti-racist, the organisation demanded better <b>working</b> <b>conditions,</b> higher wages, and the abolition of unfree labor. The union quickly received the support of nearly 20,000 plantation workers, together with that of the left-wing French administrators placed in office by the Provisional Government. Its success irritated colonists to the extent that they took legal action against Houphouët, accusing him of being anti-French for never seeking French citizenship. However, Houphouët befriended the Inspector Minister of the Colonies, who ordered the charges dropped. They were more successful in obtaining the replacement of the sympathetic Governor André Latrille with the hostile Governor Henry de Mauduit.|$|E
5|$|Development of Panzer Dragoon Saga began {{around the}} same time as its predecessor, Panzer Dragoon II Zwei (1996). According to {{director}} Yukio Futatsugi, the need to blend the series' shooting elements into an RPG with full 3D and voice acting, unusual for RPGs at the time, made it the most difficult Panzer Dragoon game to develop. Two staff members died during its two-year development, which Futatsugi attributed to the stressful <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> of the video game industry.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, the Massachusetts {{legislature}} transferred {{control of}} the Boston police department from Boston's mayor to the governor of Massachusetts, whom it authorized to appoint a five-person board of commissioners to manage the department. In 1906, the legislature abolished that board and gave the governor the authority to name a single commissioner to a term of five years, subject to removal by the governor. The mayor and the city continued to have responsibility for the department's expenses and the physical <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> of its employees, but the commissioner controlled department operations and the hiring, training, and discipline of the police officers.|$|E

5|$|In the Boston Police Strike, Boston police {{officers}} {{went on strike}} on September 9, 1919.

Attempts at reconciliation between the Commissioner and the police officers, particularly {{on the part of}} Boston's Mayor Andrew James Peters, failed.|$|E
