500|$|For me, in my {{mind the}} {{accomplishment}} is just that much sweeter. In terms of my ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me it's about saying, 'Thank you Lord, for giving me the faith to believe in myself when other people had written me off.' I've gone through enough of my life worrying {{about that kind of}} thing. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> anyone else out there who feels like maybe they can't overcome an obstacle, I feel like I'm living proof ... never lose your faith. I'm seriously a grateful individual right now.|$|E
500|$|American {{publishers}} of Tintin in America were uneasy regarding {{the scene in}} which the Blackfoot Natives are forcibly removed from their land. Hergé nevertheless refused to remove it. For the 1973 edition published in the U.S., the publishers made Hergé remove African-American characters from the book, and redraw them as Caucasians or Hispanics, {{because they did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> racial integration among children. That same year, the original black-and-white version was republished in a French-language collected volume with Tintin in the Land of the Soviets and Tintin in the Congo, {{the first part of the}} [...] collection. In 1983, a facsimile of the original was published by Casterman.|$|E
500|$|A year later, on 6 November 2007, Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{unveiled}} the government's plans in his Queen's Speech. The plans included the duty {{for parents to}} assist their children in education or training participation until the date of their 18th birthday, as well as detailing proposed moves to reform the apprenticeship system and to improve achievement for children in care. The Education and Skills Act 2008, when it came into force in the 2013 academic year, initially required participation {{in some form of}} education or training until the school year in which the child turned 17, followed by the age being raised to the young person's 18th birthday in 2015. This was referred to as raising the [...] "participation age" [...] to distinguish it from the school leaving age which remains at 16. To qualify as participation the young person must be in education or training for the equivalent of one day a week (at a minimum). The local council is responsible for ensuring that a suitable place is available. The Act makes similar powers available to the National Assembly for Wales. A spokesperson for the Welsh Assembly indicated that it would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> more young people to stay in education, but without compulsion, so school leavers there are not required to continue with any education or training.|$|E

2500|$|As a result, {{a lively}} debate has arisen in Israel about the Falash Mura, mainly between the Beta Israel {{community}} in Israel {{and their supporters}} and those opposed to a potential massive emigration of the Falash Mura people. The government's position on the matter remained quite restrictive, {{but it has been}} subject to numerous criticisms, including criticisms by some clerics who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> these people's return to Judaism [...]|$|E
2500|$|However, concerted {{efforts have}} been made by local community, church and {{political}} leaders from both traditions to redress the problem. A conference to bring together key actors and promote tolerance was held in October 2006. The Rt Rev. Dr Ken Good, the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, said he was happy living on the cityside. [...] "I feel part of it. It is my city and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> other Protestants to feel exactly the same", he said.|$|E
2500|$|This {{created a}} serious problem for Scott. He was troubled by the sweep of guilty verdicts. He {{did not want to}} {{alienate}} the Mexican public, who by now had made the deserters national heroes. Nor did he <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> insurgency among the Mexican people that would weaken his pacification program in progress. He also knew that the deserters were Irish-born Catholics, who had deserted Taylor's army because they allegedly felt mistreated and had witnessed atrocities [...] "sufficient to make Heaven weep" [...] against fellow Catholics, the Mexicans. In response to these, in 1847, Scott ordered that Protestants respect Catholic ceremonies.|$|E

2500|$|Support {{from the}} National Library was keenly sought, {{as it would}} allow access to [...] "practically every library in the dominion." [...] However this support was qualified: the National Library did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> [...] "cheap reading" [...] of genre books, such as romance, westerns and detective stories. [...] In the event, when Birkenhead opened nearly half the books present were on {{extended}} loan from the National Library. Their [...] "field librarians" [...] continued to provide a regular infusion of books into the Birkenhead collection {{two or three times}} a year, for at least a decade. Topics were diverse, from gardening, music, occupations and hobbies, to art, agriculture and home management. Junior books were added in 1953.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2005, Adler's Appetite—minus Brent Muscat, who had {{departed}} the band—released through their official website a self-titled EP, which featured four original songs and the covers [...] "Hollywood" [...] by Thin Lizzy and [...] "Draw the Line" [...] by Aerosmith. The release {{was followed by}} a tour of the US, Europe, Japan, and Argentina. Later that year, the band announced plans to release a full-length album through Shrapnel Records, but it failed to materialize. In July 2007, the group played another show at the Key Club, as part of their tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of Appetite for Destruction, during which they were joined on stage by former Guns N' Roses members Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan. Although Slash was also in attendance, he did not join the band on stage, stating that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> the notion of a Guns N' Roses reunion.|$|E
2500|$|Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay joined Harper in reiterating {{support for}} Israel's {{position}} and urging restraint while {{calling for a}} ceasefire.

And a resolution will only be achieved when everyone gets to the table and everyone admits... recognition of each other," [...] referring to the refusal of Hezbollah and Hamas to recognize Israel's right to exist. Harper laid the blame for the civilian deaths on both sides at the feet of Hezbollah. [...] "Hezbollah's objective is violence," [...] Harper asserted, [...] "Hezbollah believes that through violence it can create, it can bring about the destruction of Israel. Violence will not bring about the destruction of Israel... and inevitably the result of the violence will be the deaths primarily of innocent people.".|$|E

6000|$|... "You shall see. There {{is no such}} {{creature}} as {{a perfectly}} consistent human being {{on the face of}} the earth--and, strange as it may seem to you, the human beings themselves are not aware of it. The reason for this curious state of things is not far to seek. How can people who are ignorant--as we see every day--of their own characters be capable of correctly estimating the characters of others? Even the influence of their religion fails to open their eyes to the truth. In the Prayer which is the most precious possession of Christendom, their lips repeat the entreaty that they may not be led into temptation--but their minds fail to draw the inference. If that pathetic petition means anything, it means that virtuous men and women are capable of becoming vicious men and women, if a powerful temptation puts them to the test. Every Sunday, devout members of the congregation in church--models of excellence in their own estimation, and in the estimation of their neighbours--declare that they have done those things which they ought not to have done, and that there is no health in them. Will you believe that they are encouraged by their Prayer-books to present this sad exposure of the frailty of their own admirable characters? How inconsistent--and yet how entirely true! Lord Harry, as you rightly say, behaved nobly in trying to save my dear lost brother. He ought, as you think, and as other people think, to be consistently noble, after that, in all his thoughts and actions, to the end of his life. Suppose that temptation does try him--such temptation, Iris, as you innocently present--why doesn't he offer a superhuman resistance? You might as well ask, Why is he a mortal man? How inconsistent, how improbable, that he should have tendencies to evil in him, as well as tendencies to good! Ah, I see you don't like this. It would be infinitely more agreeable (wouldn't it?) if Lord Harry was one of the entirely consistent characters which are sometimes presented in works of fiction. Our good English readers are charmed with the man, the woman, or the child, who is introduced to them by the kind novelist as a being without faults. Do they stop to consider whether this is a true picture of humanity? It would be a terrible day for the book if they ever did that. But the book is in no danger. The readers would even fail to discover the falseness of the picture, if they were presented to themselves as perfect characters. 'We mustn't say so, but how wonderfully like us!' There would be the only impression produced. I am not trying to dishearten you; I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> you to look at humanity from a wider and truer point of view. Do not be too readily depressed, if you find your faith shaken in a person whom you have hitherto believed to be good. That person has been led into temptation. Wait till time shows you that the evil influence is not everlasting, and that the good influence will inconsistently renew your faith out of the very depths of your despair. Humanity, in general, is neither perfectly good nor perfectly wicked: take it as you find it. Is this a hard lesson to learn? Well! it's easy to do what other people do, under similar circumstances. Listen to the unwelcome truth to-day, my dear; and forget it to-morrow." ...|$|E
