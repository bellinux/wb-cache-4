In {{order to}} design {{trapezoidal}} thread parameters of co-rotating twin screw extruder {{that is used}} in non-fused materials processing, based on geometry of fully wiped co-rotating twin screw extruder by M.

Experiments show that a co-rotating twin screw pulping extruder of trapezoidal thread designed by the method is easier to machine and measure, and pulp processed by the twin screw pulping extruder can meet the quality requirements.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{proposes a}} method to measure {{geographical}} risk from tsunami run-up events based on socioeconomic-environmental data. The physical exposure of Japan to tsunami run-up events is computed based upon 1 -km grid square statistics from the population census of the Japanese Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication, 1 -km grid square national land numerical information downloaded from the National and Regional Policy Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, and tsunami run-up catalog data downloaded from NOAA Tsunami Data and Information. Using estimates of physical exposure in each 1 -km square grid, we define the physical exposure of potential passengers and freight as the sum of physical exposures over the area close to an airport. Information on Japanese domestic air transportation is further extracted as a network consisting <b>of</b> airports and <b>flights.</b> Using an exposed value as the sum <b>of</b> passengers <b>of</b> <b>flights</b> <b>landing</b> at and taking off from each airport and the sum of freight weight at each airport, we compute values of the physical exposure of both confluence and logistics for 86 Japanese airports in terms of tsunami run-up events...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, higher-efficiency jet {{aircraft}} with longer-range capabilities lessened {{the use of}} Wake Island Airfield as a refueling stop and the number <b>of</b> commercial <b>flights</b> <b>landing</b> at Wake declined sharply. Pan Am had replaced many of their Boeing 707s with more efficient 747s thus eliminating the need to continue weekly stops at Wake Island. Other airlines began to eliminate their scheduled flights into Wake. In June 1972, the last scheduled Pan Am passenger <b>flight</b> <b>landed</b> at Wake and in July, Pan Am's last cargo flight departed the island, marking {{the end of the}} heyday of Wake Island's commercial aviation history. During this same time period, the U.S. military had transitioned to longer-range C-5A and C-141 aircraft leaving the C-130 as the only aircraft that would continue to regularly use the island's airfield. The steady decrease in air traffic control activities at Wake Island was apparent and was expected to continue into the future.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to discuss the problem of {{theoretical}} justification of practical recommendations to sea- plane crews. These recommendations are aimed at increasing flight safety (Be- 200 as an example). In the article the authors consider the method of evaluation of wave-profile for Be- 200 flight safety at take off and on landing and during water ma- neuvering. The article deals with operational limits at take off and landing on rough surface of the sea. The increase of a wave length causes the overloading and instability while take off rolling or rollout. It is proved that when the ratio is (1. 15 - 1. 20) a wave length and a body of a plane, the stability may be unbalanced to such an extent that overloads and rebounds will be of maximum values according to aircraft operational conditions. The article deals with peculiarities <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> with <b>landing</b> on the rough sea. Besides the authors consider the peculi- arities <b>of</b> <b>flights</b> with sea <b>landing</b> on the long waves of ripple. The article also deals with the factors needed to be taken into consideration when choosing take off and landing direction. The rules of pilot’s evaluation of the sea roughness from the board of the plane are given in the article...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} market-based {{approach}} to the Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) problem. The goods in our market are delays and buyers are airline companies; the latter pay money to the FAA to buy away the desired amount of delay on a per flight basis. We give a notion of equilibrium for this market and an LP whose solution gives an equilibrium allocation <b>of</b> <b>flights</b> to <b>landing</b> slots as well as equilibrium prices for the landing slots. Via a reduction to matching, we show that this equilibrium can be computed combinatorially in strongly polynomial time. Moreover, {{there is a special}} set of equilibrium prices, which can be computed easily, that is identical to the VCG solution, and therefore the market is incentive compatible in dominant strategy. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Amsterdam at 12:19 pm. 11 minutes after takeoff, at 12:30 pm, the crew mistakenly believed that the number 2 engine suffered from low oil pressure because of a faulty warning light.

On short final (the last stage <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> before <b>landing),</b> at a height of 90 feet, the captain decided to go-around (abort the landing and try again) and gave full throttle.
