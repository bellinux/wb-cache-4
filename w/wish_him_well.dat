5|$|The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover are two 1910 American silent short comedies {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Both films were originally released together on a single reel and are two distinct and separate subjects. The Girls He Left Behind Him focuses on a young man, Jack Redfern, who receives a letter from an old sweetheart of his. This prompts him to reminiscence about all the girls he has had affections for {{on the eve of}} his wedding. All the old sweethearts of his life then appear at his wedding to <b>wish</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b> The Iron Clad Lover concerns two suitors who are vying for the affections of Bessie. Tom, who plays a game of chess with her father, ends up quarreling with him and he is thrown out of the house. The next day, Tom attempts to bring flowers and candy for Bessie's birthday, but is dismissed by the angry father. Tom decides to dress up in a suit of armor and ends up breaking a vase when trying to announce himself. The suit of armor is thrown out and Bessie and the other suitor chase down the junk dealer to free Tom from the suit of armor. Both films were released on December 9, 1910 and were met with positive reviews by The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|Lü Meng {{rejected}} the coins and gold, but Sun Quan {{insisted that he}} accept. He became ill again before he was enfeoffed as a marquis. Sun Quan was at Gong'an County then so he had Lü Meng brought to his personal residence to stay with him. He also offered 1,000 jin of gold as a reward to any person who could cure Lü Meng. Sun Quan became more worried as Lü Meng's condition deteriorated over time. He wanted to see Lü Meng but {{felt that it was}} too troublesome to keep moving around, so he had a hole drilled in the wall to observe Lü Meng's room. He was happy when he saw Lü Meng having his meals, but could not sleep at night when he saw that Lü Meng did not eat anything. When Lü Meng's condition improved slightly, he was so happy that he ordered his subjects to visit Lü Meng and <b>wish</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b> He even invited Taoist priests to perform rituals to increase Lü Meng's lifespan. Despite Sun Quan's efforts, Lü Meng eventually died in Gong'an County at the age of 42 (by East Asian age reckoning). Sun Quan was extremely grieved by Lü Meng's death. Before Lü Meng died, he had instructed his family to store all their priced possessions – including gifts from Sun Quan – in a vault and return them to his lord after his death. He had also asked for a simple funeral. Sun Quan felt even more sad when found out that Lü Meng had made such arrangements before his death.|$|E

500|$|The Tampa Bay Lightning hired Oates as an {{assistant}} coach in the 2009–10 season where he worked with the team's offense. Under his guidance, the team's power play finished ninth in the league and he was credited with playing a significant role in Steven Stamkos's offensive development. Oates then joined the New Jersey Devils in 2010 where he served an additional two years as {{an assistant}} coach, helping the team reach the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals, which they lost to the Los Angeles Kings in six games. New Jersey's General Manager, Lou Lamoriello, praised Oates' work with the team: [...] "He did an outstanding job for us. I <b>wish</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b> He's very communicative, very intelligent, he explains things very well. He has the resume behind him as a player and having the success he had – all the credentials are there for having the kind of respect players have for him." ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson did, however, receive {{significant}} {{encouragement from}} several major league players. Robinson named Lee [...] "Jeep" [...] Handley, {{who played for}} the Phillies at the time, as the first opposing player to <b>wish</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b> Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese once came to Robinson's defense with the famous line, [...] "You can hate a man for many reasons. Color {{is not one of}} them." [...] In 1948, Reese put his arm around Robinson in response to fans who shouted racial slurs at Robinson before a game in Cincinnati. A statue by sculptor William Behrends, unveiled at KeySpan Park on November 1, 2005, commemorates this event by representing Reese with his arm around Robinson. Jewish baseball star Hank Greenberg, who had to deal with racial epithets during his career, also encouraged Robinson. Following an incident where Greenberg collided with Robinson at first base, he [...] "whispered a few words into Robinson's ear", which Robinson later characterized as [...] "words of encouragement." [...] Greenberg had advised him to overcome his critics by defeating them in games. Robinson also talked frequently with Larry Doby, who endured his own hardships since becoming the first black player in the American League with the Cleveland Indians, as the two spoke to one another via telephone throughout the season.|$|E

He returned to England {{later in the}} year to play for Witton Albion in the Northern Premier League Division One North, and left the club upon the expiry of his contract on 31 December. In June 2016, Roberts returned to the Welsh Premier League to play for Bangor City. He signed a contract extension four months later. The [...] "Citizens" [...] finished in fourth-place in 2016–17, and qualified for the UEFA Europa League after beating Cardiff Metropolitan University 1–0 in the play-off final; Roberts said [...] "It means everything to the club [...] We’ve worked hard as a unit, not just the players but all the staff". He credited the club with turning his life around and helping him to overcome his drink and gambling problems. However he left the club in July 2017 after having his contract cancelled; Bangor City made a statement to say [...] "when a player states in the week leading up to a massive European game that he no longer wants to play for the club, we were left with no alternative other than to release him from his contract. We <b>wish</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> for the future, and hope that one day he realises what a massive opportunity he has given up." ...|$|E

[...] "Grim" [...] was Powell's response when he was asked what he thought of Thatcher's victory because he believed she would renege like Heath did in 1972. During the election campaign, Thatcher, when questioned, again repeated her vow {{that there would be no}} position for Powell in her cabinet if the Conservatives won the forthcoming general election. In the days after the election, Powell wrote to Callaghan to commiserate on his defeat, paid tribute to his reign and to <b>wish</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On December 13, 2009, Marshall broke Terrell Owens' {{record for}} receptions {{in a game}} with 21, {{as part of a}} 28–16 road loss to the Indianapolis Colts. Owens said, [...] "No more deserving of a guy than he is. He's just been a hard worker....I <b>wish</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b> He's going to have a great career." [...] Marshall became the first player since 1960 to record eight career games of at least 10 catches in his first four seasons. During the game against the Colts, he also had two touchdowns and a career-high 200 {{receiving}} yards. Marshall's performance earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors {{for the second time in}} his career.|$|E

2500|$|The season {{would prove}} to be the NHA's last. The owners of the Canadiens, Wanderers, Senators and Bulldogs wanted nothing more to do with Livingstone, but {{discovered}} the NHA constitution did not allow them to simply expel him from the league. [...] Instead, they met in November 1917 to suspend the NHA's operations and then formed the National Hockey League so that they could continue the business of pro hockey without Livingstone. Every owner except Livingstone was granted a franchise in the NHL and the NHA contracts transferred. The NHL also continued to used the same rules and season format as the NHA, with the NHL champion now moving on to face the PCHA champion in the Stanley Cup final. Wanderers owner Sam Lichtenhein was quoted as saying, [...] "We didn't throw Livingstone out; he's still got his franchise in the old National Hockey Association. [...] He has his team, and we <b>wish</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b> [...] The only problem is he's playing in a one-team league." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martin's {{departure}} {{generated a}} severe backlash from Martin's supporters, who controlled {{much of the}} party machinery, and all signs {{indicated that they were}} prepared to oust Chrétien at a leadership review in February 2003. To win the leadership review, Chrétien formed a team in early June 2002 comprising his close associates John Rae, David Collenette, Jean Carle, and David Smith who were ordered to sign up as many Chrétienist Liberals as possible for the leadership review. The open split, which was covered extensively on national media, increasingly painted Chrétien as a lame duck. During the summer of 2002, a number of backbencher Liberal MPs associated with Martin started to openly criticise Chrétien's leadership, calling on him to resign now or suffer the humiliation of losing the leadership review. In July 2002, the Martinista Liberal M.P. Liza Frulla told a Montreal radio station that there would be [...] "general relief" [...] within the caucus if Chrétien were to resign immediately. As the feud heated up, Chrétien stated at a speech in Toronto: [...] "I remember in 1993 that we had a star all summer, that we would later call a shooting star. She had a summer job. It was Kim Campbell", and went on to compare Campbell to Martin. Martin replied that [...] "It's {{been a long time since}} he's called me a star, shooting or otherwise". Chrétien asked Jim Karygiannis, who had so effective in signing up supporters for him in 1990 to repeat that performance, only to be told by Karygiannis that Chrétien had never rewarded him by appointing him to the Cabinet as he asked for many times over the years, had not even returned his phone calls to set up a meeting to discuss his possible appointment to the Cabinet and that he was now a Martin man. Chrétien tried to change Karygiannis's mind by calling up his dying father in Greece to <b>wish</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> to no avail. Karygiannis then called a press conference on July 13, 2002, where he called for Chrétien to retire [...] "with dignity", rather than risk a potentially divisive leadership review. Thomas Worrall Kent, a Liberal elder statesman closely associated with Pearson and Trudeau, stated in an interview that Chrétien was surrounded by sycophants at the PMO, and had lost touch with Canadians. Kent went on to say: [...] "You tend, of course to get surrounded by toadies who won't say anything other than you're wonderful...The present Cabinet is looking pathetic in those terms". Kent ended the interview by sharply asking how loyal Chrétien had been to Turner. Shortly afterwards, Liberal Party president Stephen LeDrew secretly met with Chrétien to inform him that if the leadership review did take place, Chrétien would be doing well if he obtained the support of 20% of the delegates, and urged him to resign to avoid having his career end that way. After less than half the caucus committed to support him in August 2002 by signing a letter indicating their support for the Prime Minister in the up-coming leadership review, Chrétien announced that he would not lead the party into the next election, and set his resignation date for February 2004. Martin was not happy with the 2004 departure date, preferring that Chrétien retire at the end of 2002, but considered it better if Chrétien were to retire than having to defeat him at the 2003 leadership review, which would have been more divisive and would have established the ominous precedent of a Prime Minister being ousted by his own party for no other reason other that someone else wanted the job.|$|E
