25|$|In C. S. Lewis's fantasy novels the Chronicles of Narnia, The Kingdom of Archenland is {{a nation}} {{to the south of}} the Kingdom of Narnia, and to the north of both nations' {{occasional}} (and final) enemy, the Calormen Empire. Its borders are formed by mountains to the north and by the River <b>Winding</b> <b>Arrow</b> to the south. Its capital appears to be the castle located below the Anvard pass, which allows passage to Narnia.|$|R
50|$|In general a {{representation}} may involve {{more than one}} scale at the same time. For example, a drawing showing a new road in elevation might use different horizontal and vertical scales. An elevation of a bridge might be annotated with arrows with a length proportional to a force loading, as in 1 cm to 1000 newtons: {{this is an example}} of a dimensional scale. A weather map at some scale may be annotated with <b>wind</b> <b>arrows</b> at a dimensional scale of 1 cm to 20 mph.|$|R
2500|$|Archenland is {{described}} as a hilly country of gorges and open parkland sparsely wooded with many different species of trees. It occupies the basin of the <b>Winding</b> <b>Arrow,</b> a swift river that flows to east through Archenland to the Eastern Ocean. [...] To the north are mountains that form the border with Narnia, which include Stormness Head. [...] To the south lie Mount Pire and the mountainous Southern March that borders on the Great Desert separating Archenland from Calormen. Secure in these geographic barriers, the kingdom has never been successfully invaded.|$|R
2500|$|Anvard is the moatless castle where King Lune of Archenland resides. [...] It is {{situated}} {{to the north}} of the <b>Winding</b> <b>Arrow,</b> and controls the main pass (and trade route) into southern Narnia. It is constructed of red-brown stones and sits on a green lawn before a high woody ridge. [...] In The Horse and His Boy, the wicked Prince Rabadash leads a force of two hundred horsemen to surprise the castle, but he is defeated by King Edmund and captured. Castle Anvard remains the home of the kings and queens of Archenland long after the reign of King Lune.|$|R

2500|$|Archenland is a mountainous country {{south of}} Narnia. [...] It is bordered {{on the north}} by Narnia and on the south by the <b>Winding</b> <b>Arrow</b> river. The seat of {{government}} is at Anvard, {{in the heart of}} the country, a fortified area. No other towns or villages are mentioned in the Chronicles. It is described as being somewhat open parkland, with many different varieties of trees scattered far enough apart so as to not constitute a forest [...] but it is mostly a mountainous country. Archenland is allied with Narnia, as is shown in The Horse and His Boy. Unlike Narnia, Archenland is inhabited by humans and is governed by Men. The second son of King Frank I of Narnia became the first King of Archenland. For reasons not explained in the Chronicles, the line of King Frank survived here (at least until the time of High King Peter) but failed in Narnia itself.|$|R
40|$|Patches of {{open water}} (cracks, leads and polynias, Figure 1) in theice cover give major {{contributions}} to turbulent exchanges of heat, moisture, CO 2 and other gases between {{the atmosphere and}} Polar oceans. Here, convective wind flows over leads (Figure 2) are investigated through numerical large-eddy simulations (LES, Figure 3), scaling theoretical analyses (Figure 4) –to estimate basic parameters of turbulence, namely, convective wind speed, depths-scales of convective zones, horizontal extension of circulations and turbulent fluxes at the air-water interface. The model allowed deriving a heat/mass transfer law for a heat island, which expresses analytically the turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapour from the water surface to the atmosphere through external parameters: the temperature difference between the open water and the ambient air over surrounding ice,and the static stability in the basic-state atmospheric environment. An important role of the lead width is disclosed (Figure 1 insertion) : with increasing widths, {{the efficiency of the}} heat/mass transfer first increases and, after achieving a maximum, decreases (Figure 3).

It is noted for two features, the Cardrona Alpine Resort, on the slopes of the 1900 metre Mount Cardrona, and a highway, known as the Crown Range Road (formerly State Highway 89), which <b>winds</b> steeply between <b>Arrow</b> Junction, just south of Arrowtown, and Wanaka to the north.|$|R
50|$|The {{question}} is - did Dickman turn his tug ESE after passing the Captain Islands, and begin taking the NW <b>wind</b> (large <b>arrow</b> on chart below) {{on the port}} quarter, or did he continue another half an hour till the tug was abeam of the Stamford breakwater, a familiar landmark to him, and then turn southeast. This route would have allowed for the wind and sea to follow the tug, and reduce the rolling. It is my thought that had he continued along his course, {{he would have been}} abeam of Stamford at 1600, and may have opted for putting into harbor there, as it was well protected and deep enough for the tug's draft.|$|R

A decade later, the ship served as a plane guard. During the Pacific War, she was initially as the mother ship for a remotely controlled target ship and then became a radio-controlled target ship herself in 1942. Although she was badly damaged in mid-1945, Yakaze survived the war and was scrapped in 1948.|$|R

40|$|An {{increasingly}} {{dry climate}} in the U. S. Southwest {{has led to}} accelerated migration of active sand dunes and reactivation of previously inactive dunes. In the Native lands of the Colorado Plateau, sand dunes and sand sheets cover one-third of the area. Migration of these dunes can threaten housing and roads, as at this Navajo settlement. Dominant <b>wind</b> direction (<b>arrow)</b> is to the northeast. (USGS photo by Jon Mason.) U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists have been studying the migration of sand dunes {{and the movement of}} sand and dust at several sites (diamonds) within the lands of the Navajo Nation. These studies indicate increasing movement of dunes, which is a cause for concern to local communities. stabilized by vegetation), partly active (exposed dune crests with some vegetation cover), and fully active (wind-driven with no vegetation cover). U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists are conducting research with the aim of providing critical data to the Native peoples of the region in response to growing dune activity, diminished vegetation cover, and an increasingly arid environment (Redsteer, 2002). The USGS interdisciplinary studies are focused on understanding the processes responsible for initiation of eolian (wind-blown) sand movement, including the influence of source sediment availability, climate, vegetation, and land use. Reactivation of inactive dunes could have serious consequences on human and anima...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{data have}} {{inherent}} uncertainty {{which is often}} ignored in visualization. For example, meteorological stations measure wind with good accuracy, but winds are often averaged over minutes or hours. As another example, doppler radars (wind profilers and ocean current radars) take thousands of samples and average the possibly spurious returns. Others, including time series data have a wealth of uncertainty information, that the traditional vector visualization methods such as using <b>wind</b> barbs and <b>arrow</b> glyphs simply ignore. We have developed new vector glyphs to visualize uncertain winds and ocean currents. Our approach is to include uncertainty in direction and magnitude, {{as well as the}} mean direction and length, in vector glyph plots. Our glyphs show the variation in uncertainty, and provide fair comparisons of data from instruments, models, and time averages of varying certainty. We use both qualitative and quantitative methods to compare our glyphs to traditional ones. Subj [...] ...|$|R

We present a data-driven method for learning hair models that enables the creation and animation of many interactive virtual characters in real-time (for gaming, character pre-visualization and design). Our model {{has a number of}} properties that make it appealing for interactive applications: (i) it preserves the key dynamic properties of physical simulation {{at a fraction of the}} computational cost, (ii) it gives the user continuous interactive {{control over the}} hair styles (e. g., lengths) and dynamics (e. g., softness) without requiring re-styling or re-simulation, (iii) it deals with hair-body collisions explicitly using optimization in the low-dimensional reduced space, (iv) it allows modeling of external phenomena (e. g., wind). Our method builds on the recent success of reduced models for clothing and fluid simulation, but extends them in a number of significant ways. We model motion of hair in a conditional reduced sub-space, where the hair basis vectors, which encode dynamics, are linear functions of userspecified hair parameters. We formulate collision handling as an optimization in this reduced sub-space using fast iterative least squares. We demonstrate our method by building dynamic, user-controlled models of hair styles.

But this the Spaniard could not do, for while she hung in the wind the Margaret came right atop of her, and as her men laboured at the sails, {{every one of the}} Englishmen who could be spared, under the command of Peter, let loose on them with their long shafts and crossbows, and, though the heaving deck of the Margaret was no good platform, and the <b>wind</b> bent the <b>arrows</b> from their line, they killed and wounded eight or ten of them, causing them to loose the ropes so that the San Antonio swung round into the gale again. On the high tower of the caravel, his arm round the sternmost mast, stood d'Aguilar, shouting commands to his crew. Peter fitted an arrow to his string and, waiting until the Margaret was poised for a moment on the crest of a great sea, aimed and loosed, making allowance for the wind.|$|R
