While a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, Soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter. [...] Soros {{received}} £40 from a Quaker charity.

[...] Soros replied, [...] "Well, I had a variety of jobs and I ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do.

2500|$|Cougar Town {{opened to}} mixed reviews from critics. Metacritic gave the series 49 out of 100 {{based on the}} pilot episode, from the 21 reviews it collected, and a user score of 4.5 out of 10 based on 46 votes. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the pilot episode a B, commenting that the show mixes [...] "clinical realism (<b>when</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> last hear a C-section scar used as a punchline?) with ridiculous slang (a new boob job is {{referred}} to as gorilla heads), Cougar Town is so brashly vulgar, it's endearing". Tucker also wrote that [...] "the entire show is about getting and having sex... Cougar is so single-minded that this obsession itself becomes funny". Variety stated that the show [...] "does feed into the dual sense of insecurity and self-empowerment that women harbor about getting older ... though, the execution here is consistently about as subtle as a kick to the groin". Los Angeles Times Mary McNamara said that the [...] "maddening thing about Cougar Town is that it isn't completely unfunny or uncharming". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger feels that [...] "Cougar Town is still finding itself, but it's already much better than the title would suggest [...] the show [...] "has to walk a very careful line between making fun of the cougar concept and embracing it" [...] although based on the two episodes [...] "Cougar Town is self-aware enough to pull that off". USA Today was also favorable, saying that the show has [...] "the right cast and good writing".|$|E
