40|$|Many {{offshore}} <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> {{are being}} developed every year at North and Baltic Sea. From the prospective of environment and integrated European power, combined power transmission from several offshore <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> using VSC-HVDC transmission system to different onshore grids are suitable instead of connecting each <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> individually. Offshore AC hub is beneficial for the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> that are far from shore but {{close to each other}} within the vicinity of 20 km. This paper presents a method of controlling reactive power flow in the offshore AC grid to minimize the power losses and voltage deviation. In the proposed scheme, offshore grid frequency and voltage are controlled through more than one converter. Using frequency and voltage droop schemes, the active and reactive power sharing is achieved among converters. Furthermore, the optimization algorithm is developed to acquire the set points for the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> and VSC-HVDC droop gains for the optimum operation of the network.

40|$|As {{the use of}} <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> {{increases}} worldwide, it {{is important}} to understand the effect these power sources have on the operations of the grid. This paper focuses on the operating reserve impact of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> Many probabilistic methods have been applied to power system analysis, and some of these are the basis of reliability analysis. This paper builds on a probabilistic technique to allocate the operating reserve burden among <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in the grid. The method was originally posed by Strbac and Kirschen [1] and uses an allocation that prorates the reserve burden based on expected energy not delivered. Extending this method to include <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> allows the reserve burden to be allocated among different plants using the same method, yet incorporates information about the intermittent nature of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
25|$|Compared to the {{environmental}} impact of traditional energy sources, {{the environmental}} impact of wind power is relatively minor. Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no air pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.|$|E

2500|$|Energy {{production}} {{usually requires}} an energy investment. Drilling for oil or building a <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> requires energy. The {{fossil fuel resources}} that are left are often increasingly difficult to extract and convert. They may thus require increasingly higher energy investments.

[...] These resources are no longer an energy source but may be exploited for value as raw materials. [...] New technology may lower the energy investment required to extract and convert the resources, although ultimately basic physics sets limits that cannot be exceeded.|$|E
