5|$|Accompanying Hurricane Katrina's catastrophic coastal impacts was a {{moderate}} tornado outbreak spawned by the cyclone's outer bands.

Due to extreme devastation in coastal areas of Louisiana and Mississippi, multiple tornadoes may have been overlooked—overshadowed by the effects of storm surge and large-scale wind—and thus {{the full extent of the}} hurricane's tornado outbreak is uncertain.
