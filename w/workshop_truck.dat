50|$|Arrival of the 1st series Austins {{allowed to}} start forming {{automobile}} machine gun platoons (Russian: пулемётный автомобильный взвод - pulemyotniy avtomobilniy vzvod or автопулемётный взвод - avtopulemyotniy vzvod). First platoons (5-12), formed {{according to the}} organization no. 19, had each three Austins, four staff cars, a truck, a <b>workshop</b> <b>truck,</b> a tanker truck and four motorcycles, with personnel of four officers and 45-46 soldiers. Further platoons (13-24, 26-28, 30-36), formed according to the organization no. 20, received only two Austins but had a gun section consisting from a gun-armed Garford-Putilov Armoured Car, a staff car, a truck and a motorcycle. Platoons 5 to 12 received an additional Garford. Crews of those auto-MG platoons were entirely drawn from volunteers. Most of platoons {{were used in the}} Western and South-Western Fronts, some platoons in the Northern Front and Caucasus. In combat they were attached to divisions or regiments.|$|E
5000|$|In the Russian Civil War Austins {{were used}} by many participants, {{including}} both Red and White armies, Ukrainians etc.. The Red Army had {{the largest number of}} vehicles, including all the Austin-Putilov and Austin-Kergesse vehicles and most of the 3rd series. In Soviet service the cars were organized into [...] "armoured automobile units" [...] (Russian: броневой автомоильный отряд - bronevoy avtomobilniy otryad or автоброневой отряд - avtobronevoy otryad), similar in strength to a World War I-era platoon: three machine gun-armed cars and one either gun-armed or machine gun-armed, four staff cars, five trucks, a tanker truck, a <b>workshop</b> <b>truck</b> and four motorcycles. The RKKA Austins also saw combat in the Polish-Soviet War. By 1921 the RKKA possessed about 16 Austins of the 1st series, 15 2nd series, 78 3rd series and Putilovs. British-built Austins were removed from service by 1931, and by 1933, the Russian-built ones were also retired.|$|E
40|$|The {{profession}} of staircase builder {{is a hard}} job. Technically complex, it requires solid skills and certain know-how to get good quality results {{and to be able}} to compete commercially with low-cost precast stair manufacturers. Towards the expansion of that discount market, the trade of traditional construction has evolved a lot over the past few years. For sake of optimizing Cost-Quality-Delivery criterions, Choquet Co., the company I have worked with has practiced continuous improvement for more than a decade, making strategic decisions to find the best concept for stairs construction. The present study returns to all the history of concrete staircase building, the improvements made or to make to ease the realizations of those constructions, to get high finish grade and accelerate the proceedings. In fact, despite the expansion of our technologies and of our control on materials, this trade remains hard to handle and is often realized by unskilled masons and in an archaic way. This can be explain culturally by the fact that the building trade is in France a family tradition, developed on very old uses that people of this world tend to keep alive. The main part of the study is about the conception of innovative mechanisms aiming at the realization of formworks for straight and winder stairs. A particular attention has been dedicated to mechanical issues, choice of materials and technological solutions to face problems which include robustness, fatigue, weight, reliability and fouling matters. Starting the conception procedure by ideas, drafts and inventive drives, we then produced set of specifications to segment and delimit the requirements of our relative products. Afterwards, we could start the design by realizing some easy models from which we could evaluate the future lacks and so the fields in need of more accurate studies. FEM analyses have been performed on the key parts of the mechanism, so that we could refine some geometrical and material parameters. In addition, a presentation will be made individually on all the set of tools thought to be parts of the equipments of the perfect staircase builder. From moulds to the <b>workshop</b> <b>truck,</b> it is a real concept of a profession that is still not recognized in a world that is pretty hard to invest but that could bring a real change in the way to build in the future...|$|E

50|$|In 1967 a levy {{was imposed}} on land owners and $3000 {{was raised to}} buy an Austin chassis and cab, which was later fitted by the CFA. On August 15, 1967 the truck was picked from the Ballarat <b>workshops.</b> This <b>truck</b> was {{unfortunately}} burnt out in the Ferntree Gully Fires and was rebuilt and served the public until January 1983.|$|R
50|$|Among other businesses, {{the village}} has {{a car and}} <b>truck</b> <b>workshop,</b> an {{electrical}} installer’s shop, a goldsmith’s shop and, {{on the road to}} the old railway station, an underground and road construction business. Besides the Bell-Vue, there is one other inn run on a pension basis.|$|R
5|$|The {{ancillary}} {{equipment and materials}} from the donation included 20 steel hangars, 30 portable wood and canvas Bessonneau hangars, radio and photographic equipment, complete engine and airframe <b>workshops</b> with tools, <b>trucks,</b> tenders, trailers, 50,000gallons of engine oils and 20,000gallons of paints, varnishes and dope. The total value of the donation was estimated at £2,000,000.|$|R
50|$|During World War II {{the most}} violent bombing Paris {{suffered}} was {{on the night of}} 20 and 21 April 1944 when the rail freight yard of la Chapelle and the main <b>truck</b> <b>workshop</b> at Rue Championnet were hit. The roof of the Simplon station was hit by a bomb and it collapsed on the tracks and platforms. After repairs the line was brought back into service a few days later.|$|R
50|$|The company Uri-Automobile {{was founded}} in 1995 by farmer Ewert Smith. At his time the company was located in Witvlei, Namibia. Prior that time, he had used his small <b>workshop</b> for {{repairing}} <b>trucks,</b> passenger cars and motorcycles. At his time he planned to develop an offroad vehicle which will be suitable for the African bush. In 1995, {{after eight years of}} starting the development phase, he had finally realized his dream.|$|R

The vehicle was a non- or partially glazed vans version with up to two seats, as a combi with five seats, as pickup and standard factory as handicapped vans or with various special bodies (refrigerated <b>trucks,</b> <b>workshop</b> vehicles available, etc.).|$|R
5|$|It was a {{daunting}} challenge. The Ho Chi Minh Trail (controlled by the 259th PAVN Logistical Group) {{consisted of a}} labyrinth of dirt roads, bicycle and foot paths, bypasses, storage areas, <b>workshops,</b> and <b>truck</b> parks that stretched from the mountain passes of North Vietnam, through the panhandle of Laos, and into east central Cambodia. The entire system was elaborately camouflaged from aerial observation and was constantly being maintained, expanded, and improved. By 1968 PAVN was relying less on manual labor and increasingly utilizing modern construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven road graders, three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network. Manual labor was still provided by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Laotians (mostly pressed into service) and North Vietnamese volunteers.|$|R

50|$|Madhavan Nair (Jose Prakash), a {{lorry driver}} is loyal and honest to his master Keshava Panicker (Adoor Bhasi). In return, Panicker offers him a lorry, {{and a house}} in which to stay along with his family {{consisting}} of Lakshmi (Kaviyoor Ponnamma), {{his wife and two}} sons. With time, Madhavan Nair turns into a rich businessman who owns several buses, automobile <b>workshops,</b> and <b>trucks.</b> Balachandran (Lalu Alex), his elder son runs his business, while Rajendran (Mohanlal), younger son is of carefree nature, who is also in his final years in college. Rajendran fells in love with Usha (Swapna), Panicker's daughter, while Balachandran is in love with Indu (Menaka), daughter of Varma (M. S Thrippunithara), an old feudal family, who had lost all his wealth with time. With the consent of parents both Rajendran and Balachandran marry their heart throbes. But life turns into more troublesome after the marriage. Both Indu and Usha gets into petty quarrels leading to serious clashes inside the house. Things even went out of hands with both the brothers getting into physical fights in front of the parents. In such a fight between Rajendran and Balan, Madhavan Nair and Lakshmi interferes, but accidentally, the blow hits on Lakshmi's head leading to her death, shocking everyone.|$|R
