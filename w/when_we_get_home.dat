6000|$|... "It {{is rather}} hard to understand," [...] said his father. [...] "But I {{can make an}} {{experiment}} with a string, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> that will show you something about it." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{here we are}} at Reading. There is the {{carriage}} waiting, and away we are off home; and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> and have seen everybody and everything, we will look over our section once more.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the bosom}} of my robe. Not knowing <b>when</b> <b>we</b> should <b>get</b> <b>home</b> again, I brought it, {{thinking}} that perhaps one day you might marry, {{when it would be}} useful. And now, strangely enough, the marriage has come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not {{thinking}} of my words," [...] said I. [...] "My heart bleeds for you, Miss Drummond. Whatever I may say, be sure you have my pity in your difficult position. But there is just {{the one thing that}} I wish you would bear in view, if it was only long enough to discuss it quietly; for {{there is going to be}} a collieshangie <b>when</b> <b>we</b> two <b>get</b> <b>home.</b> Take my word for it, it will need the two of us to make this matter end in peace." ...|$|R
60|$|Dan {{slipped off}} his shoes. 'When <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home</b> I shall {{sit in the}} woods all day,' he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Meta, smiling, [...] "thank you, Harry, but {{you must}} find some one more worthy. I do not dance this season; at least, not in public. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> who knows what we may do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not now," [...] she refused. [...] "We must {{remember}} that Reginald is learning table manners; if we act too badly through our honeymoon, he may notice shortcomings <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home.</b> Besides, he's coming--the waiter's coming. Be dignified." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certes,' said Malcolm, as after a salt-fish dinner he mounted again, 'if honest Kitson knew, {{he would}} scarce turn {{back from the}} camp, where he is somebody. Shall we find {{ourselves}} as little wanted <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> Patie?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Victor, if you {{say such}} rude things about your cousin, you shall go to bed the moment <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> without having any tea.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only thirty, an' no odds 'tween us regardin' heads, neither. You had it {{back at me}} with a hop-pole. How did <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home</b> that night? Swimmin'?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{makes me}} thirstier than ever," [...] said the girl. [...] "But {{if you have}} no water we must try to <b>get</b> along until <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home</b> again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{heard what}} I told {{you in the}} box," [...] was the quiet reply. [...] "I shall explain--as much as I can explain--to Nigel <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home.</b> He can tell you {{everything}} later on to-day at lunch-time, if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be so," [...] {{returned}} Sam; [...] "we {{shall see}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home.</b> Meanwhile it behoves us to square up here, for the Great Eastern starts early to-morrow {{and we must}} be on board in good time to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a very {{peculiar}} {{style of}} regarding the science. Don't {{you think it}} would be worth while communicating your views on the subject to one of the scientific bodies <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home</b> again? They might elect you a member, Fred." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{can hardly}} judge, dear, till {{you know what}} has to be judged. For that, we will stop till <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home.</b> I believe in you, but I cannot feel bright.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{never heard}} of it; but I suppose the Greeks have, if it's there," [...] he replied. [...] "But why not wait till <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> {{and then go to}} Kieth's or Hammerstein's?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Strictly speaking, we have {{no right}} to break into the thing,” Bethune said; “and it might perhaps lay us open to suspicion; but I’m afraid I can’t keep my hands off until <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home.</b> <b>Get</b> out the tools, Jimmy.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{take the}} assault," [...] Walter answered; [...] "there {{is more to}} be done that way than in the defence. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> Geoffrey, {{we will look at}} the plans, and see what may be the best manner of assault." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll {{give you}} a pair, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> if you're a good girl. You needn't be so frightened; I don't mean to make you work very hard. You'll have fine times with me, and live like a lady,--only be a good girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know exactly}} what to think, Sam. Uncle Randolph is very peculiar, and since father has been sick again, he has not wanted to talk matters over very much. We will have to be careful of what we say <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home.</b> It won't do, so the doctor said, to excite him too much." ...|$|E
50|$|How Are <b>We</b> <b>Getting</b> <b>Home?</b> is a 2004 album by Gaelic Storm. This album {{features}} the most original compositions to date by Gaelic Storm, and features a working class theme. The band also {{introduced a new}} percussionist and fiddler.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, if <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home</b> to {{tell about}} it," [...] Macwitty said, cautiously. [...] "I dinna think we can reckon much on that yet. It is a desperate sort of a business, and he is ower young to command." ...|$|R
6000|$|Haldane {{laid his}} hand caressingly on his daughter's arm. [...] "Impulsive as ever--but perhaps you are right," [...] he said. [...] "In any case, {{it will be}} after midnight before <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> and you might ask for our team, Ormesby." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, I am {{sure that}} she would not like that; and I don't want to lose my last three days here. Of course, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home</b> at the end of next week, and you are settled down there, too, you will be a great deal over at Greendale, but it won't be as it is here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear, yes, so nice of her! We {{might take}} up a {{contribution}} for her <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home.</b> I'll head the paper with pleasure and give all I can afford, for it must be so horrid to be ignorant at her age. I dare say the poor thing can't even read; just fancy!" [...] and Miss Ellery clasped her hands {{with a sigh of}} pity.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{pleasant}} {{to think of}} the Mouse during all that journey, and if we are never so tired, it rests us to say, [...] "I wonder where the Mouse is by this time?" [...] <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> and coldly count up our expenses, we rejoice in the five francs lent to the Mouse. [...] "And I know he will pay it back if ever he can," [...] I say. [...] "That was a Mouse of integrity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A dreary spot at night, I dare say," [...] the Prime Minister remarked, without overmuch interest. [...] "How do <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home</b> from here, Orden? I haven't {{forgotten}} your {{warning about}} luncheon, and this air is {{giving me a}} most lively appetite." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{not your}} father I was sorry for," [...] Flora Schuyler said sharply. [...] "The sod is too hard for fast riding, {{and it will be}} 'most an hour yet before <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home.</b> I wish <b>we</b> were not alone, Hetty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some day, Dora, I {{am going}} to take you for a long ride," [...] went on Dick. [...] "I mean some day after <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home</b> with that treasure," [...] he added, in a lower tone, so that the chauffeur might not hear.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} servants," [...] said Mrs. Ambrose, concentrating her gaze. [...] "At this moment I have a nurse. She's {{a good woman}} as they go, but she's {{determined}} to make my children pray. So far, owing to great care on my part, they think of God {{as a kind of}} walrus; but now that my back's turned--Ridley," [...] she demanded, swinging round upon her husband, [...] "what shall we do if we find them saying the Lord's Prayer <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home</b> again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The proper thing, {{when you}} go to Eu-rope," [...] {{declared}} Uncle John, positively, [...] "is to do Venice, where the turpentine comes from, and Switzerland, where they make chocolate and goat's milk, and Paris and Monte Carlo, where they kick high and melt pearls in champagne. Everybody knows that. That's what goin' to Eu-rope really means. But Sicily isn't on the programme, that I ever heard of. So we'll just tell Silas Watson that we'll see him later--which means <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home</b> again." ...|$|E
60|$|It is over, and {{the earth}} is filled in, and we turn to come away. Before us stands our house, so pretty and unchanged, so linked in my mind with the young idea of what is gone, that all my sorrow has been nothing to the sorrow it calls forth. But they take me on; and Mr. Chillip talks to me; and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> puts some water to my lips; and when I ask his leave {{to go up to}} my room, dismisses me with the {{gentleness}} of a woman.|$|E
60|$|I'm {{powerful}} {{glad you}} are all back again; and we will come up there if our little tribe will give us the necessary furlough; and if <b>we</b> can't <b>get</b> it, you folks must come to us and give us an extension of time. <b>We</b> <b>get</b> <b>home</b> Sept. 11.|$|R

6000|$|... "It will be {{a slight}} pull up hill," [...] he said. [...] "But it will save us nearly half a mile. We can rest a few minutes <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to the top. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> up there I'll show you the spot where I saw those four bears three years ago." ...|$|R
