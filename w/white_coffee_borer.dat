In recent years, the pest has also been found in American countries. This study in Gulmi District, Nepal, aimed to {{determine}} the infestation by <b>coffee</b> <b>white</b> stem <b>borer</b> in relation to coffee plantations in shade or sun. Eighty plantations of coffee were inspected and 68 coffee growers were interviewed.

40|$|Although the African <b>coffee</b> <b>white</b> stem <b>borer,</b> Monochamus leuconotus (Pascoe) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), {{is a major}} {{insect pest}} of coffee in Africa, {{there is much to}} learn about its biology. The present paper {{describes}} an original rearing method for M. leuconotus and provides unpublished biological data for the pest. The <b>coffee</b> <b>white</b> stem <b>borer</b> colony was started with larvae extracted from infested coffee stems collected in the field. Larvae were reared on artificial diet while the adults were kept in reproduction cages with coffee sticks as feeding and oviposition substrate. Under our rearing conditions, mean adult longevity was 89. 5 d for females and 81. 8 d for males. Fecundity was 40. 7 eggs per female on average, with an oviposition period of 53 d (one female laid 151 eggs for a period of 145 d). Egg viability was low (39 %) and the incubation period was 26. 6 d. Larval and pupal survival was high (80. 9 and 88. 5 %, respectively). Larval development duration was variable, with a mean of 251. 4 d, whereas pupal development was less variable, with a mean of 26. 6 d. The rearing method described here is easily replicable and allowed a colony of <b>coffee</b> <b>white</b> stem <b>borer</b> to be continuously maintained in the laboratory for three years. Useful data on <b>coffee</b> <b>white</b> stem <b>borer's</b> life history, including reproductive and feeding behaviors, are reported here and compared with previous reports in order to fill the knowledge gaps of this important but neglected pest of coffee.

40|$|Coffee {{production}} worldwide {{is threatened}} by a range of coffee pests and diseases (CPaD). Integrated management options require {{an understanding of the}} bioecology of CPaD and the prevalent interdependencies within the agroecological context. The comparison of different shading systems (e. g. shade-grown vs. sun-grown coffee) and the identification of trade-offs for ecosystem services is still a matter of ongoing debates. There is little quantitative knowledge of field-level investigation on shade effects and its ecological mechanisms across environmental and shading system gradients. Considering the increasingly evident effects of progressive climate change on CPaD, the need to examine the balance of shade effects under different environmental conditions becomes apparent. With the example of the coffee growing region of Mt Elgon, Uganda, this project aimed at addressing the complexity of shading effects on economically relevant CPaD using environmental and production system gradients. The approach was designed in an interdisciplinary manner, to involve the broader context of coffee agroforestry systems. The first two chapters of this thesis dealt with general aspects of coffee smallholder farming. The diversity of existing coffee production systems was characterized along an altitudinal gradient. A typology of production systems based on indicators related to the vegetation structure was generated and classified as coffee open canopy, coffee-banana inter-cropping, and densely shaded coffee systems. The typology served as the basis for comparison across the environmental and production system gradients. In the second chapter, farmers' knowledge on CPaD and the role of shade trees was contrasted with expert knowledge and field observations. Discrepancies regarding CPaD symptomatology, management and response to shade were revealed. Tackling institutional obstacles and disentangling shading effects are therefore a priority for the improvement of plant health management. The last two chapters focused more specifically on biophysical aspects of Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR, Hemileia vastatrix) and <b>White</b> <b>Coffee</b> Stem <b>Borer</b> (WCSB, Monochamus leuconotus). The effects of environment and production system on CLR abundance were spatio-temporally variable and either directly, interactive or indirectly mediated by microclimate. The development of <b>white</b> <b>coffee</b> stem <b>borer</b> was controlled by the bimodal rainfall, and by altitude and shade through their effect on minimum temperature. The findings emphasize the enormous importance of micro-environments for the ecology of CPaD, not least because of its implications in the context of climate change. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
50|$|Xylotrechus quadripes is {{a species}} of beetle in the family Cerambycidae. It was {{described}} by the French entomologist Auguste Chevrolat in 1863. It {{is well known for}} its habit of boring through the stems of coffee plants in plantations and is considered a pest and known by the common name <b>coffee</b> <b>white</b> stem <b>borer.</b> Because the larvae damage the plant while being hidden inside the woody stems, it is extremely difficult to control. The control of shade over the coffee bushes however reduces the incidence.Males have the hind femur extending beyond the tip of the elytra while females have them falling short. Females have a single raised line or carina on the head while males have a median carina with two lateral ones on each side.|$|R

This study assesses the potential distribution of agricultural pests under projected climatic scenarios using evidence from the African <b>coffee</b> <b>white</b> stem <b>borer</b> (CWB), Monochamus leuconotus (Pascoe) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), an important pest of coffee in Zimbabwe. A species distribution modeling approach utilising Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) was applied on current and projected climate data obtained from the WorldClim database and occurrence data (presence and absence) collected through on-farm biological surveys in Chipinge, Chimanimani, Mutare and Mutasa districts in Zimbabwe. Results from both the BRT and GLM indicate that precipitation-related variables are more important in determining species range for the CWB than temperature related variables. The CWB has extensive potential habitats in all coffee areas with Mutasa district having the largest model average area suitable for CWB under current and projected climatic conditions. Habitat ranges for CWB will increase under future climate scenarios for Chipinge, Chimanimani and Mutare districts while it will decrease in Mutasa district.
