40|$|Abstract. The CW CO 2 laser {{weldability}} {{of various}} Al-Mg alloys {{was investigated in}} terms of weld strength, ductility, Vickers hardness, formability and solidification cracking tendency when both autogenous and <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> <b>welding</b> were made. Tensile strength of the laser welds was {{lower than that of}} the corresponding base metals, and it was linearly proportional to the Mg content of the weld metal. Formability and ductility of Al-Mg alloy laser welds were lower than those of corresponding base alloys as well. As for the weld solidification structure, as the Mg content increased in the weld metal, more equiaxed grains developed. Hence, softening of weld metal and solidification cracking were decreased in the weld metal containing higher Mg. Solidification cracking of Al-Mg alloy laser welds showed the highest susceptibility at 1. 6 to 1. 9 wt. % Mg, and it decreased with further increase of Mg content...|$|E

40|$|Process {{parameters}} modeling {{have always}} been one of the key aspects in development of an adaptive control of arc welding process. The welding process parameters are inherently nonlinear, time-delayed, and interdependent, and their on-time adjustment highly influences a sound weld bead formation and process monitoring. During the welding process, parameters control is the primary goal to leads a quality welding. Moreover, the final weld joint behavior, i. e., residual stress, welding strength, and micro-crack formation are generally observed after cooling of the weld product. Thus, it has always been a difficult task to control mechanical properties of a final weld joint. To obtain the best mechanical properties, the final weld joint characteristics needed to be controlled and predicted during the process itself by precise adjustment of the process parameters. The paper presents a neuro-fuzzy modeling approach to provide adaptive control for the automatic process parameter adjustment. Three input parameters <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed, <b>welding</b> gap, and torch speed are modeled with welding current output, providing control over weld bead formation during the welding.

The objective of these techniques is to provide significant improvements in process control compared to that obtained by using conventional constant voltage power sources. The first control technique, described as 2 ̆ 2 open loop 2 ̆ 2, has a fixed, preprogrammed response to key events within the process that define various states of the weld cycle. The response parameters are adjusted to suit the <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed, <b>welding</b> travel speed and shielding gas mixture.

This technique produces stable, low-spatter welds with excellent bead appearance across a very wide range of <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speeds and contact tip to workpiece distance (CTWD values. Operation does not depend on synchronising the weld cycle frequency with the natural frequency of the weld pool. The technique also significantly decouples key welding parameters such as peak arc length, fusion area, and short-circuit metal transfer characteristics.

This paper highlights a study and analysis of various process-control variables and important weld bead quality parameters in SAW of pipes manufactured out of structural steel (IS: 2062). Mathematical models were devel-oped for the submerged arc welding of 6 -mm-thick structural steel plates using 3. 15 -mm-diameter steel electrodes. The models were developed using the five-level factorial technique to relate the important process-control variables — <b>welding</b> voltage, <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> rate, <b>welding</b> speed and nozzle-to-plate distance — to a few important bead-quality parameters — penetration, reinforcement, bead width, total volume of the weld bead and dilution. The models developed were checked for their adequacy with the F test. Using the models, the main and in-teraction effects of the process-control variables on important bead geometry parameters were determined quantita-tively and presented graphically. The developed models and the graphs showing the direct and interaction effects of process variables on the bead geome-try are very useful in selecting the process parameters to achieve the desired weld-bead quality. Also, the precision of the re-sults obtained with the mathematical models were tested by using conformity test runs.

40|$|The {{need for}} reduced {{intrinsic}} weight of structures and {{vehicles in the}} transportation industry has made aluminium research of interest. Aluminium has properties that are favourable for structural engineering, including good strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance and machinability. It can be easily recycled saving energy used in smelting as compared to steel. Its alloys can have ultimate tensile strength of up to 750 MPa, which is comparable to steel. Aluminium alloys are generally weldable, however welding of high strength alloys like the 7 xxx series pose considerable challenges. This paper presents research on the weldability of high strength aluminium alloys, principally the 7 xxx series. The weldability with various weld processes including MIG, TIG, and FSW, is discussed in addition to consideration of joint types, weld defects and recommendations for minimizing or preventing weld defects. Experimental research was carried out on 7025 -T 6 and AW- 7020 alloys. Samples were welded, and weld cross sections utilized in weld metallurgy studies. Mechanical tests were carried out including hardness tests and tensile tests. In addition, testing was done {{for the presence of}} Al 2 O 3 on exposed aluminium alloy. It was observed that at constant weld heat input using a pulsed MIG system, the welding speed had little or no effect on the weld hardness. However, the grain size increased as the filler <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> rate, <b>welding</b> current and welding speed increased. High heat input resulted in lower hardness of the weld profile. Weld preheating was detrimental to AW- 7020 welds; however, artificial aging was beneficial. Acceptable welds were attained with pulsed MIG without the removal of the Al 2 O 3 layer prior to welding. The Al 2 O 3 oxide layer was found to have different compositions in different aluminium alloys. These findings contribute useful additional information to the knowledge base of aluminium welding. The application of {{the findings of this study}} in welding will help reduce weld cost and improve high strength aluminium structure productivity by removing the need for pre-weld cleaning.

The microstructure of the fabricated samples exhibits a fine basket-weave structure and martensite due to the fast cooling rate which was caused by the small size of the molten pool and the additional heat dissipation from the <b>feeding</b> <b>wire.</b> The static tensile test shows that the average ultimate tensile strength is 1140 MPa in the scanning direction and 1115 MPa in the building direction, and the average elongation is about 6 % in both directions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Alloying {{elements}} such as Fe, Zr and Mg in Cu were added by direct addition of powders and by feeding of cored alloy wire filled with alloying element powder in a lab scale furnace. The yield of Fe was the highest for both addition methods. Cored <b>wire</b> <b>feeding</b> was significantly {{more effective than the}} direct powder addition into the copper melt. Though the yield of Mg was almost zero by the addition of Mg powder, it was increased remarkably by the Mg cored <b>wire</b> <b>feeding.</b> Through the calculation of the model which was designed based on an industrial scale line, it was confirmed that the yield of the alloying elements was affected by the <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> rate and the thickness of the copper tube that envelops an alloy powder...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{experimental}} study {{is done for}} technological parameters of high-melting metal arc spraying to study the influence of spraying current, spraying voltage and <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> voltage on spraying arc {{and the influence of}} spraying current on coating temperature and analyze theoretically the distribution rules of spray gun jet speed field and temperature field and their influencing factors. The results showed that the arc current increases along with arc voltage increase. The lower the spraying voltage is, the smaller the molten grain size becomes. However, if the arc voltage is lower than the minimum critical arc voltage of the material, the arc could not keep smooth burning. The spraying current has correspondence relationship with <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed. The spraying current could be adjusted through <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed adjustment...|$|R
40|$|As laser brazing {{benefits}} from advantages such as smooth joints and small heat-affected zones, {{it has become}} established as a joining technology that is widely used in the automotive industry. With the processing of complex-shaped geometries, recent developed brazing heads suffer, however, from the need for continuous reorientation of the optical system and/or limited accessibility due to lateral <b>wire</b> <b>feeding.</b> This motivates {{the development of a}} laser brazing head with coaxial <b>wire</b> <b>feeding</b> and enhanced functionality. An optical system is designed that allows to generate an annular intensity distribution in the working zone. The utilization of complex optical components avoids obscuration of the optical path by the <b>wire</b> <b>feeding.</b> The new design overcomes the disadvantages of the state-of-the-art brazing heads with lateral <b>wire</b> <b>feeding</b> and {{benefits from}} the independence of direction while processing complex geometries. To increase the robustness of the brazing process, the beam path also includes a seam tracking system, leading to a more challenging design of the whole optical train. This paper mainly discusses the concept and the optical design of the coaxial brazing head, and also presents the results obtained with a prototype and selected application results...|$|R
