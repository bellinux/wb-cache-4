He said he was sure the band would collaborate with producer Rick Rubin again. According to Blabbermouth.net, the band was considering recording its next album {{in the second half of}} 2011. In November 2010, during an {{interview with}} The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, [...] "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Get Back" [...] is a upbeat guitar-driven rock song. According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, {{the song is}} set in common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is performed in the key of C major and Lovato's vocals span from the note of B3 to the note of G5. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic compared the song's sound to works by Tommy Tutone. Lyrically, the song is about a desire to get back together with an old boyfriend, demonstrated in the lines [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the old days", and [...] "Kiss me like you mean it".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe called [...] "Get Back" [...] a [...] "welcome girl-rock hit". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included the song at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and said, [...] "She wrote {{this with the}} Jonas Brothers, but it sounds more like a Tommy Tutone B-side from the early '80s or {{the sort of thing}} Greg Kihn was pining for when he sang, 'They don't write 'em like that anymore'". Masley noted that the song sounds better live, as does [...] "nearly everything Lovato touches". Masley concluded, writing, [...] "When she sings 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the old days,' what she means is when she and her boyfriend were happy, but power-pop fans will hear it as a call to get back to much older days than that." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted it {{as one of the best}} tracks on Don't Forget. Joey Guerra of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "undeniably kicky, and Lovato manages some surprisingly credible rock wails." [...] Ken Barnes of USA Today called it an [...] "insidious, Go-Go's-like single".|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Orci {{had begun}} writing the script with Patrick McKay and J. D. Payne, with Payne saying {{of the script}} in March, [...] "We really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the sense of {{exploration}} and wonder. The kind of optimistic sense of the future that Star Trek has always kind of had at its core. It's the Chicago Bulls in space, in terms {{of these people who}} are all awesome at their job." [...] In January 2015, after Orci's departure, Simon Pegg and Doug Jung were hired to rewrite the screenplay, with Pegg saying on the previous draft, Paramount [...] "had a script for Star Trek that wasn't really working for them. I think the studio was worried that {{it might have been a}} little bit too Star Trek-y." [...] Pegg had been asked to make the new film [...] "more inclusive", stating that the solution was to [...] "make a western or a thriller or a heist movie, then populate that with Star Trek characters so it's more inclusive to an audience that might be a little bit reticent." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Evans {{considered}} himself an acoustic pianist, from the 1970 album From Left to Right on, he also released some material with Fender-Rhodes piano intermissions. However, unlike other jazz players (e.g. Herbie Hancock) he never fully embraced the new instrument, and invariably ended up {{returning to the}} acoustic sound. [...] "I don't {{think too much about}} the electronic thing, except that it's kind of fun to have it as an alternate voice. (...) [...] merely an alternate keyboard instrument, that offers a certain kind of sound that's appropriate sometimes. I find that it's a refreshing auxiliary to the piano—but I don't need it (...) I don't enjoy {{spending a lot of time}} with the electric piano. I play it for a period of time, then I quickly tire of it, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the acoustic piano." [...] He commented that electronic music: [...] "just doesn't attract me. I'm of a certain period, a certain evolution. I hear music differently. For me, comparing electric bass to acoustic bass is sacrilege." ...|$|E
