40|$|Counterparty {{credit risk}} is an {{important}} type of financial risk. The importance of proper counterparty risk management became most apparent {{in the wake of}} the 2008 series of failures of several large banks. Correlation of market factors {{is an important}} issue in the calculation of CVA. A notable case of correlation is <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> which occurs whenever the probability of default of the counterparty is positively correlated with exposure. The basic formulas for CVA and basic counterparty credit risk models do not account for <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> because its modeling is nontrivial. This thesis aims to answer how well can the impact of <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> on CVA be approximated with an add-on which only depends on correlation between the price of the underlying asset and the credit spread of the counterparty. The thesis is supplemented by a fully documented implementation of the model in the Mathematica software...|$|R
40|$|The global {{over-the-counter}} derivatives market {{reached a}} staggering 14. 5 trillion US dollars in gross market value {{at the end}} of December 2007. Although OTC derivatives are extremely useful and versatile in transferring risks, {{it appears to be a}} double-edged sword. For every derivative transaction concluded in the OTC market, there are two parties involved – each of which is exposed to the other defaulting on the agreed terms and conditions of the contract. Counterparty credit risk is defined as the loss that will be incurred in the event that a counterparty fails to honour its financial obligations. This dissertation provides an overview of counterparty credit risk measurement from a theoretical point of view and puts an emphasis on the demonstration of the current solutions used in practice to address this problem. The author applies a bottom up approach to the problem by defining counterparty credit <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> on a contract (single-trade) level and expands this definition on a step-by-step basis to incorporate portfolio effects, such as correlation among underlying market variables as well as credit risk mitigation techniques, such as netting and collateral agreements, in measuring counterparty credit <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> on a counterparty level. The author also discusses related concepts which impact counterparty credit <b>risk</b> such as <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> and proposes an enhancement to the framework introduced by Finger (2000) for incorporating <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> into existing measures of counterparty credit <b>risk</b> <b>exposure.</b> Finger‟s framework is enhanced by the introduction of a structural model approach which can be used in establishing a functional and intuitive relationship between the probability of default of the counterparty and the underlying market variable to the derivative contract under consideration. This approach is also applied to a typical South African situation through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. The topic of counterparty credit risk modelling is a very relevant topic in modern finance, especially since the advent of Basel 2 which this dissertation also touches on in terms of the applications of counterparty credit risk modelling and how this relates to the minimum regulatory capital requirements set by bank regulators.

A consistent model of <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> (WWR) is developed {{here with the}} probability-weighted addition of tail events to the calculation of credit valuation and funding valuation adjustments (CVA and FVA). This new practical model quantifies the tail risks in the pricing of CVA and FVA of derivatives and does not rely on a limited concept of linear correlation frequently used in many models. The application of the model is illustrated with practical examples of WWR arising {{in the case of}} a sovereign default for the most common interest-rate and foreign exchange derivatives.

40|$|Current CVA {{modeling}} framework {{has ignored}} {{the impact of}} stochastic recovery rate. Due to the possible negative correlation between default and recovery rate, stochastic recovery rate could have a doubling effect on <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk.</b> In {{the case of a}} payer CDS, when counterparty defaults, the CDS value could be higher due to default contagion while the recovery rate may also be lower if the economy is in a downturn. Using our recently proposed model of correlated stochastic recovery in the default time Gaussian Copula framework, we demonstrate this double impact on <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> in the CVA calculation for a payer CDS. We also present a new form of Gaussian copula that correlates both default time and recovery rate. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two parts. In the first part, we investigate {{the potential impact of}} <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> on calculating credit valuation adjustment (CVA) of a derivatives portfolio. A credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is an adjustment applied to the value of a derivative contract or a portfolio of derivatives to account for counterparty credit risk. Measuring CVA requires combining models of market and credit <b>risk.</b> <b>Wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> refers to the possibility that a counterparty's likelihood of default increases with the market value of the exposure. We develop a method for bounding <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk,</b> holding fixed marginal models for market and credit risk and varying the dependence between them. Given simulated paths of the two models, we solve a linear program to find the worst-case CVA resulting from <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk.</b> We analyze properties of the solution and prove convergence of the estimated bound as the number of paths increases. The worst case can be overly pessimistic, so we extend the procedure for a tempered CVA by penalizing the deviation of the joint model of market and credit risk from a reference model. By varying the penalty for deviations, we can sweep out the full range of possible CVA values for different degrees of <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk.</b> Here, too, we prove convergence of the estimate of the tempered CVA and the joint distribution that attains it. Our method addresses an important source of model risk in counterparty risk measurement. In the second part, we study investors' trading behavior in a model of realization utility. We assume that investors' trading decisions are driven not only by the utility of consumption and terminal wealth, but also by the utility burst from realizing a gain or a loss. More precisely, we consider a dynamic trading problem in which an investor decides when to purchase and sell a stock to maximize her wealth utility and realization utility with her reference points adapting to the stock's gain and loss asymmetrically. We study, both theoretically and numerically, the optimal trading strategies and asset pricing implications of two types of agents: adaptive agents, who realize prospectively the reference point adaptation in the future, and naive agents, who fail to do so. We find that an adaptive agent sells the stock more frequently when the stock is at a gain than a naive agent does, and that the adaptive agent asks for a higher risk premium for the stock than the naive agent does in equilibrium. Moreover, compared to a non-adaptive agent whose reference point does not change with the stock's gain and loss, both the adaptive and naive agents sell the stock less frequently, and the naive agent requires the same risk premium as the non-adaptive agent does...|$|R
40|$|The credit {{valuation}} adjustment (CVA) of OTC derivatives is {{an important}} part of the Basel III credit risk capital requirements and current accounting rules. Its calculation is not an easy task - not only it is necessary to model the future value of the derivative, but also the probability of default of a counterparty. Another complication arises in the calculation when the exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty, i. e. when it is needed to incorporate the <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk.</b> A semi-analytical CVA formula simplifying the interest rate swap (IRS) valuation with the counterparty credit <b>risk</b> including the <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> is derived and analyzed in the paper. The formula is based on the fact that the CVA of an IRS can be expressed using swaption prices. The link between the interest rates and the default time is represented by a Gaussian copula with constant correlation coefficient. Finally, the results of the semi-analytical approach are compared with the results of a complex simulation study...|$|R

Under a number of assumptions on collateralization, <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk,</b> gap risk, credit valuation adjustments and funding effects, including the treasury operational model, and via an immersion hypothesis, {{we are able to}} derive a synthetic master equation for the multiple term structure dynamics that integrates multiple curves with credit/funding adjustments...|$|R

In a study of large US and international banks, we show that (1) the main driving force of bank risk disclosures is the shifts in <b>risk</b> <b>exposures,</b> (2) changes in <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> are negatively correlated with volatility changes, which suggests that banks reduce risk taking when volatility increases, and that (3) changes in <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> are positively correlated among banks, {{which is consistent with}} banks exhibiting herding behavior in trading...|$|R
40|$|Firm-level <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> {{and costs}} of equity are {{notoriously}} difficult to estimate. Using a novel approach mapping consumption <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> to firm characteristics, we combine the traditional portfolio-level approach to testing asset pricing models with firm-level information to measure firm-level <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> First, at the portfolio level, we investigate the empirical performance of a simple two-factor consumption-based asset pricing model for the cross-section of equity returns. The priced factors in the model are innovations in the growth and volatility of aggregate consumption. Our empirical results show that this model can explain 66 % of the cross-sectional variation in returns on a menu of 55 portfolios spanning size, value, momentum, asset growth, stock issuance, and accruals. Second, we use the estimated model to map point-in-time firm characteristics to consumption <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> Through this measurement procedure, we uncover sizeable cross-sectional and time-series variation in firm consumption <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> We verify that sorting on these ex ante consumption <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> produces portfolios with consistent ex post <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> and predicts cross-sectional variation in future firm equity returns...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} issue in global corporate risk management {{is whether the}} multinationality of a firm matters {{in terms of its}} effect on exchange <b>risk</b> <b>exposure.</b> In this paper, we examine the exchange <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> of US firms during 1983 - 2006, comparing multinational and non-multinational firms and focusing on the role of operational hedging. Since MNCs and non-multinationals differ in size and other characteristics, we construct matched samples of MNCs and non-multinationals based on the propensity score method. We find that the multinationality in fact matters for a firm's exchange exposure but not in the way usually presumed - the exchange <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> are actually smaller and less significant for MNCs than non-multinationals. The results are robust with respect to different samples and model specifications.

We then study how the companies' market <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> and their use of derivatives are affected by different firm characteristics. We also survey privately owned insurers to determine the importance of derivatives in their risk management, and how they responded to the terrorist attacks. By looking at insurers' quarterly and annual market <b>risk</b> <b>exposures,</b> it is found that there is no discernible difference between property/casualty and life/health insurers during the period studied, and that the fluctuations and trend of their <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> are very similar.

40|$|Conventional {{methods for}} sample size {{calculation}} for population-based longitudinal studies tend to overestimate the statistical power by overlooking important determinants {{of the required}} sample size, such as the measurement errors and unmeasured etiological determinants, etc. In contrast, a simulation-based sample size calculation, if designed properly, allows these determinants {{to be taken into}} account and offers flexibility in accommodating complex study design features. The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) is a Canada-wide, 20 -year follow-up study of 30, 000 people between the ages of 45 and 85 years, with in-depth information collected every 3 years. A simulation study, based on an illness-death model, was conducted to: (1) investigate the statistical power profile of the CLSA to detect the effect of environmental and genetic risk factors, and their interaction on age-related chronic diseases; and (2) explore the design alternatives and implementation strategies for increasing the statistical power of population-based longitudinal studies in general. The results showed that the statistical power to identify the effect of environmental and genetic <b>risk</b> <b>exposures,</b> and their interaction on a disease was boosted when: (1) the prevalence of the <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> increased; (2) the disease of interest is relatively common in the population; and (3) <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> were measured accurately. In addition, the frequency of data collection every three years in the CLSA led to a slightly lower statistical power compared to the design assuming that participants underwent health monitoring continuously. The CLSA had sufficient power to detect a small (1 <hazard ratio (HR) ≤ 1. 5) or moderate effect (1. 5 < HR≤ 2. 0) of the environmental <b>risk</b> <b>exposure,</b> as long as the <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> and the disease of interest were not rare. It had enough power to detect a moderate or large (2. 0 <HR≤ 3. 0) effect of the genetic <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> when the prevalence of the <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> was not very low (≥ 0. 1) and the disease of interest was not rare (such as diabetes and dementia). The CLSA had enough power to detect a large effect of the gene-environment interaction only when both <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> had relatively high prevalence (0. 2) and the disease of interest was very common (such as diabetes). The minimum detectable hazard ratios (MDHR) of the CLSA for the environmental and genetic <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> obtained from this simulation study were larger than those calculated according to the conventional sample size calculation method. For example, the MDHR for the environmental <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> was 1. 15 according to the conventional method if the prevalence of the <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> was 0. 1 and the disease of interest was dementia. In contrast, the MDHR was 1. 61 if the same exposure was measured every 3 years with a misclassification rate of 0. 1 according to this simulation study. With a given sample size, higher statistical power could be achieved by increasing the measuring frequency in participants with high risk of declining health status or changing <b>risk</b> <b>exposures,</b> and by increasing measurement accuracy of diseases and <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> A properly designed simulation-based sample size calculation is superior to conventional methods when rigorous sample size calculation is necessary...|$|R

The major result of the analysis suggests that derivatives have {{played a significant role in}} shaping banks' interest rate <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> in recent years. For the typical bank holding company in the sample, increases in the use of interest rate derivatives corresponded to greater interest rate <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> during the 1991 - 94 period.

These stress-related differences in childhood amygdala development might contribute to the well-documented psychological distress as a function of early <b>risk</b> <b>exposure.</b> R 49 CE 002099 /CE/NCIPC CDC HHS/United StatesRC 2 MD 004767 /MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United StatesRC 2 MD 004767 /MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United StatesU 49 /CE 002099 /CE/NCIPC CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 12 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 26469872 PMC 483369...|$|R

Non-interest income reduces large banks’ systemic <b>risk</b> <b>exposures,</b> whereas it increases that of small banks. However, exploiting heterogeneity in countries’ institutional setting, we {{show that the}} bright side of innovation by large banks (lower systemic <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> for diversified banks) disappears in countries with more private and asymmetric information, more corruption and in concentrated banking markets. These empirical findings provide support for Saunders and Cornett (2014) who hypothesize which institutional features make the materialization of conflicts of interest more likely...|$|R
