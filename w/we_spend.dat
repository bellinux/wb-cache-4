25|$|Our {{doctors and}} {{hospitals}} are failing {{to provide us with}} care we need while delivering a staggering amount that we don't need. Current estimates suggest that as much as 20 to 30 percent of what <b>we</b> <b>spend,</b> or about $500 billion, goes toward useless, potentially harmful care.|$|E
25|$|Even though humans derive many {{benefits}} from nature, our modern lifestyles {{have created a}} disconnect from the natural environment wherein <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> significantly more time indoors. Some researchers estimate that humans spend up to 90% of their lives indoors. This disconnection from nature can {{have a negative impact}} on humans because we are missing out on the beneficial effects of nature. As a result, we are less connected to nature and feel less responsibility to protect this environment.|$|E

500|$|Celebrity Marilyn Monroe is {{mentioned}} numerous times throughout the song, including the famous quote [...] "I'm selfish, impatient {{and a little}} insecure. I make mistakes, I am {{out of control and}} at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best." [...] However, it has never been confirmed that Monroe actually said this. Minaj liked the track, as [...] "it spoke to me as a woman. I'm very infatuated with Marilyn Monroe. I had a moment with that song where I was like, 'Oh my God, every woman in this world needs to hear that'. No, we're not perfect. Sometimes, we think, 'What's wrong with us?' <b>We</b> <b>spend</b> so much time criticizing ourselves. I needed to hear that, 'I'm not perfect, but I'm worth it'. It resonated with me. I felt like the world needed to hear it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{similarity}} to Carpenter's version of The Thing {{was due in}} part to new production designer Graeme Murray, who worked on Carpenter's film and created the complex in which the episode took place. Although [...] "Ice" [...] was intended as a bottle episode which would save money by being shot in a single location, it went over budget. According to Carter, The X-Files typically worked from a small budget and [...] "every dollar <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> ends up on the screen". As a bottle episode, [...] "Ice" [...] used a small cast and its interiors were filmed on a set constructed at an old Molson brewery site. The episode's few exterior shots were filmed at Delta Air Park in Vancouver, whose hangars and flat terrain simulated an Arctic location. Carter said that he would have preferred to set the episode at the North Pole, but he believed that this was unfeasible at the time.|$|E
500|$|It is {{difficult}} to teach delayed gratification when children grow up expecting a large, instant reward for their years of schooling. Societal impacts and current media trends have {{had the effect of}} teaching people to expect instant gratification. The idea of waiting for a good job, earned through working from the bottom up, frequently upsets and frustrates emerging adults in today's society. This desire for immediate gratification is not only found in workplaces, but also in interpersonal relationships. Current studies show that 45% of marriages will end in divorce. Without the ability to delay gratification people are more apt to end relationships rather than work on them. Our society today makes it increasingly easy to receive instant gratification. According to Daniel Forrester, [...] "e have devalued the time <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> alone just thinking, but it's that time for reflection that leads to the big ideas [...] Multitasking is espoused and almost glorified in the United States, but it is dehumanizing us and making us less creative." ...|$|E

He commented that it was [...] "entirely possible" [...] that austerity was the cause and said: “If <b>we</b> don’t <b>spend</b> appropriately on social care, if <b>we</b> don’t <b>spend</b> appropriately on health care, {{the quality of life}} will get worse for older people and maybe the length of life, too”.|$|R

500|$|The Ludys {{argue that}} one's love {{life should be}} both guided by and {{subordinate}} to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, [...] "if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry... is alive and wandering the earth" [...] and that this knowledge should encourage people to act {{in such a way}} that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others... our deepest needs are met as well!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Tancredo has {{declared}} himself {{in favor of}} the legalization of marijuana. He said that his reasons to legalize marijuana include [...] "The issue of violence that surrounds it—not just on the border—and the crimes all over the place.

[...] While in Congress, Tancredo voted each year to attach an amendment, which never passed, that would have prevented the US Justice Department from spending any money to [...] "enforce any drug laws in contradiction to state law." ...|$|E

[...] "We have some 57 dialogues with Chinese counterparts, ranging from global warming to economic and trade issues.

According to Zamenhof, he created the language to reduce the [...] "time and labour <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> in learning foreign tongues" [...] and to foster harmony between people from different countries: [...] "Were there but an international language, all translations would be made into it alone... and all nations would be united in a common brotherhood."

2500|$|Buildings are {{designed}} or intended to respond actively {{to some of}} these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and maintain surfaces to enhance their appearance, performance, or longevity. [...] In other cases, such changes subtly or even dramatically alter buildings in ways that may be important to their own integrity or their impact on building occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it useful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the approaches used by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> the majority of our time, our buildings.|$|E
2500|$|Sugizo in the {{interview}} said that [...] "there are secrets held by a small elite who control the world... <b>We</b> <b>spend</b> our lives without ever being aware of the truth that is hidden from us", and so through the song [...] "Tell Me Why You Hide The Truth?"

It was nice to see Eric Idle return , but the episode felt like two {{different}} episodes battling for the same thirty-minute space. [...] In this episode <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> {{a lot of time}} learning about those who grew up in Springfield, but Homer's story is also wedged into the mix — it seems the episode should have just been about Homer feeling depressed about his life, or a lighter episode focusing on all the resident of Springfield. I'm not saying the episode was a complete write off, because I think it was still funny, just a little thinner than I come to expect from this series." ...|$|E
2500|$|McNamara's staff {{stressed}} {{systems analysis}} {{as an aid}} in decision making on weapon development and many other budget issues. The secretary believed that the United States could afford any amount needed for national security, but that [...] "this ability does not excuse us from applying strict standards of effectiveness and efficiency to the way <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> our defense dollars.... You {{have to make a}} judgment on how much is enough." [...] Acting on these principles, McNamara instituted a much-publicized cost reduction program, which, he reported, saved $14 billion in the five-year period beginning in 1961. Although he had to withstand a storm of criticism from senators and representatives from affected congressional districts, he closed many military bases and installations that he judged unnecessary to national security. He was equally determined about other cost-saving measures.|$|E
2500|$|His own organisation, The Life You Can Save, also {{recommends}} {{a selection of}} charities deemed by charity evaluators such as GiveWell {{to be the most}} effective when it comes to helping those in extreme poverty. TLYC was founded after Singer released his 2009 eponymous book, in which he argues more generally in favour of giving to charities that help to end global poverty. In particular, he expands upon some of the arguments made in his 1972 essay [...] "Famine, Affluence and Morality", in which he posits that citizens of rich nations are morally obligated to give at least some of their disposable income to charities that help the global poor. He supports this using the drowning child analogy, which states that most people would rescue a drowning child from a pond, even if it meant that their expensive clothes were ruined, so we clearly value a human life more than the value of our material possessions. As a result, we should take {{a significant portion of the}} money that <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> on our possessions and instead donate it to charity.|$|E
