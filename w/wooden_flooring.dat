5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. The {{plan was to}} rent a {{house across the street}} from the prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from the house to the prison. Berkman had been given access to a large portion of the prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the house to the stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the <b>wooden</b> <b>flooring,</b> and crawl through the tunnel to the house.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} built {{along the banks}} of the Loboc River. The coral stone church follows a {{cruciform}} plan, with a sunken pyramidal roof on its crossing. As a church built by the Jesuits, exterior walls of the church have the Jesuit insignia and icons of an angel's wing and head. Major renovations were undertaken by Augustinian priest Father Aquilino Bon, including the addition of a portico to the façade (1863–1866) and re-roofing with tiles (1873). Father José Sánchez, OAR, added stone buttresses to the walls (1891–1893) and side porticoes (1895–1896). Because of frequent flooding, its <b>wooden</b> <b>flooring</b> was changed to cement tiles in 1895 and was elevated in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Sri Temasek was {{not used}} {{for a number of}} years and fell into disrepair. It then {{underwent}} restoration between 2006 and March 2008 by CPG Consultants under the supervision of architect Maureen Soh. As the original hand-crafted timber arches and railings on the first-storey verandah had been damaged by termites, replacements moulded from the originals made with an aluminium-cast alloy were used. Details on railings, doors and windows were restored, and several pintu pagar (traditional wooden half-doors) and <b>wooden</b> <b>flooring</b> reinstated. The former servants' quarters at the rear of the building were turned into a heritage gallery. The restoration works on Sri Temasek won the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Architectural Heritage Award in Category A (national monuments and fully conserved buildings) in 2008.|$|E

5|$|The Chinatown of Kuala Terengganu (Malay: Kampung Cina, Simplified Chinese: 唐人坡, local pronunciation: Teng-lang-po) {{is one of}} {{the main}} tourist attractions. This {{settlement}} is a row of shophouses from the prewar era, with some of them dating back from the 1700s. Most of the houses are 2 stories high, mainly made of bricks or concrete, with <b>wooden</b> <b>flooring</b> for the second storey.

It is home to two Chinese temples, Ho Ann Kiong and Tien Hou Kong, which was built in 1801 and 1896. Another landmark is the 19th-century Low Tiey water well, erected in 1875. After years and years, it still supplies clean water to Chinatown's residents. Many of the buildings here have undergone restoration or beautification programmes to make them more appealing, but without destroying the heritage value. The recent attractions in Kampung China are its back alleys, many of which are transformed into thematic lanes containing various information, decorations and murals.|$|E

The wall and roof of the old subway were removed at the curve just south of the old Grand Central station, and trackways were built continuing east under 42nd Street, to bring those two tracks into the new station with a narrow island platform between them. The unused trackways of the proposed shuttle platform were covered with <b>wooden</b> <b>flooring</b> in 1918, and the width of the station was finished up as a passenger walkway between the Lexington Avenue Line and Shuttle stations.

25|$|Diedrich A. Bohlen, {{founder of}} the {{architectural}} firm of D.A. Bohlen and Son of Indianapolis, Indiana, designed the Indiana limestone church. Construction began in 1886, {{under the leadership of}} general superior Mother Euphrasie Hinkle. Its cornerstone was laid the same year. Although a fire destroyed the Providence motherhouse in 1889, the church, which was already under construction, was damaged but not destroyed. Noted architect Oscar D. Bohlen continued work on the project after his father, Diedrich, died in 1890. The church's exterior was completed in 1891; however, it took sixteen additional years before the interior was fully furnished. By June 1892 the plasterwork was completed and installation of temporary <b>wooden</b> <b>flooring,</b> seats, and altars permitted the sisters to worship in the unfinished church. An organ from William Schuelke Church Organ Builder of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was purchased in 1902; it was later replaced.|$|E

500|$|The new Lexington Avenue route curved {{off of the}} old line at 41st Street and ran {{underneath}} {{private property}} to reach Lexington Avenue at 43rd Street with a new Grand Central station located in the diagonal segment. Since there was 400 feet between {{the eastern end of}} the original line's station and the new Lexington Avenue Line station, a new shuttle station was to be built near the Lexington Avenue Line station. The construction of the narrow island platform station required building two new trackways extending east under 42nd Street. The two-track layout was expected to provide ample capacity for the shuttle. On August 1, 1918, the Dual Contracts' [...] "H system" [...] was put into service, with through trains over the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, and only shuttle trains under 42nd Street. The station was not ready in time, and therefore <b>wooden</b> <b>flooring</b> was temporarily laid over sections of the trackways at Times Square and Grand Central. The shuttle was heavily used, and the crowding conditions were so bad that the shuttle was ordered closed the next day by the Public Service Commission.|$|E
