40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} whether it has been profitable for a Swedishwheat farmer to hedge the harvest <b>with</b> <b>futures</b> contracts. The subject was chosen sincethe lack of empirical studies on the actual futures outcome for Swedish farmers. Datacomprising two exchanges (CBOT and MATIF) and daily futures prices for seven yearshas been applied for this thesis. The thesis has been restricted to only investigate futurescontracts as derivative instrument. Furthermore, this thesis is limited to autumn wheat inSweden and will only provide the perspective for a hedger. Since a farmer can enter acontract {{at any time during}} the contract period, two different methods have been used. The empirical results supports that hedging <b>with</b> <b>futures</b> contract, not only reduces pricefluctuations, but is also a useful tool for farmers to increase income.
