25|$|I had {{my editor}} count shots. There are 139 dance {{shots in the}} film. 111 are Natalie Portman untouched. 28 are her dance double Sarah Lane. If you do the math, that's 80% Natalie Portman. What about duration? The shots that feature the double are wide shots and rarely play for longer than one second. There are two {{complicated}} longer dance sequences that we used face replacement. Even so, if we were judging by time, over 90% would be Natalie Portman. And to be clear, Natalie did dance on pointe in pointe shoes. If {{you look at the}} final shot of the opening prologue, which lasts 85 seconds, and was danced completely by Natalie, she exits the scene on pointe. That is completely her without any digital magic. I am responding to this to put this to rest and to defend my actor. Natalie sweated long and hard to deliver a great physical and emotional performance. And I don't <b>want</b> <b>anyone</b> to think that's not her they are watching. It is.|$|E

As a result of the settlement of the copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Kevin McClory, Eon negotiated with McClory to make Thunderball.

500|$|Bhandarkar {{expressed}} disappointment {{about the}} Censor Board for Film Certification's decision {{to grant the}} film an [...] "A" [...] certificatemeant for viewers 18 years or olderinstead of the [...] "U/A" [...] certificate that he had expected. His previous films received U/A certification despite adult content. According to them, their new guidelines did not allow Fashion a U/A certification. The board was willing to issue a U/A certificate after several cuts; Bhandarkar refused and accepted the A certificate since the scenes in question were crucial to the narrative. Before its release, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) asked Bhandarkar to screen the film before its release due to its concern that Ranaut's character was based on Geetanjali Nagpala former high-profile fashion model found begging, bedraggled and mentally unbalanced {{on the streets of}} Delhi in 2007.

[...] The move to more intimate subject matter was [...] "semi-conscious" [...] because the band members did not want to focus on socio-political issues as they had in their previous works. Three tracks allude to Greek mythology: [...] "Ares" [...] draws its name from the god of war, [...] "Trojan Horse" [...] is named after the Trojan War military ruse, and [...] "Zephyrus" [...] draws its name from the god of the west wind. The narrative in the songs occurs between two people and focuses on the relations between lovers, friends, and enemies; Okereke indicated that [...] "it's about moments of shared vulnerability". [...] "Better Than Heaven" [...] references the Garden of Eden and , because the lyricist wanted to explore the themes of sex and death, especially in a biblical context.|$|E

500|$|Lord Pitfour is {{described}} as being good humoured but of a [...] "somewhat awkward manner" [...] and small in stature. His voice was shrill and he had poor eyesight. He was shrewd, kind and sympathetic, which put him at odds {{with some of his}} colleagues on the bench. Serving {{at the same time as}} Lord Braxfield, who had a reputation for handing down severe sentences, Pitfour was viewed as indecisive and too lenient. His desire to be fair and reach compromise had stood him in good stead as an advocate, but as a judge, these characteristics drew criticism from his contemporaries. Lord Kames was critical of him, maintaining that Pitfour did not <b>want</b> <b>anyone</b> to be hanged. Writing in 2008, local historian Alex Buchan speculated that Pitfour's hard life travelling around Scotland took too much of a toll on him, leading to a rapid decline in his health and ability.

All of the actors would fall backwards and hit their heads—particularly Lea Michele. You lose your balance really quick {{when you try to}} go up a ramp in a wheelchair. Amber Riley caught an edge going down a ramp and fell off completely. There were pile-ups; there were crashes. Basically, everything that could go wrong, did." [...] Murphy specified to Woodlee that cast members should not be able to leave their wheelchairs during the number, as: [...] "Artie doesn't get to get up ever, so I didn't <b>want</b> <b>anyone</b> to get up."

Carlisi would state: [...] "I think lyrically what lyricist Cal Curtis sketched out was brilliant, but the real thing that touches people is that one simple phrase 'a heart needs a second chance.' No one had said it like that before and that’s what makes a great song...Carl really brought it home and had such a marvelous voice.
