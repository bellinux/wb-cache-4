5|$|Despite his {{eagerness to}} start out again, Amundsen waited until mid-October and the first hints of spring. He was ready to leave on 15October, but <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by the weather {{for a few more}} days. On 19October 1911 the five men, with four sledges and fifty-two dogs, began their journey. The weather quickly worsened, and in heavy fog the party strayed into the field of crevasses that Johansen's depot party had {{discovered}} the previous autumn. Wisting later recalled how his sledge, with Amundsen aboard, nearly disappeared down a crevasse when the snow bridge broke underneath it.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 2016, Jet Airways flight 9W7083 from Bhopal to Mumbai <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by a {{large group}} of {{passengers}} headed for a marriage in Mumbai. There were allegations from other passengers that the wedding party was politically connected and attempted to coerce the cabin crew to disembark passengers, so that additional members of their party could be accommodated. The airline claimed it was a technical glitch in their booking system which led to overbooking.|$|E

50|$|A backless dress can <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> in {{a number}} of ways. The most common is by a single piece of cloth or strap which passes behind the wearer's neck, halterneck-style. The neck strap can itself be covered by the wearer's hair, leaving the {{impression}} from behind that nothing is holding the dress up. Alternatively, the dress may <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by short sleeves or by a single or two spaghetti straps, which hold the dress up at the shoulders. A stick-on dress or nude netting are other ways that a dress can <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R

The bill was known as the May-Johnson Bill for its sponsors. May immediately had the bill referred to the Military Affairs Committee, which held hearings on October 9. Bush, Conant and Groves all testified before the committee. But in the Senate Military Affairs Committee, the bill <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the last}} skirmishes of the war took place on July 25. A Swabian army marched from the Hegau on Schaffhausen, but met with fierce defense at Thayngen. Although the small force of {{defenders}} was finally overcome, and the village was pillaged, the defenders inflicted heavy casualties and the attack <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> {{long enough for the}} Swiss to send troops from Schaffhausen to meet the Swabians in the field. Misunderstandings between the Swabian knights and their foot soldiers made the Swabians retreat, and nightfall then prevented a larger battle.|$|E
5|$|St. Leger's {{artillery}} <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by {{a tactic}} {{that was also}} used to slow down Burgoyne's army {{after the fall of}} Ticonderoga: Gansevoort and his men had systematically felled trees across the wooded track the expedition came down, and St. Leger needed to clear the track to make way for his artillery. This work occupied all but 250 of St. Leger's white men, with the actual encirclement of the fort dominated by Indians.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of new D-class cruisers were canceled {{to make way for}} Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. The provisional names of the planned D-class cruisers, Ersatz Elsass and Ersatz Hessen, were reallocated to the new ships, the contracts for which were awarded to the Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven and the Deutsche Werke in Kiel. Construction <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by 14months, partly because Hitler wanted to secure the treaty with Britain before work began, and partly due to numerous design changes after the ships had been ordered.|$|E
5|$|Early in the advance, Maxwell's company {{commander}} was severely wounded, resulting in Maxwell assuming control. Reaching the German barbwire defences under intense machine-gun fire, the company suffered heavy casualties, including {{all of the}} officers except Maxwell. Pushing forward alone through a narrow passageway in the wire, Maxwell captured the most dangerous machine gun, killed three Germans and took another four as prisoners; thereby enabling the company {{to move through the}} wire and reach their objective. Shortly afterwards, it was noticed that the company on their left flank <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> and failing to advance. Gathering a party of men, Maxwell led the group in an attempt to attack the German force from the rear. They soon came under heavy machine gun fire, and, single-handedly, Maxwell dashed forward and attacked the foremost gun. Firing his revolver, he managed to shoot five of the crew and silence the gun.|$|E

If Carrouges lost, then Marguerite would be burnt at the stake for perjury. In fact, the duel was delayed a month as the King and his court, which contained most of the country's senior dukes and generals, <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> on campaign in Flanders and could not return in time. Eager to see what was rapidly becoming the event of the season, the King ordered the duel postponed until 29 December so that he would be present for its culmination.|$|E
5|$|Funding on the paving project between Buck Hill and the {{boundary}} of the national lakeshore <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up,</b> pending passage of a technical corrections bill by the US Senate. The original funding authorization specified that sections were being repaved; instead they were being paved {{for the first time}} or realigned. A technical corrections bill solved the legal hurdles involved. The road commission used state matching grants from the Michigan Department of Transportation to complete the financing needed to pave the roadway. Local officials received the checks to pay for the projects at a ceremony in August 2008. While the county completed a segment on their own in 2006, the 2008 projects paved segments of the roadway outside of the national lakeshore boundaries from Buck Hill northwards. Construction in 2009 and 2010 completed the roadway inside the park boundaries, including a new bridge over the Hurricane River.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham's {{nomination}} <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by Mississippi Senator James Eastland, {{the chairman}} of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a committed segregationist. Eastland delayed the nomination long enough so that, despite being passed by a subcommittee, Higginbotham's nomination lapsed following the death of President Kennedy, and {{the beginning of a new}} congressional term. He was ultimately appointed to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President Lyndon Johnson as a recess appointment on January 6, 1964, and was confirmed by the Senate later that year. At the time of his appointment, he was 35 years old. Higginbotham became a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, of Yale University, and of Thomas Jefferson University.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to increasing pressure from Navy leaders, Long created a permanent advisory staff after the war. The board, created in March 1900, {{was designed to}} unify {{the work of the}} Office of Naval Intelligence, the Naval War College, and the fleet leadership for the production of war plans and the proper preparation, planning, and deployment of naval resources in pursuit of objectives defined in those plans. After the war, Long pushed forward plans to establish a naval base in the Philippines, however, the funding for plans <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> in Congress, which repeatedly sought review of potential base locations in the islands. The matter was also caught up in branch rivalry with the War Department, which objected to the Navy's establishment of a permanent base there that was not under its authority. Construction of the Subic Bay Naval Base did not begin until after Long left office.|$|E
5|$|In {{the planned}} {{offensive}} on the Sangro, C Squadron was {{to follow the}} 19th Armoured Regiment in its advance at 03:00. Although its tanks reached the river, they bogged down {{in the mud and}} the squadron remained on the other bank as B Squadron advanced to Monte Marconi. Three troops from C Squadron finally crossed the river by the afternoon of 29 November; one was ordered to advance to Elici and a second was to make contact with the 8th Indian Infantry Division at La Defenza. The routes were mined and the troops spent the night at 23rd Battalion headquarters. In the morning, the mines were cleared and the second troop contacted the Indians and advanced east of Elici; the first troop <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by shelling south of Elici.|$|E
5|$|Ladas {{was sent}} to Doncaster for the St Leger on 12 September {{in an attempt to}} win the Triple Crown. Ridden by Tommy Loates, Ladas started at odds of 10/11 (0.9/1) in a field of eight, with Matchbox (ridden by Watts) the second choice on 2/1 and the filly Throstle ignored on 50/1. As usual, Ladas <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> {{at the back of the}} field as, at first Throstle, then a horse named Legal Tender, then Matchbox made the running. Ladas moved {{steadily}} closer and turned into the straight in second, before overtaking Matchbox and going into a clear lead. In the final furlong, however, he was challenged by Throstle, and in the closing stages the latter pulled ahead to win by three quarters of a length. According to The Sportsman, the cheers of the crowd were replaced by those of the bookmakers as the outsider overhauled the favourite.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur and Kenney did prevail on Washington {{to provide}} more troop carrier aircraft. In July, SWPA was given a high {{priority}} for transport aircraft, with six additional squadrons earmarked to bring it up to two groups. They were scheduled to arrive in November and December, but their movement was expedited, and the first new squadron, the 6th Troop Carrier Squadron, reached Port Moresby on 14 October. Part of the 33rd Troop Carrier Squadron <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> in the South Pacific Area, which also had urgent needs. In the meantime, ten DC-3s were converted into C-49s and C-50s at the Sacramento Air Depot and flown out to Australia, where they were allocated to the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron in September. Ten C-60 Lodestars were also despatched, which joined the 22nd Troop Carrier Squadron.|$|E
5|$|The 32nd Battalion was to {{commence}} its attack at Bellicourt at 09:00 on 29 September, and move south through the village. Due to mist and smoke from a preceding artillery barrage, visibility was poor. When the advance <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by two German machine guns, Wark ordered a tank to neutralise them. On reaching {{the southern end}} of St Quentin Canal tunnel, Wark came across two hundred troops of the American 117th Infantry Regiment who appeared to be leaderless, and attached them to his own command. A short time later, with visibility still poor, he appropriated armoured reinforcements and began an advance on the village of Nauroy. As the fog began to lift, Wark organised his troops for an attack on the village from a southerly direction. By 11:30, the battalion had taken the village, along with forty Germans as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the Franco–Belgian forces to hold the Ardennes gap was fatal. The Belgians had {{withdrawn}} laterally upon the initial invasion and had demolished and blocked routes of advance, which held up the French 2nd Army units moving north toward Namur and Huy. Devoid of any centre of resistance, the German assault engineers had cleared the obstacles unchallenged. The delay that the Belgian Ardennes Light Infantry, {{considered to be an}} elite formation, could have inflicted upon the advancing German armour was proved by the fight for Bodange, where the 1st Panzer Division <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> for a total of eight hours. This battle was a result of a breakdown in communications and ran contrary to the operational intentions of the Belgian Army.|$|E
