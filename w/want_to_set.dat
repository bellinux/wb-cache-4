5|$|As {{with earlier}} campaigns, {{recruiting}} enough men was a problem. Jefferson {{called for the}} western counties of Virginia to provide militia manpower for Clark's campaign, but county officials protested {{that they could not}} spare the men. Militiamen did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> out on a lengthy expedition—they would be gone for six months to a year—while their families and homes were threatened by Lord Cornwallis's army in the east, by Indian raids from the north, and by Loyalists at home. Because of this resistance, Jefferson called for volunteers rather than ordering the militia to accompany the expedition.|$|E

He looked for solace in addictive sleeping pills.

Murphy {{died in a plane crash}} in Virginia in 1971, which was shortly before his 46th birthday. He was interred with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.

25|$|When Qabbani was 15, his sister, who was 25 at the time, {{committed}} suicide because {{she refused to}} marry a man she did not love.

25|$|Former Labour first {{minister}} Henry McLeish published {{a report in}} May 2014 that found no obvious barriers to an independent Scotland competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics. McLeish said that some athletes, particularly those in team sports, may choose {{to compete for the}} existing Great Britain team rather than Scotland, as they would be nationals of both states. International Olympic Committee representative Craig Reedie pointed out that Scotland would need to obtain United Nations membership and may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> its own Olympic qualifying standards, which would need {{to be done in the}} period between independence (March 2016) and the closing date for entries (July 2016).|$|E

500|$|The {{significance}} of the fixture for the two clubs was increased by the fact that, had Arsenal avoided defeat, they would have extended their unbeaten league run to 50 matches. Wenger told reporters at his press conference that he felt no increased pressure, though added the team's midweek draw in the UEFA Champions League at Panathinaikos increased expectation. He admitted his team's behaviour in the fixture last season was unacceptable, but pointed out [...] "...the best response we gave was to win the fair play table. That meant we took responsibility for what we did and we have improved our attitude."

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Belgian Revolution, when candidatures were {{considered}} for the Belgian throne, Sébastiani [...] had the task of undermining support for Auguste of Leuchtenberg and drawing allegiances for the Duke of Nemours. After Nemours refused the Belgian crown, he transferred French support to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the British-backed candidate, in exchange for Leopold's agreeing to marry Louise-Marie of France. This policy was viewed as a capitulation by the Legitimists, and most notably by Jean Maximilien Lamarque, who, while deploring the separation of the French and the French-speaking Walloons, accused Sébastiani of having obtained the destruction of fortifications in Belgium not as a concession from other states, but rather because [...] "the allied powers <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> aside the means of entering France without running into obstacles".|$|E
