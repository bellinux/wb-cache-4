[...] The elder Willing claimed that Mary Ann Willing only possessed a life estate on her husband's property {{and could not}} have legally provided a <b>warranty</b> <b>deed</b> to Reavis. An attempt {{to raise funds for}} this suit was made by appealing to residents living within the grant and offering land for 20% less than the price set by Congress. [...] The attempt was unsuccessful. [...] As a result, Willing ran out of funds after a short time and was not heard from again.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>warranty</b> <b>deed</b> {{is a type}} of deed {{where the}} grantor (seller) {{guarantees}} that he or she holds clear title to a piece of real estate and has a right to sell it to the grantee (buyer). This is in contrast to a quitclaim deed, where the seller does not guarantee that he or she holds title to a piece of real estate. A general <b>warranty</b> <b>deed</b> protects the grantee against title defects arising at any point in time, extending back to the property's origins. A special <b>warranty</b> <b>deed</b> protects the grantee only against title defects arising from the actions or omissions of the grantor.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{acquisition}} {{through a}} deed of sale, a quiet title action {{will give the}} party seeking such relief no cause of action against previous owners of the property, unless the plaintiff in the quiet title action acquired its interest through a <b>warranty</b> <b>deed</b> and had to bring the action to settle defects that existed when the <b>warranty</b> <b>deed</b> was delivered.|$|E

40|$|When {{houses are}} sold {{they come with}} a deed {{attached}} that spells out the legal guarantees on good title. Some deeds give clues about {{the characteristics of the}} seller or the house. Using a 37, 043 -observation house price hedonic with a Bayesian spatial error model, we find the type of deed attached to a housing sale can have a dramatic correlation with the sale price. Ten deed types command a discount, and one commands a premium relative to <b>warranty</b> <b>deeds.</b> Mortgage rates for sheriff's deeds and foreclosure deeds are lower than for <b>warranty</b> <b>deeds,</b> indicating more sophisticated buyers.

50|$|While {{living in}} Lewistown and Havana, Ossian Ross engaged in land speculation, {{purchasing}} <b>warranty</b> <b>deeds,</b> quitclaim deeds, and tax deeds, typically for good quality land. Much {{of the land}} was then sold at roughly a 25 percent profit. In addition to providing a source of income, some of the land speculation by local businessmen such as Ross {{also served as a}} valuable resource for local farmers. For example, Ross' frequent practice of buying land with quitclaim deeds and then selling the land back to the original owner at the auction price in essence provided a source of loans to farmers in the absence of banks, which did not exist in the region until the 1850s.|$|R
50|$|Some jurisdictions use the <b>warranty</b> <b>deed</b> to {{transfer}} real property {{instead of the}} grant deed. The <b>warranty</b> <b>deed</b> adds the additional guarantee that the grantor will defend the title against any third-party claim. The quitclaim deed is also sometimes used, although this document is most often used to disclaim any interest in a property rather than selling a property that one owns.|$|E

50|$|On November 4, 1845, a <b>warranty</b> <b>deed</b> was {{recorded}} {{for the purchase}} of the tract of land in question from Benjamin Franklin Blossom to John Lenhard.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{property}} deeds, a quitclaim deed contains no title covenant and thus offers the grantee no warranty {{as to the}} status of the property title; the grantee is entitled only to whatever interest the grantor actually possesses at the time the transfer occurs. This means that the grantor does not guarantee that he or she actually owns any interest in the property {{at the time of the}} transfer, or if he or she does own an interest, that the title is free and clear. It is, therefore, possible for a grantee to receive no actual interest, and [...] - [...] because a quitclaim <b>deed</b> offers no <b>warranty</b> [...] - [...] have no legal recourse to recover any losses. Further, if the grantor should acquire the property at a later date, the grantee is not entitled to take possession, because the grantee can only receive the interest the grantor held at the time the transfer occurred. In contrast, other deeds often used for real estate sales (called grant <b>deeds</b> or <b>warranty</b> <b>deeds,</b> depending on the jurisdiction) contain warranties from the grantor to the grantee that the title is clear or that the grantor has not placed any encumbrance against the title.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{this lack}} of <b>warranty,</b> {{quitclaim}} <b>deeds</b> are most often used to transfer property between family members, as gifts, placing personal property into a business entity (and vice versa) or in other special or unique circumstances. An example use for a quitclaim deed is in divorce, whereby one spouse terminates any interest in the jointly owned marital home, thereby granting the receiving spouse full rights to the property. For example, when one spouse acquires the marital home in a divorce settlement, the other spouse could execute a quitclaim deed eliminating their interest in the property and transferring full claim to the other spouse, quickly and inexpensively.|$|R
5000|$|Jaffe, {{a native}} of New York, moved to Canada in the early 1970s. In Canada, he worked as an {{international}} economist. After his move, he also continued {{to do business in}} the United States. He was involved in land deals in Putnam County, Florida as an employee of the Atlantic Commercial Development Corporation. Jaffe sought purchasers for subdivided lots of land, but due to a dispute with the original holder of the mortgage on the lots, Jaffe issued quitclaim <b>deeds</b> rather than <b>warranty</b> <b>deeds</b> to purchasers. In August 1980, Jaffe was arrested on twenty-eight counts of violating the Florida Land Sales Practices Act. Accredited Surety & Casualty posted a US$137,500 bail bond for him. Jaffe then returned to Canada and applied to naturalise as a Canadian citizen. He failed to appear at his May 1981 trial, and was tried in absentia. AS&C faced forfeiture of its bail bond if Jaffe were not returned in 90 days. As a result, AS&C employee Daniel Kear, along with independent bounty hunter Timm Johnsen, then traveled to Canada in pursuit of Jaffe. In September 1981, they intercepted Jaffe at his apartment building as he returned from jogging, and took him in their car back to the United States. Jaffe later testified that Johnsen and Kear threatened him to obtain his cooperation, telling him that his daughter would be harmed he did not cooperate and that they could return him to Florida [...] "dead or alive", while attorneys for Johnsen and Kear claimed that Jaffe cooperated willingly because of the bail bond agreement.|$|R

5000|$|A {{real estate}} {{contract}} typically does not convey or transfer ownership {{of real estate}} by itself. A different document called a deed is used to convey real estate. In a real estate contract, the type of deed {{to be used to}} convey the real estate may be specified, such as a <b>warranty</b> <b>deed</b> or a quitclaim deed. If a deed type is not specifically mentioned, [...] "marketable title" [...] may be specified, implying a <b>warranty</b> <b>deed</b> should be provided.

5000|$|Around 1930 Mille Smith Eastman became rather {{interested}} in Scouting. Her interest in Scouting {{continued to grow}} with each succeeding year, and in July 1930 she bought an additional 15 acre for the camp from Mr. Roy W. Pilkington. All the other tracts of land composing the camp site have been conveyed by straight <b>warranty</b> <b>deeds</b> and carry no burden. A holding company composed of nine directors was incorporated under {{the laws of the}} State of Illinois, on the May 25, 1931, as a non-profit corporation for the purpose of holding the lands and properties of the camp. Said company {{to be known as the}} Boy Scout Camp Corporation with its Illinois headquarters located at Hamilton, Illinois. The Rotary Club, up to this point had invested $3,223.80 on land, buildings and equipment. All of this was transferred to the Boy Scouts of America on December 21, 1931, and the camp’s name was changed to in July 1930. Mrs. Eastman continued to purchase and add additional tracts to the camp. On December 3, 1936, she bought a tract that gave the camp an unbroken shoreline of 7250 ft and a total of 137½ acres of land for the camp. In 1934 Mrs. Eastman began construction on a stone lodge in memory of her husband. She spread the mortar herself and laid the cornerstone in 1935. In 1942 construction took place for a home for the camp ranger. And In 1943 she provided a concrete block building; half to be used for recreation and a canteen and the other half for storage, nicknamed the Bee Hive. The Order of Eagles contributed $800.00 to build four sleeping cabins and later on in 1943, they gave an additional sum to re-roof and refit these buildings. The group of buildings was known as the [...] "Eagles' Nest". The V.F.W. of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa gave funds for a Troop cabin, which was used to house the summer Camp Staff.|$|R

40|$|This {{sequel to}} the authors 2 ̆ 7 2007 article, Fugacious 1, follows the same outline and {{considers}} the same topics as the original article while considering the major developments since Fugacious 1 was published. Whereas Fugacious 1 was a basic primer on Arkansas oil and gas law, this article supplements the development of Arkansas oil and gas law {{over the last five}} years through an overview of the litigation concerning the Fayetteville Shale Play. Specifically, the article expands on those topics covered by Fugacious 1 needing revision or supplementation, while simply noting as such the sections where no revision or supplementation is necessary. The authors begin their supplementation by considering the ownership of natural gas found within coal formations and conclude that a coal owner may vent coal-bed methane away from its operations pursuant to safe mining practices while owing nothing to the gas owner for the gas lost as a result thereof. However, the coal owner may not capture and sell the coal-bed methane without the gas owner 2 ̆ 7 s permission. Next, the article discusses two recent Arkansas Court of Appeals cases considering reservation language in reservation deeds. The article then discusses the evolution of the Strohacker doctrine in Arkansas, concluding that the area where evidence of knowledge of oil and gas as mineral is relevant is not precisely limited to the county containing the lands. The authors then consider problems with severing minerals, and Arkansas 2 ̆ 7 Duhig doctrine, a bright line rule of property regarding mineral interests which applies to <b>warranty</b> <b>deeds</b> but not to quit-claim deeds. The authors examine a recent case where their opinion from Fugacious 1, that every purported tax forfeiture of a severed mineral interest for a tax year prior to 1986 was void for failure of the tax assessors in Arkansas 2 ̆ 7 s various counties to properly subjoin mineral assessments to surface assessments of the same lands prior to 1985 legislation, which removed the subjoinder requirement, was proven correct. The authors discuss ingress and egress, and a recent Arkansas Supreme Court holding where the Court found that Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission 2 ̆ 7 s General Rule B- 42 requires express permission to conduct seismic testing despite the tester 2 ̆ 7 s ingress and egress right. Regarding oil and gas leases, the authors provide a thorough analysis of the revised Ark. Code Ann. § 15 - 73 - 701 and its implications to the oil and gas business. The authors finish their supplementation with a discussion of implied covenants in leases and the prudent operator standard codified in Ark. Code Ann. § 15 - 73 - 701, the Rule of Capture, and the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction to interpret contracts. In conclusion, the article notes that as this area of the law continues to develop and generate complex litigation, more issues are sure to sure to arise in the years to come...|$|R

50|$|In the {{transfer}} of real estate, a deed conveys ownership from the old owner (the grantor) to the new owner (the grantee), and can include various warranties. The precise name and nature of these warranties differ by jurisdiction. Often, however, the basic differences between them {{is the degree to}} which the grantor warrants the title. The grantor may give a general warranty of title against any claims, or the warranty may be limited to only claims which occurred after the grantor obtained the real estate. The latter type of deed is usually known as a special <b>warranty</b> <b>deed.</b> While a general <b>warranty</b> <b>deed</b> was normally used for residential real estate sales and transfers, special warranty deeds are becoming more common and are more commonly used in commercial transactions.|$|E
