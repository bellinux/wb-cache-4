The {{purpose of}} the work: to justify the possibility of introduction of the spring turnip, spring <b>winter-cress,</b> Sarept charlock from the world collection VIR in the south part of the North-West Russian Non-Chernozem Zone. The detailed characteristic of the biology of blossoming, pollination, fruitification of 27 sort-specimens of the turnip, <b>winter-cress</b> and charlock of Sarept, has been given, the different determinants of {{the reduction of the}} seeds production have been established, the role of the entomophilia in realization of PP and PSP has been revealed. Using the revealed antiecological peculiarities of the decomposers to be studied, it is possible to increase the seeds outlet from the plants by 20 to 30 % with the aid of involving the melliferous bees as the pollinators. The sorts-specimens have been recommended by the height of the plant, the crop of the green phytomass and seeds for the selection purposes.
