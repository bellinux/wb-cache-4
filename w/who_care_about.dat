500|$|Phoenix's {{childhood}} friend Miles Edgeworth, {{who is the}} protagonist of the Ace Attorney Investigations games, is a recurring rival prosecutor character; in addition to him, each new game in the series introduces a new rival: Franziska von Karma is introduced in the second game, Godot in the third, Klavier Gavin in the fourth, Simon Blackquill in the fifth, and Nahyuta Sahdmadhi in the sixth. The prosecutor characters are portrayed as powerful and arrogant characters of high social status, who favor convictions over finding the truth, and <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> keeping perfect-win records in court. Similarly to real Japanese prosecutors, the prosecutors in the series often directly oversee investigations, issuing orders to the police. Japanese attitudes towards the police force {{are reflected in the}} series, with the police being represented by incompetent characters such as Dick Gumshoe, Maggey Byrde and Mike Meekins. In the world of Ace Attorney, trials only last three days, and usually end with a [...] "guilty" [...] verdict. The outcomes of cases are decided by a judge, based on evidence provided by the defense attorney and the prosecutor.|$|E
500|$|SAS spokespeople say its {{employee}} benefits are provided for business, not altruistic, reasons. The company evaluates new benefits using three criteria: {{whether it would}} benefit the company culture, whether it would serve {{a significant number of}} employees and whether it would save more money than is spent on it. According to academics, the company's practices improve the loyalty, focus and creativity of its staff. Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer from the Stanford Graduate School of Business estimated that the company saves $60–$80 million annually in expenses related to employee turnover. SAS has an annual employee turnover of three to five percent, while the software industry's average is 20 to 25 percent. According to USA Today, the workplace culture has created [...] "intensely loyal" [...] staff <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the company's well-being. [...] Even though there are unlimited sick days, the average employee takes only two. The 40,000 free medical visits provided to employees annually are estimated to cost the company $4.5 million USD, but save it $5 million USD due to the employee productivity lost when staff spend their work-hours in waiting rooms at other hospitals.|$|E
500|$|... "Simpson Safari"'s setpiece {{shows some}} of Springfield's {{citizens}} mistreating the bag boys {{in a grocery}} store, prompting the bag boys to go on strike. The sequence was inspired by an Albertsons store in Los Angeles, whose employees went on strike {{at the time the}} episode was written. The idea to have the Simpsons visit Africa was pitched by former staff writer Larry Doyle. Former staff writer John Swartzwelder was then assigned to write the first draft of the episode's script. Because of his involvement with the episode, [...] "Simpson Safari" [...] contains several [...] "classic" [...] Swarzwelder-type jokes, according to staff writer Matt Selman. Examples of these include the cover of the Animal Cracker box and Homer and Dr. Joan Bushwell's discussion about the smell of feces in the doctor's hut. After Swarzwelder wrote the first draft, the writing staff rewrote the script. When writing the episode, the writers deliberately included factual errors to annoy viewers who wanted the series to seem realistic. Commenting on the episode, Selman said [...] "It's kind of a combination of really nice, observational designs and then just [...] things that are deliberately wrong. To anger people <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> things being real." ...|$|E

500|$|Franklin {{argues that}} the end of the Cold War brought two main changes. First, the threat of war between the United States and Soviet Union was {{replaced}} by regional wars among smaller states. Second, war was transposed to what Franklin calls [...] "another key"—the struggle for global commercial and economic dominance. She asserts that this new form of war is now called globalization and its battlefields are global stock and currency markets. This economic warfare defines the enemy as all those <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the values of community. [...] "Whatever cannot be merely bought and sold," [...] Franklin writes, [...] "whatever cannot be expressed in terms of money and gain-loss transactions stands in the way of the 'market' as enemy territory to be occupied, transformed and conquered." [...] A main strategy in this kind of warfare is the privatization of formerly public domains such as culture, health care, prisons and education to generate private profit. Franklin contends that the new economic warlords or [...] "marketeers" [...] aim, for example, to transform [...] "the ill health or misery of our neighbours into investment opportunities for the next round of capitalism." [...] She argues that marketeers have become occupying forces served by [...] "puppet governments who run the country for the benefit of the occupiers." [...] Franklin has also noted that in democratic politics, the economy is all that seems to matter. [...] "Canada has almost no foreign policy," [...] she says, [...] "but rather is part of an elaborate network of trade agreements." ...|$|E

His interview with Obama was on the Senator's first day. Uninterested in Favreau's résumé, Obama instead questioned Favreau on what motivated him to work in politics, and what his theory of writing was. He described this theory to Obama as, [...] "A speech can broaden the circle of people <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> this stuff.

2500|$|Hitchens {{described}} Zionism as [...] "an ethno-nationalist quasi-religious ideology" [...] but {{argued that}} Zionism [...] "...nonetheless has founded {{a sort of}} democratic state which isn't any worse in its practice than many others with equally dubious origins." [...] He stated that settlement {{in order to achieve}} security for Israel is [...] "doomed to fail in the worst possible way", and the cessation of this [...] "appallingly racist and messianic delusion" [...] would [...] "confront the internal clerical and chauvinist forces which want to instate a theocracy for Jews". Hitchens contended that the [...] "solution of withdrawal would not satisfy the jihadists" [...] and wondered [...] "What did they imagine would be the response of the followers of the Prophet ?" [...] Hitchens bemoaned the transference of Arab secularism into religious terrorism as a means of democratisation: [...] "the most depressing and wretched spectacle of the past decade, for all those <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> democracy and secularism, has been the degeneration of Palestinian Arab nationalism into the theocratic and thanatocratic hell of Hamas and Islamic Jihad". He maintained that the Israel-Palestine conflict is a [...] "trivial squabble" [...] that has become [...] "so dangerous to all of us" [...] because of [...] "the faith-based element." ...|$|E
2500|$|The editing {{of the car}} chase by Frank P. Keller likely won Keller {{the editing}} Oscar for 1968, and has been {{included}} in lists of the [...] "Best Editing Sequences of All-Time". Paul Monaco has written, [...] "The most compelling street footage of 1968, however, appeared in an entirely contrived sequence, with nary a hint of documentary feel about it – the car chase {{through the streets of}} San Francisco in Bullitt, created from footage shot over nearly five weeks. Billy Fraker, the cinematographer for the film, attributed the success of the chase sequence primarily to the work of the editor, Frank P. Keller. At the time, Keller was credited with cutting the piece in such a superb manner that he made the city of San Francisco a [...] "character" [...] in the film." [...] The editing of the scene was not without difficulties; Ralph Rosenblum wrote in 1979 that [...] "those <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> such things may know that during the filming of the climactic chase scene in Bullitt, an out-of-control car filled with dummies tripped a wire which prematurely sent a costly set up in flames, and that editor Frank Keller salvaged the near-catastrophe with a clever and unusual juxtaposition of images that made the explosion appear to go off on time." [...] This chase scene has also been cited by critics as groundbreaking in its realism and originality. In the release print and the print shown for many years, a scene in which the Charger actually hits the camera causing a red flare on screen, which many feel added to the realism, was edited out on DVD prints to the disappointment of many fans.|$|E
