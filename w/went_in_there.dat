500|$|Taylor wanted Asgard in {{this film}} {{to have a more}} natural look than its predecessor. To achieve this, crews filmed the coast of Norway with an Arri Alexa camera for three days in a helicopter, {{capturing}} six hours of footage. Double Negative then embedded their CG rendering of Asgard on shots of the natural landscape. Double Negative visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, [...] "The benefit of that is that you have some real world terrain to work with – so you have buildings that have to convey natural features. Then from there we <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> populating the terrain with different buildings." [...] For scenes taking place on Svartalfheim, production filmed in Iceland with Double Negative adding ruins, mountains, Dark Elf ships, and skies.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{the band}} started {{performing}} at higher profile gigs {{such as the}} Warped Tour. Cuomo later remarked, [...] "We <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> fully expecting to be booed and to have things thrown at us. But it was exactly the opposite, people were singing along to all the songs and just going crazy, giving us the best support. And I think that gave us the confidence we needed." [...] The positive response to the Warped Tour performances led to further shows being scheduled. When touring began to wind down, MP3 demos captured live on the band's mobile unit and sound checks began to surface on file-sharing services and eventually for downloading on the band's official website. These songs were {{often referred to as}} Summer Songs of 2000 (commonly abbreviated as SS2K).|$|E

500|$|On August 5, {{the band}} cut [...] "Black Hearted Woman" [...] and [...] "Trouble No More", {{and the group}} {{completed}} [...] "Whipping Post" [...] after another day off on August 7 (it took the entirety of that day’s session to complete the recording, {{despite the fact that}} they had performed the number countless times). The next day, the band attempted to record [...] "Statesboro Blues," [...] which was the song that influenced Duane Allman to begin slide playing. Unable to achieve the same energy as it would performed live, the band scrapped the recording and session for the day. [...] "Every Hungry Woman" [...] was recorded on August 11, and their last day in the studio on Tuesday, August 12 produced a final version of [...] "Dreams". Johanson remembered the process as only taking four days; [...] "We <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> played our asses off, and that was it; we were done in four days and they spent the rest of the time mixing," [...] said Johanson.|$|E
500|$|Montana told MTV News {{about working}} with Cyrus, [...] "I was in L.A. and she {{happened}} {{to be doing the}} 'Ain't Worried About Nothin'' remix for me. She came by the studio and let me hear her album, which was crazy, and we just went through a couple tracks to see which one I fit on." [...] He continued, [...] "Then she played 'FU' and I fell in love with it. We just <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and did it together." [...] Regarding the theme of the song, he explained, [...] "It's two letters 'F' and 'U.' You've just got two letters for somebody when you get to that point, when somebody breaks your heart and you're in a relationship which has gone sour. So now you've only got two letters for them, 'F' and 'U'." [...] Its lyrics dismiss a cheating ex, as mentioned in the lines [...] "I don't really have much to say/ I was over it the second that I saw her name/ I got two letters for you/ One of them is F/ And the other one is U/ 'Cause what you gotta do/ is go get yourself a clue." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his transfer, Garland {{opened his}} stint with La Salle on December 15, 2012 in a road game against Bucknell, scoring 9 points in 22 minutes {{off the bench}} and {{recording}} 2 turnovers and 4 personal fouls. He did not {{take part in the}} team's earlier games because he was ineligible due to NCAA regulations regarding player transfers. In the game that followed, he posted a career-best 26 points as a bench player in a win over Iona. He also added 3 rebounds, an assist, and a steal in the 23 minutes he was on the court. In a seven-minute stretch in the second half, Garland scored 14 straight points. He said after the game, [...] "I used to do it in high school. It kind of felt like high school when I was out there; it just felt good". Garland, who led the Explorers in scoring, also received praise from head coach John Giannini. On December 22, 2012, he had another impactful performance vs Sacred Heart, with six assists in 31 minutes of play. This was also his first-ever start under Giannini. The coach commented about Garland, [...] "He's a very underrated passer. People think because he scored all those points in high school he's a scorer first and foremost. I think he's a very good passer". However, this would be his sole start in his junior year at La Salle. Garland was effective in the opening, First Four round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament against Boise State, finishing with a team-high 22 points and, in turn, scoring 20 or more points for the second time as a junior. After the game, Giannini told Garland, [...] "This is why I chased you all over the place, to win NCAA tournament games and see if you could be a great player". On March 23, 2014, against the Ole Miss Rebels, Garland made a scooping layup off the backboard with 2.5 seconds left in regulation to send La Salle into the Sweet 16 round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The game-winner was known as the [...] "Southwest Philly Floater," [...] following Garland's post-game comments, in which he said, [...] "That's the Southwest Philly Floater, man. Shoutout to my Cousin Bern, shoutout to my Mom". He made the shot in spite of defensive efforts from the Rebels' 6ft 9 in (2.06 m) center Reginald Buckner, who had blocked the Explorer multiple times in the game. Garland recalled the play, saying, [...] "Time was running out, and I felt like I could get the drive. When I cut, I just saw an opening and took the ball up...I <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and knew if I could get an open shot, I could make it". Following a defeat to Wichita State that ended the team's tournament run and their season, Garland was averaging 13.1 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 2 assists.|$|E

Soon, Tracht was mopping floors and {{cleaning}} bathrooms for four hours a day, several times a week. He volunteered for four months, laboring with unemployed and homeless people. Of the experience, Tracht stated: [...] "It's {{the kind of place where}} you can rediscover yourself. I did things I'd never done in my life. I <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> like an idiot, and now I know how to clean and mop, how to shovel and unload, how to slice and dice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hall's {{breakout}} role came in 1984, when he {{was cast}} as Farmer Ted, the scrawny, braces-wearing geek, who pursued Molly Ringwald's character in John Hughes' directing debut Sixteen Candles. Hall tried to avoid the clichés of geekness. [...] "I didn't play him with 100 pens sticking out of his pocket," [...] he said. [...] "I just <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and played it like a real kid. The geek is just a typical freshman." [...] Hall landed {{a spot on the}} promotional materials, along with co-star Ringwald. Reviews of the film were positive for Hall and his co-stars, and one for People Weekly even claimed that Hall's performance [...] " [...] the film" [...] from Ringwald. Despite achieving only moderate success at the box office, the film made overnight stars of Ringwald and Hall.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the debate}} John Kerry accused Bush of {{having failed to}} gain {{international}} support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying [...] "... when we <b>went</b> <b>in,</b> <b>there</b> were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States. That's not a grand coalition. We can do better." [...] Bush, who had used Poland earlier in the debate {{as an example of}} the international presence in Iraq, replied by saying [...] "Well, actually, he forgot Poland. And now there's 30 nations involved, standing side by side with our American troops." [...] Paraphrased as [...] "You forgot Poland", the term became a popular catchphrase among Bush detractors, who saw it as a humorously petty rebuttal of Kerry's original point. Though Bush had originally claimed that over 40 nations were supporting the invasion, only four nations (specifically, the four mentioned) had actually contributed over 1,000 troops – not counting the post-Saddam Iraqi police and security forces, who lost significant numbers in the Iraqi insurgency.|$|E

2500|$|However, not all {{opinions}} on the subject among prominent mountaineers are strictly negative. For example, Edmund Hillary, who went on record saying {{that he has not}} liked [...] "the commercialization of mountaineering, particularly of Mt. Everest" [...] and claimed that [...] "Having people pay $65,000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guides...isn't really mountaineering at all", nevertheless noted that he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area by Westerners, [...] "I don't have any regrets because I worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people. When we first <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> they didn't have any schools, they didn't have any medical facilities, all over the years we have established 27 schools, we have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then we've built bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines so in cooperation with the Sherpas we've done a lot to benefit them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics of {{ties between}} Iraq Study Group members and oil {{companies}} were {{highly critical of}} the report's recommendations to privatize the Iraqi oil industry. Author Antonia Juhasz argued that this recommendation amounted to a call for [...] "extending the war in Iraq to ensure that US oil companies get what the Bush administration <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> for: control and greater access to Iraq's oil." [...] Similarly, activist Tom Hayden noted that the Iraq Study Group represents the interests of the US oil industry. James A. Baker, III's law firm has interests in debt repayment to Kuwait and other Gulf States. Lawrence S. Eagleburger has ties to Halliburton and Phillips Petroleum, and is a former head of Kissinger Associates, a corporate consulting firm. (Paul Bremer was managing partner of Kissinger Associates.)

2500|$|Welsh {{classical}} singer Katherine Jenkins {{recorded a}} cover version of [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] on her 2009 album Believe. Jenkins said: [...] "I'd mentioned that I {{wanted to try}} Evanescence's Bring Me to Life and David [...] said 'you can't sing that'. I came out there questioning my vocal abilities. I'm just not used to being told that. I went home that night and I just thought to myself 'you have to pull yourself together, he's worked with so many incredible artists you {{have to step up}} the plate.' I did talk myself round and I <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> the next day on a mission. It's good to be pushed sometimes – and I proved him wrong!" [...] Jenkins decided to change the [...] guitar-led and percussive original version and instead, [...] "make it more orchestral with the percussion coming from the strings." [...] Alfred Hickling of The Guardian gave a mixed review of Jenkins' cover, calling it [...] "histrionic." [...] However, a writer of BBC Online chose her version of the song as a highlight on the album. On October 23, 2009, the song was available for digital download as the second single from Believe. On November 23, 2011, Jenkins sang the song live at the Leicester Square station in London.|$|E
