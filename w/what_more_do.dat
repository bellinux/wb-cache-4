2500|$|Coulter {{also cited}} the 2002 Senate {{testimony}} of FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley, who was acclaimed for condemning her superiors {{for refusing to}} authorize a search warrant for 9-11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui when he refused to consent to a search of his computer. They {{knew that he was}} a Muslim in flight school who had overstayed his visa, and the French Intelligence Service had confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups. Coulter said she agreed that probable cause existed in the case, but that refusing consent, being in flight school and overstaying a visa should not constitute grounds for a search. Citing a poll which found that 98 percent of Muslims between the ages of 20 and 45 said they would not fight for Britain in the war in Afghanistan, and that 48 percent said they would fight for Osama bin Laden she asserted [...] "any Muslim who has attended a mosque in Europe—certainly in England, where Moussaoui lived—has had 'affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups,'" [...] so that she parsed Rowley's position as meaning that [...] "'probable cause' existed to search Moussaoui's computer because he was a Muslim who had lived in England." [...] Coulter says the poll was [...] "by the [...] "Daily Telegraph", actually it was by Sunrise, an [...] "Asian" [...] (i.e., Indian subcontinent-oriented) radio station, canvassing the opinions of 500 Muslims in Greater London (not Britain as a whole), mainly of Pakistani origin and aged between 20 and 45. Because [...] "FBI headquarters ... refused to engage in racial profiling," [...] they failed to uncover the 9-11 plot, Coulter asserted. [...] "The FBI allowed thousands of Americans to be slaughtered on the altar of political correctness. <b>What</b> <b>more</b> <b>do</b> liberals want?" ...|$|E
