Just then the car swung over the summit of a raise, and we saw the white tents and grazing camels of an {{enormous}} caravan. Of course, Mongols would have mutton fat and why not use that for oil! The caravan leader assured us that he had fat in plenty and in ten minutes a great pot of it was warming over the fire. We poured it into the motor and proceeded merrily on our way.|$|E
500|$|After {{working on}} their debut self-titled album, Whodini {{embarked}} on a three-month European tour. Two-and-a-half weeks into this tour, {{they were joined by}} Kangol Kid and UTFO. The group had also planned to tour in Israel and Australia following their European tour, but refused to do so, as they had been away from home for three weeks and found the tour [...] "rigorous". Singer-songwriter Jalil Hutchins later said, [...] "Somebody should've stepped in and made us [...]" [...] Whodini member John Fletcher (Ecstasy) said that the group thought European audiences would be unfamiliar with their music, but they [...] "found that lots of kids, lots of club owners, had made a real effort to get hold of our music. When <b>we</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that,</b> we realized that the music we were working with really was universal, that we didn't have to think of a particular market. People everywhere like to dance, sweat and party, and they like the same kind of sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{their more}} visible Discovery years, Daft Punk {{appeared}} wearing robotic headgear and metallic gloves for publicity photo shoots, interviews, live shows and music videos. The helmets were produced by Paul Hahn of Daft Arts and the French directors Alex and Martin, the duo who also designed them. With engineering by Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc., {{they are capable}} of various LED effects. Wigs were originally attached to both helmets, but the duo removed them just before the outfits were publicly unveiled in 2001. Daft Punk introduced the costumes to many U.S. television viewers in an advertisement during a special presentation of the music videos from the Discovery album during Cartoon Network's Toonami block. Bangalter once stated, [...] "We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09am on September 9, 1999, it exploded. When we regained consciousness, <b>we</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> we had become robots." ...|$|E

500|$|The film's {{producers}} {{launched a}} nationwide talent hunt to discover new faces for the film, initially refusing to employ established actors. However, the actors {{who came to}} audition were not promising enough for the roles, and the idea was scrapped. Mahesh Bhatt said, [...] "It was a disastrous talent hunt. <b>We</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> people lacked the courage to audition. Those who are amateurs went for audition ...and people with certain talent were like why should we risk public rejection." [...] When Suri saw some pictures of Aditya Roy Kapur and met him, he found Kapur perfect for the role and cast him to play the male lead. In June 2012, Shraddha Kapoor was signed to play the female lead. Bhatt said, [...] "Yes, Shraddha Kapoor is playing the lead with the two boys Aditya Roy Kapur and Shaad Randhawa. We found her to be very talented. All three actors have extremely challenging dramatic roles." [...] When asked about replacing new actors with known ones, Suri said [...] "People said I couldn't make a film with new actors and expect an audience to come in. But I was pretty sure I wanted Aditya and Shraddha to play my protagonists. My writer Shagufta Rafique and I saw them as the protagonists. See, Aditya and Shraddha may have had unsuccessful films before. But that never took away from their talent." ...|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after <b>we</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E
2500|$|In recent years, the {{publication}} of relatively accurate histories by authors Simon Reynolds (Generation Ecstasy, also known as Energy Flash) and Dan Sicko (Techno Rebels), plus mainstream press coverage of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, have helped to diffuse the genre's more dubious mythology. Even the Detroit-based company Ford Motors eventually became savvy to the mass appeal of techno, noting that [...] "this music was created partly by the pounding clangor of the Motor City's auto factories. It became natural for us to incorporate Detroit techno into our commercials after <b>we</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> young people are embracing techno." [...] With a marketing campaign targeting under-35s, Ford used [...] "Detroit Techno" [...] as a print ad slogan and chose Model 500's [...] "No UFO's" [...] to underpin its November 2000 MTV television advertisement for the Ford Focus.|$|E

40|$|We {{probe the}} pure Einstein's gravity {{contributions}} to the second-order density power spectrum. In the small-scale, <b>we</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> the Einstein's gravity contribution is negligibly small. This guarantees that Newton's gravity is sufficient to handle the baryon acoustic oscillation scale. In the large scale, however, <b>we</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> the Einstein's gravity contribution to the second-order power spectrum dominates the linear-order power spectrum. Thus, pure Einstein gravity contribution appearing in the third-order perturbation leads to an infrared divergence in the power spectrum.

2500|$|As {{with many}} musicians {{during the period}} in Los Angeles, the band began using copious amounts of cocaine. Fleetwood {{would go on to}} {{recollect}} in his autobiography that [...] "Until then, Fleetwood Mac hadn't had much experience with this Andean rocket fuel. Now <b>we</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> a toot now and then relieved the boredom of long hours in the studio with little nourishment." [...] The personal relationships between the band members were becoming frayed. After six months of non-stop touring, the McVies divorced in August 1975, ending nearly eight years of marriage. The couple stopped talking to each other socially and discussed only musical matters. Buckingham and Nicks also fought often, a fact that was revealed to fans by Rolling Stone in April 1976. The duo's arguments stopped only when they worked on songs together. At the same time, Christine McVie and Nicks became closer. Fleetwood, meanwhile, began searching for a new recording location, and landed on the Record Plant of Sausalito, California. Grissim, working for Rolling Stone, frequently met with the group and took a particular liking to Fleetwood, whom he described as [...] "a real pro." ...|$|E
