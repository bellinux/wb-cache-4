40|$|Trichlorothene (TCE) {{was reduced}} <b>with</b> zero-valence <b>iron</b> and palladized iron in zero-head-space extractors. Progress of the {{reaction}} in these batch studies was monitered with purge-and-trap gas chromatography and a flame ionization detector. When a 5 ppm initial concentration of TCE reacts <b>with</b> zero-valence <b>iron,</b> approximately 140 ppb of vinyl chloride persists {{for as long as}} 73 days. The concentration of vinyl chloride (approximately 10 ppb) remaining <b>with</b> palladized <b>iron</b> is approximately and order of magnitude less than when zero-valence iron is the reductant. These data suggest that volatile byproducts may be under-represented in other published data regarding reduction in zero-valence metals. These results also demonstrate that the reduction of TCE <b>with</b> palladized <b>iron</b> (0. 05 percent palladium) is more than an order of magnitude faster than <b>with</b> zero-valence <b>iron.</b> <b>With</b> a 5 : 1 solution-to-solid ratio, the TCE half-life <b>with</b> zero-valence <b>iron</b> is 7. 41 hours, but is only 0. 59 hours <b>with</b> the palladized <b>iron...</b>|$|R

5|$|Manganese is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Mn and atomic number 25. It is not found {{as a free}} element in nature; it is often found in minerals in combination <b>with</b> <b>iron.</b> Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal alloy uses, particularly in stainless steels.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the lighter}} metalloids, alloys with {{transition}} metals are well-represented. Boron can form intermetallic compounds and alloys with such metals {{of the composition}} MnB, if n > 2. Ferroboron (15% boron) is used to introduce boron into steel; nickel-boron alloys are ingredients in welding alloys and case hardening compositions for the engineering industry. Alloys of silicon <b>with</b> <b>iron</b> and with aluminium are widely used by the steel and automotive industries, respectively. Germanium forms many alloys, most importantly with the coinage metals.|$|E
5|$|For the {{production}} of ferromanganese, the manganese ore is mixed <b>with</b> <b>iron</b> ore and carbon, and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace.
