40|$|AbstractThe low {{collection}} rate of agricultural irrigation <b>water</b> <b>fee</b> {{is a common}} problem facing many developing countries, which has also troubled China since the 2000 s. In different areas of China, there are two problem-solving strategies: raising water {{collection rate}} or exempting <b>water</b> <b>fee.</b> In this paper, we analyze the dilemma of China's agricultural <b>water</b> <b>fee</b> collection from both practical and theoretical perspective. We argue that China will not follow up one single model in agricultural <b>water</b> <b>fee</b> collection and each local government should explore appropriate policy in line with their own situation...|$|R

25|$|According to FAO, <b>water</b> <b>fees</b> {{are too low}} to meet {{maintenance}} and operation requirements for hydraulic infrastructure. For instance, cost recovery for water and sanitation is minimal. Average tariffs are moderate at US$0.21 per cubic meter for water and US$0.07 per cubic meter for sewerage. In addition, collection rates for {{water supply and sanitation}} are extremely low at only 28%. As a result of moderate tariffs and very low collection rates, according to a WHO estimate in 1998, households paid on average only US$0.50 per month for water and US$0.09 per month for sewerage. Not surprisingly, the regional water and sewer companies and INAPA (the national water and sewerage authority) rely largely on transfers from the central budget to fund their operations. The existing schemes lack transparency and efficiency in the use of subsidies.|$|E
25|$|Most rural {{water supply}} schemes in India use a centralised, supply-driven approach, i.e. a {{government}} institution designs a project and has it built with little community consultation and no capacity {{building for the}} community, often requiring no <b>water</b> <b>fees</b> {{to be paid for}} its subsequent operation. Since 2002 the Government of India has rolled out at the national level a program to change the way in which water and sanitation services are supported in rural areas. The program, called Swajaldhara, decentralises service delivery responsibility to rural local governments and user groups. Under the new approach communities are being consulted and trained, and users agree up-front to pay a tariff that is set at a level sufficiently high to cover operation and maintenance costs. It also includes measures to promote sanitation and to improve hygiene behaviour. The national program follows a pilot program launched in 1999.|$|E

Most water utility agencies claimed a right to charge standby <b>water</b> fees/user <b>fees</b> and believed they were reasonable and justified. The purpose of the research was to identify and evaluate the issues {{on both sides of}} the debate and to formulate recommendations. Historical and descriptive research methodology was use to answer these questions: 1.

Because these estimates frequently underestimate the volume of water actually drawn, strong incentive exists for residents to disable or destroy existing water meters, and present a strong disincentive for households to invest in the installation of new meters. In addition, the lack of meters in the system means that SANAA has no way to clearly identify non-revenue water losses within the distribution system, either through leakages or illegal connections.

40|$|Africa has a {{high rate}} of revenue under-collection in public water utility companies. This rate {{currently}} averages 20 - 50 %, and the rate is 18 % for Malawi alone. The purpose of this single-case study was to explore credible business strategies senior managers of water utilities use to address inefficiencies in collecting <b>water</b> <b>fee</b> revenues. The conceptual framework for this study was revenue management, which includes strategic constructs for increasing amounts of revenue collection. The target population for this study was 5 senior managers of a public water utility in Malawi, which is located in the southeastern part of Africa. Data collection included semistructured, face-to-face interviews and a review of company documents. The data analysis process involved the use of thematic analysis, including methodological triangulation, to identify 4 themes: innovative strategies, effective metering and billing, customer relationship management, and disconnection of water supply from customers with overdue bills. These themes highlighted credible business strategies that, for these 5 senior managers, were effective in revenue collection. Addressing inefficiencies in collecting <b>water</b> <b>fee</b> revenues will facilitate positive social change by increasing profits, growing the water business, reducing the crime rate by employing more people, providing potable water to reduce waterborne diseases, and contributing to the sustainable social and economic development of the people of Malawi...|$|R

40|$|This study uses a single-country water {{resources}} CGE model, WATERGEM, {{to investigate the}} double dividend effect of imposing <b>water</b> right <b>fees.</b> WATERGEM is developed based on ORANI model with a SAM data structure.

The substitution among three water resources is also formulated. The green tax reform is getting its popularity in the advanced countries. Due to the environmental concerns, more and more environmental taxes have been levied. The collected environmental tax revenue {{could be used to}} reduce the distorted taxes. This generates two effects, improvement in environmental quality and reduction in distortion, known as double dividends. The <b>water</b> right <b>fee</b> is usually collected under the user pays principle to increase the efficiency of water use. We consider it as an environmentally-based tax. For policy simulation, we assume that the <b>water</b> right <b>fee</b> revenues could be earmarked, or used to deduce household income tax, corporate profit tax. The results of simulation show that the double dividend effect does exist, and the double dividend effect of deduction in corporate profit tax is higher than the others.
