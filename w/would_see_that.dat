5|$|Entering the 1922 midterm congressional {{election}} campaign, Harding and the Republicans {{had followed}} through {{on many of}} their campaign promises. But some of the fulfilled pledges, like cutting taxes for the well-off, did not appeal to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11percent, and organized labor angry over {{the outcome of the}} strikes. From 303 Republicans elected to the House in 1920, the new 68th Congress <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> party fall to a 221–213 majority. In the Senate, the Republicans lost eight seats, and had 51 of 96 senators in the new Congress, which Harding did not survive to meet.|$|E
25|$|In August 1882 Wood {{commanded}} the 4th Brigade on the Egyptian expedition {{to suppress the}} Urabi Revolt. Wolseley kept him on occupation duties in Alexandria, so he missed the Battle of Tel el-Kebir. He returned to Chatham for a while again in November 1882 then returned to be Sirdar (commander) of the Egyptian Army from 21 December 1882 until 1885, during which period he thoroughly reorganised it, with Francis Grenfell and Kitchener working under him. He had 25 British officers (who were given extra pay and Egyptian ranks a grade or two higher than their British ones) and a few NCOs, although to Wood’s annoyance Lt-Gen Stephenson, commander of the British occupation forces, was confirmed as his senior in June 1884. During the cholera epidemic of 1883, British officers earned the respect of Egyptian soldiers by nursing them. Wood gave Sundays off from drill as well as Fridays (the Muslim holy day), so that Egyptian soldiers <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> their British officers took their own religion seriously.|$|E
25|$|Wood {{started the}} 1981 {{season with a}} loss to Abilene Cooper, {{but that would be}} the only loss the Lions <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> season. Brownwood went on to win {{thirteen}} victories to claim another district title and their seventh state championship. The Lions opened up the next season with their first win over Abilene Cooper since 1977. That game was also historical because it was Wood's 366th win, which tied Red Franklin's record set back in 1958. When Brownwood won their next game over Weatherford, Coach Wood became the winningest high school football coach in the United States with 367 wins. Although his team lost to San Angelo Central and another loss to Cleburne (9-3 at TCU's Amon G. Carter Stadium, est attendance of 38,000 fans) cost the Lions their district crown the UIL passed a new rule in 1982, which allowed two teams from each district to advance to the state playoffs. Brownwood took the second place spot, but lost their first game in the playoffs to Gainesville, 14 to 12. Wood's team put away their cleats with nine wins and three losses.|$|E

25|$|God gave David {{rest from}} his enemies, and David asked Nathan the prophet why David should dwell {{in a house}} of cedar, while the Ark dwelt within curtains. At first Nathan told David {{to do what was}} in his heart, but that same night God {{directed}} Nathan to tell David not to build God a house, for God had not dwelt in a house since the day that God had brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, but had abided in a tent and in a tabernacle. God directed Nathan to tell David that God took David from following sheep to be a prince over Israel, God had been with David wherever he went, and God would make David a great name. God would provide a place for the Israelites at rest from their enemies, God would make David into a dynasty, and when David died, God <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> David's son would build a house for God's name. God would be to David's son a father, and he would be to God a son; if he strayed, God would chasten him, but God's mercy would not depart from him. David's kingdom would be established forever. And Nathan told David everything in his vision.|$|E
500|$|Lydia Hand was an {{involved}} and protective mother, {{who had been}} influenced by a Calvinist aunt as a child; and she passed on {{a strong sense of}} duty and guilt to her only son. Learned Hand eventually came to understand the influences of his parents as formative. After his father's death, he looked to religion to help him cope, writing to his cousin Augustus Noble Hand: [...] "If you could imagine one half the comfort my religion has given to me in this terrible loss, you <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Christ never forsakes those who cling to him." [...] The depth of Hand's early religious convictions was in sharp contrast to his later agnosticism.|$|E

Stonebridge works for Section 20 {{and is in}} charge of his team on the ground. Although the character is married to his wife Kerry (Alexandra Moen), he has an affair with colleague Kate Marshall (played by Birthistle). Winchester describes Stonebridge as [...] "dedicated, disciplined, always plays by the rules and often saves the day. Stonebridge directs his energy trying to protecting others," [...] though as the story unfolds, the audience <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Stonebridge [...] "is not the knight in shining armour." ...|$|E

500|$|Several titles were {{considered}} during production, including [...] "Shot Down in Flames" [...] and [...] "IV". The former was rejected because Martin thought {{it sounded like}} a title The Beta Band would use. Taylor supported the name [...] "IV" [...] because he liked [...] "giving people the wrong impression all the time", and defended his opinion, saying [...] "if [...] give us any time, they <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> we're very serious about comedy ... and serious things as well". The album was called [...] "Made in the Dark" [...] because it was a title the band agreed on. Taylor considered the eponymous track to be one of his favourite songs, and thought it was nice to name the album after a thoughtful song, in contrast to Coming on Strong and The Warning, which he described as being [...] "big, slightly jokey, macho phrases".|$|E
500|$|All {{band members}} of Bloc Party {{conceived}} A Weekend in the City during 2005 while on tour {{in support of}} their critically acclaimed debut album Silent Alarm. Despite missing their home city of London, the quartet became increasingly disillusioned with the culture in the area each time they sporadically returned. Band member Gordon Moakes has noted, [...] "The contrast we saw between being away on tour and being home... we <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> London wasn't changing really and that the people we'd grown up with were part of that." [...] Okereke wrote many songs in 2005 and early 2006 and used a concept he called [...] "Urbanite Relaxation" [...] to expand upon the themes of life and leisure in the metropolis. The band recorded around 30soundchecks for the initial lyrics using a MiniDisc player. The rest of the tracks were written in April 2006 before they entered the studio recording process.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and starred Tom Kenny and Jill Talley. The original idea for the music video was for a Busby Berkeley-style video, complete with [...] "people diving into champagne glasses". The band was set to begin production on the video when they discovered that the Red Hot Chili Peppers had done a similarly styled video for their song [...] "Aeroplane", which was almost identical to what they had wanted to do. The second idea for the video was that as the band played on a surreal stage, the camera would go into audience members' eyes and the viewer <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> person's vision of the song. The third and final concept, inspired by Georges Méliès's silent film A Trip to the Moon, came from directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, who {{got the idea for}} the video because the album cover for Mellon Collie reminded them of early silent films. Hence, the video was filmed in the style of a turn-of-the-century silent film using theater-style backdrops and primitive special effects. Most of the video's backdrops and puppetwork were created by artist Wayne White.|$|E

[...] Loos convinced herself that he <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was different from all his other girls, and that behind his outwardly dull exterior was a great mind.

2500|$|On June 9, 1953, Hunt's 24-year-old son Lester Jr., {{known as}} [...] "Buddy", {{who was a}} student and {{president}} of the student body at the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was arrested in Washington, D.C., for soliciting prostitution from a male undercover police officer in Lafayette Square, just north of and adjacent to the White House property. It was his first offense, which police normally handled quietly as a matter for the offender's family to address, but the arrest became known to Senate Republicans. [...] According to Drew Pearson's Washington Merry-Go-Round column published after Hunt's death, Senators Styles Bridges and Herman Welker threatened that if Hunt did not immediately retire from the Senate and agree not to seek his seat in the 1954 election, they <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> his son was prosecuted and would widely publicize his son's arrest.|$|E
2500|$|Dennett makes a {{distinction}} between the presence of representation, and the representation of presence. The example he gives regarding this distinction is this: if you were to walk into a room covered in identical portraits of Marilyn Monroe, you <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> there are many of them, but you would not really be seeing them all at once. There would be no detailed representation of each individual portrait just the knowledge that they are present. Dennet's theory raises two relevant questions: 1) How does the visual system detect change in the environment? 2) How much information is retained in each saccade? The proposed answer to these questions lies in several mechanisms that support a high sensitivity to change in each visual fixation. These mechanisms are: retinal adaptation, [...] "pop-out" [...] systems, and motion detectors. The implication of this view is that little information is needed to be retained between each saccade.|$|E

After gaining the signed pledges of workers, the military [...] "officer-organizers" [...] <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> civilian members were gathered into [...] "locals" [...] — groups which elected grievance committees which were nominally responsible for the mediation of problems in the woods or the mill with owners and bosses. In the view of at least one historian this function seems to have been only of minimal effectiveness in practice, however, since [...] "in the early months, the only real function of the local was to meet production quotas, perhaps manage a suggestion box, and be a display counter of pledged patriots." [...] Indeed, {{at the time of its}} inception Disque did not envision the LLLL as a union of any kind, but rather a loose patriotic society.|$|E
2500|$|Khamenei is an {{advocate}} of Islamic practice of Hijab. He believes that hijab is aimed at honoring women. To the Western objection to the compulsory hijab in Iran, he responds by pointing out the compulsory unveiling in certain western countries and obstacles created for veiled Muslim {{women who want to}} enter universities. He further argues that women in the West have lost their honor by pointing out perceived high rate of sexual violence in the West as well as the widespread exploitation of female sexual appeal for commercial purposes: [...] "In effect, they have been treating women like a commodity, like another of their products. If you were to look at the magazines, which are published in the West, you <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they advertise a commodity for sale next to the naked picture of a woman.

Griffin responded, [...] "Our organization has already touched on that matter and converted a few to remembering that they are women first and a butch for fem secondly, so their attire should be that which society will accept. Contrary to belief, we have shown them that there is a place for them in society, but only if they wish to make it so." ...|$|E
