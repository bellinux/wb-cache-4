A {{generalization}} of Sperner's Lemma is proved and, using extensions of p-adit valuations {{to the real}} numbers, it is shown that the unit hypercube in n dimensions can <b>be</b> divided <b>into</b> <b>m</b> Simplexes all of equal hypervolume {{if and only if}} <b>m</b> <b>is</b> a multiple of n!. This extends the corresponding result for n = 2 of Paul Monsky. The question as to whether a square can be divided into an odd number of (nonoverlapping) triangles all of the same area was answered in the negative by Thomas [3] (if all the vertices of the triangles are rational numbers), and in general by Monsky [2]. In this note we generalize Monsky's result to n dimensions and prove the following: Theorem. Let C be the unit hypercube in n dimensions. Then C can <b>be</b> divided <b>into</b> <b>m</b> Simplexes all of equal hypervolume if and only if <b>m</b> <b>is</b> a multiple ofnṪhe proof is divided into two parts.
