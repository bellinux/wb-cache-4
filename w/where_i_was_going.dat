500|$|When {{accessing}} the very deep emotions {{called for by}} her character, Mulligan stated, [...] "I really took my cue from the book". She noted that her role did not require her to have much to say, because Kathy {{was more of an}} observer throughout most of the film. She recalled that [...] "every time I was in a scene where I wasn’t quite sure <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> with it, I would go to the book and read through the lines because she's unreliable, in that much of the time she's not being truly honest with herself or the audience." [...] The young actress said that her friendship with Knightley made their scenes together easier because they would both regard each other's comments helpful and would not feel [...] "insulted or hurt" [...] in discussion.|$|E
500|$|In 1871, {{before leaving}} Hawaii, Archdeacon Mason {{informed}} Iaukea that had Kamehameha IV still been living, {{he would have}} intended for him to continue his education in Europe, and eventually to groom him to become an ordained chaplain for the royal family. Iaukea was deeply touched by the high expectations of his deceased benefactor. After finishing his education, he served King Kamehameha V as a kāhili bearer and steward at the palace, awaiting an assignment from the king. In 1872, the king sent Iaukea and William K. Hutchison, the son of Ferdinand William Hutchison, to Lahaina where they learned the art of sugar boiling in the growing sugar industry on Maui, and helped manage the West Maui Sugar Plantation, in which the king had a share. They were placed {{under the care of}} Governor Paul Nahaolelua. After the king's death in 1872, Iaukea briefly left his service to the royal court and moved to Hilo to live with his sister Maraea and her husband Charles Akono Nui Akau, a Chinese-Hawaiian manager of the Paukaʻa Sugar Plantation. The listless Iaukea enjoyed his new-found independence, but he also felt unfulfilled. He later wrote: [...] "I was dangling at a loose end. And even though I was enjoying my independence, I was aware that I did not know just <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> or what I ought to do. I was frustrated without realizing it." ...|$|E

I wrote the letters and stuff and I kind of just started writing there on my down time. At lunch when I {{had nothing to do}} I would write about stuff. I didn’t think it would become anything. It was just stupid fun and then, it was about {{six months to a year}} later when I realized there were people reading it and that's when I had to decide <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to go with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Outhwaite has {{suggested}} that the wardrobe department struggled {{to come up with a}} static identity for Melanie at first; however, this she felt turned out to be a good thing: [...] "What I really liked about it was, when we started looking for costumes , the wardrobe department couldn't quite fit <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going.</b> I'd wear Army pants and trainers some days and then jeans some other days and then I'd be all suited and booted at other times. I said, 'That's what girls do! That's how I am. Some days I'm in scruffs and some days I'm really dressed up. It would be really nice to have a character who's not so predictable.'" [...] Rosalind Powell, head of the EastEnders wardrobe design team in 2000, said that Mel had [...] "colourful and stylish" [...] wardrobe from retailers such as Kookai and Oasis. Powell added, [...] "Although she's a barmaid, she can still afford to wear nice clothes, she just doesn't have a very big wardrobe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams told MTV {{that she}} couldn't [...] "wait {{for the world}} to hear [...] new solo album", {{describing}} it as [...] "fresher", [...] "more inspirational", and [...] "more on the secular side". Furthermore, she stated [...] "whether it's gospel or not, I wrote about it", therefore expecting [...] "some of her gospel fans to be a little upset" [...] but wanted to [...] "keep it real". She also discussed one of the album's [...] "primary themes" [...] – [...] "what it's like to be in love" [...] – explaining [...] " [...] mistakes you make when you're in love and how they affect your life" [...] after saying [...] "I was able to experience some things this year and I wrote about them." [...] In describing the album during another interview, this time for GospelCity, Williams said [...] "these songs are just about the real me" [...] and that she [...] "just wrote from [...] heart" [...] before acknowledging that [...] "it didn't turn out to be as 'gospel-ly' as some would have liked", but [...] "the stuff" [...] that's on the album [...] "is stuff [...] went through". Williams then said [...] "this whole album is about God's love and me". After being asked [...] "Michelle, as people listen to the album, Do You Know, as they get acquainted with the songs, what are you hoping to bring to their lives?", Williams responded [...] "That everybody live in peace and not settle for anything less than what the Lord wants to bring your way. I know what I went through, I know God is taking me to another level. I had people around me that were not going <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> – I had to release them from my life." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The only {{trouble is}} that I chose to go away this morning without telling him <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going.</b> Then I owned {{one-half}} of the wood-lot, with all there is or may be on it, and since {{it was the last}} time I should have the right to do anything regarding it without his knowledge, I refused to tell him <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going.</b> But now that he owns an equal share with you, Mr. Simpson and me, he will have a perfect right to question me." ...|$|E

60|$|I went to {{the stable}} and {{harnessed}} the horse to the little carriage. Jonas was not there, and I {{had fallen out of}} the habit of calling him.

60|$|Before I {{got to the}} shop, I met Mr. Batterbury {{taking his}} walking exercise. He stopped, shook hands with me affectionately, and asked <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going.</b> A {{wonderful}} idea struck me. Instead of answering his question, I asked after Lady Malkinshaw.|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed to}} me that even then the Duke would not, or could not, understand. His brows were knitted into a heavy frown, and he was evidently {{following}} my story with close attention. But exactly <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to lead, he seemed to have no idea.|$|E
