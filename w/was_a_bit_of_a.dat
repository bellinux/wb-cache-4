25|$|In 1900 {{the idea}} of {{different}} races playing {{together in the same}} match <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> novelty. Only in the West Indies and India were there significant numbers of coloured cricketers playing. Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji, an Indian prince (universally known as Ranji), had been playing in English cricket for a few years but otherwise coloured cricketers were rarely seen.|$|E

Shortly thereafter however, NBC would gain the broadcast television rights to the National Basketball Association (NBA) from CBS, thus there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> notion that NBC no longer really needed hockey.|$|E

Coached by player/coach Cliff Hagan the Dallas Chaparrals were one of 11 teams to take {{the floor in the}} inaugural season of the upstart ABA. The Chaps second season <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disappointment, as the team finished in 4th place with a mediocre 41–37 record.

As a station ship she was assigned to monitor 1) Internal Japanese Fleet frequencies 2) Frequencies measurements and DF or direction finder azimuths. She had three intercept operators and one chief radioman supervised by an officer. This all started in 1933 during {{the reconstruction of the}} Japanese fleet by Tokyo. The Gold Star along with ground stations in Guam, Olongapo and Beijing provided significant intelligence before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.|$|E
25|$|A failed two-year {{relationship}} with Australian model Helena Vestergaard, {{who was only}} 19 when they began dating in 2012 (he was 50), served as {{a major influence on}} his songwriting for the band's 2016 album, The Getaway which often has Kiedis questioning their relationship and the age difference between the two. “Lyrically, I’m embarrassed to say, but a two-year relationship that completely fell apart like a nuclear bomb just left me feeling pretty raw and available to the emotional universe for writing. So even though the relationship <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disaster, I feel that in some way I did get something out of it, which was about half the songs on this record,” Kiedis said.|$|E

Additionally, the Hadid Pavilion may be {{situated}} in {{a different part of the}} park for part of 2010. [...] The choices of Hadid and van Berkel were somewhat controversial because Burnham was a classicist and they are both avant-garde modernists. [...] Additionally, local architects complained that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> slight that two European architects were chosen to produce works to serve as the focal points of the Burnham Plan Centennial celebration. [...] The pavilions were scheduled to be a focal point of the centennial celebration of the 1909 Plan of Chicago, which is a yearlong celebration. [...] However, Hadid's Pavilion encountered manufacturer's difficulty in executing Hadid's complex, computer-aided design.|$|E
500|$|On {{the early}} experience, Richards said, [...] "The amazing {{thing is that}} {{although}} Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something {{we were going to}} do in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at least we gave it a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Martyn Williams {{remained}} {{in the dressing room}} for 90 minutes after the game, and when he emerged opted not to speak to the media. He later did give his reaction, expressing his opinion that the format <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lottery and observed [...] "somebody was going to miss – I've just got to live with {{the fact that it was}} me." [...] He also credited several of the victorious Leicester players who had commiserated with him after the game and others who had sent messages of support to him. Jordan Crane said after the match that he had felt calm prior to taking his kick, as Williams' miss meant that in the event Crane also missed, the scores would remain level and sudden death would continue. Tom James who had missed a kick earlier in the shoot-out which would have won the match for Cardiff said that [...] "gutted is the only word that properly describes how I am feeling".|$|E

500|$|Shane Hegarty of The Irish Times {{wrote that}} it [...] "may {{not have been}} a vintage episode [...] but it had plenty of good moments, and from an Irish {{perspective}} it was a fascinating opportunity to see ourselves {{through the eyes of the}} greatest comedy series ever written." [...] He added that [...] "even as it reveled in stereotypes, it used them to continue the running joke about how Ireland doesn't conform to American's [...] views of it." [...] Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald gave the episode two stars. He wrote that he enjoyed the jokes about the Irish landmarks but called it [...] "a fairly slapdash, ramshackle half-hour" [...] and mentioned that Colm Meaney deserved a better role. Evan Fanning of the Sunday Independent wrote [...] "Yes, The Simpsons came to Ireland and all we got was some lousy rehashed jokes and a feeling that the whole thing <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> waste of time." ...|$|E
500|$|Scientology {{spokeswoman}} Pat Harney called Lonsdale's apparent suicide [...] "awful" [...] {{and stated}} [...] "It's just unfortunate anybody feels {{they have to}} go to that length ... I wouldn't wish that on anybody." [...] Jerald Rowlett, a fellow Scientology critic and friend from Michigan, told The Tampa Tribune: [...] "In many ways Shawn was a hero to me ... He had a hard life and a history he knew Scientology would use to hurt him. And yet he still felt strongly enough to try to inform the public about the actions of Scientology." [...] On March 1, 2008, John Sweeney remembered Lonsdale and spoke about him on the BBC Radio 4 program, From Our Own Correspondent. Sweeney stated: [...] "Clearwater got that little bit more creepy recently, with the death - the police are treating it as suicide - of Shawn. When alive a Scientology spokesman said of him: 'He has no redeeming value to anyone, anywhere.' Well, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hero to me ... I for one mourn the loss - of a brave and singular American".|$|E
500|$|... "You and I", {{written by}} Lady Gaga and {{produced}} by Gaga and Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, {{was one of}} the first songs previewed from the album. Gaga said she wrote the song in New York, while she was busy playing her old piano. The singer first played [...] "You and I" [...] at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball in June 2010. She said that the song <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "rock-and-roll tune" [...] and, as such, was unlikely to be released as a single from Born This Way. She said [...] that it [...] " [...] is very dear" [...] to her heart. Footage of the performance appeared on the Internet soon after, and positive response encouraged Lady Gaga to perform the song during the first concert of the North American leg of The Monster Ball Tour in Montreal. Gaga told MSNBC's Meredith Vieira and Ann Curry that [...] "'You and I' was written about the most important person that I ever met", allegedly Lüc Carl, her ex-boyfriend.|$|E

500|$|Connor Trinneer (who played Commander Trip Tucker), {{felt that}} the finale {{should have had a}} memorable {{farewell}} that he described as a [...] "M*A*S*H moment", but that the producers did not want to focus on such an element. Anthony Montgomery (who played Ensign Travis Mayweather) was similarly displeased with the finale and said [...] "I feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as the franchise as a whole. It just seemed to take a little bit away from what the Enterprise cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years." [...] While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that [...] "the reality is it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stretch to have us shut down [...] show," [...] and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them. The early criticism forced the show's producers to hold a conference and address the issue. Braga admitted there was cast unrest, but defended the episode as a way to close not just Enterprise but Star Trek as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Gaga next {{performed}} [...] "Gypsy" [...] at her ArtRave {{concert in}} November 2013 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where she sang {{along with a}} live band. During the performance, Gaga gave a shout-out to artist Jeff Koons, who was heavily involved in the visuals related to the Artpop era and its campaigns, and dedicated the song to him. She again performed [...] "Gypsy" [...] on a piano on a Saturday Night Live show later that month, wearing a rainbow colored leotard with giant shoulder pads. Around the one minute mark, when the tempo of the song changes from a ballad to its original anthemic composition, a band stepped onstage from the shadows behind as well as dancers, who danced and created a party atmosphere. Hillary Hughes of The Village Voice found similarities in Gaga's vocals to those of singer Lana Del Rey. She felt that [...] "Gaga plowed into 'Gypsy' with the aplomb of a Vegas lounge goddess from the future... Girl hit her notes, and well, and I'd take 'Gypsy' over 'Applause' or 'Born This Way' {{any day of the}} week, but 'Gypsy' on SNL <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> confusing display from beginning to end." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, six main {{characters}} were axed from EastEnders by executive producer Bryan Kirkwood. Fatboy {{was not one}} of them, but Stuart Heritage from The Guardian felt that he should have been, calling him [...] "A wodge of irritating comic relief [...] who is yet to serve a purpose other than making me genuinely dislike young people. [...] He must go, preferably in a scene where he falls down the world's largest flight of stairs." [...] Heritage later called Fatboy an [...] "obnoxiously two-dimensional dubstep-fixated stock [...] transparently modelled on Jar Jar Binks." [...] A writer for the website Watch With Mothers called the character an asset to EastEnders, expressing pleasure that the show was trying to appeal to younger viewers, while another called him irritating and zany. A writer for The Northern Echo wondered if Fatboy, along with Leon and ZsaZsa, brought a new injection of life into the soap or took away screen time from more established characters, and Caroline Fitton, writing for the Daily Mail, felt that Fatboy's style of talking <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cliché. Grace Dent from The Guardian changed her opinion of Fatboy over time, saying: ...|$|E

500|$|The [...] John Vinci {{designed}} {{building is}} a two-story structure that cost $9 million for the land, building, landscaping, and interior design. The exterior facade is buff brick with black granite windowsills and thresholds and white-painted steel windows. The building features furniture {{dating back to the}} club's founding as well as Mies van der Rohe designs. [...] Several elements of the new building's design are considered homages to Mies. The fact that the building was so Miesian thirty years after his death while the club focused on avant-gard art <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> controversy. The building's atrium that allows filtered light into the central galleries and dining areas is its primary feature. [...] Another focal point of the building is the restored Mies van der Rohe steel staircase that provides access to the second floor. The design includes white-painted steel, travertine marble, floor-to-ceiling curtains, dark-stained wood floors, and large areas of glass. The color palette of saffron, black, gray, scarlet, and white is consistent with the former building. Also notable are the veil of north side metal screens. The building also has a [...] outdoor landscaped garden. The building accommodates a 200-person audience seating.|$|E
500|$|In a 1984 review, Billboard {{states the}} album is [...] "funnier and more {{versatile}} than most of their metal brethren", calling the production [...] "typically strong". A retrospective review by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine was extremely positive. He noted that the album caused [...] "a hoopla that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> red herring since the band had been layering in synths since their third album, Women and Children First". He further stated that [...] "Jump"'s [...] "synths played a circular riff that wouldn't have sounded as overpowering on guitar", but that [...] "the band didn't dispense with their signature monolithic, pulsating rock." [...] He also stated that [...] "where [...] albums placed {{an emphasis on the}} band's attack, this places an emphasis on the songs, and they're uniformly terrific, the best set of original tunes Van Halen ever had." [...] He concluded that [...] "it's the best showcase of Van Halen's instrumental prowess as a band, the best showcase for Diamond Dave's glorious shtick, the best showcase for their songwriting, just their flat-out best album overall. [...] here's no way Van Halen could have bettered this album with Dave around (and they didn't better it once Sammy [...] joined, either)." ...|$|E
500|$|Evra {{initially}} {{had some}} problems adapting to the English game. He made his debut for the club on 14 January in a 3–1 away defeat to Manchester City in the Premier League. He was substituted out at half-time after failing to make an impact. After {{the conclusion of the}} match, Ferguson stated, [...] "Maybe it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gamble playing Evra," [...] while the player himself admitted that [...] "playing for Manchester United was something I was not prepared for". Despite the initial set-back, Evra started in the team's ensuing match against Liverpool, a 1–0 victory, and was praised for his performance by teammate Rio Ferdinand. On 26 February, Evra appeared as a substitute in United's 4–0 win over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 League Cup final. On 2 March, it was reported that Liverpool defender Steve Finnan had racially abused Evra in the match. The abuse claims surfaced from two deaf television viewers lodging a police complaint. The viewers claimed to have lip-read Finnan abusing Evra during the televised match. Finnan denied the charge and, after an investigation, The Football Association (FA) decided against charging the player. Evra regularly alternated between the bench and the starting 11 to close out the campaign. He finished the season with 14 total appearances for his new club.|$|E
