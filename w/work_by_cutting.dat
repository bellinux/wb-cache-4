5|$|Topoisomerases are enzymes {{with both}} {{nuclease}} and ligase activity. These proteins change {{the amount of}} supercoiling in DNA. Some of these enzymes <b>work</b> <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break. Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix. Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.|$|E

50|$|The {{piece is}} based on the {{interaction}} of wallpaper glued to the support and charcoal lines, which evoke both objects and words. The subject matter is a glass bowl, pears, and grapes, between what looks like a dish and a wine glass, or perhaps a candlestick. Braque probably began the <b>work</b> <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> out pieces of wallpaper and moving them around a flat surface to imagine his composition. He then might have positioned two strips of the wood grain wallpaper vertically on a large sheet of white paper to signify the walls of a café. He also put a small horizontal piece of wallpaper {{at the bottom of the}} paper to represent a table top. Then, he drew the glass, pears, grapes and the words ‘ALE’ and ‘BAR’ in charcoal and added black lines in ink to the wallpaper, and a circular knob to the horizon piece of wallpaper at the bottom to make it look like the drawer of a table. The work has a variety of textures that add confusion to spatial relations of the objects in the composition. For example, in addition to the oak wallpaper, Braque used a comb to add an additional element of trompe-l'oeil to give the piece even more perceptual distortion. Braque also adds texture, applying a mix of sand and gessoto the background. This texture brings the background forward, making it more difficult to interpret the perspective. Braque’s process was deliberately mystifying. His technique is full of subtleties that one doesn't notice at first. Both the physical and logical relationships of the objects are often difficult to construct. The painting is a visual puzzle which challenges the viewer to understand what is shown from clues and fragments.|$|E
50|$|Self-tapping screws {{are widely}} used for driving into sheet metal or {{plastics}} and forming their own thread. They may be either self-drilling, forming their own hole through unbroken material, or fitted into a pre-pierced hole. Self-drilling screws have some ability to cut a thread, as for a tap. Others <b>work</b> not <b>by</b> <b>cutting,</b> but rather <b>by</b> roll-forming the thread, pushing excess material {{out of the way}} by plastic deformation. This is one reason why ductile host materials, rather than brittle, are needed.|$|R
2500|$|Meanwhile, when Breitwieser's {{mother had}} heard of her son's arrest from Kleinklauss, who {{had been able to}} evade authorities, she {{proceeded}} to destroy many of the <b>works</b> <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> or carving them up, leaving the remains of the frames in the trash {{over a period of several}} weeks and forcing the shredded paintings down her garbage disposal unit. Other artifacts, such as vases, jewelry, pottery, and statuettes, were simply thrown into the nearby Rhone-Rhine Canal, where some were later recovered through dredging. She claimed that she destroyed the paintings out of anger at her son, but police believe it was to destroy incriminating evidence against him. [...] She apparently had no inkling of the large monetary value of the works she destroyed. [...] Police found nothing besides the cord of the stolen antique bugle when they first searched her home, and she took seven months to admit to destroying the artwork, after some pieces had washed up on the shore of the Rhine.

Thomas Ward Ltd supplied replacement track in 1955, {{and a new}} 0-4-0 diesel electric shunter was ordered from Ruston and Hornsby Ltd in 1959. It was delivered from Lincoln on a low-loader in 1960, and was so successful that a second engine of the same type was ordered the following year. The Hudswell Clarke steam engine was cut up on site in 1962, but the Corporation wrote to Peckett's {{to see if they}} would convert the Peckett engine to diesel hydraulic transmission. Peckett's declined, and so the engine was converted at the <b>works,</b> <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> off the boiler and saddle tank, and fitting a Perkins diesel engine removed from a crane. It was completed on 12 May 1962, and worked well, although it spent most of its subsequent life working at Thrybergh tip. It returned to Blackburn Meadows in 1967, and was cut up later that year. A prototype steel side-tipping wagon was ordered from Robert Hudson Ltd of Leeds in 1955, and a further 22 followed in 1957, to replace the original wooden wagons. Charles Roberts and Co Ltd of Wakefield supplied 12 more in 1958, and a further 35 in 1961, with Hudsons supplying the final 6 in 1963.|$|R
5000|$|The world-famous {{hair salon}} franchise, Neo-Image has opened and its top three hairstylists - Ya Si (Ming Dao), Er Qi (Sam Wang Shao Wei), and Fei Nan Du's (Jacky Zhu Fan Gang) {{handsome}} hairstyles attracted huge crowds. At this time, a foreign affairs government official rushed over {{and asked them}} for help. It turns out that a shampoo company is conducting an event called the [...] "Asian Hairstyle Competition" [...] and they have hired a part-time female hairstylist to compete against the top-notch French hairstylist. Their objective is to help advertise the French Hair products. Since this event will seriously belittle the country's image, Ya Si and the guys decided to help out. Ya Si and the guys replaced the part-time female hairstylist to help gain some glory for their country. When the dazzling model {{came out with the}} beautiful hairstyle, Ya Si and the guys received cheers fit for a hero. The female hairstylist that they chased off the stage is none other than Nuo Ruo Yi (Xiao Bei), a worker from [...] "Zhong Nan Barbershop," [...] Neo-Image's neighbor over the next alley. Even though Ya Si has chased Xiao Bei off the stage, but seeing her snip her first cut, he decided that she has quite the talent and secretly plots to win her over. Neo-Image's grand opening is a serious blow to the family-run style [...] "Zhong Nan Barbershop." [...] Zhong Nan's owner is called Lao Bei (Zhao Shun) and he opened up this barbershop after retiring from the army. Now that there is a brand new and fashionable hair salon {{at the front of the}} alley, it is only natural that their customers are decreasing day by day. Even more importantly is that his daughter, Xiao Bei's heart, has already been deeply captivated by Neo-Image's glory. Chou Mei (Qiu Shu Fang) followed Ya Si through 18 towns and finally got the chance to have him change her hairstyle. On Neo-Image's opening night, Chou Mei went into the store's [...] "Magic Room" [...] and didn't come back out. Through the darkness of the window, Xiao Bei saw Fei Nan Du wielding his knife and blood splashing out; Neo-Image's back door, Xiao Bei saw Er Qi handing over a large canvas bag to two guys. Xiao Bei believes that Chou Mei must have met with an accident and hence, decided to report it to the police. Ya Si and the guys were brought to the police station and Xiao Bei called for a press conference at Zhong Nan to account for the [...] "murder" [...] that she witnessed. Not long after that, Chou Mei returns home and put an end to this whole ridiculous matter. Unfortunately, when the truth comes out, it was already too late to stop the submission of the newspaper article. [...] The next day, [...] "Suspicious Murder Case" [...] made the headline news and Fei Nan Du urgently called for a press conference in front of the store. In the middle of his explanation, the Chief of Defense Force arrived at Zhong Nan Barbershop. The reporters went crazy and starts asking about the army's military exercise practices. Ya Si and Xiao Bei bets on the headline news for the next day. Unfortunately, Ya Si lost to Xiao Bei and as a result, not only does he have to take wedding photos with Chou Mei but he also has to sleep overnight at the [...] "haunted room" [...] on Zhong Nan's top floor.

40|$|The authors {{review the}} stylized facts on {{regulatory}} reform in telecommunications {{and its effects}} on telecommunications development and Internet penetration in Latin America. Relying on data from the International Telecommunication Union, the Information for Development Program (InfoDev), and the World Bank for 1990 - 99, the authors then test econometrically the determinants of the differences in Internet penetration rates across Latin America. The results show that effective implementation of the reform agenda in telecommunications regulation could accelerate adoption of the Internet in Latin America-even though it {{is only part of the}} solution (income levels, income distribution, and access to primary infrastructure are the main determinants of growth in Internet connections and use). Regulation will <b>work</b> <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> costs. Cost cutting will require that regulators in the region take a much closer look at the design of interconnection rules and at the tradeoffs that emerge from the complex issues involved. It will also require a commitment to developing analytical instruments, such as cost models, to sort out many of the problems. Appropriate cost models will generate benchmarks that are much more consistent with the local issues and with the local cost of capital than international benchmarks will ever be for countries in unstable macroeconomic situations. Cost cutting will require an equally strong commitment to imposing regulatory accounting systems that reduce the information asymmetrics that incumbents use to reduce the risks of entry. All these changes will ultimately require a stronger commitment by competition agencies, since in many countries a failure to negotiate interconnection agreements will raise competition issues just as often as it will raise regulatory questions.

40|$|Peripheral milling {{is a very}} {{important}} procedure in terms of <b>work</b> piece shaping <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> in wood industry. Because of the kinematic principle of this procedure a more or less wavy structure on the cutting area of the work piece appears, the so called cutter marks. That is why in many cases after cutting, expensive extra finishing procedures like sanding must be applied to smoothen the work piece surface. An approach to improve this situation is given by an actuator controlled motion of the tool spindle position to realize a linear cutting motion during the edge approach to the work piece. A control strategy was created and first experiments with a test setup using magnetic bearings have been done successfully...|$|R
40|$|Many {{proposed}} and implemented packet classification algorithms trade off JT 1 emory against lookup-time. Matching algorithms implemented in software cannot {{keep up with}} ever-increasing data rates. On the other hand, devices implemented in hardware such as Content Addressable Memory (CAM) have deterministic high lookup rates, but they are expensive in terms of silicon cost and power dissipation. Therefore, a trade-off between hardware and software solutions Le. algorithmic-architectural solutions {{take advantage of the}} emerging technologies to provide the required high speed classification without sacrificing the deterministic performance of CAMs. I~ chapter 3 an algorithmic-architectural solution is provided that exploits the geometrical distribution of rules, Hypercuts packet classification algorithm, and CAMs. It <b>works</b> <b>by</b> multi-level <b>cutting</b> ofthe classification space into sub-spaces. It prOVides the deterministic performance of CAMs, support for dynamic updates, and fleXibility for the system designer to trade off the components of the architecture. In chapter 4 Adaptive Rules Cutting (ARC), a heuristic algorithm for packet classification, is proposed. This heuristic algorithm <b>works</b> <b>by</b> selecting the bit positions that divide the classification space into sub-spaces at l-Ievel in a way that reduces the redundancy of rules in cuts and maximizes the equal distribution of rules in cuts. An architecture for packet classification <b>by</b> l-Ievel <b>cutting</b> of the classification space is presented. In chapter 5, architecture for hardware acceleration of session-based IP packet classification is provided and implemented in FPGA. The architecture <b>works</b> <b>by</b> dividing the classification space into sub-spaces at l-Ievel using CRC 16. Overall, the thesis provides three new solutions for packet classification based on cutting the classification space into smaller spaces.
