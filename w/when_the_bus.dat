5|$|September 30, 2002: Arturo Martinez Tapia {{assaulted}} a Greyhound driver near Fresno, California, {{resulting in}} two passenger deaths after the bus then rolled off an embankment and crashed.

5|$|In 1967, {{the first}} segment of I-69 opened in Michigan, {{bypassing}} Marshall to the east. The state shifted US27 out of downtown Marshall {{to follow the}} new freeway. From the temporary end of I-69 at I-94, US27 followed I-94 back to its existing routing north of Marshall. The former route of US27 through downtown Marshall was then redesignated Bus. US27, using BL I-94 to connect to the new freeway carrying US27 west of downtown. This arrangement lasted until 1972 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bus.</b> US27 designation was decommissioned and the section of highway between BL I-94 and I-94 turned over to local control.|$|E

5|$|In December 2009, it was {{announced}} that following the success of Bustracker, an application had been developed for the iPhone that is similar to the way Bustracker works. It allows people to download an application to their iPhone that enables them to see where their nearest bus stop is and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> is due. Although not developed by Lothian Buses or The City of Edinburgh Council, the application has now won the backing of both companies. My Bus Edinburgh is an application developed for the Android platform which is similar in functionality to the iPhone application. Like the iPhone application, this application is developed by an independent developer, backed by Lothian Buses and The City of Edinburgh Council, and is available free of charge.|$|E

The limited stops eliminated in 2011 were restored for Q114 service, with two additional limited stops added.

25|$|Cash fares are distance-related. The {{scale was}} {{originally}} intended to be broadly comparable with buses, but this proved to be unfinanceable. In January 2013 the adult single fare from Birmingham to Wolverhampton was £2 by bus and £3.60 by tram, although the tram journey is much quicker even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> routes are congestion-free. By 2016 the tram fare had risen to £4. In November 2013 Birmingham City Council indicated plans to introduce a smart-card system (similar to Transport for London's Oyster Card) to improve access, alongside a range of measures including a new Tube-style map and electric bus networks. This has now launched and is called the Swift card.|$|E

The District Armed Reserve (DAR) personnel of Bellary, who accompanied him, claimed that he was handcuffed at the time, but Reddy denied this {{when he was arrested}} two months later. He stated that he bought rum and chicken for the policemen, and earned their trust. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> stopped at a dhaba near Hiriyur bypass, he requested the policemen to remove his handcuffs on the pretext that he needed to answer the call of nature.

The same day, he sent a number of letters to people and associations, inviting them to found a private company to build and operate the tramway.

500|$|M-36 supplanted {{the former}} M-49 {{designation}} between Mason and Whitmore Lake in late 1930; segments of M-49 through Stockbridge {{not used in}} the new M-36 [...] were given to M-92 or M-106. The last segments were paved in late 1940 between Plainfield and the eastern terminus. When the Michigan State Highway Department completed a US127 bypass around Mason in late 1946 or early 1947, M-36 was extended westward over a section of highway previously used by US127 to connect to the bypass; that segment was designated Bus. US127/M-36 This concurrency was removed in 1962 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bus.</b> US127 designation was decommissioned. The M-52 concurrency was formed in 1969 when M-52 was extended northerly to Webberville.|$|E
