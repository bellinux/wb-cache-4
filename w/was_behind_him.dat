5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E
25|$|He was old, {{his life}} <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> and, save herself, {{he had no}} ties. What did it matter to him how his {{struggle}} should end? But she was young, she was beautiful, she might form new friendships, the world was before her, the world might yet be at her feet, and life, so sweet and so sad, and yet so good a thing withal, was ready and waiting for her.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though his}} career with the Scottish team <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> Maclagan was {{approached}} by the Rugby Football Union to captain a British Team to South Africa. Although called an English team at the time, mainly because the tour was organised by the English Union, the team contained four Scottish players in which is now recognised as the first official British Lions tour. He played in 19 of the 20 matches, including all three tests. In the final test of the series against South Africa at Cape Town he scored one of two tries, the other coming from Randolph Aston.|$|E

25|$|At the 2016 Welsh Indoor Championships he was runner-up to David King {{while at}} the British Indoor Championships he came third after Andrew Pozzi and Lawrence Clarke. He topped the podium at the British Universities Championships indoor and outdoors, however. He was beaten into second place by King at the British U23 Championships and <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> in fourth at the British Athletics Championships. A sudden {{improvement}} to 13.25 seconds came in Loughborough. This moved him to fifth on the all-time British rankings for the 110m hurdles, but was {{a week after the}} deadline for Olympic qualifying times. He was fifth at the London Grand Prix that year and won the English Athletics Championships. He demonstrated his run in Loughborough was not a one-off with a win at the ISTAF Berlin, recording a new best of 13.24 seconds and beating world medallist Pascal Martinot-Lagarde.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the high}} points of Lynch's first term as Taoiseach, and {{possibly}} {{one of the most}} important events in modern Irish history, was Ireland's entry into the European Economic Community. Lynch personally steered the application for membership and the acceptance of membership by a five to one majority in a referendum shows that the vast majority of the country <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> Ireland officially joined, along with its nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom and Denmark, on 1 January 1973. Patrick Hillery became Ireland's first European Commissioner. In appointing Hillery Europe was gaining one of Ireland's most experienced politicians, while on the other hand Lynch was losing one of his staunchest allies. The admittance of Ireland was the culmination of a decade of preparation which was begun by Lynch and his predecessor, Seán Lemass, who unfortunately did not live to see what would have been his greatest achievement.|$|E
500|$|Several {{shots were}} exchanged: {{the house was}} riddled with bullets, but the whites did not {{overtake}} it. [...] The standoff lasted long into the next morning, when Sarah and Sylvester Carrier were found dead inside the house; several others were wounded, including a child who {{had been shot in}} the eye. Two white men, C. P. [...] "Poly" [...] Wilkerson and Henry Andrews, were killed; Wilkerson had kicked in the front door, and Andrews <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> At least four whites were wounded, one possibly fatally. The remaining children in the Carrier house were spirited out the back door into the woods. They crossed dirt roads one at a time, then hid under brush until they had all gathered away from Rosewood.|$|E

The declassified documents showed that he was chosen as the best of a bad lot. [...] "There aren't any obvious candidates for the Nobel prize and the prize committee is in an unenviable situation," [...] wrote committee member Henry Olsson. Although the committee believed Steinbeck's best work <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> by 1962, committee member Anders Österling believed the release of his novel The Winter of Our Discontent showed that [...] "after some signs of slowing down in recent years, [...] regained his position as a social truth-teller [...] authentic realist fully equal to his predecessors Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway." ...|$|E

Luo Tong's mother {{remarried}} after her husband's death, and became a concubine of the official Hua Xin. Luo Tong, who was seven years old then, returned to Kuaiji Commandery with his close friends. Before he left, his mother tearfully saw him off, but Luo Tong did not look back when he boarded the carriage. When the carriage driver told him his mother <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> Luo Tong said, [...] "I don't want to make my mother miss me even more. That's why I don't look back." [...] Luo Tong was also known for being filial to his stepmother (Hua Xin's official spouse).|$|E
2500|$|In April 2015, police {{reputation}} {{suffered a}} further blow {{when a student}} accused by a police officer of attacking him during the clearance of the Mong Kok occupation on 28 November 2014 was acquitted. In three written statements and during questioning at the witness stand, Constable Lau Kam-wing accused the defendant of approaching him from the front and hitting him in the mouth. Video evidence submitted by an independent witness clearly showed that Lau was in a highly agitated state, and that the defendant <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> and had not assaulted Lau. Lau changed his testimony under questioning, and again {{in light of the}} video evidence. The judge observed that the case was [...] "highly suspicious" [...] and that the defendant had been falsely accused; he criticised Lau's wavering testimony and reproached him for being a dishonest and thus unreliable witness. The judge ordered the incident to be referred to the police complaints department, and asked to be kept informed of the progress of the investigation.|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1967, Lombardi had {{suffered}} from digestive tract problems, {{and he had}} refused his doctor's request for him to undergo a proctoscopic exam. On June 24, 1970, Lombardi was admitted to Georgetown University Hospital, and tests [...] "revealed anaplastic carcinoma in the rectal area of his colon, a fast-growing malignant cancer in which the cells barely resemble their normal appearance." [...] On July 27, Lombardi was readmitted to Georgetown and exploratory surgery found that the cancer was terminal. Lombardi and Marie received family, friends, clergy, players, and former players at his hospital bedside. He {{received a phone call}} from President Nixon telling Lombardi that all of America <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> to which Lombardi replied that he would never give up his fight against his illness. On his deathbed, Lombardi told Father Tim that he was not afraid to die, but that he regretted he could not have accomplished more in his life. Lombardi died in Washington, D.C. at 7:12a.m. on Thursday, September 3, 1970. He was 57. He was surrounded by his wife, parents, two children, and six grandchildren.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main event}} of the show was the final match of the 2012 Campeon Universal Del CMLL {{following}} qualifying rounds on the two previous Super Viernes shows. El Terrible [...] was accompanied by fellow La Fuerza TRT member Rey Bucanero while Hiroshi Tanahashi had CMLL's resident Rudo Japanese wrestler Okumura in his corner for this match. The IWGP World Heavyweight Champion and the CMLL World Heavyweight Champion faced off in a best of three falls match, the only match of the tournament contested under those rules. Despite being a rudo, the Mexican crowd <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> as he worked with the Japanese Tanahashi, cheering with El Terrible tied the match up, one fall a piece and then pinned NJPW's top guy to become the 2012 Universal Champion. Following the decision El Terrible's rival Rush came to the ring and wanted to attack El Terrible but CMLL officials prevented this from happening. Once Rush {{was removed from the}} arena El Terrible was allowed to celebrate his victory and to show off the championship belt that came with the tournament victory.|$|E
2500|$|He {{earned the}} {{nickname}} [...] "One Man Army". On April 19, 1951, Cartagena, [...] "with {{no regard for}} his own safety," [...] as the official record states, left his position and charged directly into devastating enemy fire, single-handedly destroying two enemy emplacements on Hill 206 near [...] "Yonch'on," [...] North Korea. After taking out the emplacements, he was knocked to the ground twice by exploding enemy grenades. Nevertheless, {{he got up and}} attacked three more times, each time destroying an enemy emplacement until he was wounded. On October 19, 2002, during a ceremony honoring the 65th Infantry, when he was asked about the battle, Cartagena responded that he just hurled back at the Chinese the grenades thrown at him. [...] He thought {{that the rest of the}} squad <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> and didn't realize most of them had been wounded and forced to take cover. Later they found 33 dead Chinese in the machine gun and automatic emplacements and they found 15 more dead in the positions he had destroyed on his way up the hill. Cartagena, who had lost a lot of blood, was sent to Taibu in a helicopter and then to Japan to the 128th Marines Hospital where he was hospitalized for 62 days. According to 1st Lt.

2500|$|In the , Lewis Hamilton {{ran into}} the back of Alonso's Renault, heavily {{damaging}} the rear wing of Alonso's car, as well as his own nosecone. Stewards did not seek to investigate the incident but critics alleged he braked (or did not accelerate as expected) in front of Hamilton causing Hamilton to crash into him. The telemetry data from Alonso's car proved these accusations to be wrong. Hamilton himself stated [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> and I moved to the right, and he moved to the right and that was it– a racing incident I guess". It was later revealed by McLaren that Hamilton's front wing, which was damaged when he hit Alonso earlier in the race, had broken seconds before the impact and has been identified as the cause of the crash. Alonso started the [...] with promising pace, qualifying on the front row in second place behind Kimi Räikkönen even though he had a light fuel load. He was running in fifth place when his engine blew on lap 35.

2500|$|After {{the members}} of the 110th House of Representatives were sworn in en masse, Ellison was the first Representative {{scheduled}} to have his picture taken with the new Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Though the Library of Congress is directly {{across the street from the}} Capitol, Thomas Jefferson’s Quran took fifteen minutes to arrive as it was brought through [...] "a long, winding underground route via tunnels...to protect the Quran from the elements". Once inside the Capitol the Quran was placed in a rectangular box, and handled with a green felt wrapper then guards ran the book through security x-ray machines. Ellison was impressed by the two-volume set, saying [...] "Look at that. That’s something else. Oh my God. This is great." [...] A few minutes later, Nancy Pelosi arrived and photos of a ceremonial reenactment oath were taken. There were so many of Ellison’s family in attendance that the ceremony was done in two takes. Among his family was his mother Clida Ellison who thought that the controversy had a positive effect, [...] "because many people in America are going to learn what the diversity of America is all about". Clida Ellison noted that she is a practicing Roman Catholic who goes to Mass every day. Ellison expressed his satisfaction that the controversy <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "It was good, we did it, it's over, and now it's time to get down to business...maybe we don't have to talk about it so much anymore.
