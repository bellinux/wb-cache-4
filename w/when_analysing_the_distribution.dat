40|$|We {{compute the}} bulk motions of cosmic voids, using a ΛCDM {{numerical}} simulation considering the mean velocities {{of the dark}} matter inside the void itself {{and that of the}} haloes in the surrounding shell. We find coincident values of these two measures in the range ∼ 300 - 400 km/s, not far from the expected mean peculiar velocities of groups and galaxy clusters. <b>When</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> of the pairwise relative velocities of voids, we find a remarkable bimodal behaviour consistent with an excess of both systematically approaching and receding voids. We determine that the origin of this bimodality resides in the void large scale environment, since once voids are classified into void-in-void (R-type) or void-in-cloud (S-type), R-types are found mutually receding away, while S-types approach each other. The magnitude of these systematic relative velocities account for more than 100 km/s, reaching large coherence lengths of up to 200 h^- 1 Mpc. We have used samples of voids from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR 7) and the peculiar velocity field inferred from linear theory, finding fully consistent results with the simulation predictions. Thus, their relative motion suggests a scenario of a sparkling Universe, with approaching and receding voids according to their local environment.

The daily stock market index returns of twelve different emerging markets are used for the empirical analysis. In addition to the well-known methodologies, such as the historical simulation and GARCH-based ones, the extreme value theory (EVT) {{is also used to}} estimate the daily VaR. In this paper, we focus on EVT because it studies the non-linear estimation of the tails and we expect to find many extreme events <b>when</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>the</b> return <b>distributions</b> in these twelve emer ging markets.

The daily VaR is forecasted at three different quantile levels: 90 %, 97. 5 %, 99. 9 %; and competing methodologies are back-tested accordingly. The results indicate that the historical simulation and GARCH-based methodologies work better at lower quantile levels than they do at higher quantile levels, while VaR estimated using EVT is more accurate at higher quantiles.

40|$|Cold {{roll forming}} is an {{incremental}} {{sheet metal forming}} process used to supply products to numerous industries such as automotive, architecture and construction, etc. In recent {{years there has been}} an increase in the demand by customers for high value products, through the forming of high strength materials, or complex profiles. Such demands increase the challenges faced by the tooling designer to bring a successful product through from design to manufacture, on time and within specification. Finite element (FE) simulations are increasingly applied in industry due to the desired advantage of reducing design iterations by allowing the designer to investigate the effects of parameter changes, without the risk of expensive tooling costs. Some successful validation of the numerical modelling of the cold roll forming process can be found in literature, in particular <b>when</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>the</b> strain <b>distribution</b> across <b>the</b> material or comparing the final rolled profile geometry. However, cold roll forming is a continuous process and no one has published work on the measurement of the profile on a pass to pass basis, in particular, the three dimensional geometry of the profile.

The market value approach is used to derive an estimate of imputed rental income, which is added to disposable income. The results indicate that in 1998 - 99, imputed rent had an equalising distributional impact, except {{at the very top of}} <b>the</b> <b>distribution.</b> This finding is robust with respect to changes in some of the assumptions that underlie it. Comparisons of low-income rates by housing tenure and age are very sensitive to the inclusion of imputed rent as part of income, and to the deduction of housing costs from income. Analysis of the changing distributional impact of imputed rent between 1993 - 94 and 1998 - 99 indicates that while the effect was equalising in both years, it is not possible to determine whether the impact became more or less equalising over the period. Simulation results indicate that the disequalising impact of changes in gross housing equity (which incorporates the effect of increased house prices) explain much of the observed change in <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> of income plus imputed rent, and accounted for much of the changed distributional impact of imputed rent itself. Overall, the results highlight the importance of taking account of imputed rent <b>when</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>the</b> structure and <b>distribution</b> of Australian living standards...|$|R

Importance of grain rotation and of counter-rotation of adjacent grains is stressed. It is shown that all deformation modes form an incomplete vectorial space D. This allows the statistics of fluctuation to be determined. Parallel with anti-ferromagnetism is then drawn and frustration of rotation is shown to be the leading dissipating mechanism. However this does not allow making the parallel with spinglass due {{to the structure of}} the space of deformation modes which is vectorial, which ensures response linearity. In order to demonstrate experimentally the validity of the approach and the existence of the incomplete vectorial space of deformation, experimental examples are studied starting from regular arrays. They do demonstrate the mechanism of counter-rotation and the existence of the vectorial space of deformation. This theory is applied to compare different experiment and simulation results on the deformation of square and triangular lattices of rods, which can only be done through a statistical approach based on existence of different modes of deformation. Non linear behaviour of the modes is demonstrated experimentally; link with the continuous theory of dislocation is made. Pacs # : 5. 40; 45. 70; 62. 20; 83. 70. FnComment: 24 pages, 9 Figure...|$|R
40|$|Fabric {{analysis}} of the upper 1300 m of the Dome C ice core reveals a slight clustering tendency of c axes towards vertical, which gradually enhanceswith depth from an initially isotropic orientational distribution of c axes at the free surface. Such a strain induced anisotropy {{is compatible with the}} expected macroscale stress state in a dome, viz. dominated by vertical compression. Yet, <b>when</b> one <b>analyses</b> <b>the</b> orientational <b>distribution</b> of <b>the</b> visible gliding layers ofindividual crystallites (slip bands), the evidences are quite contrasting. Direct observation of slip bands in samples from Dome C ice core taken from dierent depths (ranging from 204 m to 1291 m depth) indicates a higher slip activity in nearly horizontal planes, in such a manner that more than 60 % of the detectedslip bands have an inclination of less than 30 with respect to the horizontal. Furthermore, the observed slip activity is not symmetric, i. e., the amount ofslip bands discerned at 20 (say) is usually not comparable with the number ofslip bands found at 160. Such features are not consonant with the predictedslip activity induced by compression and/or extension. In this work, we presentevidences for this unexpected orientational distribution of slip bands and discusstheir possible causes. Natural and artificial agents are investigated, togetherwith their respective consequences for ice sheet modeling and ice core processing. Additionally, we show the occurrence of bent slip bands in certain crystallites. Such a bending represents an early stage of polygonization and it highlights thestrong inhomogeneity of deformation on the crystal level. Moreover, it indicatesthat polygonization might be mathematically interpreted as a continuous processof rotation, characterized by the divergence of c-axes from a common direction. This result is of great value for the modeling of polycrystalline ice within theframes of a continuum theory...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{evolution}} of wide and hot subdwarf (sdB) binaries. These hot subdwarfs are core-helium-burning stars with a very small hydrogen envelope (M_H < 0. 02 Msol). The formation of sdB stars has been controversial for a long time: how can a star lose almost all of its envelope {{at the tip of}} the red-giant branch (RGB). Currently it is widely accepted that sdB stars can only be formed by binary interaction, making them an ideal testing ground for binary interaction processes. There are three main formation channels proposed to form sdB stars: 1) common-envelope ejection creating a short-period binary containing an sdB and a white dwarf (WD) or main-sequence (MS) component, 2) stable Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) {{at the tip of the}} RGB creating long-period sdB + MS binaries, and 3) merger channels creating a single sdB star. Many short-period sdB binaries are known, and the observed population corresponds well with the theoretical models. However, there are only few long-period sdB binaries known, and only one was studied in some detail at the start of my PhD research. In this thesis we focus on this formally unsampled population of wide sdB binaries. The text is divided in two parts, the first covering the observations and analysis of a wide binary sdB sample while the second part focuses on specific binary evolution models which produce the observed wide sdB systems. In the fist part, the analysis of an wide sdB binary sample containing eight systems is discussed. These systems have orbital periods varying from 2 to over 3 years. These binaries have been observed with the HERMES spectrograph attached to the 1. 2 m Mercator telescope on La Palma since 2009. The high resolution and efficiency of HERMES, and the accessibility of the 1. 2 m Mercator telescope for long-term projects like ours allow to obtain the long orbits with appropriate sampling to determine accurate radial velocities of both the cool companion and the sdB component. Based on the RV curves, the orbital properties of the systems could be determined. Due to the large difference in surface gravity between the two components, we were able to observe the gravitational redshift of the sdB component, and use it to estimate its surface gravity. This was a first for sdB binaries. To determine the effective temperature and surface gravity of both components, we developed algorithms that could fit binary model atmospheres to <b>the</b> spectral-energy <b>distribution</b> (SED) from photometry available in the literature. The most important discovery is that all the wide sdB binaries in our sample have significantly eccentric orbits. In combination with two other systems published in the literature, there are ten eccentric systems and only one possibly circular system. This is unexpected as tidal forces are predicted to circularize the binaries when the sdB progenitor is ascending <b>the</b> RGB. <b>When</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>the</b> period-eccentricity <b>distribution</b> of <b>the</b> sample, there is a clear trend visible that higher eccentricities are detected in systems with longer orbital periods. The eccentricity varies from e = 0. 04 at P~ 750 days, to e= 0. 17 at P~ 1250 days. The circular system has the lowest orbital period at ~ 730 days. In the second part we tested three possible eccentricity-pumping mechanisms described in the literature. These are: 1) phase-dependent tidally-enhanced-wind mass loss, 2) phase-dependent mass loss during RLOF and 3) the interaction between a circumbinary (CB) disk with the binary in combination with phase-dependent RLOF. To test these processes we used the evolution code MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) which, next to the stellar evolution part, also contains a binary module. We adapted this binary module to include all physical processes necessary to study {{the evolution of}} eccentric binary systems. The tidally-enhanced-wind-mass-loss models were not capable to create eccentric sdB binaries in the covered parameter space. To remain on an eccentric orbit, the sdB progenitor needs to lose too much mass to ignite helium. All formed eccentric binaries consist of a MS and WD component, while the formed sdB + MS binaries are all circular. Models including phase-dependent RLOF or a CB disk are capable of creating eccentric sdB + MS binaries. Using only phase-dependent RLOF, the systems with low and intermediate eccentricities on orbital periods up till ~ 1100 days can be explained. When also a CB disk is added, also the higher eccentricities and orbital periods up to 1600 days can be reached. Circular systems on short orbital periods (< 1000 days) can not be formed when the eccentricity-pumping mechanisms are active. Even though the models allow all observed eccentric systems, they do not predict the observed trend of higher eccentricities at higher orbital periods. Both eccentricity-pumping mechanisms are more effective at shorter orbital periods. We conclude that our observed sample of sdB binaries can contribute significantly in studies of binary-interaction mechanisms. Two of the tested eccentricity-pumping mechanisms allow for the existence of the eccentric wide sdB binary population, even though they can not predict the observed trend in <b>the</b> period-eccentricity <b>distribution.</b> Further theoretical research is necessary to improve the eccentricity-pumping models. While an improved understanding of the cool companions in wide sdB binaries can help to constrain the free parameters in the binary-interaction mechanisms. Our findings have wider implications as also in the more evolved post-AGB binaries, wide eccentric systems are observed. status: publishe...|$|R
