50|$|The {{material}} may be solid, liquid, gas, {{material of}} some intermediate {{characteristics such as}} gel or sputum, tissue, organisms, {{or a combination of}} these. Even if a material sample is not countable as individual items, the quantity of the sample may still be describable in terms of its volume, mass, size, or other such dimensions. A solid sample can come in one or a few discrete pieces, or can be fragmented, granular, or powdered. A section of a rod, <b>wire,</b> <b>cord,</b> sheeting, or tubing may be considered a sample. Samples which are not a solid piece are commonly kept in a container of some sort. In the field of science, a representative liquid sample taken from a larger amount of liquid is sometimes called an aliquot.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Process {{analytical}} technology guidance by the US Food & Drug Administration lately became the major driver of pharmaceutical process optimization. The {{majority of these}} processes are complex and consequently multivariate. Although new insights have improved knowledge of the phenomena taking place, it is not usually possible to develop deterministic modeling. Processes involving powder handling, such as multi-component pharmaceutical formulation blending, are common and the real-time monitoring of their physico-chemical attributes is challenging. In this work, we propose multivariate analysis of a V-blender mixing unit operation with an in-line near-infra red (NIR) measurement technique. The NIR measurement system {{used in this study}} consists of a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) -based spectrometer connected to an IP- 65 -encased optical measuring head (sampling probe) through a 1 -meter length umbilical <b>wire</b> <b>cord.</b> It deploys diffuse reflectance sampling technology, providing 40 -mm spot size with a spectral range of 1, 350 to 1, 800 nm. The methodology includes the following steps: (1) modification of a nominal 1 -ft (30 -L) V-blender unit to accommodate Axsun’s NIR spectroscopy system; (2) 3 experimental runs, each with a different mixing time, while monitoring powder homogeneity with NIR spectroscopy; (3) acquisition of 10 powder samples after each run from pre-determined locations in the V-blender, evaluated with current Quality Assurance (QA) /Quality Control (QC) lab methods, to determine reference mixing endpoints; and (4) NIR data analysis by SIMPA-P+ an...|$|E

30|$|Thermal {{spraying}} is {{a deposition}} method where {{a spray of}} molten particles is focused on a portion to form the coating. It {{is used for the}} protection of new parts against corrosion, wear and high temperatures, thereby improving the properties of engineered surfaces. Thermal spray coating processes are also applied for fixing damaged and worn parts. At times, the thermal spraying can be useful for the decoration thus improving the esthetical properties of parts. Coating material can be either in powder, <b>wire,</b> rod, <b>cord</b> or molten-bath form. Using thermal spraying process basically composite, ceramic, polymer and thick metallic coatings can be deposited. Operations of the process can be manual, mechanized and fully automated. Thermal spraying was mentioned {{for the first time in}} the patents of the Swiss engineer Max Ulrich Schoop (1870 – 1956) at the beginning of the 20 th century [79]. The various advantages of thermal spray coatings are low porosity, excellent coating, good adherence to substrate, low permeability, excellent corrosion or wear resistance, reliability, long-lasting protection, improved electrical properties (resistance and conductivity), clearance and good dimensional control [78].|$|R
