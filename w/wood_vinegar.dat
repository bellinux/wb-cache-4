5000|$|Pyrolysis or thermal {{decomposition}} of wood {{in a low}} oxygen manner originated prehistorically to produce charcoal. Condensates of the vapors eventually were made and found useful as preservatives. The term <b>wood</b> <b>vinegar</b> for centuries was the popular term {{used to describe the}} water based condensates of wood smoke. Presumably, this is due to its utilization as food vinegar. Pliny the Elder recorded in one of his ten volumes of Natural History the use of <b>wood</b> <b>vinegar</b> as an embalming agent, declaring it superior to other treatments he used. Widely recognized as the father of chemical engineering, another naturalist documentarian Johann Rudolf Glauber outlined in Furni Novi Philosophici [...] the methods to produce <b>wood</b> <b>vinegar</b> during charcoal making. Further, he described the use of the water insoluble tar fraction as a wood preservative and documented the freezing of the <b>wood</b> <b>vinegar</b> to concentrate it. Use of the French derivation, pyroligneous acid as a widely used term for <b>wood</b> <b>vinegar</b> emerged by 1788.|$|E

30|$|In this study, three <b>wood</b> <b>vinegars</b> {{obtained}} from oil palm trunk were examined for their antifungal activity against a brown-rot fungus, Fomitopsis palustris and a white-rot fungus, Trametes versicolor. The {{efficacy of the}} <b>wood</b> <b>vinegars</b> against an economically important termite, C. formosanus, was also evaluated.|$|R
30|$|Sunarta et al. [41] {{concluded}} that <b>wood</b> <b>vinegars</b> made from oil palm fruit {{had the potential}} to be a low-cost and environmentally low-impact wood preservative for preventing attacks by Cryptotermes spp. Recently, <b>wood</b> <b>vinegars</b> from pineapple waste biomass were shown to have termiticidal activities against subterranean termites [42].|$|R
30|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>vinegars</b> {{prepared}} {{from various}} sources of wood and wood-based composites have been tested for their effectiveness against decay fungi and insects [5 – 10].

[5] reported the insecticidal activity of <b>wood</b> <b>vinegars</b> produced at 400 – 600  °C against Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say). Hossain et al. [10] tested the insecticidal activity of <b>wood</b> <b>vinegars</b> derived from fast pyrolysis of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose at 450 and 550  °C, and found that they were toxic at both temperatures against L. decemlineata, Trichoplusia ni, and Acyrthosiphon pisum.|$|R
50|$|Inchcailloch {{has been}} used as a hunting forest since the reign of Robert the Bruce. Deer still roam the island. White deer have been seen on the island in 2003. The narrow {{crossing}} is very shallow making an easy passage for deer to ford. The island was farmed until the early 19th century, being recorded in 1800 as producing good wheat and oats; the ruins of the farm can still be seen. For around 130 years, Inchcailloch was an oak plantation. The resulting timber was processed at Balmaha (on the site of the Highland Way Inn), for making <b>wood</b> <b>vinegar</b> (pyroligneous acid), wood tar, and dye.|$|E
50|$|The 18th and 19th centuries {{once more}} brought {{a certain level}} of {{economic}} health to the villages, although economic wealth did not come overnight. Reasons for this could be seen in improvements to agriculture and forestry, the distribution of former lordly and communally held lands to the peasants and also in an emerging handicraft industry. In 1861, for the first time, an industrial operation located in Brücken. Wood charcoal, tar, <b>wood</b> <b>vinegar</b> and other chemicals were manufactured. Serving as raw material were the surrounding forests. While some found work at the plant, local farmers also found extra earning opportunities in transporting goods or hewing wood. Brücken grew into one of the biggest villages in the Birkenfelder Land.|$|E
5000|$|In the 17th century, {{the river}} {{did not have}} a {{specific}} name; however, it was sometimes referred to the St. Nicholas river (named after the chapel of the nearby Church of the Assumption). The place was also called [...] "Mokrushi" [...] (Russian:Мокруши) because the area is surrounded by wetlands. In the 19th century, construction began on the deserted island Petrovsky. The Zhdanov brothers, Ivan and Nicholas, where the first to be granted land on the island. The Zhdanovs lined the river banks of the Malaya Neva River to the current Little Petrovsky Bridge. Here, the brothers built a chemical-pharmaceutical plant, which drew up the birch tar and <b>wood</b> <b>vinegar.</b> The Brother's development of the area led their name being used refer to the river and the street along it.

30|$|Recently, Theapparat et al. [3] {{reported}} that <b>wood</b> <b>vinegars</b> exhibited antifungal activity against two white-rot fungi, a brown-rot fungus and a sapstain fungus. The vinegars {{were made from}} Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Leucaena leucocephala, Azadirachta indica, Hevea brasiliensis (rubberwood), and Dendrocalamus asper (bamboo). The largest component in the five <b>wood</b> <b>vinegars</b> that exhibited high fungicidal activities, especially in those made from rubberwood and bamboo, was total phenol. A previous study suggested that phenolic compounds derived from lignocellulosic biomass might be primarily responsible for the antifungal performance of <b>wood</b> <b>vinegars</b> [11]. Tar oil from macadamia nut shells was employed in vitro to protect wood against various wood-decaying fungi and wood-attacking termites [12].|$|R
30|$|Termiticidal {{performance}} {{was consistent with}} concentration of total acid in the <b>wood</b> <b>vinegars</b> (Table  2), showing good agreement with the previous results. For example, Shiny and Remadewi [15] investigated the termiticidal activity of coconut shell oil against Odontotermes horni (Wasmann), O. obesus (Rambur), O. redamanni (Wasmann), and Microtermes obesi (Holmgren). They reported that the largest components in the coconut shell oil that exhibited high termiticidal performance were phenol or its highly oxygenated fractions. Temiz et al. [14] examined the termiticidal activity of <b>wood</b> <b>vinegars,</b> and stated that no mass losses were observed in treated samples, while untreated control samples showed 20 % mass loss.|$|R
30|$|The choice {{bioassay}} method [18, 19] {{was carried}} out to evaluate repellent effect of the <b>wood</b> <b>vinegars</b> using Petri dishes of 60  mm diameter containing a pair of paper discs (8  mm in diameter, Advantec Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan): a wood vinegar-treated disc (treated) and a DI-treated disc (untreated). The treated and untreated paper discs were placed into a Petri dish by approximately 25  mm apart from each other.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the common}} {{practice}} of charcoal burning using internal heating of the charged wood by burning {{a part of}} it, all the by-product vapors and gas escapes into the atmosphere as smoke. The by-products can be recovered by passing the off-gases {{through a series of}} water to yield so-called <b>wood</b> <b>vinegar</b> (pyroligneous acid) and the non-condensible wood gas passes on through the condenser and may be burned to provide heat. The wood gas is only usable as fuel and consists typically of 17% methane; 2% hydrogen; 23% carbon monoxide; 38% carbon dioxide; 2% oxygen and 18% nitrogen. It has a gas calorific value of about 10.8 MJoules per m3 (290 BTU/cu.ft.) i.e. about one third the value of natural gas. When deciduous tree woods are subjected to distillation, the products are methanol (wood alcohol) and charcoal. The distillation of pine wood causes Pine tar and pitch to drip away from the wood and leave behind charcoal. Birch tar from birch bark is a particularly fine tar, known as [...] "Russian oil", suitable for leather protection. The by-products of wood tar are turpentine and charcoal.|$|E

The feasibility of using water-soluble, resole-type, wood tar phenol-formaldehyde resins (WT-PF) was investigated. The resins were prepared from phenol (P) and wood tars (WTs) at weight ratios of 100 : 0, 80 : 20, 60 : 40 and 40 : 60 and F/P molar ratios of 1. 5, 1. 8 and 2. 0 as plywood adhesives. The results demonstrated that WT-PF resins had a higher viscosity, shorter gel times, a higher polydispersity, a lower curing temperature and less heat of curing than conventional PF resins under the same conditions. The shear strength of plywood bonded with WT-PF resins was slightly {{lower than that of}} conventional PF resin. However, the WT-PF resin still met the CNS 1349 requirement for the dry test, and phenol substitution levels could be up to 60 %, but only 20 % for type I and type II plywood. The addition of A. confusa bark powder fillers could significantly improve the bonding strength of WT-PF resins, especially for the warm water soaking and soaking in boiling water tests. The required amounts of fillers added were up to 5 % for A. confusa WT-PF resins and up to 3 % for C. japonica resins...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} action of bamboo/wood vinegars collected at different temperatures from the exit of chimney of earthen kiln was evaluated by Salmonella mutagenesis assay, {{as a safety}} evaluation (Ames test) and reverse mutation assay (antimutagenic activity). The compounds of the vinegars were analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy analysis. The acid, phenol and ketone compounds of bamboo vinegars were 10. 65 – 20. 09 %, 57. 87 – 65. 98 % and 10. 13 – 18. 76 %, and the compounds of <b>wood</b> <b>vinegars</b> were 4. 27 – 14. 51 %, 50. 23 – 65. 03 % and 12. 93 – 25. 26 %, respectively. The vinegars’ safety showed that neither cytotoxicity nor mutagenicity toward Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 with S 9 mix (an external metabolic activation system) at the diluting percent content of vinegars were lower than 20. 00 % or less, and without the S 9 mix was at 33. 33 % or less. The vinegars at a diluting percent content below 20. 00 % expressed a dose–dependent inhibitory effect against both 4 –nitroquinoline–N–oxide (NQNO), a direct mutagen, and the mutagenicity of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), an indirect mutagen which requires metabolic activation, in Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100. The inhibition of the vinegars against NQNO and AFB 1 toward TA 100 was better than those toward TA 98. In addition, the main percent of phenol and ketone compounds in the vinegars showed cytotoxicity/mutagenicity and an antimutagenic effect against the strains mentioned above, which may partially account for the {{biological action}} of bamboo/wood vinegars...|$|R
3000|$|In our work, {{in which}} the <b>wood</b> <b>vinegar</b> made from LABAN was used, the vinegar showed {{resistant}} against both fungi and termites, but it needed the relatively high concentrations to perform as an antitermite agent. The <b>wood</b> <b>vinegar</b> of 10  % concentration was needed to achieve 100  % mortality against C. formosanus, whereas for R. speratus only 5  % of <b>wood</b> <b>vinegar</b> was required. Whereas <b>wood</b> <b>vinegar</b> from coconut shell exhibited high termicidal activity against termite workers, Odontotermes sp. at a dilution of 1 : 50, wood vinegar: sterile water (v/v) [31].
