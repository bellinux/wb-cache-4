5|$|Cases {{have been}} {{recorded}} by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some archaeological cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem fetal expulsion have always been rare, the phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when {{the body of a}} pregnant woman lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated from the body of the pregnant <b>woman</b> <b>about</b> the time of death or during decomposition, though because those cases are not consistent with the processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{to assess}} the {{knowledge}} of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection among Dutch primary care midwives, and clinical approaches to informing <b>women</b> <b>about</b> CMV. Design: cross-sectional study, using self-administered questionnaires. Participants: 330 Dutch primary care midwives. Setting: primary midwifery care practices across the Netherlands. Main outcome: Midwives' knowledge of CMV transmission routes and maternal symptoms, and clinical practice behaviours regarding CMV, the information typically provided or reasons for not informing pregnant <b>women</b> <b>about</b> CMV. Findings: the overall median knowledge score was 8. 0 out of a maximum possible score of 13. 0. Of all participants, 10. 6 % reported always informing pregnant <b>women</b> <b>about</b> CMV infection prevention and 41. 0 % reported never informing pregnant women. The main reason indicated for not informing pregnant women was {{lack of knowledge about}} preventive methods (45. 7 %). Conclusion: Dutch primary care midwives have limited knowledge of CMV infection. Improvement in providing education to pregnant <b>women</b> <b>about</b> strategies to prevent CMV is necessary...|$|R
25|$|The {{beginning}} of pregnancy may be detected either based on symptoms {{by the woman}} herself, or by using pregnancy tests. However, an important condition with serious health implications that is quite common is the denial of pregnancy by the pregnant <b>woman.</b> <b>About</b> one in 475 denials will last until around the 20th week of pregnancy. The proportion of cases of denial, persisting until delivery is about 1 in 2500. Conversely, some non-pregnant women {{have a very strong}} belief that they are pregnant along with some of the physical changes. This condition is known as a false pregnancy.|$|E

[...] Although many in the congregation lived in Nebo (in the north of the parish), it was decided to build the new church about two-thirds of a mile from its predecessor (about 1.1km) to the south-west in the vicinity of the Llys Dulas estate, whose owners had long been connected with the church.|$|E

500|$|As film roles {{became more}} {{difficult}} to find, a common problem shared by many Hollywood veterans from her era, deHavilland began working in television dramas, despite her dislike of the networks' practice of breaking up story lines with commercials. Her first venture into the medium was a teleplay directed by Sam Peckinpah called Noon Wine (1966) on ABC Stage 67, a dark tragedy about a farmer's act of murder that leads to his suicide. The production and her performance as the farmer's wife Ellie were well received. In 1972, she starred in her first television feature film, The Screaming <b>Woman,</b> <b>about</b> a wealthy woman recovering from a nervous breakdown. In 1979, she appeared in the ABC miniseries [...] {{in the role of}} Mrs. Warner, the wife of a former Confederate officer played by Henry Fonda. The miniseries was seen by an estimated 110 million peoplenearly one-third of American homes with television sets. Throughout the 1970s, deHavilland's film work was limited to smaller supporting roles and cameo appearances. Her last feature film was The Fifth Musketeer (1979). During this period, deHavilland began doing speaking engagements in cities across the United States with a talk entitled [...] "From the City of the Stars to the City of Light", a program of personal reminiscences about her life and career.

500|$|On January 6, {{after the}} Americans had spent {{several days of}} waiting and {{shouting}} basic Huaorani phrases into the jungle, the first Huaorani visitors arrived. [...] A young man and two women emerged on the opposite river bank around 11:15a.m., and soon joined the missionaries at their encampment. The younger of the two women had come against the wishes of her family, and the man, named Nankiwi, who was romantically interested in her, followed. The older <b>woman</b> (<b>about</b> thirty years old) acted as a self-appointed chaperone. The men gave them several gifts, including a model plane, and the visitors soon relaxed and began conversing freely, apparently not realizing that the men's language skills were weak. Nankiwi, whom the missionaries nicknamed [...] "George", showed interest in their aircraft, so Saint took off with him aboard. They first completed a circuit around the camp, but Nankiwi appeared eager for a second trip, so they flew toward Terminal City. Upon reaching a familiar clearing, Nankiwi recognized his neighbors, and leaning out of the plane, wildly waved and shouted to them. Later that afternoon, the younger woman became restless, and though the missionaries offered their visitors sleeping quarters, Nankiwi and the young woman left the beach with little explanation. The older woman apparently had more interest in conversing with the missionaries, and remained there most of the night.|$|E

500|$|In 1934, Birkett {{acted as}} {{counsel for the}} second of the two Brighton trunk murders, a case which was {{described}} as [...] "his greatest triumph in a capital case". In June 1934, a woman's torso was found in a suitcase in Brighton railway station. The legs were discovered at King's Cross station the next day, but her head and arms were never found, and the case is still unsolved. A woman by the name of Violette Kaye had disappeared, and the appearance of the first woman's body prompted greater scrutiny on Kaye's case. On 14 July, they interviewed Toni Mancini, Kaye's boyfriend, who convinced them that the dead woman could not possibly be Kaye; the dead woman had been identified as around thirty five years old and five months pregnant, while Kaye was ten years older. Kaye was last seen alive on 10 May looking distressed in the doorway to her house and had been scheduled to visit her sister in London who received a telegram on 11 May reading [...] "Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. Vi." [...] in block capitals. The post office clerks could not remember who sent it, but experts testified that the handwriting on the telegram had similarities to that on a menu written by Mancini. On 14 May, with the help of another man, Mancini moved his belongings from the house he shared with Kaye, which included a large trunk which was too heavy to move by hand. Mancini had told people that he had broken up with Kaye and she had moved to Paris, and that before she left he had beaten her. He later said to a friend, [...] "What is the good of knocking a <b>woman</b> <b>about</b> with your fists? You only hurt yourself. You should hit her with a hammer same as I did and [...] her up."
