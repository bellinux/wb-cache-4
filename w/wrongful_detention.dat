25|$|In an {{associated}} case, Ashcroft v. al-Kidd (2011), Abdullah al-Kidd, an American citizen and convert to Islam, {{was arrested in}} 2003 and held for 16 days in maximum security prisons. He was under supervised release (house arrest) for 13 months. The federal government was holding him as a material witness against Al-Hussayen. After finally being released, al-Kidd sued Attorney General John Ashcroft personally, in {{a case in which}} he was represented by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). They said that they knew of 70 other Muslim men who had been similarly detained in the early years following the 9/11 attacks. In 2009 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that Ashcroft could be sued and held personally responsible for the <b>wrongful</b> <b>detention</b> of al-Kidd.|$|E

5000|$|Cebotari v Moldova {{concerned}} <b>wrongful</b> pre-trial <b>detention.</b> The Court {{found that}} Cebotari's detention had been arbitrary (and therefore contrary to Article 5 ECHR), {{as it was}} not based upon a 'reasonable suspicion', meaning [...] "the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence". Instead, the detention had been a mechanism for pressuring Cebotari to stop other proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights.|$|R
25|$|Similar {{results are}} seen in other cases from the time. The two actions were {{regarded}} as alternative remedies for the same wrong. Often, the plaintiff had a choice of action, although there were differences between the choices. Trover must involve a <b>wrongful</b> <b>detention</b> of goods which had not been wrongfully taken, while trespass would not. The theory of trespass was that the plaintiff remained {{the owner of the}} chattel, with his possession only interrupted or interfered with, so that when it was tendered back to the plaintiff, he must accept it. The damages must be limited to the loss of use, which could be considerably less than its total value. Trover, which involved lost goods or those placed in a bailment, necessitated full replacement damages. Once the damages were paid, the ownership of the chattel passed to the defendant in trover.|$|E

50|$|In May 2005, it was {{revealed}} that a total of 33 cases of people being wrongfully detained under the Migration Act 1958 were known. This included the case of a woman, Australian citizen Vivian Alvarez Solon, who was forcibly deported to the Philippines and who subsequently went missing. As of May, it was not known how many actually spent time in an immigration detention facility. By late May, Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone announced that more than 200 cases of possible <b>wrongful</b> immigration <b>detention</b> had been referred to the Palmer Inquiry. In October 2005, the Commonwealth Ombudsman revealed {{that more than half of}} those cases were held for a week or less and 23 people were held for more than a year and two of them were detained for more than five years. Australia's longest-serving detainee in immigration detention was Peter Qasim who was detained for more than 7 years before being released in 2005 on a bridging visa.|$|R
2500|$|Otherwise, {{conversion}} had {{its origin}} in the common law action in trover, as a branch of action on the case. [...] The earliest cases are most likely lost. [...] These probably involved cases when the finder of lost goods did not return them to the rightful owner, but used them himself or disposed of them to someone else. It became necessary to invent a new writ which covered the gap between action in trespass which lay for the wrongful taking of a chattel, and detinue which lay for its <b>wrongful</b> <b>detention.</b>|$|E
2500|$|For a {{time during}} the fifteenth century, the common law courts seemed to draw a real {{distinction}} between the counts detinue sur trover and detinue sur bailment. A bailment occurs {{when there is an}} agreement for someone to transport or keep a chattel. [...] The normal rule was that [...] "ordinary" [...] care was necessary to protect the chattel while it was in the custody of the bailee. The former was a <b>wrongful</b> <b>detention</b> and a tortious wrong. [...] The latter a wrong based on the agreement between the parties.|$|E

He was held for 15 days in maximum security in three states, and 13 months in supervised release, {{to be used as a}} material witness in the trial of Sami Omar Al-Hussayen.

40|$|The {{judgment}} by Nugent JA (with whom Navsa and Heher JJA concurred) {{not only}} restates and applies well-known principles regarding the quantification of damages for <b>wrongful</b> arrest and <b>detention,</b> but also {{deals with the}} role of the Constitution in this regard. The court correctly places emphasis on the principle that the facts of each case are decisive in arriving at the appropriate amount of damages and that a comparison of awards made in previous cases must take proper account of this approach (see generally Visser and Potgieter Law of damages (2003) 472 – 474; Neethling, Potgieter and Visser Neethling’s Law of personality (2005) 121 – 122) ...|$|R
5000|$|Following the confrontation, 71 pickets {{were charged}} with riot and 24 with violent disorder. At the time, riot was {{punishable}} by life imprisonment. The trials collapsed when the evidence given by the police was deemed [...] "unreliable". Gareth Peirce, who acted as solicitor {{for some of the}} men, said that the charge of riot had been used [...] "to make a public example of people, as a device to assist in breaking the strike", while Mansfield called it [...] "the worst example of a mass frame-up in this country this century." [...] In June 1991, South Yorkshire Police paid £425,000 in compensation to 39 miners for assault, <b>wrongful</b> arrest, unlawful <b>detention</b> and malicious prosecution. In 2015, the Independent Police Complaints Commission reported that there was [...] "evidence of excessive violence by police officers, a false narrative from police exaggerating violence by miners, perjury by officers giving evidence to prosecute the arrested men, and an apparent coverup of that perjury by senior officers." [...] Alan Billings, the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, admitted that the police had been [...] "dangerously close to being used as an instrument of state." [...] Following the 2016 inquest verdict into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, previously censored documents suggesting links between the actions of senior South Yorkshire Police officers at both incidents were published. This led to renewed calls for a public inquiry to be held into the actions of the police at Orgreave. In October 2016, Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced there would be no statutory inquiry or independent review in an Oral Answer to a Question in the House of Commons, in a written ministerial statement to the House of Commons and Lords, and {{in a letter to the}} Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign (OTJC).|$|R
2500|$|In Sykes v Walls , a {{claim of}} <b>wrongful</b> <b>detention</b> by a bailee was upheld as a good claim {{on the ground that}} a refusal to deliver up {{constituted}} a [...] "misfeasance". [...] By this case, trover became virtually concurrent with detinue. [...] When a chattel had been found, and there was a subsequent refusal to deliver it to the owner, it was taken as evidence that a conversion had occurred. Trover was a wrong against the right of possession and not against the possession itself, because possession was prima facie in the wrong-doer. Even when trover was allowed to overlap trespass and replevin, which were concerned with possession, it remained necessary to define conversion, and this extension did not really affect the definition. Conversion became any act {{on the part of the}} defendant inconsistent with the plaintiff's right to possession. [...] This right had parts: [...] it had to be (1) absolute and (2) immediate.|$|E
