5000|$|The [...] "Traction Avant" [...] is a {{car that}} pioneered the mass {{production}} of three revolutionary features that are still in use today: a unitary body with no separate frame, four <b>wheel</b> <b>independent</b> <b>suspension</b> and front-wheel drive. Whereas for many decades, {{the vast majority of}} motor cars were similar in conception to the Ford Model T - a body bolted onto a ladder frame which held all the mechanical elements of the car, a solid rear axle that rigidly connected the rear wheels and rear wheel drive. The Model T school of automobile engineering proved popular because it was considered cheap to build, although it did pose dynamic defects as automobiles were becoming more capable, and resulted in heavier cars, which is why today cars are more like the Traction Avant than the Model T under the skin.In 1934 Citroën commissioned the American Budd Company to create a prototype, which evolved into the 7 fiscal horsepower (CV), [...] Traction Avant.|$|E

50|$|All {{vehicles}} {{have power}} steering and incorporate {{a new type}} of suspension consisting of a double trailing arm <b>independent</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>suspension,</b> the kinetic properties of which give considerably improved mobility in rough terrain. The negative lead angle of the springing reduces the vertical and horizontal acceleration when driving rapidly across obstacles so that the physical load on the crew is lower compared to vehicles equipped with rigid axles.|$|R
40|$|The active {{suspension}} {{system is a}} possible way to improve suspension performance although the passive system can effectively handle some control of suspension system. The main propose of this project is to assess performance of {{active suspension}} system in comparison and passive suspension system by implementing Fuzzy and Proportional-Integral-Derivative. The quarter car system is designed and constructed based on the four <b>wheel</b> <b>independent</b> <b>suspension.</b> Mathematic model that used in simulation {{is based on the}} dynamic diagram of quarter car system. Passive suspension is a system that not equipped with any controller but there are two controllers that used in active suspension system. The two controllers that applied to simulate the action of active system are Fuzzy Logic controller and Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller. First controller that used in active system is PID controller. This controller design deals with the selection of proportional gain, derivative gain and integral gain parameters (K_p,〖 K〗_(d) and〖 K〗_i). The parameter of this control is adjusted by tuning the PID controller using the heuristic method. Fuzzy Logic controller is applied to the block diagram that controlled by PID controller to improve the active suspension system. From the result of simulations, the Fuzzy-PID scheme can reduce vibration than PID scheme. In conclusion, the active suspension with PID controller combined with FLC is more effective and stable rather than passive suspension system...|$|E
40|$|Stiffness {{has long}} since governed the way people choose automobiles. Stiffer {{suspensions}} allow for the better handling necessary in sporty cars while softer suspensions provide the comfort expected in luxury cars. Automobiles have also been limited by ride height: a higher ride height will yield more clearance from bumps along the ground. However, lower ride height lowers {{the center of gravity}} of the car, which is desired for safety. The purpose of this work is to propose a way of using axiomatic design to device a system that uses orifice controlled dampers, pneumatic springs and hydraulic chambers to achieve a fully customizable suspension system and ride height regulation. In addition, a way to create the best possible user experience is proposed by using control theory to keep the car chassis at the same level at all times, thus giving the user the ability to have a smooth ride at any suspension setting, even stiff suspension systems in the case of sporty car settings. To achieve the goals of this work, a short-long arm (SLA) suspension system was modeled and modified. The SLA suspension system is the most common front <b>wheel</b> <b>independent</b> <b>suspension</b> system that is used today. (cont.) By keeping a similar overall design for the proposed system, adaptability of the proposed system is increased. The coil spring of the common SLA suspension system is replaced by an air spring with a fluid chamber in series. The air spring has a variable spring stiffness that is related to the volume of air inside. Because air is compressible, the volume changes with the force applied, yielding a nonlinear relationship that must be compensated for by an active control system that monitors the overall volume of the air spring and compensates for any changes during use by addition or removal of air. The fluid chamber is responsible for keeping the chassis at the same level at all times by taking into account the changing volume of the air spring and the changes in the road by having incompressible fluid pumped {{in and out of the}} chamber. by Amy L.

5000|$|An even broader (somewhat figurative) {{sense of}} the word refers to every pair of {{parallel}} wheels on opposite sides of a vehicle, regardless of their mechanical connection {{to each other and to}} the vehicle frame or body. Thus, transverse pairs of <b>wheels</b> in an <b>independent</b> <b>suspension</b> may be called an axle in some contexts. This very loose definition of [...] "axle" [...] is often used in assessing toll roads or vehicle taxes, and is taken as a rough proxy for the overall weight-bearing capacity of a vehicle, and its potential for causing wear or damage to roadway surfaces.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wheel</b> rate on <b>independent</b> <b>suspension</b> {{is fairly}} straightforward. However, special {{consideration}} {{must be taken}} with some non-independent suspension designs. Take {{the case of the}} straight axle. When viewed from the front or rear, the wheel rate can be measured by the means above. Yet because the <b>wheels</b> are not <b>independent,</b> when viewed from the side under acceleration or braking the pivot point is at infinity (because both wheels have moved) and the spring is directly inline with the wheel contact patch. The result is often that the effective wheel rate under cornering is different from what it is under acceleration and braking. This variation in wheel rate may be minimized by locating the spring as close to the wheel as possible.|$|R
5000|$|Both the Especial and Luxo had {{a manual}} gearbox, rear <b>wheel</b> drive, front <b>independent</b> <b>{{suspension}}</b> and rear live axle, both with coil springs. In front, the suspension components were anchored to one side, {{set in the}} unibody with screws, later known as the subframe. The tires were the first tubeless tires used on a car manufactured in Brazil. It had a diaphragmatic (or [...] "Chinese hat") clutch spring, which was becoming popular throughout the world. The sporty Opala SS, originally only available with the [...] "250" [...] engine, was the first version to receive a four-speed manual gearbox. This was coupled with a tachometer and lots of matte black striping.|$|R
50|$|In December 1930, Adler {{assigned}} the German engineer Josef Ganz, {{who was also}} editor-in-chief of Motor-Kritik magazine, as a consultant engineer.

After completion in May 1931, Ganz nicknamed his new prototype Maikäfer (May Beetle). After a shift in management at Adler, further development of the Maikäfer was stopped as the company's new technical director Hans Gustav Röhr concentrated on front-wheel driven cars.|$|R
