25|$|On 27 January 1993 {{the county}} court in Požega filed an {{indictment}} against four Serbian paramilitaries, {{accusing them of}} taking a civilian to Bučje and torturing him, along {{with others in the}} camp. In April, the four were convicted in absentia. All were sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. In 2009 the county state attorney officially requested that the men be re-tried. In the changed indictment, new evidence suggested that the four did indeed take an individual to Bučje, but they did not participate in the torture of prisoners and had no influence on how long they would be imprisoned. Also, the person they forced to Bučje was captured in his <b>working</b> <b>place</b> but {{was a member of the}} Ministry of the Interior reserve force.

25|$|The {{government}} took action into regulating the migrant service business by imposing {{a law in}} 2009 aiming for more control on “Migrant Workers Offices,” the law simply demands that such an office would register in the ministry of labour; the law emphasizes on the business owner to be a Lebanese citizen with no previous criminal record. It mentions as well {{the need to provide}} a location for the workers to stay in, moreover it is not allowed for the business or its clients to abuse the workers and should there be any disputes, they should be reported to the ministry or the appropriate legal entities. Finally, the law identifies the rights of the worker to days off and the responsibility of the office to return the worker within three months of arrival in Lebanon in case the workers refuse to work, escaped from their <b>working</b> <b>place</b> or in case of pregnancy; the law gives more specifics on the duties of the office with regards to the working states of the workers in Lebanon. Other measurements taken by the government of Lebanon includes adding more regulations to the process of bringing foreign workers into the country. The measurements apply on workers from the state of Madagascar, where no office is allowed to bring workers from Madagascar without the approval of the consulate of Madagascar in Lebanon. The offices then are obliged to present the approval document and the application paper to the ministry of labour.|$|E

2500|$|This {{place is}} located on the {{south-western}} part of Dasmariñas. The name [...] "Langkaan" [...] came from the word [...] "langka" [...] meaning jackfruit; which is believed to be planted in many parts of this barangay during the 1900, the year of its foundation. Barangay Langkaan was a part of a vast hacienda during the Spanich period that's why there are numerous water systems for ricefields that can be found here. The San Agustin Dam was constructed in 1855. On {{the last part of the}} 19th century, the Spaniards erected an indigo plantation here. The stone-made grinder of indigo still exists until now and it is the mark of the Spanish influence in the place. The Spaniards are the first ones who planted sugar canes and became the primary source of income during the 18th century. During those times, tarapiche and carabaos are used to make panucha and paldo. Don Placido Campos and Andres Medina are the ones who owned these tarapiche. When the Americans arrived, this place attracted residents from the Poblacion. The families Quillao, Bautista, Sarabusab, Reyes, Remulla, Sango, Laudato, Empeño, Satsatin, Medina, de Lima and others transferred here during those times. During the Second World War, the Japanese had a big plantation of cotton trees in Langkaan. Dasmarineños were forced to work here. A Japanese concentration camp was also established in this area. Now, this is considered to be a backbone of the economic progress of Dasmariñas. The presence of numerous factories in different industrial estates in this area, such as the First Cavite Industrial Estate, serves as the <b>working</b> <b>place</b> for the workers living in Dasmariñas and other towns of Cavite as well.|$|E

The planner fixes during this phase both methods and conditions for the latter work, considering a lot of ergonomical, technical and organsiational aspects, as well as restrictions of the particular problem. In the past this resulted in solutions being totally dependent on the qualification and the experience of the planner. Obviously the chance for getting relatively bad designed <b>working</b> <b>places</b> is increasing with the number of planning tasks to be performed concurrently. To ease the problems described above, our Institute has developed a computer aided program for the design of manual assembly places.

My <b>working</b> <b>place</b> was established {{in a corner of the}} warehouse, where Mr. Quinion could see me, when he chose to stand up on the bottom rail of his stool in the counting-house, and look at me through a window above the desk. Hither, on the first morning of my so auspiciously beginning life on my own account, the oldest of the regular boys was summoned to show me my business. His name was Mick Walker, and he wore a ragged apron and a paper cap. He informed me that his father was a bargeman, and walked, in a black velvet head-dress, in the Lord Mayor's Show. He also informed me that our principal associate would be another boy whom he introduced by the--to me--extraordinary name of Mealy Potatoes. I discovered, however, that this youth had not been christened by that name, but that it had been bestowed upon him in the warehouse, on account of his complexion, which was pale or mealy. Mealy's father was a waterman, who had the additional distinction of being a fireman, and was engaged as such at one of the large theatres; where some young relation of Mealy's--I think his little sister--did Imps in the Pantomimes.|$|E

40|$|Quantitaions of urinary cotinine, a major {{metabolite}} of nicotine, by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA), {{were performed}} in parallel with questionnaires consisting of items on smoking status, such as active and/or passive smokers, the number of cigarettes smoked, and {{the presence or absence}} of active smokers in the surroundings, for 504 employees in a light company. The volume and ventilation status of their <b>working</b> <b>places</b> were also surveyed. Smoking rates in the company were 56. 8 % in males and 23. 0 % in females. The cotinine values corrected by creatinine (cotinine-creatinine ratios, CCR) were remarkably higher (to the extent of 100 times) in active smokers than in non-smokers whether or not they felt exposure to ETS with a statistical significance (P＜ 0. 01). The CCR of the passive smokers were significantly higher in the office workers than in the factory workers whether or not active smokers were in their homes. In the office non-smokers, the CCR values became significantly higher in members who felt they were not exposed to any tobacco smoke than in members who felt they were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS); which increase could not be found in the factory non-smokers. The volumes and ventilation capacities of the,factory <b>working</b> <b>places</b> were 12. 7 times and 3. 3 times greater respectively than those of office <b>working</b> <b>places.</b> The results showed that the extent of exposure to ETS (actively and/or passively) were influenced by the volumes and the ventilation capacities of the <b>working</b> <b>places</b> and their accurate self-recognition of real exposure status to ETS. In the passive smokers, their ETS exposure seemed to be greater in the <b>working</b> <b>places</b> than in their homes. The present study has also shown that urinary cotinine measurement in parallel with suitable questionnaires is thus recommended to investigate the real status of both' active and passive exposure to ETS...|$|R
