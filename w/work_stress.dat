25|$|The initiative, called Postal Transformation, {{has been}} rolled {{out across the}} country from 2010-2017. This {{transformation}} saw {{a fundamental change in}} the work duties of letter carriers. Previously, the delivery of parcels, clearance and transfers to retail postal outlets and collection of mail from street letter boxes was carried out by the separate position of a mail service courier, while letter carriers delivered the mail through walking routes, utilizing public transit and taxis to travel to their work locations. Today, letter carrier routes are motorized and they are responsible for delivering parcels, mail, clearing and transfers at retail postal outlets, and collection of mail from street letter boxes. The additional duties have led to increased overtime, <b>work</b> <b>stress,</b> and injuries to employees who are facing greater fatigue and delivering mail in the dark; with many complaining that regular routes can no longer be completed in 8 hours, resulting in forced overtime and undelivered mail.|$|E
25|$|Most {{truck drivers}} are {{employed}} as over-the-road drivers, meaning they are hired to drive long distances {{from the place}} of pickup {{to the place of}} delivery. During the short times while they are in heavily polluted urban areas, being inside the cab of the truck contributes much to avoiding the inhalation of toxic emissions, and on the majority of the trip, while they are passing through vast rural areas where there is little air pollution, truck drivers in general enjoy less exposure to toxic emissions in the air than the inhabitants of large cities, where there is an increased exposure to emissions from engines, factories, etc., which may increase the risk of cancer and can aggravate certain lung diseases, such as asthma in the general public who inhabit these cities. However, the few drivers who are hired to drive only within urban areas do not have this advantage of spending more time away from toxic emissions that is enjoyed by over-the-road drivers. Other conditions affecting the health of truck drivers are for example vibration, noise, long periods of sitting, <b>work</b> <b>stress</b> and exhaustion. For drivers in developing countries there are additional risks because roads are in appalling conditions and accidents occur more frequently. Truck drivers are even a high-risk group for HIV-infection in those countries.|$|E

2500|$|Nursing {{professionals}} work in {{a stressful}} environment. According to a report conducted at Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network (LVHHN), nurses {{are at high risk}} for chronic burnout and stress. The nurse's roles are regarded as stress-filled based upon physical labor, human suffering, work hours, staffing, and interpersonal relationships. <b>Work</b> <b>stress</b> and burnout are significant concerns on both an individualistic and an organizational level. On an individualistic level, stress symptoms can contribute to health problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes. On an organizational level, <b>work</b> <b>stress</b> may lead to absenteeism and turnover, which impedes on the quality of care. According to a 2016 National Healthcare Retention & RN Staffing Report published by NSI Nursing Solutions, the national average turnover rate among nurses is 17.2%, a 0.8% increase from 2014. During the study, 27 nurses voluntarily participated in an 8-week-stress-reduction program called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Data analyses revealed that the MBSR program had significant benefits that could be categorized into two. “The early weeks of the training program conveyed that benefits were related to increased relaxation, slowing down, feeling a sense of peace, and learning to be in the present moment." [...] Results in the late weeks of the training program were linked to self-acceptance, self-awareness and self-care.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study is to present a detailed description of regulation of the the Occupational Safety and Health Act and investigate how well employees are being protected by the law. I will also explain with the help of statistic which employees that most often suffer from <b>work</b> related <b>stress</b> and the results is discussed from a gender perspective. Work related phycosocial health is a big issue in todays workplaces, and people who suffers from stress are supposed to be protecteded by the the Occupational Safety and Health Act, but is that really the truth? The Occupational Safety and Health Act is a frame law, meaning the law is general and needs binding regulations to define the rules, and there is no such act about <b>work</b> related <b>stress</b> at the moment. No employer has ever been convicted for <b>work</b> related <b>stress.</b> At the same time the Occupational Safety and Health Act explains that the employer has a responsibility to take arrangement to prevent mental illness in working life. It’s mostly women who suffer from <b>work</b> related <b>stress.</b> The most common reason for sick leave among women is caused by their mental health, and it often caused by organizational elements like a heavy work load or a minor self-monitoring. These elements commonly appear in occupations where the employee works with people. The fact that there is no binding regulation about <b>work</b> related <b>stress</b> can create problems, especially for women. The problems and effects that can occur will be treated and analyzed in this essay. Finally there will be a reflection about how binding regulations in the aspect of <b>work</b> related <b>stress</b> may help women get a better protection in the Occupational Safety and Health Act...|$|R
