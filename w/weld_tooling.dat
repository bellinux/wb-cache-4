40|$|Friction stir welding is an {{innovative}} weld process {{that continues to}} grow in use, in the commercial, defense, and space sectors. It produces high quality and high strength welds in aluminum alloys. The process consists of a rotating weld pin tool that plasticizes material through friction. The plasticized material is welded by applying a high weld forge force through the weld pin tool against the material during pin tool rotation. The high weld forge force is reacted against an anvil and a stout tool structure. A variation of friction stir welding currently being evaluated is self-reacting friction stir welding. Self-reacting friction stir welding incorporates two opposing shoulders on the crown and root sides of the weld joint. In self-reacting friction stir welding, the weld forge force is reacted against the crown shoulder portion of the weld pin tool by the root shoulder. This {{eliminates the need for}} a stout tooling structure to react the high weld forge force required in the typical friction stir weld process. Therefore, the self-reacting feature reduces tooling requirements and, therefore, process implementation costs. This makes the process attractive for aluminum alloy circumferential weld applications. To evaluate the application of self-reacting friction stir welding for aluminum alloy circumferential welding, a feasibility study was performed. The study consisted of performing a fourteen-foot diameter aluminum alloy circumferential demonstration weld using typical fusion <b>weld</b> <b>tooling.</b> To accomplish the demonstration weld, weld and tack weld development were performed and fourteen-foot diameter rings were fabricated. Weld development consisted of weld pin tool selection and the generation of a process map and envelope. Tack weld development evaluated gas tungsten arc welding and friction stir welding for tack welding rings together for circumferential welding. As a result of the study, a successful circumferential demonstration weld was produced leading the way for future circumferential weld implementation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ultrasonic welding is {{conducted}} using pure aluminum sheets to investigate {{effect of the}} transitional welding processes comprised of three transitional stages on {{the formation of the}} weld microstructure. In the first stage of ultrasonic welding, the relative motion mainly occurred between the workpieces, and a partially bonded region was observed in the weld interface. In the second stage, the relative motion at the weld interface was suppressed by the formation of the partially bonded region, while relative motion between the <b>weld</b> <b>tool</b> and the workpiece in contact with the <b>weld</b> <b>tool.</b> The relative motion at the weld tool/workpiece caused weld temperature rise with a penetration the <b>weld</b> <b>tool</b> edge. In the third stage, a plastic deformation zone generated by the relative motion at the weld tool/workpiece spread into the lower side of weld part as the welding time increased.

40|$|A small friction-stir-welding tool {{has been}} {{developed}} for use in tack welding of aluminum-alloy workpieces. It is necessary to tack-weld the workpieces in order to hold them together during friction stir welding because (1) in operation, a full-size friction-stir-welding tool exerts a large force that tends to separate the workpieces and (2) clamping the workpieces {{is not sufficient to}} resist this force. It is possible to tack the pieces together by gas tungsten arc welding, but the process can be awkward and time-consuming and can cause sufficient damage to necessitate rework.

This investigation characterized the x-ray environment due to operation of an in-vacuum electron beam <b>welding</b> <b>tool.</b> NASA, in {{a joint venture with}} the Russian Space Agency, was scheduled to perform a series of welding in space experiments on board the United States Space Shuttle. This series of experiments was named the International Space Welding Experiment (ISWE).

Two tests were scheduled, using the ISWE electron beam <b>welding</b> <b>tool,</b> to characterize the radiation exposure to an astronaut during the operation of the ISWE.

The ISWE hardware was returned to Ukraine before the issue of adequate shielding for the astronauts was verified.
