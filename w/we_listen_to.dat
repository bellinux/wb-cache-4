That they speak to us as part of something greater than us—greater than any alien force. And if you and I are powerless now, I {{want to believe that}} if <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves." [...] Despite their slim chance for success, Mulder declares, [...] "Maybe there's hope." ...|$|E
500|$|The Boston Globe heard {{echoes of}} The Rolling Stones' 1966 song [...] "Out of Time" [...] {{in the chorus}} of [...] "Ultraviolet". Entertainment Weekly called it the album's highlight, [...] "where Bono's soaring voice and the Edge's pointillistic guitar meld to create one of those {{uplifting}} moments <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> U2 for". [...] Cedarville University literature professor Scott Calhoun says of one lyrical portion of [...] "Ultraviolet", [...] "That's so evocative and works as beautiful writing away from the music. It can {{stand on its own}} on the page and, of course, it's even more effective when accompanied by the music." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{shifting}} {{point of}} view coincides with the movie's subject matter: filmmaking. The film begins {{with the end of}} a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera's focus in the first scene on Barton (who is mouthing the words spoken by actors offscreen), not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: [...] "hough <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> one scene, we watch another.... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the protagonist (his play) and the world outside it (what goes into creating a performance)".|$|E

[...] She salutes Black women, calling them [...] "precious jewels all", and profiles her friend Oprah Winfrey, who she compares to [...] "the desperate traveler who teaches us the most profound lesson and affords us the most exquisite skills". [...] Angelou defends her controversial support of Clarence Thomas as a Supreme Court justice in one of her essays. [...] In her final essay in the book, Angelou uses the story of the prodigal son to emphasize the value of solitude: [...] "In the silence <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> ourselves.

2500|$|As Bellini reports, he had {{problems}} with Tosi wanting changes {{to be made to}} a cavatina and a stretta in one scene, but he stuck to his own opinion, proving to be correct when he reported the audience's reaction to Florimo: [...] "the public was very happy with the entire opera, particularly with the second act". Overall, the first performance was even greater {{than it had been in}} Naples, and the opera was given a total of 21 times. However, critical reaction was not as positive as that of the audience: [...] "The second act is a long bore" [...] stated L'Eco di Milano, although the Gazzetta di Genova was more helpful, noting [...] "the more <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the style of the music, the more we appreciate its merit".|$|E
2500|$|Rashid {{found out}} {{that he was going to}} become a daddy in about 8 months. Stunned and confused, Rashid had life {{altering}} decisions to make with his girlfriend, Kim Jones. The situation led to the composition of his favourite cut on One Day... that offers a male slant on abortion. [...] "Retrospect for Life", produced by James Poyser and No I.D. featuring Lauryn Hill (who was due on the same day as Rashid's girlfriend), is the song that is the driving force behind the project. Rashid listens to [...] "Retrospect for Life" [...] today at the mastering session geeked, as if it were for the first time. He tells me as <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> L-Boogie wail the chorus, [...] "when I listen to the song now, I think about how precious her (Omoye's) life is".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of their debut album Yes in July 1969 for Atlantic Records, Yes resumed {{extensive}} touring across the UK. The line-up of the group at this time included lead vocalist Jon Anderson, guitarist Peter Banks, bassist Chris Squire, drummer Bill Bruford, and organist Tony Kaye. Towards the end of 1969, they booked time at Advision Studios in London during gaps between shows to record Time and a Word. In a November 1969 interview during a tour of Switzerland, Bruford talked about the album, saying Anderson was [...] "pouring out new numbers for us to play ... Usually he writes a tune and <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the tape and take it from there". At Advision, Yes were joined by producer Tony Colton, a friend of Anderson's who was also the singer of the rock band Heads Hands & Feet. Phil Carson, the European managing director of Atlantic and {{a fan of the}} band, brought in audio engineer Eddy Offord to assist Colton in the album's production because of his skills and hard work. Offord would become a key figure in the band's history in the 1970s as their producer and live sound mixer.|$|E

2500|$|Sanders {{does not}} {{regularly}} attend synagogue, and {{he works on}} Rosh Hashanah, a day when Jews typically take a holiday from work. He has attended yahrzeit observances {{in memory of the}} deceased, for the father of a friend, and he attended a Tashlikh, an atonement ceremony, with the mayor of Lynchburg on the afternoon of Rosh Hashanah in 2015. According to Sanders's close friend Richard Sugarman, a professor of religious studies at the University of Vermont, Sanders's Jewish identity is [...] "certainly more ethnic and cultural than religious". Deborah Dash Moore, a Judaic scholar at the University of Michigan, has said that Sanders has a particular type of [...] "ethnic Jewishness" [...] that is somewhat old-fashioned. Sanders's wife is Roman Catholic, and he has frequently expressed admiration for Pope Francis, saying that [...] "the leader of the Catholic Church is raising profound issues. It is important that <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> what he has said." [...] Sanders has said he feels [...] "very close" [...] to Francis's economic teachings, describing him as [...] "incredibly smart and brave". In April 2016, Sanders accepted an invitation from Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, an aide close to the pope, to speak at a Vatican conference on economic and environmental issues. While at the Vatican, Sanders met briefly with the pontiff.|$|E
2500|$|Author Michael Zager {{wrote that}} Pet Sounds resembles Spector's {{productions}} {{more than it}} does Rubber Soul, and that it recycles many of Spector's Wall of Sound production watermarks. Wilson talked of Spector's influence on his work, having learned how to produce records through attending his sessions, and in a 1988 interview, Wilson asserted that the album aspired to [...] "extend" [...] Spector's music, that [...] "in one sense of the word, we [...] were his messengers." [...] In Pet Sounds, Wilson sought to emulate Spector's Wall of Sound, driven by his fascination with [...] "combining one [...] to make another... It's amazing". Shortly before the album's release, Wilson spoke of recent popular music trends, saying [...] " [...] helped the Beach Boys evolve. <b>We</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> what's happening and it affects what we do too. The trends have influenced my work, but so has my own scene." [...] In 1996, Wilson said of his partnership with Asher: [...] "none of us looked back... We went forward, kind of like on our own little wavelength. It wasn't like we were thinking, 'Okay, let's beat Spector,' let's out-do Motown.' It was more what I would call exclusive collaboration not to specifically try to kick somebody's butt, but just {{to do it the}} way you really want it to be. That's what I thought we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2001, Fallon Bowman left Kittie. Bowman {{explained}} why {{she left the}} band, saying: [...] "I was unhappy with some things in the band so I felt that maybe {{it was time for}} me to depart. I think it was for the best". On October 30, 2001, Kittie released their second album Oracle. Sounding more aggressive than [...] "Spit", the album features elements of death metal and thrash metal. Morgan Lander noted how the band members were only 14 years old when writing their debut album and said [...] "We haven't written in 4 or 5 years." [...] She acknowledged a change in influence from their early days, stating, [...] "Then we listened to bands like Nirvana, Silverchair, and Alice in Chains. Now <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> stuff like Cannibal Corpse and Nile." [...] However, the band would continue to write in the same fashion by first composing the music and then using that [...] "as the backdrop behind the vocals." [...] The album Oracle was recorded with Morgan Lander as the sole guitarist. Fallon's position as guitarist was filled by Jeff Phillips who worked as Kittie's guitar technician. In 2002, Talena Atfield left the band and was replaced on bass by Jennifer Arroyo. In 2004, the group added guitarist Lisa Marx, and Jeff Phillips went to work full-time on his side project, Thine Eyes Bleed. On July 27, 2004, Kittie released their third studio album Until the End.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sound of}} the album was notably {{different}} than Forever as the female vocals and violins had disappeared and the band's focus had shifted away from melody towards more technicality and progressiveness, featuring more complex song structures and time signature changes. Remy Beauchamp elaborated, [...] "Basically, it was over three years between the recordings of both albums so within that time, the music <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> has changed. Also, we all improved on our instruments... The female vocals are just something we tried a long time ago. The song was actually written in 1994, and then every band started doing it {{so we decided to}} drop it. The violin is not out definitely though, we might be putting some on our next album but for 'Day Into Night', we wanted to have a good heavy album, no extras." [...] Bart said that [...] "the production is much better; we spent 3 months in the studio as opposed to a week and a half... Our budget helped as well - we basically spent ten times the amount that we spent on Forever..." [...] He also said, [...] "One thing that many fans asked about... was why there was no violin. At the time we wanted to distance ourselves from all the bands that filled space in their music with different instruments as opposed to writing good music that stood on its own. We did the violin thing five years ago when the idea was a new concept so we wanted to move in. In face, we did record a violin piece for the album but chose not to include it for the reason above. Too many bands with violins. We wanted Day into Night to be heavy and kick ass and not diluted by association." ...|$|E
