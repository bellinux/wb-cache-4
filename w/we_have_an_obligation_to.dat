The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative {{arguments from}} moral order have proposed that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists.

The welfare state, {{at least in the}} robust form endorsed by progressives, is rooted in an ethic of social membership.

Using the Yengeni incident as a springboard for my discussion, I focus on the moral question of the relative weight of two competing ethical claims. I weigh the claim that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> not to cause animals unnecessary pain against the claim by cultures that traditional practices, {{such as the one}} under discussion, are morally justifiable {{on the basis of the}} moral goods obtained through cultural identification and participation.

The second idea, expressed in critical race theory and feminist jurisprudence, is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> as <b>a</b> society and as scholars to attend to excluded voices. The juxtaposition of these two themes offers an opportunity to explore the relationship between classical philosophy and the American constitutional order.
