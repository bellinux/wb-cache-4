She said [...] "There {{was a sort of}} complacency before Fukushima and I don't think <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> have that complacency now".|$|E

2500|$|Lastly, in {{the late}} 1990s, a new Internet fad began, owing to simplistic {{software}} development kits such as the Japanese RPG Maker series (1988 onwards). Influenced by console RPGs and based mostly on the gameplay and style of the SNES and Sega Genesis games, {{a large group of}} young programmers and aficionados across the world began creating independent console-style computer RPGs and sharing them online. An early successful example was Corpse Party (1996), a survival horror indie game created using the RPG Maker engine. Much like the survival horror adventure games Clock Tower (1995 onwards) and later Haunting Ground (2005), the player characters in Corpse Party lack any means of defending themselves; the game also featured up to 20 possible endings. However, the game would not be released in Western markets until 2011. In an interview with GameDaily in 2007, MTVN's Dave Williams remarked that, [...] "Games like this [...] have been sort of under the radar for something that could be the basis of a business. We have the resources and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> invest more... I think it's {{going to be a great}} thing for the consumer." ...|$|E

[...] Believing that too many modern writers encouraged {{men and women to}} flee to unreason, decadence and barbarism, he condemned the trahisons des clercs of the twentieth century, and used his lectures and writing to campaign for a responsible use of intellectual freedom. [...] "One may question whether real civilisation is so safely afloat," [...] he wrote in his last published letter (1966), [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> use our pens for boring holes in the bottom of it." [...] The writer or artist serving up [...] "slapdash nightmares out of his Unconscious", [...] "in an age morbidly avid of uncivilised irreticence", not only exhibited his own neuroses, but fed neurosis in others. Literary critics, too, had to take more responsibility. [...] "Much cant gets talked," [...] he noted of the Structuralists, [...] "by critics who care more for the form and organisation of a work than for its spirit, its content, its supreme moments." [...] The serious note in his criticism was counterbalanced by wit and urbanity, by lively anecdote and quotation, and by a gift for startling imagery and epigram.|$|E

40|$|The era {{following}} September 11, 2001 will {{be remembered}} as the golden age of law enforcement, the age of a bold paradigm shift inspired by the great challenges we face. It is instructive first to reflect on the old paradigm: as law enforcement agencies, we moved like swimmers in different lanes, all going the same direction with the same mission, yet also working by and for ourselves. Each criminal justice agency dealt with its own issues, staying—for the most part—in its own lane. Then, 9 / 11 changed everything. Indeed, it is our turn to be the greatest generation. Just as World War II fundamentally changed the world, so too have the events of 9 / 11. It is now our turn to rise to the challenge. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> no longer <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> fight crime independently; rather, we must build partnerships across agency lines. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> no longer <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> limit access to criminal intelligence to only those officers in a particular agency; rather, we must share information across agency lines. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> no longer <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> react to crimes after they have taken place; instead, we must prevent them in the first place, just as the NYPD has done through its renowned CompStat crime fighting strategy. To become today’s greatest generation, we must fight crime strategically, and we must do so together...|$|R

This paper examines whether quantum resources can help us to delay those decisions until they can be made in an informed manner...|$|R
