It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E

The feudal {{system may be}} called the real life of the period {{of which we are}} treating, possessing its advantages and inconveniences, its virtues and its vices. Chivalry, on the contrary, is the ideal world, such as it existed in the imaginations of the Romance writers. Its essential character is devotion to woman and to honour.|$|E

25|$|In {{supporting}} an Austrian {{war with}} Serbia, Germany's leaders knew {{the risks of}} a general war. As the historian Fritz Fischer pointed out, this could be proven by Jagow's request to know the full itinerary of Wilhelm's North Sea cruise before the Austrian ultimatum was presented because:"Since we want to localize the conflict between Austria and Serbia, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> have the world alarmed by His Majesty’s returning prematurely; on the other hand, His Majesty must be within reach, in case unpredictable developments should force us to take important decisions, such as mobilization. His Majesty might perhaps spend {{the last days of}} his cruise in the Baltic".|$|E

25|$|Herodotus {{is neither}} a mere {{gatherer}} of data nor a simple teller of tales – he is both. While Herodotus is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events, this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative, elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study. Thus to understand what Herodotus is doing in the Histories, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> impose strict demarcations between the man as mythologist and the man as historian, or between the work as myth and the work as history. As James Romm has written, Herodotus worked under a common ancient Greek cultural assumption that the way events are remembered and retold (e.g. in myths or legends) produces a valid kind of understanding, even when this retelling is not entirely factual. For Herodotus, then, it takes both myth and history to produce truthful understanding.|$|E
500|$|Biographer William Taubman {{suggested}} that because Khrushchev was again unsuccessfully denounced while in Kiev, {{he must have}} known that some of the denunciations were not true and that innocent people were suffering. In 1939, Khrushchev addressed the Fourteenth Ukrainian Party Congress, saying [...] "Comrades, we must unmask and relentlessly destroy all enemies of the people. But <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> allow a single honest Bolshevik to be harmed. We must conduct a struggle against slanderers." ...|$|E

The school's {{president}} stated:"We live in a different era than when the Warriors nickname was selected in 1954. The perspective of time has shown us that our actions, intended or not, can offend others. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> knowingly act {{in a way that}} others will believe, based on their experience, to be an attack on their dignity as fellow human beings." [...] Also in 1994, St. John's University (New York) changed the name of its athletic teams from the Redmen to the Red Storm after the university was pressured by American Indian groups who considered Redmen a slur.|$|E

500|$|Edward the Confessor is {{depicted}} on a throne {{and wearing a}} crown and holding a sceptre in the first scene of the Bayeux Tapestry. In 1066, Edward died without an heir, and William the Conqueror emerged as the first Norman king of England following his victory over the English at the Battle of Hastings. Wearing a crown became {{an important part of}} WilliamI's efforts to cement his authority over his new territory and subjects. At his death in 1087, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reported: [...] " [...] kept great state … He wore his crown three times a year as often as he was in England … He was so stern and relentless … <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> forget the good order he kept in the land".|$|E
500|$|The chance {{expected}} by Saavedra came in May 1810, when two British ships came {{with news of}} the peninsular war. The previous January Seville was invaded, the Junta of Seville ceased working, and some members took refuge at Cadiz and Leon, the last undefeated Spanish provinces. The complete Spanish defeat seemed imminent. The viceroy tried to conceal the information by seizing all newspapers, {{but some of them}} were leaked into the possession of the revolutionaries. Colonel Viamonte called Saavedra and informed him of the news, requesting once again his military support. Saavedra agreed {{that it was a good}} context to proceed, and gave his famous answer: [...] "Gentlemen: now I say it is not only time, but <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> waste a single hour." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the matter}} of {{historical}} accuracy, Christopher Caldwell wrote in the Financial Times: [...] "Of course, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> mistake a feature film for a public television documentary", {{pointing out that the}} film should be treated as entertainment, not as a historical account of the time period it is set in. [...] "Django uses slavery the way a pornographic film might use a nurses' convention: as a pretext for what is really meant to entertain us. What is really meant to entertain us in Django is violence." [...] Richard Brody, however, wrote in The New Yorker that Tarantino's [...] "vision of slavery's monstrosity is historically accurate.... Tarantino rightly depicts slavery as no mere administrative ownership but a grievous and monstrous infliction of cruelty." ...|$|E

[...] The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated. Lincoln said as the war was ending: ...|$|E
500|$|In the Comines {{sector of}} the front there was an early fraternization between German and French {{soldiers}} in December 1914, during a short truce, and {{there are at least}} two other testimonials, from French soldiers, of similar behaviors in sectors where German and French companies opposed each other. [...] Gervais Morillon wrote to his parents: ‘The Boches waved a white flag and shouted [...] "Kamarades, Kamarades, rendez-vous." [...] When we didn’t move they came towards us unarmed, led by an officer. Although we are not clean they are disgustingly filthy. I am telling you this but don’t speak of it to anyone. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> mention it even to other soldiers.’ Gustave Berthier wrote: ‘On Christmas day the Boches made a sign showing they wished to speak to us.

500|$|Kennedy's {{campaign}} {{staff was}} disorganized and Kennedy was initially an ineffective campaigner. The Chappaquiddick incident {{emerged as a}} more significant issue than the staff had expected, with several newspaper columnists and editorials criticizing Kennedy's answers on the matter. In the January 1980 Iowa caucuses that initiated the primaries season, Carter demolished Kennedy by a 59–31 percent margin. Kennedy's fundraising immediately declined and his campaign had to downsize, but he remained defiant, saying [...] " [...] we'll see {{who is going to}} whip whose what." [...] Nevertheless, Kennedy lost three New England contests. Kennedy did form a more coherent message about why he was running, saying at Georgetown University: [...] "I believe <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> permit the dream of social progress to be shattered by those whose premises have failed." [...] However, concerns over Chappaquiddick and issues related to personal character prevented Kennedy from gaining the support of many people who were disillusioned with Carter. During a St. Patrick's Day Parade in Chicago, Kennedy had to wear a bullet-proof vest due to assassination threats, and hecklers yelled [...] "Where's Mary Jo?" [...] at him. In the key March 18 primary in Illinois, Kennedy failed to gain the support of Catholic voters, and Carter crushed him, winning 155 of 169 delegates.|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} significant soul truths {{and ourselves}} {{in relation to}} them, sometimes one must approach them indirectly. As Palmer (2004) suggested, If soul truth is to be spoken and heard, it must be approached “on the slant. ” I do <b>not</b> mean <b>we</b> <b>must</b> be coy, speaking evasively about subjects that make us uncomfortable, which weakens us and our relationships. But soul truth is so powerful that <b>we</b> <b>must</b> allow ourselves to approach it, and it to approach us, indirectly. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> invite, <b>not</b> command the soul to speak. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> allow, <b>not</b> force, ourselves to listen. (p. 92) Through poetry, art, literature and music, people explore such truths both through reflection and conversation, and the intellect combines with {{the heart and soul}} in an exploration of the depth and paradox of these truths.
