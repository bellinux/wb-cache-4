40|$|This paper {{describes}} factor analyzed voice {{models for}} realizing various voice characteristics in the HMM-based speech synthesis. The eigenvoice method can synthesize speech with arbitrary voice characteristics by interpolating representative HMM sets. However, {{the objective of}} PCA is to accurately reconstruct each speaker-dependent HMM set, {{and this is not}} equivalent to estimating models <b>which</b> <b>represent</b> <b>training</b> data accurately. To overcome this problem, we propose a general speech model which generates speech utterances with various voice characteristics directly. In the proposed method, the HMM states, factors representing voice characteristics and contextual decision trees are simultaneously optimized within a unified framework...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{self-organizing}} map (SOM) is a commonly used clustering algorithm, <b>which</b> <b>represents</b> <b>training</b> data, by codebook vectors and creates an ordered map. A typical application is {{the classification of}} feature vectors. Though topology preservation represents a totally new principle {{in the domain of}} vector quantisation and function approximation the training is reasonably fast [Gop 93 b]. The training algorithm was inspired by cortical columns and mutual activation of columns and regions in the cortex. Neurons and cortical columns do not change their activity instantly. They are increasing or decreasing the activity in a smooth way. A closer look on the human cortex reveals also dynamic properties which may lead to completely new properties of artificial neural nets. This comportment is supposed to produce attentional effects. 1. 1 Dynamical Behaviour The SOM takes into account cooperative aspects of neighbouring neurons by using individual activation for a...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPLS {{initially}} creates uncorrelated latent variables {{which are}} linear combinations {{of the original}} input vectors Xi, where weights are used to determine linear combinations, which are proportional to the covariance. Secondly, a least squares regression is then performed on the subset of extracted latent variables that lead to a lower and biased variance on transformed data. This process, leads to a lower variance estimate of the regression coefficients {{when compared to the}} Ordinary Least Squares regression approach. Classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA), linear PLS and kernel ridge regression (KRR) techniques are well known shrinkage estimators designed to deal with multi- collinearity, which can be a serious problem. That is, multi-collinearity can dramatically influence the effectiveness of a regression model by changing the values and signs of estimated regression coefficients given different but similar data samples, thereby leading to a regression model <b>which</b> <b>represents</b> <b>training</b> data reasonably well, but generalizes poorly to validation and test data. We explain how to address these problems, which is followed by performing a PLS hypotheses driven preliminary research study and sensitivities analysis by not doing a combinatorial analysis as PLS will eliminate the unnecessary variables using a microarray colon cancer data set. Research studies as well as preliminary results are described in the results section...|$|R
30|$|It is {{important}} to keep in mind that self-organizing maps as defined by [19] only use mappings from that map, <b>which</b> <b>represents</b> the <b>training</b> items (i.e. the sensorimotor state maps in our case) towards the self-organizing map (the phonetic map in the case of our modeling approach). But Hebbian learning in principle allows the emergence of neural connections between synchronously activated neurons in both directions. Thus, in our modeling approach we assume that the neural mapping between state maps and phonetic map is bidirectional. Thus, neural connections occur and increase in connectivity in both directions, i.e. from state maps towards the phonetic map and vice versa. The increase in connectivity directly reflects the degree of activation of the model neurons within each training step.|$|R

40|$|Background: Achieving {{competence}} in transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) requires {{a clear understanding}} of cardiac anatomy as well as an ability to correlate two-dimensional (2 D) echocardiographic images with the three-dimensional (3 D) structures <b>which</b> they <b>represent.</b> <b>Training</b> in the technique is a long process, which may also be hampered by insufficient access to teaching in the clinical environment. These challenges would be met by a simulator which demonstrates detailed cardiac anatomy with a previously unavailable degree of accuracy. Methods: A TOE simulator system was created by collaboration {{with a wide range of}} clinical specialists and a post-production company skilled in the generation of computer graphics and special effects for the film industry. The core of the system is an animated, accurate and detailed virtual heart. Echocardiographic simulation was developed to provide a real-time display of ultrasound images alongside the 3 D anatomical correlate of the imaging plane. Results: A freely interactive animated model of the heart was created as the basis for ultrasound simulation. Creation of a mannequin simulator which drives the software allowed reproduction of the practical experience of the TOE procedure. Conclusions: Partnership with groups with a wide diversity of skills can result in a simulator teaching tool of high fidelity...|$|R
40|$|Geographic {{information}} systems (GIS) {{are dependent on}} accurate and up-to-date data sets. The manual revision of GIS data is very cost and time consuming. On the other hand more and more high resolution satellite systems are under development and will be operational soon - thus high resolution remote sensing data will be available. In this paper a fully automated approach for verification of GIS objects using remote sensing data is presented. In a first step a supervised maximum likelihood classification is performed. It is necessary that the training areas for the supervised classification are derived automatically {{in order to develop}} a fully automated approach. The already existing GIS data are used to compute pixel masks (<b>which</b> <b>represent</b> the <b>training</b> areas) for each object class. In order to find inconsistencies between the GIS data and the remote sensing data the result of the classification has to be matched with the GIS data. It is shown that different approaches are needed when dealing either with area objects or with line objects. Examples on both approaches are presented. The automatic verification was tested with ATKIS data sets and DPA high resolution remote sensing data. ATKIS is the German topographic cartographic spatial database and DPA (Digital Photogrammetric Assembly) is an optical airborne imaging system for real time data collection. This paper shows the results of the automatic verification of ATKIS objects represented in DPA data...|$|R

40|$|In many {{recent studies}} in the {{literature}} have described and commented on ‚Äúcompetency based resident training‚Äù in pathology. According to this model, competencies are subclassified in 6 main categories: Patient care, medical knowledge, practice based learning and improvement, interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, and systems based practice. Assessment of competency forms {{the main component of}} this model. Under the framework of Ankara Society of Pathology, a working group, composed of 11 residents, 6 of <b>which</b> <b>representing</b> the <b>Training</b> and Research Hospitals of Ministry of Health and the rest representing the university hospitals in Ankara, was established in order to participate in the think-tank about resident training in pathology. A questionnaire, composed of 12 questions, was prepared. According to this questionnaire, the number of trainers in the university hospitals is much higher than in the commercial hospitals. While the total number of cases and cases per resident do not differ between the university and commercial hospitals, microscopes used for the educational purposes are significantly less in the commercial hospitals, that is due to less number of binocular microscopes. The amount of resident training program, which consists of intra and intersectional meetings, are similar in the university and commercial hospitals, however, theoretic lectures are given only in 3 departments. Residents working in the university hospitals have obviously heavier burden than in the commercial hospitals. Lastly, residents generally exclaimed that the time dedicated to the macroscopy training is less sufficient than time used for the microscopy training. The factors affecting the training of resident in pathology are divided into two main groups: 1) Factors directly affecting training (quality of trainer, time dedicated for education, feed back, eg.) and 2) Conditions which waste residents' time. For instant, workload which does need qualified staff and increases the burden on residents may be reassigned to medical secretary or pathology assistants; therefore energy of residents can be saved for educational activities. Optimization of physical working conditions, assortment of training programs, rotation in lacking subjects and consultations will enhance the quality of the education of the resident. Feedback assessment of trainer and trainee {{is an essential part of}} a training program. In conclusion, an ideal resident from the resident's point of view is the person who is endowed with medical and pathological knowledge, orderly interrelates with staff, professionally communicates with clinicians, manages a laboratory and is trained hard to achieve all the above mentioned competencies...|$|R
