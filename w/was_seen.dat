5|$|First World {{commentators}} {{had already}} speculated that Brezhnev had {{died when he}} failed to sign a message of congratulations to José Eduardo dos Santos, the President of Angola, for the Angolan Independence Day. This was a breach of protocol, and, as Brezhnev had earlier signed messages to all Soviet-aligned heads of state, the absence of his signature <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> as suspicious. The delay in declaring the death of Brezhnev <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> by some First World commentators as proof of the ongoing power struggle in the Soviet leadership over who would succeed him. Konstantin Chernenko <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> as the most likely candidate to succeed Brezhnev.|$|E

By May, his approval rating had fallen to 57%, down from 80% just two years earlier, while unemployment increased.
