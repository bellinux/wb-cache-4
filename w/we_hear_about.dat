But why should <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or what do you suppose? Or, I mean, it's not relevant.

2500|$|Newspaper reports claimed Douglas Muggeridge, {{controller}} of Radio 1 in {{the early}} 1970s, was aware of allegations against Savile, {{and asked for a}} report in 1973. Derek Chinnery, controller of Radio 1 from 1978 to 1985, recalled an occasion when he confronted Savile, saying [...] "I asked, 'what's all this, these rumours <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> you Jimmy?' And he said, 'that's all nonsense'. There was no reason to disbelieve." [...] Michael Grade told Channel 4 News that during his time at the BBC he had [...] "fleetingly" [...] heard rumours about Savile, but described claims of a cover-up as [...] "ludicrous". The BBC said no evidence of allegations of misconduct or actual misconduct by Savile had been found in its files and denied there had been a cover-up of his activities.|$|E
2500|$|On January 11, 1997, a Los Angeles Times {{article titled}} [...] "Cautionary Concert in Rocker's Memory", writer Jerry Crowe quoted No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal as saying, [...] "Obviously, it's {{going to be}} very {{emotional}} because you're there playing a show to commemorate a good friend who died and died for very wrong reasons. But you're also there to change things for the future and prevent stuff like that from ever happening again. A lot of times <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> musicians using drugs and it's so blasé and clichéd. You just kind of say, 'Oh, he'll be fine. Somebody will take care of him.' But that's not true. It's important for every single one of us to stand up and say, 'Enough of this shit.' It's time to make a difference".|$|E
2500|$|Ian Hislop, {{editor of}} the British satirical {{magazine}} Private Eye, stated, [...] "I am appalled and shocked by this horrific attack– a murderous attack on free speech {{in the heart of}} Europe.... Very little seems funny today." [...] The editor of Titanic, a German satirical magazine, declared, [...] "e are scared when <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> such violence. However, as a satirist, we are beholden to the principle that every human being has the right to be parodied. This should not stop just because of some idiots who go around shooting". Many cartoonists from around the world responded to the attack on Charlie Hebdo by posting cartoons relating to the shooting. Among them was Albert Uderzo, who came out of retirement at age 87 to depict his character Astérix supporting Charlie Hebdo. In Australia, what was considered the iconic national cartoonist's reaction was a cartoon by David Pope in the Canberra Times, depicting a masked, black-clad figure with a smoking rifle standing poised over a slumped figure of a cartoonist in a pool of blood, with a speech balloon showing the gunman saying, [...] "He drew first." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bianca's rape {{was heavily}} debated; viewers who despised the storyline argued the rape as [...] "punishment" [...] for her sexuality, and as unnecessary; others {{felt that it}} realistically {{captured}} what gay women sometimes face from men who want to force themselves on lesbians. When GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was asked by Metro Weekly why GLAAD sent out an action alert voicing their concern over the rape of Bianca, but two days later sent out another release which seemed to support how the storyline was told, Joan M. Garry, {{executive director of the}} organization, responded that they had [...] "some concerns" [...] about [...] and [...] "that the broader context of the [...] genre kind of needs to be taken into account." [...] Metro Weekly felt that this did not answer their question. They wanted to know why there was a sudden reversal in GLAAD's statement, specifically citing that GLAAD's second press release spoke of rape experience for lesbians and how men who rape lesbians not only engage in gender based acts of violence, but in acts of hate violence, and that this release was supportive of how Bianca's rape storyline was told, as opposed to GLAAD's first press release on the matter. Garry said she felt that their first press release concerning Bianca's rape was premature. Metro Weekly countered by asking what is the [...] "actual process" [...] GLAAD uses to select what to criticize, what raises their organization's red flags. [...] "There's a whole host of input we receive about things as <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> them, as we see them in script form, as we see them in pilots," [...] Garry relayed. [...] "We have a strong team of program folks who represent different regions around the country, different communities. We get an awful lot of stuff that comes across the transom via our website raising concerns. And we did get quite a number of concerns coming over email, particularly about All My Children." [...] Garry continued, [...] "So it's basically community feedback, {{as well as some of}} our own observations and perceptions. Combine that with conversations that we have with folks that are actually producing the images and we really try to work our way through those different opinions and shape a position we think makes sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Iron Man" [...] was {{originally}} entitled [...] "Iron Bloke"; upon hearing the main guitar riff {{for the first}} time, Osbourne remarked that it sounded [...] "like a big iron bloke walking around". The title was later changed to [...] "Iron Man" [...] as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. [...] The riff to [...] "Iron Man" [...] is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that [...] "...Tony Iommi {{turned out to be}} one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away." [...] Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. He is rendered mute, unable verbally to warn people of his time of the impending destruction. His attempts to communicate are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and have his revenge on mankind, causing the destruction seen in his vision. [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands [...] "it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life." [...] In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne concurs: [...] "It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday... And suddenly, you know, <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet. [...] "You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world," [...] Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, [...] "and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' about the things that I wanted to talk about political stuff so that's what inspired me." ...|$|E

6000|$|The last {{instance}} of the intelligence of insects which I will give is something almost too wonderful to believe, and yet the statement is made by a Dr. Lincecum, who studied the habits of the insect in question for twelve years, and his investigations {{were published in the}} Journal of the Linnæan Society. Dr. Lincecum says, that in Texas there is an ant called by him the Agricultural Ant, which not only lays up stores of grain, but prepares the soil for the crop; plants the seed (of a certain plant called ant-rice); keeps the ground free from weeds; and finally reaps the harvest, and separating the chaff from the grain, packs away the latter, and throws the chaff outside of the plantation. In [...] "Wood's Bible Animals" [...] you can read a full account of this ant, and I think that after hearing of its exploits, we can believe almost anything that <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> the intelligence of insects.|$|E
6000|$|Dear Martin,--"How {{individuals}} found religious consolation {{from the}} creeds of ancient Greece and Rome" [...] is, as you quote C. O. Muller, [...] "a very curious question." [...] It is odd {{that while we}} have countless books on the philosophy and the mythology and the ritual of the classic peoples, <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> their religion in the modern sense scarcely anything from anybody. We know very well what gods they worshipped, and what sacrifices they offered to the Olympians, and what stories they told about their deities, and about the beginnings of things. We know, too, in a general way, that the gods were interested in morality. They would all punish offences in their own department, at least {{when it was a}} case of numine laeso, when the god who protected the hearth was offended by breach of hospitality, or when the gods invoked to witness an oath were offended by perjury.|$|E
60|$|That is {{the sort}} of boy he is. How I used to hate him! If he has a proper sort of father, then he goes to college. He does no work: {{there is no need for}} him to work: {{everything}} seems to come to him. That was another grievance of mine against him. I always had to work a good deal, and very little came of it. He fools around doing things that other men would be sent down for; but in his case the professors love him for it all the more. He {{is the sort}} of man who can't do wrong. A fortnight before the examination he ties a wet towel round his head. That is all <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> it. It seems to be the towel that does it. Maybe, if the towel is not quite up to its work, he will help things on by drinking gallons of strong tea. The tea and the towel combined are irresistible: the result is always the senior wranglership.|$|E
