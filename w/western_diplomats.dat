5|$|Before Gorbachev's {{visit to}} Washington, D.C., {{for the third}} summit in 1987, the Soviet leader {{announced}} his intention to pursue significant arms agreements. The timing of the announcement led <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats</b> to contend that Gorbachev was offering major concessions to the United States on the levels of conventional forces, nuclear weapons, and policy in Eastern Europe. He and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I; Reagan insisted that {{the name of the}} treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.|$|E
5|$|Book reviewers {{found the}} criticisms {{constructive}} and the writing sincere. His style focuses less on numbers and statistics, {{and more on}} connecting decisions by UN officials and <b>western</b> <b>diplomats</b> to consequences {{on the ground in}} Africa. His eyewitness accounts are said to be candid and emotional. The book spent seven weeks at #1 on The Globe and Mails Nonfiction Bestseller List. A second edition was released in June 2006. The Canadian Booksellers Association awarded its Libris Award for non-fiction book of the year to Race Against Time and its Author of the Year Award to Lewis in 2006.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{a senior}} <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat,</b> {{hundreds}} of thousands of ballots for Hamid Karzai were from as many as 800 fake polling sites where no one had actually voted. The <b>diplomat</b> and another <b>Western</b> official also said that Karzai supporters took over approximately 800 actual polling centers on election day and used them to fraudulently report tens of thousands of ballots for Karzai. The <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat</b> said: [...] "This was fraud en masse." [...] In Karzai's home province, Kandahar, preliminary results indicated that more than 350,000 ballots had been turned in to be counted, but Western officials estimated that only about 25,000 people had actually voted in the whole province.|$|R
50|$|The Saudi Interior Ministry {{issued a}} {{statement}} claiming 41 hostages had been rescued by the commandos. According to a <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat</b> the hostages had been hiding {{in parts of the}} complex to avoid being killed by the gunmen.|$|R
5|$|Humanitarian {{workers and}} foreign {{military}} observers had suspicions that the Croats deliberately abandoned Jajce, {{as well as}} territories lost in Operation Corridor 92, to the VRS {{in exchange for the}} Prevlaka Peninsula south of Dubrovnik. Even though Croatia and several <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats</b> denied this claim, European Community envoy David Owen urged the UN to impose sanctions against Croatia. The suspicion was fueled by an October 1992 agreement between Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and Yugoslav President Dobrica Ćosić to withdraw the JNA from Prevlaka. However, the JNA withdrawal from Croatian soil had also {{been a part of the}} Vance plan, which was accepted by both Croatia and Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|Within hours, {{suspected}} KLA gunmen {{attacked a}} Serb-owned café in Peć, killing six unarmed Serb youths. <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats</b> suspected {{the attack was}} carried out in retaliation for the ambush, though the KLA denied responsibility. Several days later, Yugoslav authorities returned the bodies of all but three of the fallen militants following mediation by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The militants were given heroes' funerals in a rebel-held area, in a ceremony attended by thousands of ethnic Albanians, including other KLA fighters. In January 1999, the KLA abducted eight VJ personnel, who were later exchanged for the nine militants captured in the ambush.|$|E
5|$|Pakistani {{intelligence}} {{officials said they}} found letters from Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, after taking control of Lal Masjid. They were written to Abdul Rashid Ghazi and Abdul Aziz Ghazi, directing the brothers and militants to conduct an armed revolt. Government sources believe {{that as many as}} 18 foreign fighters from Uzbekistan, Egypt, and Afghanistan had arrived weeks before the final confrontation and established firing ranges to teach the students, including children, how to handle weapons properly. Diplomats were surprised by how quickly al-Zawahiri condemned the attack on the mosque and called on Pakistanis to rise up against Musharraf's government. Officials blamed the presence of foreign fighters for the breakdown of negotiations, as they seemed about to reach a deal to end the standoff peacefully. According to government sources and <b>western</b> <b>diplomats,</b> the Al-Qaeda fighters in the mosque sought martyrdom instead.|$|E

50|$|The National Electoral Commission placed turnout at 63.29%, {{although}} a <b>western</b> <b>diplomat</b> in Gabon {{said that it}} was probably about 30 - 35%. Low turnout had been widely anticipated by observers due to the popular feeling that Bongo would inevitably win the elections.|$|R

5|$|Saddam Hussein {{claimed that}} Aflaq had {{converted}} to Islam {{prior to his}} death – according to nameless <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats.</b> This claim was later disputed by nameless members of Aflaq's own family - although Aflaq's son Iyad confirmed that his father thought about conversion already in 1980. Upon his disputed conversion {{he had taken the}} first name of Ahmad. According to the German orientalists Martin Robbe and Gerhard Höpp the conversion happened before 1988. Even so, Aflaq was given an Islamic funeral. For the Berkley Center, Aflaq's disputed conversion is considered by anonymous members of his family as a tool used by Saddam Hussein to disassociate Ba'athism from Christianity. The tomb constructed on the orders of Hussein was later used by American soldiers after the 2003 American invasion of Iraq as a military barracks for troops stationed within the Green Zone.|$|E
5|$|Józef Piłsudski, Polish commander-in-chief, {{determined}} that regaining control of Vilnius, whose population consisted mostly of Poles and Jews, {{should be a}} priority of the renascent Polish state. He {{had been working on}} plans to take control of Vilnius since at least March; he gave preliminary orders to prepare a push in that direction—and counter an expected Soviet westward push—on March 26. One of Piłsudski's objectives was to take control of Vilnius before <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats</b> at the Paris Peace Conference could rule on whom the city, demanded by various factions, should be given to. The action was not discussed with Polish politicians or the government, who at that time were more concerned with the situation on the southern Polish–Ukrainian front. By early April, when members of the Kresy Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Kresów) Michał Pius Römer, Aleksander Prystor, Witold Abramowicz, and Kazimierz Świtalski met with Pilsudski, stressing the plight of occupied Vilnius and its inhabitants' need for self-government, Piłsudski was ready to move.|$|E

25|$|Chinese troops {{could not}} move any further into the valley and were forced to away from the valley. By 1987, Beijing's {{reaction}} {{was similar to that}} in 1962 and this prompted many <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats</b> to predict war. However, Indian foreign minister N.D. Tiwari and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi travelled to Beijing to negotiate a mutual de-escalation.|$|E
25|$|In late 1941 {{and early}} 1942, <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats</b> and journalists {{received}} scattered information about Nazi massacres of {{many thousands of}} Jews in German-occupied Poland and Russia. However, the news was difficult to confirm. In June 1942, Ignacy Schwarzbart, one of two Jewish representatives on the Polish National Council of the Polish government-in-exile, {{held a press conference}} with WJC officials in London, where it was stated that an estimated one million Jews had already been murdered by the Germans.|$|E
25|$|With {{the turning}} tide against Poland, Piłsudski's {{political}} power had been weakened and his opponents, including Roman Dmowski {{had risen to}} power, but he had regained it as the Soviet forces were approaching Warsaw. The government of Leopold Skulski had resigned and new prime minister Stanisław Grabski had transferred all power to the Rada Obrony Państwa (Council of Country's Defence) which consisted of Naczelnik Państwa (the title of Józef Piłsudski), Marshall of the Sejm, prime minister, 3 ministers, 3 army's representatives and 10 members of the parliament. Grabski's government supported by the <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats</b> attempted to restart peace negotiations with the Soviets, but their attempts were completely ignored by the Soviet Side. Stanisław Grabski resigned and a new government was formed by Wincenty Witos.|$|E
5000|$|He became {{chairman}} of the PDP Board of Trustees, with control over nominations for governmental positions and even policy and strategy.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the voting}} day, top {{election}} official Zekria Barakzai estimated the voter turnout across the country at around 40–50%. One <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat</b> slapped aside 50 percent as a [...] "joke". On August 21, New York Times [...] reported that overall turnout was expected to be about 40%. On August 26, The Daily Telegraph reported that turnout may have been little more than 35% nationwide and was less than 10% in some districts of Helmand and Kandahar.|$|R
25|$|This gave Austrians {{the idea}} to dig a canal to connect the Danube with the Black Sea at the {{shortest}} point before the Delta, between Rasova or Cernavodă (Bogaz Köi) and Constanța (Küstendjie), and a parallel railway. The Austrian project, however, {{was rejected by the}} Ottoman Porte. <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats</b> and newspapers accused the Russian government that through bribing and intimidation, it determined the Ottoman officials to reject the proposal of Szechenyi's company. In 1839, Széchenyi got the approval of his and Ottoman governments to ensure the transport of goods and people without getting to Sulina by a transshipment on dry land. Carts and coaches made a 7–8 hour trip from Cernavodă to Constanța, where people and goods were boarding other ships for Istanbul. The enterprise was scrapped after 4 years due to non-profitability because of a low number of passengers, high cost of transport, and poor conditions of accosting in the unfit roadstead of the port of Constanța.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 9, 1850, the Báb {{was taken to the}} {{courtyard}} of the barracks in which he was being held, where thousands of people had gathered to watch his execution. The Báb and Anís were suspended on a wall and a large firing squad of Christian soldiers prepared to shoot. Numerous eye-witness reports, including those of <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats,</b> recount the result. The order was given to fire and the barracks square filled with musket smoke. When it cleared, the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and his companion stood there unharmed; the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the rope suspending them from the wall. There was a great commotion, many in the crowd believing the Báb had ascended to heaven or simply disappeared. But the soldiers subsequently found the Báb {{in another part of the}} barracks, completely unharmed, giving his final instructions to his secretary. He and Anis were tied up for execution a second time, a second firing squad of Muslim soldiers was ranged in front of them, and a second order to fire was given. This time, the Báb and his companion were killed. In Bábí and Bahá'í tradition, the failure of the first firing squad to kill the Báb is believed to have been a miracle. Their remains were dumped outside the gates of the town to be eaten by animals.|$|E
500|$|Coalition and Afghan {{authorities}} {{continued their}} efforts to win over Taliban sympathizers. However a [...] "miscommunication between authorities" [...] created some tension. In late December, two <b>western</b> <b>diplomats</b> were expelled from Afghanistan. Governor Assadullah Wafa accused them of holding secret talks with the Taliban and proposing bribes to them; the secret talks were denied as a misunderstanding by a UN spokesperson. In January 2008, Mullah Abdul Salaam was appointed governor of Musa Qala district by the Afghan government, a gesture that was intended to encourage other Taliban commanders to change sides.|$|E

The information was immediately denied in Russian media. The daily then released an audio of the claimed conversation, but the voice reportedly did not sound like Bogdanov's. Other sources, including a <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat,</b> said they had heard Maher lost a leg.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s, the Soviets {{used the}} term [...] "ethnic cleansing" [...] to {{describe}} the inter-ethnic violence in Nagorno-Karabakh. At around the same time, the Yugoslav media used it to describe what they alleged was an Albanian nationalist plot to force all Serbs to leave Kosovo. It was widely popularized by the Western media during the Bosnian War (1992-95). The first recorded mention of its use in the Western media {{can be traced back}} to an article in The New York Times dated 15 April 1992, in a quote by an anonymous <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat.</b>|$|R
500|$|Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau said Kosygin {{was like}} [...] "Khrushchev without the rough edges, a fatherly {{man who was}} the forerunner of Mikhail Gorbachev". He noted that Kosygin was willing to discuss issues so long that the Soviet {{position}} was not tackled head-on. Former United States Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said that Kosygin was devoted, nearly fanatically, to his work. Kosygin was viewed by <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats</b> as a pragmatist [...] "with a glacial exterior who was orthodox if not rigid". Andrei Sakharov, a Soviet dissident, believed Kosygin to be [...] "the most intelligent and toughest man in the Politburo".|$|E
500|$|According to Albanian journalists, villages {{near the}} site of the ambush {{remained}} sealed off by Yugoslav forces {{for the remainder of the}} day. Within hours of the ambush, the KLA vowed revenge. That evening, suspected KLA gunmen entered a Serb-owned café in Peć and opened fire on the patrons, killing six Serb youths. <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats</b> suspected that the attack was carried out by the KLA in retribution for the ambush. The KLA denied responsibility; the journalist Tim Judah suggests that the attack may have been carried out by a rogue unit. The shooting appalled foreign emissaries, and at a meeting with Milošević the following day, Holbrooke condemned it as an act of terrorism and described the situation in Kosovo as [...] "very grave". Milošević issued a separate statement accusing the international community of failing to prevent attacks on Serb civilians, stating: [...] "The terrorist gangs have not ceased attacking the army, the police, and inhabitants of Kosovo." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{captured}} militants {{were initially}} {{taken to a}} jail in Prizren, and later transported to a military prison in Niš. On January 8, 1999, the KLA ambushed a convoy carrying rations to VJ personnel in Kosovska Mitrovica, taking eight Yugoslav soldiers hostage. U.S. officials negotiated the soldiers' release five days later. In return, on January 23, Yugoslav authorities freed the nine militants. Almost simultaneously, the KLA released five elderly Serb civilians that it had taken hostage two days earlier. Yugoslav officials insisted that the two events were not linked. The KLA's taking of civilian hostages drew condemnation from <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats,</b> including {{the head of the}} KVM, William Walker, who told reporters: [...] "...I think it was a very unwise and uncivilized thing for them to do to kidnap civilians." [...] Upon being released, the militants alleged they were mistreated and beaten while in custody, and vowed to avenge the deaths of their fellow fighters.|$|E
5000|$|Iran {{started to}} work closer with the KDP against Saddam's Iraq, and by 1983 the threat of an Iranian {{incursion}} into Iraq via Kurdistan became a real one. The KDP allowed Iran to seize the famous Iran-Iraq border crossing of Haji Omaran, a move that one <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat</b> called [...] "a stab in the back Saddam will never forget". Subsequently, Saddam gained his vengeance on the Barzani clan. 8,000 Barzani males - including pro-government [...] "jash" [...] - were abducted and paraded {{through the streets of}} Baghdad before being executed.|$|R
5000|$|On 30 June 2012 voter {{registration}} for the 2014 elections began in Suva. A {{few days later}} a <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat</b> confirmed that Fiji was on-schedule for elections in 2014: [...] "It seems fairly clear now {{that there will be}} elections of some description in Fiji in 2014. The real question {{is the extent to which}} those elections meet minimal international standards for being free and fair. Crucial to answering that question is seeing whether everyone is allowed to compete, and the media and civil society are able to operate in a minimally unimpeded manner." ...|$|R
500|$|Bill Law of the BBC News {{said the}} [...] "recommendations if {{implemented}} in full would effectively return {{the country to}} a state of martial law". An unnamed <b>western</b> <b>diplomat</b> said the recommendations timing was likely due to 14 August protest plans and the increasing violence. Marc Jones said that many of the recommendations were already in place. [...] "Thirty-one Bahrainis were stripped of their citizenship back in November 2012, {{and there has been a}} de facto ban on protests in Manama since last year," [...] he added and listed other examples of what he called [...] "reactionary laws" [...] already in place.|$|R
