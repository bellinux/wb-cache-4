40|$|The {{number of}} {{children}} walking <b>to</b> <b>school</b> {{is at an all-time}} low and car use on the rise.

Walking <b>to</b> <b>school</b> would not only make for healthier kids, it would reduce traffic and create a healthier, safer environment but we still drive our <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> <b>school.</b> This paper describes the initial design and development of UKKO, a novel persuasive game to encourage walking <b>to</b> <b>school</b> and engagement with local data. UKKO uses real time environmental data captured by the player to create a virtual environment for a digital pet.
