Warner played him as a substitute, encouraging him to put his time into track and field. By 1909, Warner had Thorpe competing in track and field and he won 14 events. In 1911, Thorpe began training for the upcoming Olympics, and won gold medals in the pentathlon and decathlon at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm.|$|E

50|$|Now, if {{we assume}} that the number of humans <b>who</b> will <b>ever</b> be born equals N1, the {{probability}} that X is amongst the first 60 billion humans <b>who</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>lived</b> is of course 100%. However, if the number of humans <b>who</b> will <b>ever</b> be born equals N2, then the probability that X is amongst the first 60 billion humans <b>who</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>lived</b> is only 1%. Since X is in fact amongst the first 60 billion humans <b>who</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>lived,</b> this means that the total number of humans <b>who</b> will <b>ever</b> be born {{is more likely to be}} much closer to 60 billion than to 6,000 billion. In essence the DA therefore suggests that human extinction is more likely to occur sooner rather than later.|$|R

25|$|Diogenes Laertius, {{who lived}} in the third century AD, wrote Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, a voluminous {{collection}} of biographies of nearly every Greek philosopher <b>who</b> <b>ever</b> <b>lived.</b> Unfortunately, Diogenes Laertius often fails to cite his sources and many modern historians consider his testimony unreliable. Nonetheless, in spite of this, he remains the only available source on the lives of many early Greek philosophers. His book is not entirely without merit; it does preserve a tremendous wealth of information that otherwise would not have been preserved. His biography of Epicurus, for instance, is of particularly high quality and contains three lengthy letters attributed to Epicurus himself, at least two of which are generally agreed to be authentic.|$|E

25|$|The late 17th {{and early}} 18th centuries saw the {{achievements}} of the greatest figure of the Scientific revolution: Cambridge University physicist and mathematician Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), {{considered by many to be}} the greatest and most influential scientist <b>who</b> <b>ever</b> <b>lived.</b> Newton, a fellow of the Royal Society of England, combined his own discoveries in mechanics and astronomy to earlier ones to create a single system for describing the workings of the universe. Newton formulated three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation, the latter of which could be used to explain the behavior not only of falling bodies on the earth but also planets and other celestial bodies. To arrive at his results, Newton invented one form of an entirely new branch of mathematics: calculus (also invented independently by Gottfried Leibniz), which was to become an essential tool in much of the later development in most branches of physics. Newton's findings were set forth in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), the publication of which in 1687 marked the beginning of the modern period of mechanics and astronomy.|$|E

500|$|Olympia premiered for Hitler's 49th {{birthday}} in 1938. Its international debut led Riefenstahl {{to embark on}} an American publicity tour {{in an attempt to}} secure commercial release.

When news of the event reached the United States, Riefenstahl publicly defended Hitler. On 18 November, she was received by Henry Ford in Detroit. Olympia was shown at the Chicago Engineers Club two days later. Avery Brundage, President of the International Olympic Committee, praised the film and held Riefenstahl in the highest regard.

500|$|Brown's acrimonious {{departure}} from Cleveland was {{another source of}} criticism. His teams' winning ways had helped obscure his harsh methods and need for control, but Modell's active involvement in the team exposed them. Despite that Modell owned the team, Brown refused to cede any authority or be diplomatic in his relationship with Modell. Modell felt Brown was unwilling {{to adapt to the}} way football was played in the early 1960s. Many players from that time agreed. [...] "Paul didn't adjust to the changes in the game", former Browns cornerback Bernie Parrish said in 1997. [...] "By 1962, he was more worried about protecting his reputation as the Greatest Coach <b>Who</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Lived</b> than he was about winning a title. ...

[...] After his firing, Brown held a grudge against Modell {{for the rest of his}} life. He never forgave Collier for taking over as coach when he left, even though Collier had asked for and received his blessing.|$|E
