40|$|Secondary {{analysis}} of 581 adoptees was utilized {{to determine if}} parental age is related, either genetically or environmentally, {{to the development of}} psychopathology. The significant results showed that proband adoptees (with psychopathology in biologic relatives) <b>with</b> <b>younger</b> birthparents had increased alcohol abuse and those <b>with</b> <b>younger</b> birthfathers had increased antisocial personality while adoptees with older birthparents had increased depression. Analyses on control adoptees (with background free of known genetic disturbances) showed that those <b>with</b> <b>younger</b> adoptive mothers had increased antisocial personality and drug abuse and those <b>with</b> <b>younger</b> adoptive fathers had increased antisocial personality while adoptees with older adoptive fathers had increased depression. Implications of these findings are that adoptees <b>with</b> both <b>younger</b> birth and adoptive parents {{are more likely to have}} externalizing symptoms, while adoptees with both older birth and adoptive parents are more like to have internalizing symptoms. This information is beneficial to those involved in adoption placement...|$|R

5|$|While {{serving as}} the Eton coach, Hirst also worked <b>with</b> <b>young</b> Yorkshire players during the school holidays, and {{maintained}} his coaching connection with the county until shortly before his death. Despite {{the differences in the}} backgrounds of the players, Hirst was equally respected at Eton and when he acted as a coach to the Yorkshire team. At Yorkshire Hirst worked <b>with</b> <b>young</b> players in the cricket nets at Headingley, took charge of indoor trials during the winter, and travelled with the team as coach on a tour to Jamaica in 1936. Many Yorkshire players, with vastly differing temperaments, came under his influence and improved as players. One of Hirst's most notable achievements as a coach was improving the bowling of George Macaulay {{to the point where he}} became a key member of the Yorkshire team.|$|E

5|$|After {{changing}} collaborators {{several times}} over his early solo albums, starting with Sabda Alam (1978), in 1983 Chrisye recorded a trilogy of albums for which Jockie Soerjoprajogo and Eros Djarot– {{with whom he had}} worked on Badai Pasti Berlalu– wrote or co-wrote most of the songs. After the trio disbanded in 1984, Chrisye produced another three albums <b>with</b> <b>young</b> songwriter Adjie Soetomo. This collaboration was followed by two albums arranged by Younky Suwarno, in 1988 and 1989. During the final twelve years of his career, Chrisye worked with several young artists, with arrangement generally handled by Erwin Gutawa.|$|E
5|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Henry {{increasingly}} wanted {{to resolve the}} question of the inheritance. He decided that he would divide up his empire after his death, <b>with</b> <b>Young</b> Henry receiving England and Normandy, Richard being given the Duchy of Aquitaine, and Geoffrey acquiring Brittany. This would require the consent of Louis as king of France, and accordingly Henry and Louis held fresh peace talks in 1169 at Montmirail. The talks were wide-ranging, culminating with Henry's sons giving homage to Louis for their future inheritances in France, and with Richard being betrothed to Louis's daughter Alice.|$|E

5|$|By the {{following}} year, Azazel began making demonic pacts <b>with</b> <b>young</b> individuals; {{in exchange for}} a wish, he would be allowed to enter their homes ten years later.

After taking possession of her father (Mitch Pileggi), he kills her mother and stabs himself to kill his host. Mary's fiance, John Winchester, is the demon's next victim. Azazel makes his usual offer, giving her the chance to resurrect John, to produce a child he can use; now orphaned and alone, she reluctantly agrees without knowing his true intentions.|$|E

The store is the first on the iconic tailoring street to hand-weave a cloth before making it up into a fully finished suit.

5|$|Eighteen years later, Winanta and Fatimah {{have had}} a {{daughter}} named Koestini (Boen Sofiati), who is studying in Batavia.

One of her spurned suitors, Soekatma, decides to ruin their relationship by telling Winanta that Koestini has spent all of her time chasing boys rather than studying. Believing these lies, Winanta recalls Koestini to Bandung.|$|E
5|$|However, both Clinton and Larson {{present the}} {{possibility}} that Margaret was in fact Tubman's daughter. Larson {{points out that the}} two shared an unusually strong bond, and argues that Tubman – knowing the pain of a child separated from her mother – would never have intentionally caused a free family to be split apart. Clinton presents evidence of strong physical similarities, which Alice herself acknowledged. Both historians agree that no concrete evidence exists for such a possibility, and the mystery of Tubman's relationship <b>with</b> <b>young</b> Margaret remains to this day.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mucociliary {{clearance}} is impaired {{in patients}} <b>with</b> <b>Young's</b> syndrome (obstructive azoospermia with recurrent sinobronchial disease), cystic fibrosis, and primary ciliary dyskinesia. No defect of cilia or mucus has been detected in Young's syndrome. METHODS: Ciliary function and ultrastructure, including ciliary orientation, were studied quantitatively in 20 patients <b>with</b> <b>Young's</b> syndrome and 20 normal subjects {{to determine the}} incidences of ciliary defects. Nasal ciliated epithelium was obtained from each subject and used for measurement of ciliary beat frequency and ultrastructural analyses. Ciliary orientation was determined by measuring ciliary deviation in electron micrographs; ciliary deviation {{is a measure of}} the relative orientation of cilia in relation to each other in which high values indicate ciliary disorientation. RESULTS: Ciliary beat frequency and the incidence of microtubular defects and numbers of dynein arms did not differ between patients <b>with</b> <b>Young's</b> syndrome and control subjects. In patients <b>with</b> <b>Young's</b> syndrome basal ciliary deviation (16. 0 degrees) was similar to that in control subjects (14. 1 degrees), but at the ciliary tip ciliary deviation (21. 9 degrees) was greater than in healthy subjects (14. 5 degrees). CONCLUSION: The relative disorientation of the distal ciliary axoneme in patients <b>with</b> <b>Young's</b> syndrome compared <b>with</b> normal subjects may be due to a structural defect but is more likely to be a consequence of abnormal mucus...|$|R
