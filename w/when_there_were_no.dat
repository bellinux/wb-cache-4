5|$|Seventh-century Muslim armies had no siege equipment, and {{typically}} employed siege tactics only <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> other options. Without the necessary siege equipment, armies {{of the early}} Muslim expansion would surround a city, denying it supplies until the city's defenders surrendered. Meanwhile any chance of breaking into the city would be availed, if possible, using stealth and espionage. Muslim armies would usually isolate the city {{from the rest of}} the region and deploy scouts along vital routes.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> {{signs of}} the POWs backing down on the third day, General Fukuye ordered the Commander of the British and Australian troops in Changi, Lt-Gen E. B. Holmes, and his deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Galleghan, to attend the {{execution}} of the four recent escapees — Breavington, Gale, Waters and Fletcher. One of the Australians, Breavington, pleaded to no avail that he was solely responsible for the escape attempt and should be the only one executed. Their executions were carried out by the Indian National Army guards with rifles on 2 September. The initial volley was non-fatal, and the wounded men had to plead to be finished off.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Hedley Marston's {{research}} into nuclear {{fallout from the}} Maralinga nuclear tests brought Marston into bitter conflict with the Australian government appointed Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee. He was vindicated posthumously by the McClelland Royal Commission, which found that significant radiation hazards existed at many of the Maralinga test sites long after the tests. His project tracked fallout across the continent by examining the thyroids of sheep and cattle as well as devices that filtered radioactive elements from air. Later the results, which showed dramatic increases of certain radioactive elements after British Nuclear Tests, caused a further, controversial study where the bones of deceased people (especially children) were burnt to ash and then measured for strontium-90. These tests showed that the tests had increased the concentration of strontium-90 dramatically. As well as finding this after British tests a notable 50% increase was noticed one year <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> tests and it was cited {{as evidence that the}} previous year's hydrogen bomb tests had contaminated the majority of the world.|$|E

25|$|The Grace Contract caused {{widespread}} controversy, the Cáceres {{administration was}} accused of having sold the country's main assets at a very low price among other things.

25|$|Mrs Rylands died in 1908 having bequeathed {{her private}} {{collections}} and an endowment of £200,000 {{to enable the}} library to expand. The funds were used to acquire 180,000 books, 3,000 manuscripts and extend the building.

25|$|In 1900, Montgomery {{had passed}} a city {{ordinance}} to segregate bus passengers by race. Conductors were empowered to assign seats {{to achieve that}} goal. According to the law, no passenger {{would be required to}} move or give up their seat and stand if the bus was crowded and no other seats were available. Over time and by custom, however, Montgomery bus drivers adopted the practice of requiring black riders to move <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> white-only seats left.|$|E

Thereafter, Providence was only used <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> other alternatives. Her last commercial voyages are believed to have occurred between December 1895 and early 1896, when she was called upon to operate for a few days when some of the regular steamers were temporarily out of commission.|$|E

They sent an application that year to the municipality, at a time <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> other electric tramways in operation in Europe.

25|$|In addition, many NA {{groups were}} not {{following}} the 12 traditions very closely (which were quite new at the time). These groups were at times accepting money from outside entities, conflating AA with NA, or even adding religious elements to the meetings. For {{a variety of}} reasons, meetings began to decline in the late 1950s, {{and there was a}} four-month period in 1959 <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> meetings held anywhere at all.

25|$|Over its {{decade of}} {{existence}} the Birkenhead Mobile Library issued nearly 15,000 items a year.

On the other hand, Birkenhead as {{a subset of the}} whole North Shore Libraries system, has averaged 16% of the total issues.

25|$|The FIDONET {{program was}} what later {{became known as}} a mailer. FIDO was {{modified}} to use a previously unused numeric field in the message headers to store a node number for the machine the message should be delivered to. When FIDONET ran, it would search through the email database for any messages with a number in this field. FIDONET collected all of the messages for a particular node number into a file known as a message packet. After all the packets were generated, one for each node, the FIDONET program would look up the destination node's phone number in NODELIST.BBS, and call the remote system. Provided that FIDONET was running on that system, the two systems would handshake and, if this succeeded, the calling system would upload its packet, download a return packet if there was one, and disconnect. FIDONET would then unpack the return packet, place the received messages into the local system's storage, and move onto the next packet. <b>When</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> remaining packet, it would exit, and run the FIDO BBS program.|$|E
