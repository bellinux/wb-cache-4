40|$|The Solar Rating and Certification Corporation (SRCC) has {{established}} a standardized methodology for determining the performance rating of the Solar Domestic Hot Water (SDHW) systems it certifies under OG- 300. Measured performance data for the solar collector component(s) of the system are used along with numerical models for {{the balance of the}} system to calculate the system`s thermal performance under a standard set of rating conditions. SRCC uses TRNSYS to model each of the components that comprise the system. The majority of the SRCC certified systems include a thermal storage tank with an auxiliary electrical heater. The most common being a conventional fifty gallon electric tank water heater. Presently, the thermal losses from these tanks are calculated using Q = U {center_dot} A {center_dot} {Delta}T. Unfortunately, this generalized formula does not adequately address temperature stratification both within the tank {{as well as in the}} ambient air surrounding the tank, non-uniform insulation jacket, thermal siphoning in the fluid lines attached to the tank, and plumbing <b>fittings</b> <b>attached</b> to the tank. This study is intended to address only that part of the problem that deals <b>with</b> the plumbing <b>fittings</b> <b>attached</b> to the tank. Heat losses from a storage tank and its plumbing fittings involve three different operating modes: charging, discharging and standby. In the charging mode, the tank receives energy from the solar collector. In the discharge mode, water flows from the storage tank through the distribution pipes to the faucets and cold city water enters the tank. In the standby mode, there is no forced water flow into or out of the tank. In this experimental study, only the standby mode was considered...|$|R

50|$|Most lens {{adapters}} {{feature a}} male fitting {{and a female}} fitting. The male <b>fitting</b> <b>attaches</b> to the camera, and the female <b>fitting</b> <b>attaches</b> to the lens. There is also {{an opening in the}} center to allow the light to pass through. Lens adapters can be shorter or longer, based on the respective flange focal distance of the lens and camera being adapted. Flange focal distance is the key specification in determining whether or not a particular type of lens can be adapted to any given camera. Generally speaking, cameras with a shorter flange focal distance can be adapted to a greater diversity of lenses. This is because there must be enough room to fit an adapter between the lens and the camera.|$|R

50|$|A gudgeon is a socket-like, {{cylindrical}} (i.e., female) <b>fitting</b> <b>attached</b> to {{one component}} to enable a pivoting or hinging {{connection to a}} second component. The second component carries a pintle fitting, the male counterpart to the gudgeon, enabling an interpivoting connection {{that can be easily}} separated. Designs that may use gudgeon and pintle connections include hinges, shutters and boat rudders.|$|R
50|$|Sails {{usually have}} <b>fittings</b> <b>attached</b> {{to them that}} {{transmit}} force through a small area. These include grommets, which reinforce fabric at an attachment points and connections to lines; hoops and slides, which attach sails to spars; and reefing features, which may reefing lines attached to the sail or grommets that have reefing lines running through them. Additional features include tell-tales, windows—used on dinghy sails—and lettering and other graphics that include sail numbers and manufacturers logos, etc.|$|R

50|$|A {{pipe support}} or pipe hanger is a {{designed}} element that transfer the load from a pipe to the supporting structures. The load includes {{the weight of}} the pipe proper, the content that the pipe carries, all the pipe <b>fittings</b> <b>attached</b> to pipe, and the pipe covering such as insulation. The four main functions of a pipe support are to anchor, guide, absorb shock, and support a specified load. Pipe supports used in high or low temperature applications may contain insulation materials. The overall design configuration of a pipe support assembly is dependent on the loading and operating conditions.|$|R

50|$|The {{cheap and}} simple water {{aspirator}} {{is the most}} common type of aspirator. It is used in chemistry and biology laboratories and consists of a tee <b>fitting</b> <b>attached</b> to a tap and has a hose barb at one side. The flow of water passes through the straight portion of the tee, which has a restriction at the intersection, where the hose barb is attached. The vacuum hose should be connected to this barb. While previously common for low-strength vacuums needed in chemistry benchwork, they use a lot of water, and depending on what the vacuum is being used for, i.e. solvent removal, they can violate environmental protection laws such as RCRA by mixing these potentially hazardous solvents into the water stream, then flushing them down a drain that often leads directly to the municipal sewer.|$|R
