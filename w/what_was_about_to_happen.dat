5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E
500|$|Rosin and Mordowicz {{already knew}} Vrba and Wetzler. Vrba wrote {{that anyone who}} survived {{more than a year}} in Auschwitz was {{a senior member of the}} [...] "old hands Mafia", and all were known to each other. On 15 June Rosin and Mordowicz were interviewed by Oscar Krasniansky, the {{engineer}} who had translated the Vrba–Wetzler report into German. They told him that, between 15 and 27 May 1944, 100,000 Hungarian Jews had arrived at Birkenau, and that most were killed on arrival, apparently with no knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to them. Vrba concluded that the report had been suppressed.|$|E
500|$|That evening, Wellesley College neuroscientist Bevil Conway {{gave some}} {{comments}} on the phenomenon to Wired reporter Adam Rogers. Before they hung up, Rogers warned him, [...] "your tomorrow {{will not be the}} same". Conway thought the reporter was exaggerating, saying, [...] "I didn't appreciate the full extent of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Not even close." [...] Rogers's story eventually got 32.8 million unique visitors. Meanwhile, when Conway woke up the next morning, his inbox had so many emails about the dress that at first, he thought his email had been hacked, until he saw that the bulk were interview requests from major media organisations. [...] "I did 10 interviews and had to have a colleague take my class that day," [...] said Conway.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 {{received}} critical acclaim. Despite the game's praise, journalists {{heavily criticized}} {{the content of}} [...] "No Russian". Marc Cieslak of BBC News was saddened by the level, as he felt it disproved his theory that the video game industry had [...] "grown up". Rock, Paper, Shotgun Kieron Gillen chastised the level for failing {{to live up to}} expectations. He found the plot to be illogical, criticized the skip feature for rendering an artistic statement as [...] "laughably pathetic", and ultimately summarized the level as [...] "dumb shock". Writing for PC World, Matt Peckham questioned why the gunmen would not care if the player did not shoot, and felt that not informing the player of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> until the last possible moment was [...] "creating a kind of plausible emotional deniability by removing all the dramatic impetus that ought to surround it". Several prominent British religious leaders condemned [...] "No Russian": Alexander Goldberg of the London Jewish Forum was worried that children would play the level; Fazan Mohammed of the British Muslim Forum described the level as an intimate experience of enacting terrorism; and Stephen Lowe, the retired Bishop of Hulme, felt that the level was [...] "sickening".|$|E
2500|$|Back in Iraq, deposed {{dictator}} Saddam Hussein {{made what}} an American photographer present called [...] "the ultimate perp walk", in restraints, escorted by two Iraqi security personnel, with a media presence, {{to the start}} of his trial in 2004. [...] "I felt his anger at my camera, at me," [...] Karen Ballard recalled, [...] "and actually thought he might spit on me. He didn't know exactly <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> and, suddenly, the formerly fierce dictator seemed small and disheveled." [...] To her, and other observers, it symbolized the end of his reign and the beginning of hopes for a more democratic Iraq.|$|E

60|$|The Seneschal approached, {{wondering}} <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> take place. The Marquise {{watched his}} coming, a cold glitter in her eye, for--keener of mental vision than Tressan--she {{already knew the}} hideous purpose that was in Garnache's mind.|$|R

60|$|Immediately the Prince {{and all of}} {{his people}} flocked out of the hall into the street, that they might see <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Dorothy and Zeb jumped out of the buggy and ran after them, but the Sorcerer {{remained}} calmly in his throne.|$|E

60|$|One concession, {{however, the}} vrouw had won from the commandant, who, knowing <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to me, had not, I suppose, {{the heart to}} refuse.

60|$|I dare {{venture to}} say that every man in the garrison, save perhaps the officers, was {{watching}} intently the movements of Thayendanega's gang, {{and it was as}} if the knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done burst upon us all at the same instant.|$|R

60|$|The {{two boys}} walked {{either side of}} Mrs. Hargreaves as they went to meet the deacon, and it seemed very much as if the {{majority}} of the people present knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> occur, for the sad-visaged party was followed by crowds of the visitors as they walked steadily onward.|$|R
60|$|Only three persons {{beyond the}} Consul's family knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> when Miss Ponsonby, in her deep mourning, {{attended}} the morning {{service in the}} large hall at the Consul-house; and such eyes as were directed towards the handsome stranger, only gazed at the unwonted spectacle of an English nobleman, not with the more eager curiosity {{that would have been}} attached to him had all been known.|$|E

60|$|In {{the middle}} of the night of the 11th Umbelleni's men arose, and, {{accompanied}} by the boys, started from the kraal, and Dick and Tom were filled with forebodings of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Dick had already gathered from the natives that the guard of the waggons was an extremely small one, and, as the body moving to attack them were between 4000 and 5000 strong, the chance of a successful resistance appeared small.|$|E

60|$|An hour {{had passed}} when Le Drieux entered the lobby in {{company with a}} thin-faced, sharp-eyed man in plain clothes.

Uncle John lowered his paper, frowned at Le Drieux and then turned his eyes upon the face of young Jones.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as the}} {{cheroots}} were lit, Mellish spoke like a man; {{beginning with}} his cholera-theory, reviewing his fifteen years' 'scientific labours,' the machinations of the 'Simla Ring,' and the excellence of his Fumigatory, while the Viceroy watched him between half-shut eyes and thought--'Evidently this is the wrong tiger; {{but it is an}} original animal.' Mellish's hair was standing on end with excitement, and he stammered. He began groping in his coat-tails and, before the Viceroy knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> he had tipped a bagful of his powder into the big silver ash-tray.|$|E
