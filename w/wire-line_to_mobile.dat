The British researchers used <b>wire-line</b> soundings <b>to</b> investigate sea depths and collected hundreds of biological samples from all the oceans except the Arctic.

50|$|Together {{with his}} colleagues, Wolfram Burgard {{developed}} numerous probabilistic approaches <b>to</b> <b>mobile</b> robot navigation.

In 1999, Frank Dellaert, Dieter Fox, Sebastian Thrun, and Wolfram Burgard developed Monte Carlo localization, a probabilistic approach <b>to</b> <b>mobile</b> robot localization that is based on particle filters.|$|R
