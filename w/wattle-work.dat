After that we were certainly horribly anxious, for they might have taken it into their heads to tow her away with them, for the purpose of breaking her up at their leisure, {{for the sake of the}} bolts and nails.” ...|$|E
60|$|A {{week later}} they were {{established}} in their new camp. The sugar, coffee, and other articles were all repacked in the casks, which were headed up again {{to protect them from}} the weather and the assaults of insects, portions sufficient for a week’s consumption only being left out. The labour had been great, but the Peruvian captain seconded Stephen’s efforts well. The steward, however, grumbled frequently, and had many times to be spoken to sharply by the captain. Another week was spent in fortifying the position. Young trees were cut down and stuck in the earth two feet apart in the intervals between the trees. A <b>wattle-work</b> of the tough thorny creepers was interwoven across the little promontory, eight feet high. This was painful work, for, however careful they were, they frequently tore their hands with the spikes.|$|E

50|$|In 53 BC, Trebonius {{was given}} a special command against the Eburones, {{specifically}} to harass {{the area in the}} vicinity of Huy. After the defeat of Ambiorix, he continued to serve Caesar; in 50 BC he was placed in charge of the winter quarters in Belgic Gaul, in command of four legions while Caesar was in Ravenna, preparing to confront Pompey and his enemies in the Senate. When Caesar heard that the consul Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor had asked Pompey to defend the state against Caesar, he ordered Trebonius on October 20, 50 BC to take three legions and move to Matisco, where he was to wait for further instructions. These arrived in April 49 BC, where Caesar instructed him to travel down to Massilia to take command of three newly recruited legions from Northern Italy and begin the siege of Massilia. Arriving around April 3, 49 BC, Trebonius began preparing for the siege under Caesar’s eye, before leaving Trebonius on April 14 to conduct the land assaults, while Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus command the naval forces. Before he commenced the siege, Trebonius collected labourers and cattle from the Province, ordered timber and wood suitable for <b>wattle-work</b> to be brought up, and then proceeded to construct the principal terrace.|$|E
50|$|At Brocolitia, the {{anteroom}} and nave {{were separated}} by a <b>wattle-work</b> screen, the base of which was found exceptionally well preserved. Excavations revealed three stages of development: the first stage was small, around 5.5 metres wide and 8 metres long. The building was expanded to 11 metres length in a second stage, at which time the temple also gained elaborate furnishings and extensive woodwork. This second stage existed for the entire 3rd century, and included at least two major renovations. The second stage was looted and the furnishings destroyed around 296-297 AD, but the sanctuary itself and the stone monuments remained intact, and the temple was re-equipped in a third stage shortly thereafter. The third stage includes three monuments by different cohort prefects, commanders of Cohors I Batavorum, a Roman Batavi unit of auxiliary cavalry stationed at Brocolitia. All three date to the 3rd century. The youngest coin found on the premises was a freshly-minted follis of Maximian (r. 296-308). This coincides with the third structural period on Hadrian's Wall (297-367), but the complete lack of coins from after 308 suggests that the temple did not remain in use {{for much of the}} 4th century. The temple was deliberately desecrated by the removal of the primary tauroctony scene, only a piece of which was found. Other than a collapsed roof, the temple was found almost exactly as the Romans had left it. The foundations of the temple are still visible, as are the wooden stakes on which the podia benches were raised. A reconstruction of the sanctuary is on display at the Great North Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
40|$|The Essex tidal {{estuaries}} are {{the site}} of a number of timber-built fish traps, their distribution being particularly dense in the Blackwater estuary where six sites have been identified through the work of local archaeologists and aerial reconnaissance. The Blackwater examples are Saxon in date (Strachan 1998) and comprise large and complex monuments, comprising numerous wooden posts in various alignments, along with <b>wattle-work</b> (sails and rods) and basketry. The recovered information adds to the understanding of these and other fishtraps in the Blackwater estuary and provides measurable data with which to assess the nature and rate of erosion taking place in this inter-tidal environment. Additionally, a number of methodological lessons have been learnt that are of benefit to the improved investigation of such monuments in the inter-tidal zone...|$|E
