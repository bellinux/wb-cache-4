40|$|Individuals {{are known}} to differ in their {{sensitivity}} to cocaine. Cocaine is known to inhibit the re-uptake of monoamines. The response to cocaine has also been found to depend on monoamines inside reserpine-sensitive storage vesicles. The present study {{examined the effects of}} reserpine (1 - 2 mg/kg) on cocaine-induced behavior (10 - 15 mg/kg) in Low Responders (LR) and High Responders (HR) to novelty rats. LR displayed less cocaine-induced <b>walking,</b> <b>wall</b> rearing, free rearing and stereotyped behavior than HR did. The dose of 1 mg/kg of reserpine decreased cocaine-induced <b>walking,</b> <b>wall</b> rearing, free rearing and stereotyped behavior in LR, but not in HR. A dose of 2 mg/kg of reserpine was required to inhibit cocaine-induced behavior in HR. Combining these behavioral findings with our previously reported neurochemical finding that a higher dose of reserpine was required to inhibit the accumbal dopamine response to cocaine in HR than in LR (Verheij et al., 2008), suggests that HR are more sensitive to the behavioral effects of cocaine than LR because cocaine can release more monoamines from storage vesicles in HR than in LR. Our behavioral data also demonstrate that the individual differences in sensitivity to reserpine are not only limited to the dopaminergic system of the nucleus accumbens...|$|R

40|$|Muscular {{dystrophy}} (MD) is {{an incurable}} disease characterized by muscle degeneration. MD treatments require use of mouse models in preclinical studies. The DBA/ 2 -congenic Dmdmdx(“D 2 ”) mouse {{is a novel}} dystrophic model that is uncharacterized physiologically. PURPOSE: While high intensity physical activity levels declines with MD disease progression, we examined whether 4 -month old D 2 mice (n= 10) engage in less moderate to high intensity physical activity than age-matched controls (“D 2 J” mice, n= 8). METHODS: Physical activity quantification was performed by 0 - 1 sampling according to a species-specific activity ethnogram of <b>walking,</b> <b>wall</b> pacing, climbing, running and jumping. Activity counts were recorded by a blinded observer every 15 -seconds for a 10 -minute session (total of 40 observation periods). Individual activity counts were recorded and analyzed in a mouse strain-dependent fashion. An activity-scaled composite metric was also calculated whereby activity sums were scaled for <b>walking</b> and <b>wall</b> pacing (x 2), climbing and running (x 2. 5), and jumping (x 3). RESULTS: Scores for individual activities were similar between mouse strains for walking (7 % mean group difference, p= 0. 120), running (61 % mean group difference, p= 0. 145). Moreover, composite metric analyses revealed that scores were not different between mouse strains (D 2 J 82 ± 36, D 2 61 ± 23; p= 0. 477). In contrast, D 2 mice performed 70 % less climbing (p= 0. 049) and 44 % less jumping (p= 0. 046) than D 2 J mice. CONCLUSION: Findings from composite analysis and some activity counts reveal that D 2 J controls and D 2 congenital dystrophic mice perform statistically similar amounts of physical activity. However, individual activity analyses indicate that D 2 mice engage in less climbing and jumping than D 2 J healthy control mice. Future work should examine these physical activity parameters across the lifespan as related to disease outcomes. Supported by: Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy to JS and J...|$|R
