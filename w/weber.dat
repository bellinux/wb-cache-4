5|$|On July 8, 2010, <b>Weber</b> {{was named}} the fifth captain in Nashville Predators history, {{replacing}} Jason Arnott, who {{was traded to the}} New Jersey Devils. He became the youngest captain in franchise history and the only Predators captain to have been drafted by the team. On January 11, 2011, <b>Weber</b> was among 42 players named to the 58th National Hockey League All-Star Game in Raleigh, North Carolina. For {{the first time in its}} history, the NHL used a fantasy draft format to select teams for the All-Star Game, and <b>Weber</b> was selected eighth overall by Team Lidstrom. At the game, <b>Weber</b> recorded four assists and was a +6, finishing the game tied with Loui Eriksson for most points and second to Nicklas Lidström for best plus/minus. Shortly after his All-Star Game appearance, <b>Weber</b> recorded his 200th career NHL pointan assistin a game versus the Detroit Red Wings on February 9, 2011. During his sixth season with the Predators <b>Weber</b> averaged 25:19 in ice time, and set career highs in games played (82), assists (32) and shots on goal (25). <b>Weber</b> also contributed three goals and five points in 12 playoff games as the Predators lost to the Vancouver Canucks after advancing to the Western Conference Semifinals for the first time in their history. At the conclusion of the regular season, <b>Weber</b> was named one of three finalistsalong with Zdeno Chára and Nicklas Lidströmfor the Norris Trophy, the first finalist nomination of his career. He finished second in Norris Trophy voting, losing with 727 voting points to Lidström's 736. <b>Weber</b> also finished 25th in Hart Memorial Trophy voting with two fifth-place votes. For the first time in his career, <b>Weber</b> was voted to the NHL First All-Star Team after receiving 445 voting points, second among defencemen to Lidström's 464. On July 1, 2011, <b>Weber</b> became a restricted free agent; despite this, <b>Weber</b> had stated he wanted to remain with the Predators. To prevent the possibility of other teams signing him to an offer sheet, the Predators filed for salary arbitration with <b>Weber,</b> giving the team and <b>Weber</b> until their hearing to negotiate a new contract. Failing to come to terms on a new contract by their hearing, Weber's case went to arbitration on August 2 – the first time in NHL history that a team-elected arbitration candidate had reached a hearing. The following day, he was awarded a one-year, $7.5 million contract, from which the Predators could not walk away, as they, and not <b>Weber,</b> had elected arbitration.|$|E

50|$|This work {{examines}} <b>Weber's</b> {{discussions of}} the prospects for liberal Parliamentarism in authoritarian societies. This is within an age defined by both mass politics and bureaucratic organization. Beetham argues that <b>Weber's</b> analysis of the class basis of politics means that we should modify {{some of the more}} standard interpretations of <b>Weber's</b> sociology of modern capitalism. The book also includes <b>Weber's</b> discussion of Wilhelmine Germany and the 1905 and 1917 Russian revolutions.|$|R
5|$|During the 2015–16 season, <b>Weber</b> {{recorded}} his first career hat trick on December 5 against the Detroit Red Wings, {{which was also}} the first ever by a Nashville Predators defenceman. <b>Weber</b> would continue his goal-scoring ways, tying Paul Kariya's franchise record for power play goals in a season with 14 and finishing with his third 20+ goal season. <b>Weber</b> was also named a finalist for the Mark Messier Leadership Award., which he would eventually win.|$|E
5|$|Entering {{his fifth}} {{season with the}} Predators, <b>Weber</b> {{continued}} his stellar record. At the February Olympic break, <b>Weber</b> accumulated 35 points in 59 games for the Predators. He also established a strong leadership role and willingness to defend his teammates, highlighted by three consecutive games in March 2010 in which he fought opposing players. Weber's offensive production slowed after the Olympic break and he finished the season with 43 points in 78 games played. Despite a decrease in offence from the previous season, <b>Weber</b> was a Norris Trophy candidate {{for the third consecutive}} year, receiving a single first place vote and 96 voting points to finish as the sixth runner-up behind winner Duncan Keith (1,096 points). <b>Weber</b> also received a single fifth-place vote, tying for 23rd with six other players in Hart Memorial Trophy voting, and was the seventh-ranked defenceman in NHL All-Star Team voting with 83 voting points.|$|E

Slovic took <b>Weber's</b> law and incorporated prospect theory, which is decision making based on potential gains and losses, not the actual final outcome. Slovic found that when prospect theory and <b>Weber's</b> law are analyzed in regards to human life, the value of saving human lives is greater for a smaller tragedy than for a larger one.|$|R

5|$|In 1897 Max <b>Weber</b> Sr. {{died two}} months after a severe quarrel with his son that was never resolved. After this, <b>Weber</b> became {{increasingly}} prone to depression, nervousness and insomnia, {{making it difficult for}} him to fulfill his duties as a professor. His condition forced him to reduce his teaching and eventually leave his course unfinished in the autumn of 1899. After spending months in a sanatorium during the summer and autumn of 1900, <b>Weber</b> and his wife travelled to Italy {{at the end of the}} year and did not return to Heidelberg until April 1902. He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919. Weber's ordeal with mental illness was carefully described in a personal chronology that was destroyed by his wife. This chronicle was supposedly destroyed because Marianne <b>Weber</b> feared that Max Weber's work would be discredited by the Nazis if his experience with mental illness were widely known.|$|E

40|$|<b>Weber’s</b> law, first {{characterized}} in the 19 th century, {{states that}} errors estimating {{the magnitude of}} perceptual stimuli scale linearly with stimulus intensity. This linear relationship is found in most sensory modalities, generalizes to temporal interval estimation, and even applies to some abstract variables. Despite its generality and long experimental history, the neural basis of <b>Weber’s</b> law remains unknown. This work presents a simple theory explaining {{the conditions under which}} <b>Weber’s</b> law can result from neural variability and predicts that the tuning curves of neural populations which adhere to <b>Weber’s</b> law will have a log-power form with parameters that depend on spike-count statistics. The prevalence of <b>Weber’s</b> law suggests that it might be optimal in some sense. We examine this possibility, using variational calculus, and show that <b>Weber’s</b> law is optimal only when observed real-world variables exhibit power-law statistics with a specific exponent. Our theory explains how physiology gives rise to the behaviorally characterized <b>Weber’s</b> law and may represent a general governing principle relating perception to neural activity.

40|$|<b>Weber’s</b> law {{is one of}} {{the basic}} laws in psychophysics, but the link between this psychophysical {{behavior}} and the neuronal response has not yet been established. In this paper, we carried out an analysis on the spike train statistics when <b>Weber’s</b> law holds, and found that the efferent spike train of a single neuron is less variable than a Poisson process. For population neurons, <b>Weber’s</b> law is satisfied only when the population size is small (< 10 neurons). However, if the population neurons share a weak correlation in their discharges and individual neuronal spike train is more regular than a Poisson process, <b>Weber’s</b> law is true without any restriction on the population size. Biased competition attractor network also demonstrates that the coefficient of variation of interspike interval in the winning pool should be less than one for the validity of <b>Weber’s</b> law.

5|$|Max <b>Weber</b> was {{a pioneer}} in {{delineating}} a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. In earlier texts, Maximiliano Korstanje explores the American exceptionalism {{and its effects on}} the current means of productions. This contribution to the existent literature is of paramount importance because of two main reasons. The first and most important, he relates capitalism to Protestantism. This is of course nothing new, since Max <b>Weber</b> did it in the past. However, Korstanje adds, though <b>Weber</b> was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism, the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind. In effect, the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by <b>Weber</b> did not come from Luther alone. It was rather enrooted in the core of Norse Culture. Secondly, this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a risk-prone culture, which resulted in what Ulrich Beck dubbed the “Risk Society”. The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of Capitalism should be explained by the “economy of salved peoples” formulated by <b>Weber.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Weber’s</b> law quantifies the {{perception}} of difference between stimuli. For instance, it can explain why we {{are less likely to}} detect the removal of three nuts from a bowl if the bowl is full than if it is nearly empty. This {{is an example of the}} magnitude effect – the phenomenon that the subjective perception of a linear difference between a pair of stimuli progressively diminishes when the average magnitude of the stimuli increases. Although discrimination performances of both human and animal subjects in various sensory modalities exhibit the magnitude effect, results sometimes systematically deviate from the quantitative predictions based on <b>Weber’s</b> law. An attempt to reformulate the law to better fit data from acoustic discrimination tasks has been dubbed the ‘‘near-miss to <b>Weber’s</b> law’’. Here, we tested the gustatory discrimination performance of nectar-feeding bats (Glossophaga soricina), in order to investigate whether the original version of <b>Weber’s</b> law accurately predicts choice behavior in a two-alternative forced choice task. As expected, bats either preferred the sweeter of the two options or showed no preference. In 4 out of 6 bats the near-miss to <b>Weber’s</b> law provided a better fit and <b>Weber’s</b> law underestimated the magnitude effect. In order to test the generality of this observation in nectar-feeders, we reviewed previously published data on bats, hummingbirds, honeybees, and bumblebees. In all groups of animals the near-miss to <b>Weber’s</b> law provided better fits than <b>Weber’s</b> law. Furthermore, whereas the magnitude effect was stronger than predicted by <b>Weber’s</b> law in vertebrates, it was weaker than predicted in insects. Thus nectar-feeding vertebrates an...|$|R
