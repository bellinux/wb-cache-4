5|$|As {{the glaciers}} {{retreated to the}} {{northeast}} about 20,000 years ago, glacial lakes formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a sluiceway, or channel, that diverted the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. The retreating glaciers also left deposits of debris 20to 30feet (6.1to 9.1m) thick, which formed a dam blocking <b>water</b> <b>from</b> draining into Big Run. Instead <b>water</b> <b>from</b> Ganoga Lake and the area that later became Lake Jean was diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek. These diversions added about 7square miles (18km²) to the Kitchen Creek drainage basin, increasing it by just over 50percent to 20.1square miles (52km²).|$|E

5|$|In 1908, Erie started {{building}} a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh {{water for the}} city. <b>Water</b> <b>from</b> Lake Erie was pumped into two reservoirs on the peninsula, where particulates in the water were allowed to settle, removing them from the lake water. After treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the <b>water</b> <b>from</b> one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949.

Before the introduction of piped water the town's inhabitants drew <b>water</b> <b>from</b> wells and the nearby River Tame. Industrial processes had polluted the river however, and the wells could not sustain a rapidly expanding population. From 1825, a private company was responsible for piping <b>water</b> <b>from</b> reservoirs, but there were still many homes without proper drainage or water supply. Today, waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority.|$|E

A linear relation exists between chlorine and evaporate residue contents {{as well as}} chlorine and iodine contents of brine <b>waters</b> <b>from</b> different wells.

Especially intersting results were found in brine waters that the brine <b>waters</b> <b>from</b> new drilled wells and deep well are more abundant in the contents of zinc and manganese,and a linear relation is also seen between chlorine and zinc,manganese of brine waters.

5|$|Ratanakiri {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{developed}} provinces in Cambodia. As of 2013, the average home had 1.9 rooms, and only 14.9% of buildings in the province had permanent roofs, walls, and flooring. Relatively few households (27.8%) had toilet facilities. The largest share of households (38.0%) obtained <b>water</b> <b>from</b> springs, streams, ponds, or rain; much of the remainder obtained <b>water</b> <b>from</b> protected (23.9%) or unprotected (15.1%) dug wells. Only 21.6% of Ratanakiri residents obtained <b>water</b> <b>from</b> sources that are considered safe (purchased water, piped water, or tube/piped wells). Household water sources were within the home for 28.0% of households, near the home for 39.1%, and away from the home for 32.9%. The most common source of light was battery power (39.5%), followed by government-provided power (25.5%), and kerosene (16.5%). Most households (85%) used firewood as the main fuel for cooking. A variety of NGOs, including Oxfam and Health Unlimited, work to improve health and living conditions in the province.|$|E
