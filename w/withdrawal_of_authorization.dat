40|$|Background and problem: It is pivotal {{to provide}} {{competent}} auditors for {{the trade and}} industry {{as well as to}} supervise and assure the quality of the audit profession. The Swedish Supervisory Board of Public Accountants (SSBPA), a governmental authority, was in 1995 assigned the mission to both provide approved and authorized auditors in Sweden and to supervise these. The board has the authority to issue reminders and warnings or withdraw the licenses of auditors if necessary. However, studies reveal that only withdrawal has a major effect on the auditor. To thoroughly explore the frequency of these withdrawals and the reasons for them would therefore be of considerable interest. Aim: The aim of this master thesis is to examine the SSBPA’s investigation of auditors, to be able to identify what areas within auditing that are critical for the auditor when performing an audit. Furthermore, the aim is also to analyze the disciplinary cases resulting in the SSBPA withdrawing the license of the auditor, in order to describe the types of failures that are reported most frequently as well as what types of failures that solely lead to withdrawal. Method: This study was conducted by reviewing 77 disciplinary cases issued by the SSBPA resulting in <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> or approval during 1995 - 2010. The audit failures found in these cases were sorted into categories representing different areas within the audit process and the professional conduct of the auditor. Thereafter, the empirical result was analyzed based on previous studies and the frame of reference. Results and conclusions: The most frequent type of failure in the 77 disciplinary cases was by far failures regarding Error of judgment or execution when performing the audit. However, the fact that a failure is frequently reported does not mean that it is the most likely cause of withdrawal. This study revealed two additional areas as critical, in terms of solely leading to withdrawal of license. These areas consisted of Failure to cooperate with the SSBPA’s investigation etc. and Unprofessional conduct. Future studies: An interesting point of view would be to thoroughly compare disciplinary cases resulting in withdrawals with cases resulting in warnings, {{in order to determine the}} differences in content between these two sanctions. Furthermore, a comparison between sanctions issued by the SSBPA and sanctions issued by similar supervisory authorities abroad may also be of value as it would provide further information regarding supervision and auditing on an international level...|$|E

5000|$|Changes to old rites {{and ceremonies}} {{following}} Vatican II produced {{a variety of}} responses. Some stopped going to church, while others tried to preserve the old liturgy {{with the help of}} sympathetic priests. These formed the basis of today's Traditionalist Catholic groups, which believe that the reforms of Vatican II have gone too far. Liberal Catholics form another dissenting group who feel that the Vatican II reforms did not go far enough. The liberal views of theologians such as Hans Küng and Charles Curran led to Church <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> their <b>authorization</b> to teach as Catholics. According to Professor Thomas Bokenkotter, most Catholics [...] "accepted the changes more or less gracefully". In 2007, Benedict XVI reinstated the old mass as an option, to be celebrated upon request by the faithful.|$|R

The most famous liberal theologian of recent times has been Hans Küng, whose unorthodox views of the incarnation, and his denials of infallibility led to Church <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> his <b>authorization</b> to teach as a Catholic in 1979. In his book A Concise History of the Catholic Church, professor Thomas Bokenkotter commented on the situation by stating [...] "Most Catholics, however, accepted the changes more or less gracefully but with little enthusiasm and have learned to take in stride the continuing series of changes that have modified not only the Mass but the other sacraments as well."

40|$|The {{conventional}} models <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> {{have been}} designed for database systems supporting the hierarchical, network, and relational models of data.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{discretionary access control}} model in which authorizations contain temporal intervals <b>of</b> validity. An <b>authorization</b> is automatically revoked when the associated temporal interval expires. The proposed model provides rules for the automatic derivation <b>of</b> new <b>authorizations</b> from those explicitly specified. Both positive and negative authorizations are supported. A formal definition of those concepts {{is presented in the}} paper, together with the semantic interpretation <b>of</b> <b>authorizations</b> and derivation rules as clauses of a general logic program. Issues deriving from the presence <b>of</b> negative <b>authorizations</b> are discussed. We also allow negation in rules: it is possible to derive new authorizations {{on the basis of the}} absence <b>of</b> other <b>authorizations.</b> The presence <b>of</b> this type of rules may lead to the generation of different sets <b>of</b> <b>authorizations,</b> depending on the evaluation order.

40|$|Abstract. The {{authorization}} {{problem is}} to decide whether, according to a security policy, some principal should be allowed access to a resource. In the trust-management system SPKI/SDSI, the security policy is given {{by a set of}} certificates, and proofs <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> take the form of certificate chains. The certificate-chain-discovery {{problem is to}} discover a proof <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> for a given request. Although certificate-chain-discovery algorithms for SPKI/SDSI have been investigated by several researchers, previous work did not address how to perform certificatechain discovery in distributed environments. We address the certificate-chain-discovery problem where the certificates are distributed over a number of sites, which then have to cooperate to identify the proof <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> for a given request. We propose two protocols for this purpose. These protocols can also handle cases where certificates are labeled with weights and where multiple certificate chains must be combined to form a proof <b>of</b> <b>authorization.</b> We have implemented these protocols in a prototype and report preliminary results of our evaluation. 1...|$|R
