500|$|George W. Bush {{took office}} in January 2001, and changed the American policy towards {{countries}} in financial crises. The Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, a critic of financial aids, said, [...] "We're working {{to find a way}} to create a sustainable Argentina, not just one that continues to consume the money of the plumbers and carpenters in the United States who make $50,000 a year and wonder <b>what</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> we're doing with their money". The September 11 attacks occurred a few months later, and the U.S. focused its foreign policy on the War on Terror against countries suspected of harboring terrorist organizations. As a result, the U.S. gave no further financial aid to Argentina. This policy was confirmed after an interview of Bush with the Brazilian president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who confirmed Brazil would not be affected by the Argentine crisis.|$|E
500|$|Wheeler {{became famous}} in Britain as [...] "the {{embodiment}} of popular archaeology {{through the medium}} of television". In 1952, Wheeler was invited to be a panelist on the new BBC television series, Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?. Based on the American quiz programme <b>What</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World?,</b> the show was hosted by Glyn Daniel and featured three experts in archaeology, anthropology, and natural history being asked to identify artefacts which had been selected from various museums. However, Wheeler is alleged to have prepared for the show by checking beforehand which objects had been temporarily removed from display. The show proved popular with British audiences, and would air for six more years. It brought Wheeler to public attention, resulting in a Television Personality of the Year award for him in 1954. He also appeared in an episode of Buried Treasure, an archaeology show also hosted by Daniel, in which the pair travelled to Denmark to discuss Tollund Man. In 1957, he appeared in a second episode of Buried Treasure, for which he travelled to Pakistan to discuss that nation's archaeology, and in 1958 again appeared in an episode, this time on the site of Great Zimbabwe in Southern Rhodesia. In 1959 he presented his own three-part series on The Grandeur That Was Rome, for which he travelled to Hadrian's Wall, Pompeii, and Leptis Magna; the show failed to secure high ratings, and was Wheeler's last major foray into television. Meanwhile, he also made appearances on BBC radio, initially featuring on the John Irving series The Archaeologist, but later presenting his own eight-part series on Roman Britain and also appearing on the series Asian Club, which was aimed primarily at newly arrived migrants from the Indian subcontinent.|$|E

40|$|Philosophers such as Hilary Putnam and Tyler Burge {{evaluate}} philosophical positions {{by testing}} whether we talk {{the way that}} <b>the</b> positions require. <b>In</b> a series of influential papers, Terence Horgan and Mark Timmons follow their lead and construct thought experiments designed {{to show that we}} do not talk the way that moral realism requires. In chapter 1, I argue that suitably constructed thought experiments show that we do talk the way that moral realism requires. However, I also question whether the way that we talk is a reliable guide to showing <b>what</b> is real <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> I distinguish between experiments that test how we talk about <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and experiments that test <b>what</b> happens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>In</b> chapter 2, I construct experiments designed to show <b>what</b> would happen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> under certain conditions if Oxford moral realism were true. In chapter 3, I construct experiments designed to show <b>what</b> would happen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> under certain conditions if Cornell moral realism were true. In both chapters, I use abductive arguments to interpret the results of the experiments and conclude that moral realism is not true. In chapter 4, I question the role that empirically informed work on human psychology and social relations can serve in establishing moral claims about human lives and social institutions. I identify subtle equivocations between moral and nonmoral conceptions of goodness in work by authors such as Richard Boyd, Martha Nussbaum, and Paul Bloomfield. I elucidate these equivocations by formulating a version of <b>the</b> is-ought gap <b>in</b> which nonmoral goodness takes the role of descriptive premises and moral goodness takes the role of prescriptive conclusions. Moral conclusions about motivation, behavior, and society are underdetermined by many empirically informed premises about nonmoral goodness. ^ In sum, this dissertation defends moral anti-realism in metaethics and sets an agenda for research in substantive ethics that does not founder on mistaken assumptions about metaethics. ...|$|R
