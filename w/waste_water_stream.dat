50|$|The {{removal of}} {{pollutants}} from the <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>stream</b> involves both absorption and adsorption of organic compounds and some inorganic species such as nitrite and nitrate ions by the layer of microbial bio film. The filter media is typically chosen to provide a very high surface area to volume. Typical materials are often porous and have considerable internal surface area {{in addition to the}} external surface of the medium. Passage of the waste water over the media provides dissolved oxygen which the bio-film layer requires for the biochemical oxidation of the organic compounds and releases carbon dioxide gas, water and other oxidized end products. As the bio film layer thickens, it eventually sloughs off into the liquid flow and subsequently forms part of the secondary sludge. Typically, a trickling filter is followed by a clarifier or sedimentation tank for the separation and removal of the sloughed film. Other filters utilizing higher-density media such as sand, foam and peat moss do not produce a sludge that must be removed, but require forced air blowers and backwashing or an enclosed anaerobic environment.|$|E
