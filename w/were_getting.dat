The proceedings were generally amicable, and {{she received a}} reported $4million settlement when the divorce was granted in 1982.

5|$|Račić {{signed a}} mutual {{cooperation}} agreement against the occupation {{forces with the}} commander of the Podrinje Partisans, Nebojša Jerković. Due to its lack of action against the Germans and puppet government, the Jadar Chetnik Detachment became quite isolated. Their leadership realised that the Partisans <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> stronger with each success against the occupiers, and the Chetnik position was becoming relatively weaker due to their inaction. Misita's decision to attack Loznica was a consequence of the cooperation agreement Račić signed with the Partisans.|$|E

Vitiligo or lighter skin?" [...] Noting that Jackson had even skin tone when he was younger, Lipkin's interpretation was that [...] "probably he's trying to look Caucasian: His skin is whiter. His nose <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> thinner every six months. His lips <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> thinner. His eyebrows <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> higher. His eyes <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> wider every time. His cheekbones <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> bigger." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{challenge}} for NASA's imaging team was that, as the mission progressed, the objects being photographed <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> {{farther away from}} the spacecraft, therefore appearing fainter and requiring longer exposures and even slewing (panning) of the cameras to achieve good quality. The telecommunication capability also decreased with distance, limiting the number of data modes that could be used by the imaging system.|$|E
5|$|Those changes worsened the magazine's problems. When {{the title}} was {{shortened}} to just HG, many longtime subscribers thought they <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> a new magazine and put it aside {{for the real thing}} to arrive.

5|$|By September 1945, many of {{the self-proclaimed}} pemuda, who were ready to die for '100% freedom', <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> impatient. It was common for ethnic 'out-groups' – Dutch internees, Eurasian, Ambonese and Chinese – and anyone {{considered}} to be a spy, to be subjected to intimidation, kidnap, robbery, murder and organised massacres. Such attacks would continue throughout the course of the revolution, but were most present during the 1945-46 period, which is known as the Bersiap. p.78; Anthony Reid, Indonesian National Revolution (Hawthorn, Vic.: Longman, 1974), chs. 2 and 3; Shirley Fenton-Huie, The Forgotten Ones: Women and Children Under Nippon (Sydney: Angus and Robertson, 1992); Anthony Reid, 'Indonesia: revolution without socialism', in Robin Jeffrey (ed.), Asia: the Winning of Independence (London: MacMillan, 1981), pp. 107–57.|$|E
5|$|By this time, however, North Korean {{logistics}} {{had been}} stretched to their limit, and resupply became increasingly difficult. By {{the beginning of}} August, the North Korean units operating in the area <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> little to no food and ammunition supply, instead relying on captured UN weapons and foraging for what they could find. They were also exhausted from over a month of advancing, though morale remained high among the 766th troops. The 766th Regiment specialized in raiding UN supply lines, and effectively mounted small disruptive attacks against UN targets to equip themselves.|$|E

5|$|Even before Carpathia {{arrived in}} New York, efforts <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> {{underway}} {{to retrieve the}} dead. Four ships chartered by the White Star Line succeeded in retrieving 328bodies; 119 were buried at sea, while the remaining 209 were brought ashore to the Canadian port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 150 of them were buried. Memorials were raised in various places– New York, Washington, Southampton, Liverpool, Belfast and Lichfield, among others– and ceremonies were held {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic to commemorate the dead and raise funds to aid the survivors. The bodies of most of Titanics victims were never recovered, and the only evidence of their deaths was found 73years later among the debris on the seabed: pairs of shoes lying side by side, where bodies had once lain before eventually decomposing.|$|E
5|$|Magnapop {{established}} their fan {{base in the}} early 1990s through touring and the festival circuit—particularly in central Europe, where they first broke through to the mainstream. It was only after they had established a fan base in Europe and received positive press in the United Kingdom that the band first became recognized in the United States, including their native Atlanta. By the end of 1992, they <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> positive write-ups in American press such as The New York Times and supported Juliana Hatfield on tour. The group made appearances at Rocking Kolonia Festival in Maastricht in 1992, Pukkelpop in 1992, Transmusicales in 1992, A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise in 1993, and the Reading Festival in 1993. They also recorded a John Peel session on September 2, 1993 and a Black Session on February 25, 1994.|$|E
5|$|On 24 November 2008, 14 league {{games into}} the 2008–09 season, Fàbregas was named as the {{successor}} to William Gallas as club captain. However, just as Arsenal <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> back into the title race after a poor start to the season, the Spaniard was ruled out for four months after sustaining a knee injury against Liverpool. The Gunners eventually finished the season without any silverware, coming in fourth {{in the league and}} being knocked out at the semi-finals of the 2008–09 Champions League campaign. In tandem with Arsenal's policy to groom its young players, the team that Fàbregas led into the new season consisted mostly of the same young nucleus as before, with the likes of Nicklas Bendtner, Gaël Clichy, Abou Diaby, Denílson, Samir Nasri, Alex Song and Theo Walcott in tow.|$|E

5|$|River {{traffic and}} {{railroad}} traffic were increasingly {{in competition with}} each other. In October 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven-coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached the open swing bridge too fast and was barely able to stop in time, ending up with its front wheels hanging off the approach road over the river. Meanwhile, boats on the river <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> larger and finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} navigate the bridges {{at the mouth of the}} north branch, so the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the clearing of three swing bridges near Kinzie Street that were obstructing river traffic. Therefore, in 1907 construction started on a new bascule bridge that would allow more space for boats to pass by on the river.|$|E
5|$|Slavery was not {{abolished}} {{even after}} the Thirteenth Amendment. There were four million freedmen {{and most of them}} on the same plantation, doing the same work that they did before emancipation, except as their work had been interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war. Moreover, they <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> about the same wages and apparently were going to be subject to slave codes modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or {{on the streets of the}} cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without protection.|$|E
5|$|The changes paid off. In 1963, {{the team}} {{finished}} 10–4, and Jim Brown broke the NFL's single-season rushing record with 1,863 yards. Brown was also voted the league's Most Valuable Player. Cleveland, however, finished a game behind the New York Giants {{and did not}} reach the championship game. The Browns had started out 6–0 but faltered after racial divisions cropped up within the team. Some black players believed white teammates <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> to play ahead of them because of their race. Toward {{the end of the}} season, Collier met with the team's leaders and told them the racism had to stop. After the season, he traded away players he thought were sowing discord and opened up a dialogue with those who remained to stamp out the tension.|$|E

5|$|After touring Who's Next, and needing time {{to write}} a follow-up, Townshend insisted that the Who take a lengthy break, as they had not stopped touring since the band started. There was no group {{activity}} until May 1972, when they started working on a proposed new album, Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!, but, unhappy with the recordings, abandoned the sessions. Tensions began to emerge as Townshend believed Daltrey just wanted a money-making band and Daltrey thought Townshend's projects <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> pretentious. Moon's behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic through excessive drinking and drugs use, {{and a desire to}} party and tour. Daltrey performed an audit of the group's finances and discovered that Lambert and Stamp had not kept sufficient records. He believed them to be no longer effective managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed. The painful dissolution of the managerial and personal relationships are recounted in James D. Cooper's 2014 retrospective documentary, Lambert & Stamp. Following a short European tour, the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of Tommy with Lou Reizner.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time gay men <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> sick in the U.S., doctors in Paris, France, were {{receiving}} patients who were African or {{who had lived in}} Africa with the same symptoms as Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, and doctor Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus. As a scientific necessity to compare it to the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} as he was collaborating with Stipe, and while still a member of Oh-OK, Sweet began writing songs for another project, the Buzz of Delight, which {{consisted}} of Sweet and former Oh-OK drummer David Pierce. In October 1983, they recorded a six-song EP, Soundcastles, released {{in the spring of}} 1984 on DB Records, and performed in New York, Florida and Georgia State to promote it. In the summer and November 1984, the Buzz of Delight recorded more songs, none of which were immediately released. (In 1990, one previously unreleased Buzz of Delight track appeared on the DB Records compilation Squares Blot out the Sun, and, in 2002, three others on To Understand.) Meanwhile, Stipe continued his work with R.E.M., who <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> acclaim and success with their album Murmur. In 1983, it was named album of the year by Rolling Stone and Trouser Press, and by the middle of 1984, it had sold 200,000 copies. In November 1983, R.E.M. began recording their follow-up, Reckoning.|$|E
