30|$|In the {{components}} discussed so far, the changing number of <b>working</b> <b>days</b> leads to a proportional {{change in the}} volume of work. This would result in an excessively volatile productivity development caused by calendar-effects. Therefore, working time elasticities specific to economic branches are needed to approximate the correlation between a change of number of <b>working</b> <b>days</b> and a change of labour volume. These working-time elasticities should measure by how many hours the annual hours worked change when more or less <b>working</b> <b>days</b> are available, and hence the latter {{are not included in}} annual hours worked one-to-one. As suitable data for estimating these effects are not available, we take the elasticities to correspond to <b>working</b> <b>days</b> elasticities of production calculated by the German Bundesbank. These elasticities indicate the percentage by which the production increases if the potential working hours are extended by one per cent due to (the fraction of) an additional <b>working</b> <b>day.</b> The estimated <b>working</b> <b>day</b> effect reflects the difference of production carried out at a normal work day and the production carried out at a weekend day.|$|R

A signal in the skewness of the lower-level relative humidity distribution over the ensemble suggests that a dry lower troposphere can prevent development of a model cyclone. The local minimum in many variables' time series suggests the presence of an initial disturbance that is suddenly enhanced, becoming a model tropical cyclone, as has been noted in observations...|$|R

30|$|In the {{calculations}} {{of the number}} of potential <b>working</b> <b>days</b> a five-day week is assumed throughout.

Regional holidays that do not apply throughout Germany are weighted with the number of employees subject to social insurance contributions within the states (Bundesländer) level to calculate averages.
