5000|$|In my {{next life}} I intend to return as a novelist, {{but in this}} one, lacking the ability to invent characters, I go looking {{for them in the}} real world. But that {{relieves}} me of having to pass the hurdle that novelists generally face: is their work believable? As the critic Christopher Benfey once wrote, ‘One advantage of writing nonfiction is that it doesn’t have to be plausible; it just has to be true.’ And so I’ve found my raw material in life itself, sometimes in the present, more often in the past.I'm particularly attracted to writing about times and places when people felt a moral imperative to confront evil: whether in bearing witness to the prison camps of Stalin’s Soviet Union, battling apartheid in South Africa, exposing the forced labor system that King Leopold II of Belgium imposed on the Congo, working to end slavery in the British Empire, or resisting the madness of the First World War. I’m working now on a book about American volunteers and journalists in the Spanish Civil War. Getting to know some {{of the men and women}} who took part in these struggles has taken me to the ruins of gulag camps in the Russian Arctic, to townships, villages and miners’ camps in various parts of Africa, and to the libraries and archives where diaries and letters of people from earlier times can be found. Those journeys in time can be just as moving as the ones in geography: what a thrill it was to page through the small, leather-bound pocket notebook that an abolitionist organizer took with him on a stagecoach trip to Scotland in 1792, filled with accounts of those he met and with admonitions to himself.

Try like hell to be accurate. Remember how much you don’t know. Write in a way that will make your reader keep on reading.Is there any profession I would rather have? There isn’t.

The majority of this rather large collection is split two ways: modern fantasy novels and books on or from the classical antiquity.

I just had to get my hands on fantasy books. I kept growing and growing my collection until my senior year in high school, when, as an AP Latin student, I read Vergil’s Aeneid in Latin. Although I had always had a love for ancient Greece and Rome, reading this work changed my life, and I decided to become a Classics major.

Burke [...] "distrusted the young producer", and often spoke of him disparagingly, but later acknowledged Berns as [...] "a genius" [...] and [...] "a great writer, a great man." [...] Cissy Houston, who provided backing vocals on several of Burke's songs that were produced by Berns, believed [...] "Burke changed his mind about Bert as soon as Sol started working with him in the studio.

5000|$|The {{relationship}} between Orthodoxy and feminism {{is more complicated}} than women to run to minyan three times a day on time - acting like men, if you will. As I’ve said many times, there is a whole slew of reasons why women do not come “on time” or perhaps at all - whether it’s that they are still doing the bulk of childcare and food preparation on Shabbat, whether they are still recovering from years of alienation and a private resistance that makes reading the paper on Shabbat morning very attractive, or whether they have internalized the message that if they don’t count for minyan, it doesn’t really matter if they come anyway. But more than that, the assumption that feminist resistance entails women acting like men is misguided.For one thing, everything that men are expected to do as “Orthodox” - whether being “on time” three times a day or standing without talking from beginning to end of the service - assumes female servitude. The only reason men have been able to insist on “on time” and fulfilling all their other rigid, ritualistic obligations is because they have always been able to count on women to cook, clean and watch the kids. These assumptions persist today - not only in Orthodoxy. It is not uncommon for men to plan business trips without regard to home needs, they continue to work the longest hours they can knowing that someone at home is picking up the slack, and as such they continue to buy into notions that they should be praying in a group of ten men three times a day despite the strain these assumptions place on female labor. To wit: Nachum’s entire model for Orthodox masculinity is the “yeshiva bachur,” the single student whose every need is taken care of by - whom? The community? The mother? The wife? It doesn’t matter. There continues to be an idealization of religious practice that is fully dependent on the servitude of someone else, usually women. So if women want access to this, they have a problem. Who is serving their needs so they can freely and happily get to shul?More than that, there is a more profound point: I submit that women find the standard male practice absent of meaning. Female cultures of spirituality are emotion-filled, personal, engaging, musical, spontaneous, surrounded by people, connections, children, and friendships. Jews have been praying {{more or less the same}} way from a certain book with the same pages upon pages of words for recitation for, oh, a few thousand years give or take. So when push comes to shove and women gain access to those practices, the celebration is short lived. For this we struggled so hard? This is what we were looking for all this time? No wonder so many women say, okay, but no thanks. Women seeking access to this space from which they are systematically excluded are disappointed with their own culture. Because it is not really their culture - it is men’s culture. The Orthodox synagogue, even when women are involved, remains a men’s space based on men’s culture.Ultimately, I think that the real reason why women are not running to synagogue is found in the core of this research. If we look at Orthodox masculinity, and compare it to Orthodox femininity (leaving aside for the moment the issue of hierarchy between them and the exercise of power from one to the other), on the level of a simple collection of characteristics that we will call “male” and characteristics that we will call “female”, it becomes clear why women are not rushing into the male world. Women are socialized as carers, a role which undoubtedly entails servitude, physical restrictions, and enormous amounts of unpaid labor, but also involves love, warmth, friendship, relationship, care, flexibility, and home. Men, by contrast, are socialized as mechanistic performers, with all the accompanying status, power, strength, and freedom for sure, but the construct is emotionless, connection-less, cold, and demanding, and leaves little room for individual expression or even ambivalence. In fact, to be a man may provide personal power, and it certainly has physical, social and monetary rewards, but it does not necessarily involve freedom. Being mounted with expectations of three times a day rote repetition and performance among emotionless peers - and calling that prayer, as if it is actually a spiritual expression - is not all that attractive. It is especially not attractive to women who have experienced something else. Women who have experienced friendship, sharing, deep caring and the love between women look at what goes on between men and think, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> become that? I think that’s the real reason women aren’t all that interested in running to do the man’s thing in synagogue. Being a woman, at the end of the day, is much nicer than being a man." ...|$|E

40|$|My lived {{experience}} and my wish to volunteer The creative and interactive volunteering that I will describe is set within my own {{lived experience}}. During my adult life, I {{have suffered from}} mental illness and have been an inpatient. These periods are crippling to the mind and so often confidence is lost. My experience is that mental illness is an infliction upon a person’s life that is so often misunderstood. I was passionate about {{being involved in the}} ongoing change in mental health services, but alongside this was a lack of confidence, which had been knocked due to months of dark depression. The desire to volunteer in the hospital where I was once admitted for treatment was a decision I made jointly with my care staff. It aided my ongoing recovery and fulfilled a need in me to return to a working environment. It also helped me to gain confidence and the environment felt safe to me. At the time, my friends and family were concerned about this choice of occupation. They found it hard to understand <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to return to a place of emotional pain. In June 2009 I found myself standing {{in front of an audience}} of professionals presenting a paper at the National Occupational Therapists Conference. I was nervous and excited at having been given such an opportunity to share my story of the volunteer work I have been involved with over the past two years. This article is the story of that journey. I will describe how and why I have chosen to volunteer. I will also explain some project work that I have developed with hospital staff. Finally, I will outline the importance of this occupation in my recovery experience. My life roles and interests I am a mother, an artist and was, until recently, a volunteer visitor at a local psychiatric inpatient hospital in Gloucestershire. I used to visit patients regularly and was also a volunteer artist-in-residence at the hospital. Over the last two years, this has given me the chance to use my creative skills in a number of art projects within the occupational therapy department, in partnership with service users and staff.

40|$|Q. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> drive a {{capacitive}} load? A. It’s {{usually not}} a matter of choice. In most cases, the load capacitance is not from a capacitor you’ve added intentionally; most often it’s an unwanted parasitic, such as the capacitance of a length of coaxial cable. However, situations do arise where it’s desirable to decouple a dc voltage at the output of an op amp—for example, when an op amp is used to invert a reference voltage and drive a dynamic load. In this case, you might want to place bypass capacitors directly on the output of an op amp. Either way, a capacitive load affects the op amp’s performance...|$|E
40|$|What is RefWorks and <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> use it? RefWorks is {{a web-based}} {{software}} application {{that helps you}} manage citations. It helps you {{keep track of the}} sources you are using for your research and your own notes about the sources. It is web-based (no special software installation, downloads, or plug-ins required.) It will also create bibliographies for you in the format you specify (APA, IEEE, etc.). What are the main features of RefWorks? RefWorks is internet-accessible and allows each user a private account. WARNING: You must register from a computer on the Drexel campus network the first time you use RefWorks. RefWorks allows you to import references from many of the electronic databases available on the Drexel University Libraries ' web site (www. library. drexel. edu). You can conveniently compile a list of sources you intend to read [...] as you identify them [...] and save the list online in RefWorks. RefWorks interacts with Microsoft Word (the “Write-N-Cite ” feature) so that you can insert footnotes and a bibliography while you are writing your paper.

40|$|I don’t {{have direct}} access to my medical record, {{although}} I could ask to see it under Ontario’s Personal Health Information Protection Act. 1 My physician is obliged to let me see my medical record, barring a few specific circum-stances, and is required to grant me access to it within 60 days, although in some regions 90 days “is permissible” (really?). For access, I would almost certainly be charged a fee. The situation is similar in other jurisdictions: legal rights with hoops and speed bumps. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> view or ask to amend my medical record? After all, it is (currently) pretty thin. I’ve lived in Can-ada for only a year, and I’ve visited my family doctor only twice. Well, that’s entirely the point. I’d like {{to make sure that}} all the information that is relevant is there. Many patients move cities, provinces or countries, and gather a patchy medi-cal record over a lifetime. Physicians have a duty to ensure that medical records are accurate and complete. Although physi...|$|E
