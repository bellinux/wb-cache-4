To {{improve the quality of}} <b>rolled</b> <b>wire</b> it is necessary to obtain continuous casting specimen with the maximum possible length of the zone of equiaxial crystals, dispersed centerline segregation, centerline porosity being welded in the process of hot plastic deformation. Objective. To investigate the continuous casting specimen dendritic structure influence on structure formation in <b>rolled</b> <b>wire</b> associated with the segregation phenomena. Methods. The research was carried out on the industrial continuous casting lots with the initial cross section of 125 ´ 125 mm from C 82 D and C 86 D steels and 11, 0 mm in the ready-made diameter. The optical light microscope «Axiovert 200 M MAT» and the binocular microscope «MBI- 2 » were used. Results. The formation of dendritic structures is most favorable if electromagnetic mixing (EMM) technology is used. In the rolled steel products, made at continuous casting with EMM, {{there is a tendency to}} spreading segregation and structural banding, as well as a decrease in the width of martensitic areas. Conclusions. The positive effect of electromagnetic mixing on the reduction in the width of martensitic areas in <b>rolled</b> <b>wire,</b> as well as on the change in the length of the various zones of the dendritic structure in cross-section continuous casting specimen has been established.

Indeed, contrarily to standard encircling differential transducers, they are sensitive to any kind of flaws, including long ones, and can determine their angular positions. In addition, the rotation speed of the magnetic field can easily reach values much larger than those possible with rotating probes devices. As a consequence, they make possible the inspection of the whole surface of products moving at very high speed (up to 80 meters per second for hot <b>wire</b> being <b>rolled).</b> Finally, the mechanical simplicity of these transducers enables the insertion of cooling circuits and, therefore, the testing of hot products...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{paper has}} studied the {{formation}} mechanism of frame-shaped segregation in 40 Cr <b>wire</b> rod <b>rolled</b> from bloom {{by means of the}} composition measurement, the electron microscopic observation and the energy spectrum analysis method. The results show that the frame-shaped segregation in wire rod originated from the positive segregation in columnar-to-equiaxed grain transition zone of bloom. The main influence factors are the solidification behavior of liquid steel in columnar-to-equiaxed grain transition zone, the temperature gradient of different solidification regions in bloom, the diffusion rate of the solute and inclusions in transition zone and so on. It may reduce the frame-shaped segregation by improving the purity of liquid steel, adopting the electromagnetic stirring in secondary cooling zone and enhancing the cooling intensity of the secondary cooling zone...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{parameters}} that significantly affect the electrical performance of ceramic-core superconducting composite wire and tapes, which remain ambiguous and require more labor on their optimization. BSCCO 2212 {{has not been}} paid the attention and investment it deserves. In this regard, all optimization efforts were made for BSCCO 2223. In our work, a practical and inexpensive manufacturing method, thermally and mechanically optimized for Pb doped BiSrCaCuO 2212 superconducting multifilament (38 filaments) wires and tapes, was successfully employed. Optimized parameters can be classified under material, mechanical (deformation) and heat treatment (thermal) subgroups. Parameters involved with materials included investigation of deformation behavior of two different sheath metals; pure silver and 0. 02 % magnesia dispersion reinforced silver alloy. Pb doped BiSrCaCuO 2212 ceramic superconductor powder, the other source of material related parameters, was synthesized following the "Thermal Co-decomposition or Wet Mix" method. Fabrication of mono and multifilament wires with Oxide Powder in Tube (OPIT) method followed next. Optimization of drawing deformation was practiced to achieve the best ceramic grain alignment and smoother ceramic powder core/metal sheath interface {{in order to avoid}} "sausaging" in <b>wires.</b> <b>Rolling</b> of the <b>wire</b> products into tapes by following different deformation regimes was the other manufacturing stage of the project. Variable and constant reduction-per-pass deformation paths were employed to reveal their effects on our composites with distinct sheath material and filament formation. The search for the best (optimum) heat treatment schedule for our Bi 2212 superconductor composites, a modified version of "step solidification partial melting", was employed successfully. A solution through tried recipes for the bubbling problem that occurred with our tapes was also addressed. Electrical performance tests of fully reacted wires were carried out in our laboratory and very promising results were attained...|$|R

In our study, a method to safely remove electrospun tubes from a template mandrel (collector) is described. Before electrospinning, a copper <b>wire</b> is <b>rolled</b> up on the mandrel to form a helix, with the purpose of creating a gap between mandrel and electrospun tube once the wire is easily removed from the mandrel.
