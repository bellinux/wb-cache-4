40|$|In {{the last}} decade wind energy {{has proven to be}} one of the most {{competitive}} and fastest growing sources of renewable energy. Currently the problem of evaluating the site-specific wind potential is showing the main difficulties since it is faced only using on-site anemometric long-term monitoring and <b>wind</b> <b>atlases.</b> Usually information published on <b>wind</b> <b>atlases</b> traces a territorial map of the wind speeds in correspondence with different heights. This documents represent a good starting-point for a preliminary site analysis, but it fails to give reliable customized information to support the evaluation and, eventually, the activation of potential investments. Undoubtedly, the on-site direct anemometric monitoring gives more reliable information because it is directly taken from the site. However, it is costly and lengthy because wide temporal windows (of at least one year) are required to accurately characterize the site-specific wind potential. In order to obtain a both reliable and timely analysis, this paper proposes to integrate the above two sources of knowledge by a Bayesian approach, implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The proposed methodology, combining prior information (e. g. obtained from atlases and/or fluid-dynamic assessment) with sampling data, furnishes robust and timely posterior information. Real sampling data, collected from a southern Italian site, are analysed in order to illustrate the main features of the proposed methodology and to test the adopted filtering strategy to face the high correlation which characterize the anemometric data. The results of the example show that the proposed Bayes methodology fits the applicative needs very well. In particular the attained precision of the estimates carried out from one-month sample is comparable to the one of the ML estimates from the corresponding whole (one-year) sample...|$|R

Data is key to any major engineering project, but when we start to look to offshore development, the importance of having high quality, reliable data is an order of magnitude higher. Data governs the financial aspect of the project.

30|$|The results {{corresponding}} to the objectives are as follows: a) The spatial pattern of wind speed was similar between PRECIS simulation (1961 – 1990) and Canadian <b>Wind</b> Energy <b>Atlas.</b> The mean absolute difference of the mean wind speed between PRECIS simulation, <b>Wind</b> Energy <b>Atlas</b> and the observed data were 0.73 and 0.84 [*]m/s respectively, indicating a successful climate simulation. b) The PRECIS simulation (2071 – 2100) suggested decreasing wind speed over the populated southern Ontario relative to the baseline period. These changes would be more intense in the A 2 than in B 2 scenario, and lead to statistically {{significant differences in the}} grid cell mean wind speed. c) Based on case studies around Erie Shores, James Bay and Georgian Bay, it was showed that the changes of wind power production may not be in proportion to the changes of average wind speed, due to the possible variations of wind speed distribution. It would be reasonable to develop onshore or offshore wind energy industry around Georgian Bay and James Bay, considering the projected increasing wind speeds within these areas.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a comprehensive, 8 -year wind {{resource}} assessment programme in Egypt are presented. The objective has been to provide reliable and accurate <b>wind</b> <b>atlas</b> data sets for evaluating the potential wind power output from large electricity-producing wind turbine installations. The regional wind climates of Egypt have been determined by two independent methods: a traditional <b>wind</b> <b>atlas</b> based on observations from more than 30 stations all over Egypt, and a numerical <b>wind</b> <b>atlas</b> based on long-term reanalysis data and a mesoscale model (KAMM). The mean absolute error comparing the two methods is about 10 % for two large-scale KAMM domains covering all of Egypt, and typically about 5 % for several smaller-scale regional domains. The numerical <b>wind</b> <b>atlas</b> covers all of Egypt, whereas the meteorological stations are concentrated in six regions. The numerical <b>wind</b> <b>atlas</b> database, in combination with SRTM 3 elevation data and satellite imagery, provide the means for immediate WAsP wind resource assessments anywhere in Egypt. In addition to the very high wind resource in the Gulfs of Suez and Aqaba, the <b>wind</b> <b>atlas</b> has discovered a large region in the Western Desert with a fairly high resource – close to consumers and the electrical grid.
