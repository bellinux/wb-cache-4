40|$|The textile {{industry}} processes a large quantity of fibres obtained from various animals of which wool is commercially the most important. However, {{it has some}} technical problems which affect the quality and performance of the finished products such as felting shrinkage, handle, lustre, pilling and dyeability. These problems may be attributed mainly {{to the presence of}} <b>wool</b> <b>scales</b> on the fibre surface. The scales are relatively hard and have sharp edges which are responsible for causing fibre directional movement and shrinkage during felting. Furthermore, the scales also serve as a barrier for diffusion processes which will adversely affect the sorption behaviour. In recent years, there has been an increase in the modification of <b>wool</b> surface <b>scales</b> by physical means such as mechanical, thermal and ultrasonic treatments, and chemical methods such as oxidation, reduction, enzyme and ozone treatments which can solve the felting and sorption problems to a certain extent.

50|$|Using a {{powerful}} xenon arc lamp, 1 lumen of light is focused through a optical fiber onto a 300-400 μm spot of the object’s surface. The reflected light is collected {{by a second}} fiber optic. The period of exposure is monitored with a probe that transforms the reflectance spectrum into color coordinates in real-time. A typical microfading test is achieved in less than 10 minutes and replicates exposures equivalent to 5-12 years of display at normal museum light levels. The output of the xenon arc lamp is kept at a constant by an exposure controller while it is filtered to 400-710 nm using a water filter. The spectrum is then used to quantify {{the amount of time}} it would take for the color change to result in a noticeable difference. This information is used to retrofit display conditions and improve the protection of vulnerable objects.Calibration of the instrument is achieved by using internal standards such as the Blue <b>Wool</b> <b>Scale.</b>|$|E

SEM images showed the tip of <b>wool</b> <b>scale</b> was smoothened {{and parts of the}} scale were peeled off after {{hydrogen peroxide}} treatment. The time for a water droplet to sink into the fabric could decrease to less than 1 s and the wicking properties of wool fabrics were dramatically improved after hydrogen peroxide treatment. Shrinkage and whiteness of the fabric were improved due to the modification of scale and the bleaching effect of hydrogen peroxide, respectively. The fabrics became weaker and ductile with less than 4 % weight loss. This study would benefit further application of wool fiber in summer clothing in which the surface wettability and moisture transfer properties are essential and determinative. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{tendency}} of wool to felt and shrink is mainly {{due to its}} scaly structure. The enzymatic treatment of textiles significantly improves some of their properties as well as increases their aesthetic values and comfort of use. The application of enzymes in the wool modification process was studied, and it was proven that the application of enzymes has an important influence on changes in the surface structure. However, although proteases are large molecules, their attack is not only limited to the scales, they penetrate inside the fibre causing unacceptable weight and strength loss. It is believed that if the proteases are chemically modified {{in order to increase}} their molecular weight, then they will act just {{on the surface of the}} fibres, thus providing wool with anti-shrinking behaviour. The free enzyme penetrated into wool fibre cortex while the modified enzyme, with a bigger size, was retained at the surface, in the cuticle layer. Modified proteases can be a promising alternative for wool bio-finishing processes at an industrial level, since it is an effective way of removing <b>wool</b> <b>scales...</b>|$|R
50|$|Wool is {{produced}} by follicles which are small cells located in the skin. These follicles {{are located in the}} upper layer of the skin called the epidermis and push down into the second skin layer called the dermis as the wool fibers grow. Follicles can be classed as either primary or secondary follicles. Primary follicles produce three types of fiber, Kemp (wool), medullated fibers and true wool fibers. Secondary follicles only produce true wool fibers. Medullated fibers share nearly identical characteristics to hair and are long but lack crimp and elasticity. Kemp fibers are very coarse and shed out. <b>Wool's</b> <b>scaling</b> and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together. Because of the crimp, wool fabrics have greater bulk than other textiles, and they hold air, which causes the fabric to retain heat. Wool has a high specific heat coefficient, so it impedes heat transfer in general. This effect has benefited desert peoples, as Bedouins and Tuaregs use wool clothes for insulation.|$|R
40|$|The <b>wool</b> <b>scale</b> {{present on}} the fibre surface gives rise to certain {{unwanted}} effects such as felting and poor wettability in textile wet processing. In general practice, the removal of scale was done either by surface modification through physical/chemical degradation of scale or by deposition of a polymer on the scale. In modern treatment, combination of both methods is usually carried out. Since the deposition of a polymer on the fibre surface depends much on the surface characteristic of the fibre, therefore, the surface property of modified fibre {{is an important factor}} for polymer application. On the other hand, the surface modification methods may also result in improved hydrophilicity of fibre. The present paper investigated the surface physico-chemical properties of wool fibre under the influence of different surface modification treatments: (i) low temperature plasma (LTP) treatment with nitrogen gas and (ii) chlorination. The surface physico-chemical properties of the LTP-treated and chlorinated wool fibres were studied which included contact angle measurement with different solvents, determination of critical surface tension and surface free energy. Experimental results showed that these selected properties were altered after the surface modification treatments.

Most of the discussions on the applications of LTP treatment on wool fiber were focused on applying this technique for improving the surface wettability and shrink resistance. Meanwhile, little discussion has been made on the mechanical properties, thermal properties, and the air permeability. In this paper, wool fabric was treated with LTP treatment with the use of a non-polymerizing gas, namely oxygen.

In this study, corona discharge was combined with a hydrogen peroxide treatment to improve the hydrophilic properties of wool fabric. Scanning electron microscopy photographs showed that the tip of <b>wool</b> <b>scales</b> was etched after corona discharge and that parts of the scales were peeled off after the hydrogen peroxide treatment. The surface hydrophilic properties of the wool fabric were improved greatly by corona discharge.

The hydrogen peroxide treatment could improve the hydrophilic properties and especially the wicking properties of the wool fabric. The fabric became weaker and flexible with an average weight loss of 3 % after the hydrogen peroxide treatment. A combination of corona discharge treatment and the hydrogen peroxide treatment made the wool fabric absolutely hydrophilic; the water penetration time of the treated fabric was less than 1 s even when the fabric was washed for several cycles or stored tor 6 months. ...|$|R

40|$|Wool surface comprehends {{numerous}} scales {{which are}} responsible of certain undesirable behavior of this fiber during its use and maintenance. One {{of the most}} significant issues is related to shrinkage, caused during washing, as a consequence of friction between the fibers. Chemical modification of wool is considered a useful option to avoid these kind of circumstances. During the last years, multiple alternatives for chemical modification of wool have been studied, comprising enzymes or acids amongst others. In this case of study, three different treatments were carried out in order to evaluate wool morphological appearance. The first treatment was an oxidative procedure, containing Basolan DC and sodium acetate as the main components. The second treatment was accomplished using Lanaperm VPO, a commercial finishing agent for wool fiber that claims to soften its surface. The third finishing process was performed employing Siligen FA, a commercial agent intended to act as an antimigrant for dye baths and also provide a smoother and regular surface. After said treatments, microphotographs of all treated and untreated fibers were taken so that a comparison between final appearance could be done. Analyzing results and conclusions, it can be stated that chemical modification of fiber does change its surface appearance and, consequently, its behaviour.
