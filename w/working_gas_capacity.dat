25|$|The {{consuming}} east region, {{particularly the}} states in the northern part, heavily rely on stored gas to meet the peak demand during the cold winter months. Due to the prevailing cold winters, large population centers and developed infrastructure, {{it is not surprising that}} this region has the highest level of <b>working</b> <b>gas</b> storage <b>capacity</b> of the other regions and the largest number of storage sites, mainly in depleted reservoirs. In addition to underground storage, LNG is increasingly playing a crucial role in providing supplemental backup and/or peaking supply to LDCs on a short term basis. Although the total capacity for these LNG facilities does not match those of underground storage in scale, the short term high deliverability makes up for that.|$|R

Especially during the winter months, the stored gas must then be supplied at fuli capacity for short periods. Currently storage capacities of existing UGS facilities in Poland are not fully sufficient for proper regulation of gas demand. The more they do not overcome long term limitation in gas supply from import. There is therefore a need for increasing capacity of existing UGS or development of new ones. This paper presents an analytical model based on equations of material balance combined with well inflow and tubing performance equations for modeling gas storage operations. Presented model was used to maximize the capacity and efficiency of natural gas storage developed in partially depleted gas fields located {{in the region of}} south-eastern Poland for a given reservoir/well configuration. On the basis of this model variant scenario of gas storage operation with the use of vertical and horizontal wells were demonstrated. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{the results of}} a two-phase study that examines the economic and technical feasibility of converting a conventional natural gas storage facility in bedded salt into a refrigerated natural gas storage facility for the purpose of increasing the <b>working</b> <b>gas</b> <b>capacity</b> of the facility. The conceptual design used to evaluate this conversion is based on the design that was developed for the planned Avoca facility in Steuben County, New York. By decreasing the cavern storage temperature from 43 C to - 29 C (110 F to - 20 F), the <b>working</b> <b>gas</b> <b>capacity</b> of the facility can be increased by about 70 percent (from 1. 2 x 10 {sup 8 } Nm{sup 3 } or 4. 4 billion cubic feet (Bcf) to 2. 0 x 10 {sup 8 } Nm{sup 3 } or 7. 5 Bcf) while maintaining the original design minimum and maximum cavern pressures. In Phase I of the study, laboratory tests were conducted to determine the thermal conductivity of salt at low temperatures. Finite element heat transfer calculations were then made to determine the refrigeration loads required to maintain the caverns at a temperature of - 29 C (- 20 F). This was followed by a preliminary equipment design and a cost analysis for the converted facility. The capital cost of additional equipment and its installation required for refrigerated storage is estimated to be about $ 13, 310, 000 or $ 160 per thousand Nm{sup 3 } ($ 4. 29 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf)) of additional <b>working</b> <b>gas</b> <b>capacity.</b> The additional operating costs include maintenance refrigeration costs to maintain the cavern at - 29 C (- 20 F) and processing costs to condition the gas during injection and withdrawal. The maintenance refrigeration cost, based on the current energy cost of about $ 13. 65 per megawatt-hour (MW-hr) ($ 4 per million British thermal units (MMBtu)), is expected to be about $ 316, 000 after the first year and to decrease as the rock surrounding the cavern is cooled. After 10 years, the cost of maintenance refrigeration based on the $ 13. 65 per MW-hr ($ 4 per MMBtu) energy cost is estimated to be $ 132, 000. The gas processing costs are estimated to be $ 2. 05 per thousand Nm{sup 3 } ($ 0. 055 per Mcf) of gas injected into and withdrawn from the facility based on the $ 13. 65 per MW-hr ($ 4 per MMBtu) energy cost. In Phase II of the study, laboratory tests were conducted to determine mechanical properties of salt at low temperature. This was followed by thermomechanical finite element simulations to evaluate the structural stability of the cavern during refrigerated storage. The high thermal expansion coefficient of salt is expected to result in tensile stresses leading to tensile failure in the roof, walls, and floor of the cavern as it is cooled. Tensile fracturing of the cavern roof may result in loss of containment of the gas and/or loss of integrity of the casing shoe, deeming the conversion of this facility not technically feasible...|$|E

Material model development activities include acquisition of salt core for testing, laboratory testing, and regression analyses to determine site-specific model parameter values that describe the behavior of salt around a storage cavern.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to conduct a {{field-scale}} application demonstrating the use of continuum damage mechanics to determine the minimum allowable operating pressure of compressed natural gas storage caverns in salt formations. A geomechanical study was performed of two natural gas storage caverns (one existing and one planned) utilizing state-of-the-art salt mechanics to assess the potential for cavern instability and collapse. The geomechanical study consisted primarily of laboratory testing, theoretical development, and analytical/numerical tasks. A total of 50 laboratory tests was performed on salt specimens to aid in the development and definition of the material model used to predict the behavior of rock salt. Material model refinement was performed that improved the predictive capability of modeling salt during damage healing, recovery of work-hardened salt, and the behavior of salt at stress states other than triaxial compression. Results of this study showed that the <b>working</b> <b>gas</b> <b>capacity</b> of the existing cavern could be increased by 18 percent and the planned cavern could be increased by 8 percent using the proposed method compared to a conventional stress-based method.
