50|$|The Neoplatonists though {{sought to}} exhibit the {{philosophical}} ideas of Plato and Aristotle as a unity. Porphyry (3rd century) attempted {{in a special}} work to show the agreement of Aristotelian and Platonist philosophy and wrote a number of commentaries on Plato, Aristotle, and Theophrastus. Additional commentaries on Plato were written by Dexippus, Plutarch of Athens, and Syrianus. A partial translation and commentary in Latin of Plato's Timaeus by Calcidius was significant for being the only substantial work of Plato known to scholars in the Latin west for approximately 800 years. The best commentaries date from this era; most {{of the works of}} Proclus are commentaries on single dialogues of Plato and similar subjects. The commentaries on Plato were either given in lectures or written; and many have come down to us. Later Neoplatonist commentators on Plato whose <b>works</b> <b>partially</b> survive include Damascius and Olympiodorus.|$|E
50|$|Beginning {{with her}} Elegiac Sonnets in 1784, Smith {{included}} autobiographical material in her works, relaying “a saga {{of her own}} marital unhappiness, poverty and anxiety about her children”. Readers purchased her <b>works</b> <b>partially</b> {{because they wanted to}} hear the unfolding story of her life. The narratives of Jessy and Sophy contain references to Smith's own life that readers of the Sonnets would have recognised and to which reviewers alluded. For example, Sophy's marriage to a merchant whose wealth was built on the slave trade, her suffering as a mother, and the loss of her children, all parallel Smith's own life. The heroine is widely read and a poet, signalling her connection with Smith. For Celestina, “literature is talismanic, her greatest help in times of trouble”, as it was for Smith. Celestina takes a trip to the Hebrides where she writes poetry and watches her friend's husband die in a shipwreck, mimicking an illustration Thomas Stothard made for the fifth edition of the Sonnets. This section of the novel is particularly redolent with autobiographical references, with Benjamin Smith, Smith's husband, represented by Elphinstone, in a portrait that partially redeems him after his portrayal as Mr. Stafford in Emmeline. In her heroising of the author figure, Smith was helping to create Romanticism.|$|E

5000|$|Jonathan Mwe di Malila uses strong, {{vibrant and}} {{unbroken}} colours. Inspired by Fauvism and Pop-Art he aims {{to counteract the}} fugacity of impressionistic paintings to give the artwork more duration. Many of his paintings include african or congolese elements, combined with everyday objects, subjects and situation to create a funny content. His main Medium is oil, which he often combines with acrylics or typicall african fabrics, such as african wax prints. His art has no political intent, it just serves to uplift his heritage and bring his culture to people. Also, some of his art appears to be naive. These <b>works</b> <b>partially</b> depict childish and elementary vision of the artist and act as spontaneous expressions of himself. In his latest series, Jonathan Mwe di Malila {{was inspired by the}} [...] "Gentlemen of Bacongo" [...] or better known as Les Sapeurs. These men, based in Brazzaville, are known for their dapper eye-catching clothing and have been inspirational to several artists and designer such as Solange Knowles for her music video [...] "Losing You" [...] and designer Paul Smith.Mwe di Malila adapted the Sapeurs in his artwork and brought the subject with strong, unbroken and bright colours to canvas. He integrated african fabrics as his artistical interpretation. Since he is from Kinshasa, the other Congo State, he gave his series the name [...] "Les Gens de coleur de Kinshasa", which means [...] "The coloured people from Kinshasa". Jonalthan's work has also been influenced by his favourite artist, Henri Matisse who is also known to be a representative of Fauvism.|$|E

40|$|The Beckett Heat Recovery is {{a series}} of {{techniques}} for recovering low-grade waste heat from flue gas. Until the cost of fossil fuels began rising rapidly, flue gas below 600 F was considered economically unworthy of reclaim. This paper will describe the latest system installation at the John Deere WeIland <b>Works.</b> <b>Partially</b> funded by the Canadian and Ontario Governments in order to demonstrate new energy saving technology, the Beckett Model 2002 employs a heat exchanger which does double duty. During low demand periods, the unit is gas-fired and produces 150 psi steam at high efficiency. In the fall, the heat exchanger is converted to accept flue gas from the large original water tube boilers. The flue gas heats water, which preheats make-up air and boiler feedwater. Several of the Beckett Systems presently operating use year-round heat recovery exchangers on constant loads. The newest development is the Series 2004 condensing system that reduces flue gas temperature to within 15 F of the heat sink medium...|$|E

40|$|In this {{empirical}} analysis, {{we estimate}} {{the impact of}} vacancy, neglect associated with property-tax delinquency, and foreclosures {{on the value of}} neighboring homes using parcel-level observations. Numerous studies have estimated the impact of foreclosures on neighboring properties, and these papers theorize that the foreclosure impact <b>works</b> <b>partially</b> through creating vacant and neglected homes. To our knowledge, this is only the second attempt to estimate the impact of vacancy itself and the first to estimate the impact of tax-delinquent properties on neighboring home sales. We link vacancy observations from Postal Service data with property-tax delinquency and sales data from Cuyahoga County (the county encompassing Cleveland, Ohio). We estimate hedonic price models with corrections for spatial autocorrelation. We find that an additional property within 500 feet that is vacant, delinquent, or both reduces the home’s selling price by at least 1. 3 percent. In low-poverty areas, tax-current foreclosed homes have large negative impacts of 4. 6 percent. In high-poverty areas, we observe positive correlations of sale prices with tax-current foreclosures and negative correlations with tax-delinquent foreclosures. This may reflect selective foreclosing on better-maintained properties or better maintenance by tax-paying foreclosure auction winners. The marginal medium-poverty census tracts display the largest negative responses to vacancy and delinquency in nearby nonforeclosed homes. Foreclosure; Housing - Prices...|$|E
