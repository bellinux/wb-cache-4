5|$|On {{their first}} stop ashore at St Jago in Cape Verde, Darwin {{found that a}} white band high in the {{volcanic}} rock cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy {{had given him the}} first volume of Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, which set out uniformitarian concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods, and Darwin saw things Lyell's way, theorising and thinking of <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> geology.|$|E
5|$|Development of Django Unchained {{began in}} 2007 when Tarantino was <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> Sergio Corbucci. By April 2011, Tarantino sent his final {{draft of the}} script to The Weinstein Company. Casting began {{in the summer of}} 2011, with Michael K.

Principal photography took place from November 2011 to March 2012 in California, Wyoming and Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} decade, Galileo stayed {{well away from}} the controversy. He revived his project of <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> the subject, {{encouraged}} by the election of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini as Pope Urban VIII in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and had opposed the condemnation of Galileo in 1616. Galileo's resulting book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the Inquisition and papal permission.|$|E

5|$|Martello {{claimed that}} {{in the summer of}} 1964, he moved to Tangier, Morocco, where he {{researched}} the history of the tarot, resulting in the publication of It's in the Cards (1964). Returning to the U.S. in 1965, he moved into an apartment in Greenwich Village, New York City, <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> astrology, It's Written in the Stars, and a book on psychic protection, How to Prevent Psychic Blackmail. He also began attending the Spiritualist gatherings that were operated by Clifford Bias at the Ansonia Hotel. At some point High Priestess Lori Bruno founded a witchcraft coven and church, Our Lord and Lady of the Trinacrian Rose, in which Leo was acknowledged as Elder. In 1969 he publicly revealed himself to be a practitioner of Witchcraft; claiming that he had gained the permission of his coven to do so. Intent on countering the negative publicity that Wicca had been receiving, he published The Weird Ways of Witchcraft in 1969, the same year that he also published The Hidden World of Hypnotism.|$|E

25|$|Darwin {{had already}} been invited by FitzRoy to {{contribute}} his Journal, based on his field notes, as the natural history section of the captain's account of the Beagle's voyage, and this ended up keeping him fully occupied from 13 March {{to the end of}} September. He also plunged into <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> South American Geology, putting his and Lyell's ideas forward against the cataclysmic explanation of mountain formation Alcide d'Orbigny was promoting in a multi-volume account of the continent begun two years previously.|$|E
25|$|Shahak {{had a deep}} {{affinity}} with Spinoza:}he always packed a copy of The Ethics in his suitcase for reading during his periodic stints of service in the Israel Defense Forces, and had been <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> the philosopher before death intervened. His activities as a public intellectual fighting for human rights causes and for a secular state earned him a reputation for controversy, and frequent abuse. He was regularly spat on, frequently given death threats, and decried variously as an Israel basher, self-hating Jew, traitor, and enemy of the people.|$|E
25|$|In Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and a {{few other}} regions, Dalits came under the {{influence}} of the neo-Buddhist movement initiated by Ambedkar. In the 1950s, he turned his attention to Buddhism and travelled to Ceylon to attend a convention of Buddhist scholars and monks. While dedicating a new Buddhist vihara near Pune, he announced that he was <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> Buddhism, and that he planned a formal conversion. Ambedkar twice visited Burma in 1954; the second time to attend a conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists in Rangoon. In 1955, he founded the Bharatiya Bauddha Mahasabha (Buddhist Society of India). He completed writing The Buddha and His Dhamma in 1956.|$|E

25|$|Instead, {{he studied}} Buddhism all his life. Around 1950, he devoted his {{attention}} to Buddhism and travelled to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to attend {{a meeting of the}} World Fellowship of Buddhists. While dedicating a new Buddhist vihara near Pune, Ambedkar announced he was <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> Buddhism, and that when it was finished, he would formally convert to Buddhism. He twice visited Burma in 1954; the second time to attend the third conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists in Rangoon. In 1955, he founded the Bharatiya Bauddha Mahasabha, or the Buddhist Society of India. He completed his final work, The Buddha and His Dhamma, in 1956 which was published posthumously.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, O'Brien started <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> Madonna, {{where she}} {{wanted to look at}} her life and work, as the artist was {{approaching}} the age of fifty. She believed that the general public was eager to know the real-self of Madonna, and she concentrated on finding that out. According to her, [...] "the popular negative stereotype about the artist is that of a publicity-hungry, manipulative ball-breaker, while for many woman she is a beacon of feminism. I have always found her work clear and autobiographical, but her personality complex and disarmingly changeable." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{his work}} on the biography, Steve Turner had {{previously}} written a book about the music group U2, titled U2: Rattle & Hum, and Eric Clapton, titled Conversations With Eric Clapton. Turner first met Van Morrison in 1985, while <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> religion's place in rock music. Turner characterised himself as someone who is [...] "drawn to artists bothered by spiritual issues". In his research for the book, the author interviewed approximately 40 people that knew Van Morrison. Turner spoke with Van Morrison, and they discussed the musician's views on philosophy. Some of the photographs included in the book were obtained by Turner from a guitarist with Van Morrison's band Them.|$|E

500|$|The {{trial began}} on 8 May, under Sir Joseph Cantley, a {{relatively}} obscure High Court judge with limited experience of high-profile cases. To conduct his defence Thorpe engaged George Carman, who {{had established a}} criminal law practice on the Northern Circuit in Manchester; [...] this was his first high-profile national case. Carman undermined Bessell's credibility by revealing his financial interest in Thorpe's conviction: his newspaper contract provided that {{in the event of}} acquittal, only half the £50,000 would be paid. The judge left no doubt as to his own low opinion of Bessell's character; Auberon Waugh, who was <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> the trial, thought that Cantley's general attitude to other prosecution witnesses became increasingly one-sided. On 7 June Deakin testified that although he had put Newton in touch with Holmes, he had thought that this was to help someone to deal with a blackmailer—he knew nothing of a conspiracy to kill. Deakin was the only defendant to testify; the others all chose to remain silent and call no witnesses, believing that, based on the testimonies of Bessell, Scott and Newton, the prosecution had failed to make its case. During his closing speech on behalf of Thorpe, Carman raised the possibility that Holmes and others might have organised a conspiracy without Thorpe's knowledge.|$|E
500|$|Though Daubeny's {{book in the}} Beagles library {{described}} the volcanic geology of the Canary Islands, it said that {{the structure of the}} Cape Verde Islands was [...] "too imperfectly known". Darwin saw Quail Island as his key to understanding the structure of St. Jago, and made careful studies of its stratigraphy in the way he had learnt from Adam Sedgwick. He collected specimens and described a white layer of hard white rock formed from crushed coral and seashells lying between layers of black volcanic rocks, and noted a similar white layer running horizontally in the black cliffs of St. Jago at [...] above sea level. The seashells were, {{as far as he could}} tell, [...] "the same as those of present day". He speculated that in geologically recent times a lava flow had covered this shell sand on the sea bed, and then the strata had slowly risen to their present level. Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology presented a thesis of gradual rising and falling of the Earth's crust illustrated by the changing levels of the Temple of Serapis. Darwin implicitly supported Lyell by remarking that [...] "Dr. Daubeny when mentioning the present state of the temple of Serapis. doubts the possibility of a surface of country being raised without cracking buildings on it. – I feel sure at St Jago in some places a town might have been raised without injuring a house." [...] In a letter to Henslow he wrote that [...] "The geology was preeminently interesting & I believe quite new: there are some facts on a large scale of upraised coast... that would interest Mr. Lyell. While still on the island, Darwin was inspired to think of <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> geology, and later wrote of [...] "seeing a thing never seen by Lyell, one yet saw it partially through his eyes".|$|E
