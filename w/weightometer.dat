40|$|In this study, {{flue gas}} {{emissions}} from the combustion of eco-fuel briquettes in a ceramic lined stove were investigated. The eco-fuel briquettes {{were made of}} biomass and other waste material such as spent coffee beans, mealie husks, saw dust and coal fines using a hand operated screw press. A combustion set-up consisting of digital <b>weightometer,</b> ceramic lined stove and a complete chimney system was used. The emissions from the combustion process were measured using a Testo 350 gas analyzer linked to the chimney system. The eco-briquettes made from a mixture of waste biomass burnt cleanly within the acceptable exposure limits as set out by Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA). The measured gross calorific value was 18. 9 MJ/kg with a burning rate of 2 g/min. These properties make eco-fuel briquettes suitable for domestic applications...|$|E
40|$|A {{monitoring}} task {{of production}} system (bucket-wheel excavator) is investigated {{for the development}} and realization of a multisensor-based monitoring system. The objective of the monitoring system is to obtain in real time reliable decisions {{on the presence of}} target objects (large stones) in the transported material during the production process to avoid disturbances or failures of the transportation process. Due to the complexity of the considered production system, different physical effects are used {{for the development of the}} multisensor-based monitoring system. The measured signals are acquired using different sensors (five acceleration sensors, two load cells, and a laser scanner). Due to the inevitable and varying time shift between the stimulations of the individual sensors, each signal is individually subjected to preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification process. The proposed monitoring system consists of three modules: acceleration, laser scanner, and decision fusion modules. For the acceleration module which uses acceleration signals of five different acceleration sensors, two detection approaches are developed. The first approach (STFT-SVM) is based on Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) as feature extraction tool, Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification, and a novel decision fusion process to fuse the individual decisions. The second approach (CWT-SVM) is based Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) as feature extraction tool, Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification, and a rule-based decision fusion process to fuse the individual decisions. Both approaches are trained, validated, and tested using real industrial data. The developed approaches show strong improvements in detection and false alarm rates. Due to the implementation complexity and the high number of false alarms of the STFT-SVM approach in comparison to the CWT-SVM approach, the CWT-SVM-based approach is chosen for the development of the overall monitoring system. The Laser scanner module which processes the laser scanner signal consists of prefiltering, filtering, validation, and classification process. The module is validated, and successfully tested on real industrial data. The decision fusion module fuses the decisions of both detection modules in order to obtain a final reliable decision. Three fusion techniques are investigated, which are OR-logic, Bayesian Combination Rule (BCR), and the new developed decision fusion technique Basic Belief Fusion (BBF). Due to the characteristics of the considered application, the OR-Logic is chosen to perform the fusion task. For the online realization, the <b>weightometer</b> module is added to avoid false alarms which could be caused by acceleration module. Additionally modifications and simplification processes are performed in order to overcome the hardware limitations The proposed monitoring approach is developed for online and real time implementation, and it achieves high detection rate, with minimum false alarms rate, thus the production process disturbance is minimized...|$|E

An enclosed product conveyor runs to the vessel loading platform via a causeway and jetty for export in ocean going vessels, ranging from 35,000 dwt Handymax bulk carriers up to 65,000 dwt Ultramax sized vessels, at 4,000 t/h.|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 185 - 187. Massflows on {{conveyor}} belts {{need to be}} measured in various process streams in mineral extraction processes to ensure good plant management. Conventional <b>weightometers</b> are, however, too expensive to allow a widespread installation in these processes. This study investigates more economic means to measure the massflow on horizontal {{conveyor belts}}. A deterioration of accuracy resulting from an instrument using this technique is expected, but the advantages {{of being able to}} instrument entire plants is very attractive. The study uses a model a whereby the kinetic energy of the belt system is determined during a perturbation to the system. From this the massflow can be determined...|$|R
40|$|With the {{advancement}} {{and the wide}} usage of measurement instruments associated with stockpiles, such as <b>weightometers,</b> a smart sensor can be developed to online monitor {{the level of a}} stockpile. Furthermore, the stockpile smart sensor can be used to determine the mixing behaviour of different ores discharged out of the stockpile, by combining the smart sensor technique and element modelling. The mixing behaviour of different materials includes when and how the mixing takes place, and more important, when the mixed materials with a certain portion is discharged out of the stockpile. In this article, only the level function of the stockpile smart sensor will be discussed in detail. The stockpile smart sensor can help estimate accurate residual time for different group of ores charged to the stockpile. The smart sensor makes it possible to monitor the behaviour of different ore types in real time in a stockpile, including when and how the different ores are mixed in the stockpile and when the mixed ores are discharged with certain mixing portion. Using the smart sensor system, the information on ore types can be provided for ores that are discharged from the stockpile. The ore type information includes ore grade, density, hardness, strength, etc. The stockpile smart sensor, developed originally for a diamond mine, can be used for stockpiles of other mines, including iron ore mines, coal mines, copper mines, chromium ore mine, and cement plants...|$|R
40|$|A diamond mine {{generally}} {{consists of}} mining and mineral beneficiation operations. Mining operation includes planning, drilling, explosion, loading; hauling and mineral processing normally has the following operations: crushing; screening; washing; transporting; separation; sorting; storing; water treatment, etc. The operation {{could be described}} as a complex and expensive balancing act where material flow rates, size, density and other factors must all be in required balance if any degree of plant optimization and efficiency is to be achieved. One of the main objectives to optimally operate a mine is to maintain balanced production among all product streams. To achieve a balanced and optimal production at a mine, two tasks at least must be considered. The first is to have an optimal production plan, including a set of optimal production targets for all process units. And the second task {{is to make sure that}} all those optimal targets in the mentioned optimal production plan must be achieved at all process units by using all resources available. To achieve the mentioned two tasks, all measurements, equipment and systems at the mine must be available in real time, particularly those critical measurements such as <b>weightometers,</b> densitometers, ore types; stockpile levels. With the advancement and applications of technologies in mineral processing industry, an automated mine optimization system is developed to include the following three functions: (1) mine production optimizer; (2) various dynamic controllers; and (3) a set of soft sensors. Over the past ten years, a large amount of work has been done to develop the system, started from forming the concept to testing and implementation at various mines. The system can potentially help improve the production throughput up to 30 % at the mineral processing operation of a mine...|$|R
