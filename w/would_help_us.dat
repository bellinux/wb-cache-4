[...] "From the get-go, we were committed to designing it top to bottom. Let's get the architectural style, clothing, heritage, customs, how they would sleep, and how they would speak. So we brought people on board who <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> develop those ideas." [...] Art director David Goetz stated, [...] "We looked at Mayan architecture, styles of ancient, unusual architecture {{from around the world}}, and the directors really liked the look of Southeast Asian architecture." [...] The team later took ideas from other architectural forms, including Cambodian, Indian, and Tibetan works. Hahn added, [...] "If you take and deconstruct architecture from around the world into one architectural vocabulary, that's what our Atlantis looks like." [...] The overall design and circular layout of Atlantis were also based on the writings of Plato, and his quote [...] "in a single day and night of misfortune, the island of Atlantis disappeared into the depths of the sea" [...] was influential from the beginning of production. The crew wore T-shirts which read [...] "ATLANTIS—Fewer songs, more explosions" [...] due the film's plan as an action-adventure (unlike previous Disney animated features, which were musicals).|$|E

However, I must point out that the assistance voted by this House in the Shipbuilding Industry Act was meant to be used not to save uneconomic yards but to assist reorganisation with a view to promoting competitiveness in the industry. If the Burntisland yard fits that pattern, I shall be pleased, but I do not think that an inquiry <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> as of now." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2008, Netflix {{announced}} plans to eliminate its online subscriber profile feature. Profiles allow one subscriber account to contain multiple users (for example, a couple, two roommates, or parent and child) with separate DVD queues, ratings, recommendations, friend lists, reviews, and intra-site communications for each. Netflix contended that elimination of profiles would improve the customer experience. However, likely {{as a result of}} negative reviews and reaction by Netflix users, Netflix reversed its decision to remove profiles 11 days after the announcement. In announcing the reinstatement of profiles, Netflix defended its original decision, stating, [...] "Because of an ongoing desire to make our website easier to use, we believed taking a feature away that is only used by a very small minority <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> improve the site for everyone," [...] then explained its reversal: [...] "Listening to our members, we realized that users of this feature often describe it as an essential part of their Netflix experience. Simplicity is only one virtue and it can certainly be outweighed by utility." ...|$|E

"Superchrist"– written {{during the}} Zeitgeist sessions, Corgan opted against {{recording}} the track for the album, stating that he [...] "didn't understand the song, and thought playing it on tour <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> sort it out." [...] Superchrist received its live debut on July 24, 2007 during their residency at The Fillmore, and {{would go on}} to become a staple of the bands' live shows {{by the time it was}} finally recorded in January 2008 at Sunset Sound. Co-produced by Kerry Brown of the band Catherine (and also the ex-husband of former Smashing Pumpkins bassist, D'arcy Wretzky), the song was highly publicized by the band, including a music video that debuted on MySpace on February 27, 2008; it was also notable for being the band's first release without a record label. The song was initially available in a limited capacity on the compilation Fresh Cuts: Volume 2. Available solely in Guitar Center outlets, the album otherwise featured songs performed by Guitar Center employees. A more general release was later given to the track digitally on the iTunes Store on November 4, 2008, packaged with [...] "G.L.O.W." [...] as a 'digital 45".' ...|$|E
