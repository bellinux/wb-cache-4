25|$|The trans-Planckian {{problem is}} {{nowadays}} mostly considered a mathematical artifact of horizon calculations. The same effect occurs for regular matter falling onto a <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> solution. Matter which {{falls on the}} <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> accumulates on it, but has no future region into which it can go. Tracing {{the future of this}} matter, it is compressed onto the final singular endpoint of the <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> evolution, into a trans-Planckian region. The reason for these types of divergences is that modes which end at the horizon {{from the point of view}} of outside coordinates are singular in frequency there. The only way to determine what happens classically is to extend in some other coordinates that cross the horizon.|$|E
25|$|The {{event horizon}} {{of a black}} hole may {{be thought of as a}} surface moving outward at the local speed of light and is just on the edge between {{escaping}} and falling back.

25|$|In {{his first}} model the two universes did not interact, except via local matter {{accumulation}} whose density and pressure become {{high enough to}} connect the two sheets through a bridge without spacetime between them, but with a continuity of geodesics beyond the Schwarzschild radius with no singularity, allowing an exchange of matter between the two conjugated sheets, based on an idea after Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov.

25|$|This song {{is divided}} in three movements, and makes {{reference}} to several different concepts. Foremost, white holes are highly theoretical celestial bodies that spew out matter. In other words, they are anti-black holes, {{or the time}} reversal of black holes, and are the point in which matter which travels a black hole would exit. Finally, the colonist exits the black hole through a <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> and reaches the Andromeda Galaxy, passing through the fictional Planet Y, which is already populated. He decides to continue his search.

25|$|One great {{topic of}} debate during the 1960s was whether quasars were nearby objects or distant objects as implied by their {{redshift}}. It was suggested, for example, that the redshift of quasars was {{not due to}} the expansion of space but rather to light escaping a deep gravitational well. However a star of sufficient mass to form such a well would be unstable and in excess of the Hayashi limit. Quasars also show forbidden spectral emission lines which were previously only seen in hot gaseous nebulae of low density, which would be too diffuse to both generate the observed power and fit within a deep gravitational well. There were also serious concerns regarding the idea of cosmologically distant quasars. One strong argument against them was that they implied energies that were far in excess of known energy conversion processes, including nuclear fusion. At this time, there were some suggestions that quasars were made of some hitherto unknown form of stable antimatter and that this might account for their brightness. Others speculated that quasars were a <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> end of a wormhole. However, when accretion disc energy-production mechanisms were successfully modeled in the 1970s, the argument that quasars were too luminous became moot and today the cosmological distance of quasars is accepted by almost all researchers.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} satisfy this requirement, {{it turns out}} that in {{addition}} to the black hole interior region that particles enter when they fall through the event horizon from the outside, there must be a separate <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> interior region that allows us to extrapolate the trajectories of particles that an outside observer sees rising up away from the event horizon. And just as there are two separate interior regions of the maximally extended spacetime, there are also two separate exterior regions, sometimes called two different [...] "universes", with the second universe allowing us to extrapolate some possible particle trajectories in the two interior regions. This means that the interior black hole region can contain a mix of particles that fell in from either universe (and thus an observer who fell in from one universe might be able to see light that fell in from the other one), and likewise particles from the interior <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> region can escape into either universe. All four regions can be seen in a spacetime diagram that uses Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates.|$|E

2500|$|In this spacetime, it is {{possible}} to come up with coordinate systems such that if you pick a hypersurface of constant time (a set of points that all have the same time coordinate, such that every point on the surface has a space-like separation, giving what is called a 'space-like surface') and draw an [...] "embedding diagram" [...] depicting the curvature of space at that time, the embedding diagram will look like a tube connecting the two exterior regions, known as an [...] "EinsteinRosen bridge". Note that the Schwarzschild metric describes an idealized black hole that exists eternally from the perspective of external observers; a more realistic black hole that forms at some particular time from a collapsing star would require a different metric. When the infalling stellar matter is added to a diagram of a black hole's history, it removes the part of the diagram corresponding to the <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> interior region, along with the part of the diagram corresponding to the other universe.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made by creationists to construct a cosmology consistent with a young Universe rather than the standard cosmological age of the universe, {{based on the belief that}} Genesis describes the creation of the Universe as well as the Earth. The primary challenge for young-universe cosmologies is that the accepted distances in the Universe require millions or billions of years for light to travel to Earth (the [...] "starlight problem"). An older creationist idea, proposed by creationist astronomer Barry Setterfield, is that the speed of light has decayed in the history of the Universe. More recently, creationist physicist Russell Humphreys has proposed a hypothesis called [...] "white hole cosmology" [...] which suggests that the Universe expanded out of a <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> less than 10,000 years ago; the apparent age of the universe results from relativistic effects. Humphreys' theory is advocated by creationist organisations such as Answers in Genesis; however because the predictions of Humphreys' cosmology conflict with current observations, it is not accepted by the scientific community.|$|E

40|$|A {{possible}} {{resolution of}} the information loss paradox for black holes is proposed in which a phase transition occurs when the temperature of an evaporating black hole equals a critical value, T. sub(c), and Lorentz invariance and diffeomorphism invariance are spontaneously broken. This allows a generalization of Schrödinger's equation for the quantum mechanical density matrix, such that a pure state can evolve into a mixed state, because in the symmetry broken phase the conservation of energy-momentum is spontaneously violated. TCP invariance is also spontaneously broken together with time reversal invariance, allowing the existence of <b>white</b> <b>holes,</b> which are black holes moving backwards in time.

50|$|In general relativity, a <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> is a {{hypothetical}} region of spacetime which cannot be entered from the outside, although matter and light can escape from it. In this sense, {{it is the}} reverse of a black hole, {{which can only be}} entered from the outside and from which matter and light cannot escape. White holes appear in the theory of eternal black holes. In addition to a black hole region in the future, such a solution of the Einstein field equations has a <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> region in its past. However, this region does not exist for black holes that have formed through gravitational collapse, nor are there any known physical processes through which a <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> could be formed.

50|$|The event horizons {{bounding}} {{the black}} hole and <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> interior regions are also a pair of straight lines at 45 degrees, reflecting {{the fact that a}} light ray emitted at the horizon in a radial direction (aimed outward in the case of {{the black hole}}, inward {{in the case of the}} <b>white</b> <b>hole)</b> would remain on the horizon forever. Thus the two black hole horizons coincide with the boundaries of the future light cone of an event at the center of the diagram (at T=X=0), while the two <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> horizons coincide with the boundaries of the past light cone of this same event. Any event inside the black hole interior region will have a future light cone that remains in this region (such that any world line within the event's future light cone will eventually hit the black hole singularity, which appears as a hyperbola bounded by the two black hole horizons), and any event inside the <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> interior region will have a past light cone that remains in this region (such that any world line within this past light cone must have originated in the <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> singularity, a hyperbola bounded by the two <b>white</b> <b>hole</b> horizons).
