For most other tasks, modern programming languages allow the programmer to work directly with abstractions instead of bits that represent those abstractions. Source code that does bit manipulation makes use of the bitwise operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifts.|$|E

Line position in a full frame can be determined by tracking SAV status bits, allowing receivers to 'synchronize' with an incoming stream.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{takes an}} introspective look at {{electrical}} engineering {{as it exists}} today and poses several questions {{about the future of}} EE. While traditional EE departments have been adding computer engineering and/or science degrees and expanding their titles to include the <b>word</b> <b>computer,</b> not all students want to do computing beyond what is essential to their specialty. So what is EE, as distinct from computer engineering, and what is its future? We address this question by examining it from the perspective of university EE programs and the needs of industry and society. As a result of our investigation, we also develop a definitional set of broad areas and specialties that define EE, both now and in the future. We conclude with a recommendation to give EE more curb appeal fo...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a set of free {{software}} technologies, tools and programming languages that are used for application development and the utilization of these tools on the development of a specific application named ZIDEC. Nowadays, we can hardly imagine life without computers, and even though the <b>word</b> <b>computer</b> more or less reminds us of the hardware box, screen, keyboard and computer mouse, the true value of problem solving is brought to us by computer applications and software. During the evolution of software, two main streams appeared: commercial ownership solutions and free ware. In these rough economic times many individuals and companies realize the importance of economical behaviour. One of the possible ways of economizing is changing commercial solutions with free ware. In this diploma paper I have tried to choose from the many free ware solutions and find those that help in developing and up-keeping applications such as project management, code revisions, virtualization of development environment and the choice of programming language. Along with the choice of software, this paper describes the concept of setting a development environment in a virtual machine. One of the main reasons to use free ware is of course economizing, saving on the costs of development and up-keeping of the applications. The main goal of the developed application ZIDEC is to simplify and speed up the long term process of calculating the seismic resistance of masonry building. The application is fully used in the Karlovšek d. o. o. company. ...|$|E
40|$|Since their {{development}} in the late l 940 s, the main work {{in the application of}} computers has been persuading the recalcitrant machines to do clever things, huge, enormous jobs that humans cannot manage, such as calculating mathematical formulae to a trillion points of accuracy, directing spacecraft to Mars or looking after the sale of sandwiches in Marks and Spencer. The very <b>word,</b> <b>computer,</b> is associated with calculation, with science and mathematics, things that men in white coats do—we would do better to remember Marshall McLnhan's phrase 'information processing' (which he came up with when IBM asked him what they did) or the French word, ordinateur, or 'arranger', altogether a more appropriate description of the machine. Archaeologists have largely followed the trend in their use of computers—for most people, there is still a feeling that one has to do something clever to justify the use of a computer. The last decade, however, has seen the growth of a feeling that computers can be used for really pretty dull things, things that humans can do, but cannot be bothered with; the theme of my paper is this use of computers, to do useful things, not clever things. UNIX hackers will recall that Thomson and Ritchie wrote the system a) for playing games and b) as a text-processing environment [1]. At a gathering like Computer Applications in Archaeology, I am probably preaching to the converted, but then again a glance at the contents of this conference reveals that many archaeological computer hackers are still trying to do clever things, rather than using a computer to give them extra time to do the clever things themselves [...] ...|$|E
