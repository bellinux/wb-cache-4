5|$|The Indians were {{a harder}} fight; {{they were out}} of the main field of battle, skirmishing on the edge of an {{adjacent}} swamp. Richard Johnson eventually ordered a suicide squad of twenty men to ride forward and draw the Indians' fire, planning to charge with the rest as they reloaded. But the ground before the Indian position was too swampy to support many cavalry. Johnson had to order his men to dismount and hold until Shelby's infantry came up. But eventually they broke, and fled into the swamp, during which time Tecumseh was slain, some say by Johnson, others believing it <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> else.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, SIRT {{purchased}} {{the property of}} the B and merged it with the Staten Island Railway. The line had been worked with B and SIRT equipment since it opened in 1890. By 1949, there were no longer any staffed offices along the line except at Arlington. All of the stations on the line, with the exception of Harbor Road, Lake Avenue, Livingston and Snug Harbor, had waiting rooms and agents. The stations without waiting rooms were flag stops; the train would only stop if there <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> waiting at the station. The station at Port Ivory, which was used for workers of the Procter & Gamble Plant and was only open for the morning and evening rush hour, closed around the year 1950.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1778, George Washington ordered Major Benjamin Tallmadge to form the Culper Ring. This group was {{composed}} of a select few trustworthy individuals whose purpose was to collect information about the British movements and activities in New York City. The Ring is famous for uncovering Benedict Arnold's intentions of treason, which shocked Washington because Arnold <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> who had {{contributed significantly to the}} war effort. Arnold was embittered by his dealings with Congress over rank and finances, as well as the alliance with France, so he conspired with the British in a plan to seize the post that he commanded at West Point. Washington just missed apprehending him, but did capture his co-conspirator Major John André, a British intelligence officer under Clinton who was hanged by order of a court-martial called by Washington.|$|E

50|$|The term —both as a noun and adjective— {{is usually}} {{applied to the}} field of politics, and is {{occasionally}} used in the context of science, invention or art. In politics, a revolutionary <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> who supports abrupt, rapid, and drastic change, while a reformist <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> who supports more gradual and incremental change. A conservative <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> who generally opposes such changes.

5|$|Now {{settled into}} Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers {{began looking for}} a {{suitable}} producer. One person in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded in contrast to individuals they had worked with in the past even though Rubin previously turned down the band's offer to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak who would die of a heroin overdose a year later. Eventually, the band decided Rubin {{would be the best}} choice as a producer, and therefore hired him to produce what would become Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> that they felt confident to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|The {{rejection}} likely {{had several}} causes. The {{people of the}} Grants were tired of the disputes with New York, and they were tired of Allen's posturing and egotistic behavior, which the success at Ticonderoga had enhanced. Finally, {{the failure of the}} attempt on St. John's was widely seen as reckless and ill-advised, attributes they did not appreciate in a regimental leader. Warner was viewed as a more stable and quieter choice, and <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> that also commanded respect. The history of Warner's later actions in the revolution (notably at Hubbardton and Bennington) may be seen as a confirmation of the choice made by the Dorset meeting. In the end, Allen took the rejection in stride, and managed to convince Schuyler and Warner to permit him to accompany the regiment as a civilian scout.|$|E
5|$|Writer and {{producer}} Bob Gale conceived the idea after he visited {{his parents in}} St. Louis, Missouri {{after the release of}} Used Cars. Searching their basement, Gale found his father's high school yearbook and discovered he was president of his graduating class. Gale thought about the president of his own graduating class, who <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> {{he had nothing to do}} with. Gale wondered whether he would have been friends with his father if they went to high school together. When he returned to California, he told Robert Zemeckis his new concept. Zemeckis subsequently thought of a mother claiming she never kissed a boy at school when, in fact, she was highly promiscuous. The two took the project to Columbia Pictures, and made a development deal for a script in September 1980.|$|E

25|$|Madero's {{candidacy}} against Díaz garnered {{widespread support}} in Mexico, since he <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> of independent financial means, ideological determination, and bravery to oppose Díaz {{when it was}} dangerous to do so. Arrested by the dictatorship shortly after being declared Presidential candidate by his party, the opposition leader escaped from prison and launched the Plan of San Luis Potosí from the United States, in this manner beginning the Mexican Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Calleja was a determined, unscrupulous, cruel ruler who tolerated the {{numerous}} abuses of his commanders; he <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> to be feared. He was feared, and also hated, even {{by some of}} the more liberal royalists. They blamed his brutal methods for causing more rebellion after the death of Morelos. Their complaints against his dictatorial methods were received in the Spanish court and on September 20, 1816, he was relieved of his position.|$|E

25|$|Quevedo {{could be}} impulsive. He {{was present at}} the church of San Martín in Madrid when a woman praying there was slapped on the cheek by another man who had rushed up to her.

25|$|For the 1988 pilot, George Dzundza and Chris Noth {{were cast}} as the {{original}} detectives, Sergeant Max Greevey and Detective Mike Logan.

Madsen initially was considered the perfect choice for the role, but, in a final reading, it was felt that Madsen's acting mannerisms were repetitive, and Noth received the role instead. Rounding out the police cast, Dann Florek was cast as Captain Donald Cragen.|$|E
25|$|Toungoo {{was to get}} a {{much needed}} breather, however. For much of the rainy season of 1542, the Confederation chiefs were still {{coming to terms with}} their new leader Hkonmaing (son of Hkonmaing I of Onbaung), and had no time to plan for an invasion. Initially, the {{leadership}} of Mohnyin was deeply unsatisfied with Hkonmaing, who was put on the throne by the Ava court, not only because the heirs of Sawlon felt the throne of Ava was theirs but also because Hkonmaing's father <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> they bitterly fought against in the 1520s. In the end, in August/September 1542, the chiefs reluctantly decided to back Hkonmaing, and form a united front against a rising Toungoo.

According to an Associated Press report, rather than transmit emails to each other's inbox, which would have left a more obvious email trail, Petraeus and Broadwell left messages in a draft folder and the draft messages were then read by the other person when they logged into the same account.|$|E
