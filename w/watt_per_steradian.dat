5000|$|The Doppler effect (with {{arbitrary}} direction) also modifies {{the perceived}} source intensity: {{this can be}} expressed concisely {{by the fact that}} source strength divided by the cube of the frequency is a Lorentz invariant (here, [...] "source strength" [...] refers to spectral intensity in frequency, i.e., power per unit solid angle and per unit frequency, expressed in <b>watts</b> <b>per</b> <b>steradian</b> <b>per</b> hertz; for spectral intensity in wavelength, the cube should be replaced by a fifth power). This implies that the total radiant intensity (summing over all frequencies) is multiplied by the fourth power of the Doppler factor for frequency.|$|R
50|$|Like other SI base units, the candela has an {{operational}} definition - it {{is defined by}} the description of a physical process that will produce one candela of luminous intensity.

5000|$|In radiometry, {{radiance}} is {{the radiant}} flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received by a given surface, per unit solid angle per unit projected area. Spectral radiance is the radiance of a surface per unit frequency or wavelength, {{depending on whether}} the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. These are directional quantities. The SI unit of radiance is the <b>watt</b> <b>per</b> <b>steradian</b> per square metre (...) , while that of spectral radiance in frequency is the <b>watt</b> <b>per</b> <b>steradian</b> per square metre per hertz (...) and that of spectral radiance in wavelength is the <b>watt</b> <b>per</b> <b>steradian</b> per square metre, per metre (...) —commonly the <b>watt</b> <b>per</b> <b>steradian</b> per square metre per nanometre (...) [...] The microflick is also used to measure spectral radiance in some fields. Radiance is used to characterize diffuse emission and reflection of electromagnetic radiation, or to quantify emission of neutrinos and other particles. Historically, radiance is called [...] "intensity" [...] and spectral radiance is called [...] "specific intensity". Many fields still use this nomenclature. It is especially dominant in heat transfer, astrophysics and astronomy. [...] "Intensity" [...] has many other meanings in physics, with the most common being power per unit area.|$|E

50|$|The lumen {{is defined}} as amount of light given into one {{steradian}} by a point source of one candela strength; while the candela, a base SI unit, {{is defined as}} the luminous intensity of a source of monochromatic radiation, of frequency 540 terahertz, and a radiant intensity of 1/683 <b>watts</b> <b>per</b> <b>steradian.</b> (540 THz corresponds to about 555 nanometres, the wavelength, in the green, to which the human eye is most sensitive. The number 1/683 was chosen to make the candela about equal to the standard candle, the unit which it superseded).|$|R
50|$|If {{the concept}} is {{restricted}} to geometric optics—i.e., to incoherent light and to objects larger than the wavelength of light—then the fundamental carrier of light is a ray. The measure {{for the amount of}} light traveling along a ray is radiance, denoted by L and measured in <b>watts</b> (W) <b>per</b> <b>steradian</b> (sr) <b>per</b> meter squared (m2). The steradian is a measure of solid angle, and meters squared are used here as a measure of cross-sectional area, as shown at right.|$|R
40|$|Radiometric {{calibration}} is {{a method}} of capturing digital images and processing the digital image data so that the pixel values represent actual measurements of light. Radiometric camera calibration converts ordinary digital images into radiometric images. Absolute radiometric calibration means that the image pixels are calibrated with reference to physical units such as <b>watts</b> <b>per</b> <b>steradian</b> <b>per</b> square meter (W. sr− 1. m− 2) or photon counts. Relative radiometric calibration means that the image pixels are calibrated with reference to each other — the ratio of two image pixels {{is the same as}} the ratio of the corresponding physical measurements of light. Radiometric calibration, both absolute and relative, has a wide range of applications in science and technology, including astronomy, remote sensing, and machine vision. Methods for radiometric calibration typically involve up to four steps. First, the camera response is corrected to be linear. Second, the camera's black response is subtracted. Third, corrections are applied for spatial variations in the effective aperture of the lens and the sensor sensitivity. This correction yields a relative radiometric calibration. A final step converts the relative calibration to absolute calibration by applying an appropriate scaling factor. This article first explains the basis of radiometric calibration — the additive property of light and the formation of digital images. Techniques for radiometric calibration are then explained, focusing on the four steps of estimating the camera response function, measuring the black response, correcting for vignetting and sensitivity, and using calibration targets. Finally, applications of radiometric imaging are discussed briefly. 10 page(s...|$|R
