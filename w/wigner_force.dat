40|$|We use Feshbach's {{projection}} formalism {{to write}} an equation for the wave function that describes the relative distance between the centers of mass of the two ions. We assume that the Q-space can be truncated at the excitation of 1 p- 1 h in either {{one or the other}} ion, leaving one of them in its ground state. In the propagator of the effective potential, the two-body interaction is replaced by the ion-ion mean field VMF. The matrix elements of the elementary interaction are of finite range, represented by an effective <b>Wigner</b> <b>force.</b> The total many-body wave function is antisymmetrized only in the partial intrinsic wave function of each ion. Calculations are done in the Thomas Fermi approximation. The Coulomb energy is not considered...|$|E

It is now recast in a precisely equivalent but vastly more computationally efiaent form, directly in terms of coordinate-space correlation functions which are expanded in a Gaussian geminal basis and determined variationally. This reformulation further leads in a straightforward manner to a natural procedure for including higher-order correlations. Its implementation at even the simplest level produces a significant improvement in the already very good upper bounds achieved far the ground-state energy. Further extensions are also discussed. In a recent letter to this joumal we presented a shell-model-style calculation of the ground and. I+ = 0 excited states of the “He nucleus described by <b>Wigner</b> (central) <b>forces.</b> We worked in a basis generated from the non-interacting harmonic-oscillator ground state by the inclusion of all one- and two-body excitations which leave the centre-of-mass (CM) undisturbed, i. e. in the Os state. Restricting the allowed excitations to this subset has two important consequences. Besides rendering th...|$|R
