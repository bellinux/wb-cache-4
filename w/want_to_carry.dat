2500|$|After {{the fall}} of Bilbao, the Republican {{government}} decided to launch an offensive against Brunete {{in order to stop}} the Nationalist offensive in the north on July 6, but by July 25 the offensive had ended.

2500|$|Mid November 2011 {{radioactive}} cesium {{was found}} in milk-powder for baby-food produced by the food company Meiji Co. Although this firm was warned about this matter three times, the matter was taken seriously by its consumer service after it was approached by Kyodo News. Up to 30.8 becquerels per kilogram {{was found in}} Meiji Step milk powder. While this is under the governmental safety-limit of 200 becquerels per kilogram, this could be more harmful for young children. Because of this cesium-contaminated milk powder, the Japanese minister of health Yoko Komiyama said on 9 December 2011 at a press conference, that her ministry would start regularly tests on baby food products {{in connection with the}} Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis, every three months and more frequently when necessary.

2500|$|Dirk de Vos {{suggests}} that van der Weyden wished to evoke a life sized, carved relief filled with polychrome figures, and thus elevate his painting {{to the level}} of grand scale sculpture. The work's corners are filled with carved gilded tracery, with the presentation of living figures on a stage intended as a tableau vivant, or sculptural group, the latter of which is created through the sense of condensed movement within a single instant. Mary faints and is supported by St John who rushes to her assistance. The man on the ladder lowers Christ's body is already reinforced by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, both of whom seems to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> it {{to the right of the}} pictorial space. Nicodemus's movement transforms the weeping Magdalene into a statue frozen in time. De Vos writes: [...] "Time seems to have solidified into a composition. And what a composition. Interplay of undulating lines, swaying poses and counterposes of figures have rightly been compared to technique of counterpoint in polyphonic music." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Auxiliary Police is a {{volunteer}} police {{force in the}} Suffolk County Police Department. Auxiliary officers are civic-minded {{men and women who}} volunteer to help their community and the Suffolk County Police Department by performing uniformed patrols throughout Suffolk County to help deter crime. Up until 2010 Auxiliary officers had to go through a 40-hour training course, but due to changes in state legislation, are now required to go through a full 120-hour Peace Officer training program, and are recognized by NY State as full-time Peace Officers. Auxiliary officers, are uniformed, and are equipped with batons, handcuffs, and pepper spray. Auxiliary officers who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> a firearm on patrol must go through extra training in order to do so. Auxiliary officers patrol on foot and in fully marked patrol cars. Auxiliary officers have always had no power beyond a citizen while on duty, although with the new [...] "Peace Officer" [...] designation, that has changed. Even though they hold Peace Officer status, SCPD rules do limit their authority while on duty and a full-time Police Officer is usually called to assist Auxiliaries with police related actions like arrests.|$|E

2500|$|Medcalf has {{revealed}} to the Walford Gazette how she prepared for the role: [...] "I actually watched the show a bit when Danniella had been on so I had a distinct memory of her to work with.

I did sit down to watch a five-minute clip of Danniella but I quickly realised I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> on watching because I was afraid of falling into doing an imitation of her, d'ye know what I mean? I'll tell you something weird-when I first started getting the scripts I used to hear the lines first in my head with HER voice saying them! But that changed over time, thank God, as I hopefully made the character my own and I gave her my voice." [...] Medcalf added that contrastingly to Westbrook, who played Sam as a young girl who was overprotected by her brothers and sheltered, she played Sam as a young woman [...] "trying to find her place both in a career and in relationships with the opposite sex." ...|$|E

In early 2008, Murphy claimed that he [...] "was most satisfied with the bonding on an emotional level. It was good to be working together and to put the past behind us and it was very positive. The result was coming out really fast, so it was exciting and it was very enjoyable", but in the end, [...] "that rocky character worked and I think it was a bit right to finish it, really". The same year, David J commented on the breakup: [...] "You have a test tube, and you pour in one chemical, and you pour in another chemical, and something happens. It starts to bubble.

Their replacement with any other troops will not be discussed with anyone... If Georgia wants them out of its territory, we will do everything for them to remain in Abkhazia." [...] Solana said that the conflict could not be resolved without Russia and Russia was {{a key player in}} the peace process. Giorgi Baramidze, the Georgian deputy prime minister and minister on European and Euro-Atlantic integration said: [...] "Georgia is ready to sign a ceasefire agreement with Abkhazia if it is guaranteed by the European Union." [...] Baramidze said that earlier agreements without an effective guarantor had resulted in the loss of Gagra, Sukhumi and the main part of Abkhazia for Georgia. He added, [...] "We are ready for constructive dialogue both with the Russians and the separatists.

2500|$|Amerie gained {{even more}} {{recognition}} from garnering her first acting {{role in the}} 2004 film First Daughter with Katie Holmes and directed by Forrest Whittaker. The film was not commercially appreciated, possibly due to its development being pushed back several years. Also, in 2004, Amerie began working on her sophomore album, Touch, in early 2004. As with All I Have, the album Executive Produced by Ameriie and Lenny Nicholson it was co-written and produced by friend Rich Harrison, who contributed seven (new) tracks to the record; additional productions came from Lil Jon, Bryce Wilson, Red Spyda, and Dre & Vidal. Unlike on her first album, Amerie co-wrote every track but one, [...] "Come with Me", which Harrison wrote.

In January 2005, Amerie released the lead single, titled [...] "1 Thing".
