On January 5, Michigan hired Dave Brandon to replace Bill Martin as its athletic director. Martin had previously announced his retirement during the 2009 season. Reaction to the hire was positive, but the hire also brought increased scrutiny upon Rich Rodriguez, as Brandon {{made it clear that}} he would do whatever was necessary to turn the program around from its recent slump.|$|E
25|$|When Charles W. Nash, {{founder of}} Nash Motors {{began looking for}} his successor, he turned to Mason upon the {{recommendation}} of Walter Chrysler. Mason initially rebuffed Nash’s offer, however when Nash asked <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> to bring Mason over to Nash, Mason stated {{that he would not}} take the position if Kelvinator {{was not included in the}} deal. Nash saw merit in this idea; General Motors owned Frigidaire, Borg-Warner owned Norge Appliance, and Chrysler operated its own air conditioning division, Airtemp. Nash and Mason came to terms and the deal announced in November 1936. The two firms merged to form Nash-Kelvinator Corporation with Mason as its CEO. By 1940, Mason continued to grow Kelvinator’s market share and returned Nash to profitable status.|$|E

500|$|In 1961, Leader of the Opposition Lester Pearson asked John Ross Matheson {{to begin}} researching <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> for Canada {{to have a}} new flag. Pearson knew the Red Ensign with the Union Jack was unpopular in Quebec, a base of support for his Liberal Party, but {{strongly}} favoured by English Canada. By April 1963, Pearson was prime minister in a minority government and risked losing power over the issue. He formed a 15-member multi-party parliamentary committee in 1963 to select a new design, despite opposition leader Diefenbaker's demands for a referendum on the issue. On May 27, 1964, Pearson's cabinet introduced a motion to parliament for adoption of his favourite design, presented to him by artist and heraldic advisor Alan Beddoe, of a [...] "sea to sea" [...] (Canada's motto) flag with blue borders and three conjoined red maple leaves on a white field. This motion led to weeks of acrimonious debate in the House of Commons and the design {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Pearson Pennant", derided by the media and viewed as a [...] "concession to Québec".|$|E
500|$|When {{describing}} the film's accuracy, Burton explained, [...] "it's {{not like a}} completely hardcore realistic biopic. In doing a biopic you can't help but get inside the person's spirit a little bit, so for me, some {{of the film is}} trying to be through Ed a little bit. So it's got an overly optimistic quality to it." [...] Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating {{he did not want to}} ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. Burton decided not to depict the darker side of Wood's life because his letters never alluded to this aspect and remained upbeat. To this end, Burton wanted to make the film through Wood's eyes. He said in an interview, [...] "I've never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy– saying in, like, five sentences <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> most normal people one [...] Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, and I always found that somewhat touching; it gives them a surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 2013, Paul was {{the subject}} of some {{controversy}} when it was discovered that he had plagiarized from Wikipedia part of a speech in support of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli. Referencing the movie Gattaca, Paul quoted almost verbatim from the Wikipedia article about the film without citing the source. Evidence soon surfaced that Paul had copied sentences in a number of his other speeches nearly verbatim from other authors without giving credit to the original sources, including in the speech he had given as the Tea Party rebuttal to the president's 2013 State of the Union address. In addition, a three-page-long passage of Paul's book Government Bullies was taken directly from an article by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. When it became apparent that Paul's op-ed in The Washington Times on mandatory minimums and related testimony he had given before the Senate Judiciary Committee both contained material that was virtually identical to an article that had been published by another author in The Week a few days earlier, the Washington Times said that the newspaper would no longer publish the weekly column Paul had been contributing to the paper.

500|$|Similarly to the club's {{successful}} campaign {{the season}} before, but in complete {{contrast to his}} first tenure at the club, the 2010–11 season saw five players joining the club, while roughly five players left the club in the close season. The club started the season inconsistently, with Westley stating the season would be a [...] "massive learning curve" [...] for both himself and the players. Following four defeats in six games in December 2010 and January 2011, Stevenage found themselves in 18th position, just four points above the relegation zone. However, during a congested period throughout February and March 2011, Stevenage won nine games out of eleven, propelling the club up the league table and into the play-off positions. This included winning six games on the trot, a sequence only matched by Bury. A 3–3 draw against Bury {{on the final day}} of the season meant that Stevenage finished the season in sixth place. They faced fifth place Accrington Stanley in the 2010–11 League Two play-off semi-finals, winning both legs by a 3–0 aggregate scoreline. They beat Torquay United 1–0 in the Final at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011. The victory meant that Westley had guided the club to back-to-back promotions, playing in League One for the first time in the club's history. On securing promotion, Westley said [...] "It's a fantastic feeling. The players work so hard and they deserve everything they get". During the 2010–11 season, Westley also guided the club to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup, where they lost to Reading 2–1. In the previous round, Stevenage beat Premier League side Newcastle United 3–1 at Broadhall Way. After the match, Westley said before the game he had told the players to [...] "go out and win the match 5–0. We established that if we did just 20% of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> to win 5–0 then we would still win the game".|$|E

2500|$|Dunsterville was {{in contact}} with the Armenian National Council in Baku and urged Marshall in Mesopotamia to send {{infantry}} and artillery but Marshall refused and in June sent only the [...] already promised, two companies each of the 1st/4th Hampshire and 1st/2nd Gurkhas, two mountain guns of the 21st Battery and supplies in the [...] vans; the troops took over guarding the road up to Resht. The War Office and the War Cabinet questioned Marshall's judgement and asked Dunsterville directly, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> to control the Caspian Sea and destroy the oilfields. Dunsterville urged a forward policy but not the sabotage of the oil as this was inimical to the interests of the populations he was trying to recruit against the Ottomans. Marshall then offered the 39th Infantry Brigade of the 13th (Western) Division and artillery, provided that it could be supplied locally. (The brigade was detached on 1 July and set off in stages from [...] the Brigade HQ arriving five days later.) Along with training and leadership, Dunsterforce was to occupy the Baku oil fields, to deny oil and the local cotton crop to the Germans and Ottomans.

My answer was simple: A check for $800 million placed directly in the endowment would do it -- even if we never changed another thing we were doing." [...] Helms also noted that, [...] "what you won't read in U.S. News {{is that most of the}} data they use is public information, readily available on the Web sites of most colleges and universities, as well as on the U.S. Department of Education Web site. There is no single formula for weighting these factors -- they will have different significance for different students and families. So, next year I and many other leaders of our nation's best colleges and universities will be working on a new and better Web-based tool for families engaged in the college search." [...] Millsaps College president, Frances Lucas, further noted that, [...] "she previously had paid little attention to the rankings debate because her own institution was rated highly in U.S. News. But after learning more about the magazine's methodology and discussing the issue with colleagues at this week's meeting, she concluded that the rankings were based too heavily on measurements determined by institutional wealth." ...|$|E
