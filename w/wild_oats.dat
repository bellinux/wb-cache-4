5000|$|Puccinia coronata is a plant {{pathogen}} and causal agent of oat and barley crown rust. The pathogen occurs worldwide, infecting both <b>wild</b> and cultivated <b>oats.</b> It {{is a relatively}} new disease of barley in North America. It was first found in 1992 in a barley breeding nursery near Clay Center, Nebraska. Since then, crown rust has been found throughout the upper Midwest, with greatest incidence in the central Red River Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota. In that region the alternate host, common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), grows abundantly in shelter belts and riparian areas. Since 1993, outbreaks of crown rust have occurred on barley and forage grasses at several localities in this region. The extent of yield losses in barley caused by this disease have not been determined. Crown rust posed a threat to barley production, because the first infections in barley occur early in the season from local [...] Crown rusts have evolved many different physiological races within different species in response to host resistance. Each pathogenic race can attack a specific line of plants within the species typical host. For example, there are over 290 races of P. coronata. Crops with resistant phenotypes are often released, but within a few years virulent races have arisen and P. coronata can infect them.|$|R

25|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>Oats</b> was co-founded in 1986 by {{husband and}} wife team Mike Gilliland and Libby Cook in 1987 in Boulder, Colorado. Originally {{purchasing}} a convenience store, which they bought with cash advances on 17 credit cards and a second mortgage on Gilliland's mother's house, the pair decided to buy a natural foods market, Crystal Market, which they felt would prosper in health-conscious Boulder. The $300,000 purchase, completed in 1987, thrust the couple into an environment {{quite different from the}} junk-food focus of convenience stores, an environment that gradually persuaded Gilliland and Cook to become healthy eaters themselves. In that first store, Gilliland worked the counter, while Cook worked the deli. Soon, the couple had opened another natural foods store, {{on the south side of}} Boulder, called <b>Wild</b> <b>Oats</b> Community Market. As the <b>Wild</b> <b>Oats</b> business expanded, a holding company was formed, and Gilliland became chief executive officer and president, while Cook became vice-president and in-house attorney.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} some notable {{achievements}} by yachts over the years. Sydney yacht, Morna, won the second, third and fourth races (1946–1948) and then, under new owners Frank and John Livingston from Victoria, took a further four titles as Kurrewa IV in 1954, 1956, 1957 and 1960. Other yachts to win three or more titles are Astor (1961, 1963 and 1964)and Bumblebee IV firstly in 1979 and then again in 1988 and 1990 as Ragamuffin. When <b>Wild</b> <b>Oats</b> XI won back-to-back titles in 2006, {{it was the first}} yacht to do so since Astor in the 1960s. <b>Wild</b> <b>Oats</b> XI claimed its third consecutive line honours title in the 2007 race, re-writing history by being only the second yacht after Rani in the inaugural 1945 race to win line and handicap honours and break the race record in the same year (2005) and then only the second yacht after Morna to win three line honours titles in a row. In 2008, <b>Wild</b> <b>Oats</b> XI broke Mornas long-standing record of three titles in a row, by completing a four-in-a-row, the first yacht to achieve that remarkable achievement.|$|E

The 2008 race was not without difficulty for the crew though, as they picked up debris in Sydney Harbour which added excess drag, and also collided with a two-metre (6.5foot) shark.
