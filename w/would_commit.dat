5|$|René Pottier {{would not}} defend his {{title in the}} 1907 Tour de France, because he <b>would</b> <b>commit</b> suicide before, after {{discovering}} {{that his wife had}} had an affair while he was riding the Tour. Petit-Breton and Georget would start again in the 1907 Tour and duel for the overall victory, which would be won by Petit-Breton.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this alone}} does not explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. This {{seems to have been a}} particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force <b>would</b> <b>commit</b> itself to a fight to the death.|$|E
5|$|International {{publishers}} expressed {{some interest}} in carrying Elmer, {{but none of them}} <b>would</b> <b>commit</b> to it. To generate more interest among readers, Alanguilan released the sold-out first issue for free online. This led publisher Editions Ca Et La to purchase the French rights in 2010. After Alanguilan exchanged emails with publisher Dan Vado, Slave Labor Graphics released Elmer as a 144-page trade paperback in North America. Slave Labor Graphics also distributes the comic digitally.|$|E

5|$|After the {{fighting}} in Normandy, Model established his headquarters at Oosterbeek, near Arnhem in the Netherlands, where he set about the massive task of rebuilding Army Group B.

Model retained command of OB West for eighteen days before Hitler appointed Gerd von Rundstedt as permanent replacement for Kluge, allowing Model to return to the command of Army Group B.|$|E
5|$|At age 13, Clayton {{entered the}} private St Columba's College {{secondary}} school in Rathfarnham, Dublin. Here he {{made friends with}} other pupils who were enthusiastic about the pop/rock music acts of the period, including The Who, The Beatles, The Grateful Dead, and Carole King. In response he bought a £5 acoustic guitar from a junk-shop near the Dublin quays, and began learning elementary chords and songs. John Leslie, who shared a bunk bed with Clayton at St. Columba's, persuaded him to join in with a school band where Clayton would play the bass guitar for the first time.

5|$|Operation Citadel {{called for}} a double envelopment, {{directed}} at Kursk, to surround the Soviet defenders of five armies and seal off the salient. Army Group Centre would provide General Walter Model's 9th Army to form the northern pincer. It would cut through the northern face of the salient, driving south to the hills east of Kursk, securing the rail line from Soviet attack. Army Group South <b>would</b> <b>commit</b> the 4th Panzer Army, under Hermann Hoth, and Army Detachment Kempf, under Werner Kempf, to pierce the southern face of the salient. This force would drive north to meet the 9th Army east of Kursk. Von Manstein's main attack was to be delivered by Hoth's 4th Panzer Army, spearheaded by the II SS Panzer Corps under Paul Hausser. The XLVIII Panzer Corps, commanded by Otto von Knobelsdorff, would advance on the left while Army Detachment Kempf would advance on the right. The 2nd Army, {{under the command of}} Walter Weiss, would contain the western portion of the salient.|$|E

5|$|Reinsdorf {{was one of}} two bidders for the Phoenix Coyotes that <b>would</b> <b>commit</b> to not {{relocating}} the team. On July 29, 2009 Reinsdorf and {{his group}} were approved for ownership of the Coyotes for $148 million. In August 2009, it was reported that Jerry Reinsdorf & Ice Edge LLC had dropped its bid for the Coyotes, leaving only Balsillie and the NHL as bidders for the team. The NHL bid ultimately prevailed, however the league stated it wished to re-sell the franchise as soon as possible. On March 24, 2010, it was reported that Reinsdorf was once again a possible buyer for the Phoenix Coyotes. Reinsdorf had been working out an arrangement to make the deal more feasible with the municipality of Glendale, Arizona. As late as August 2011, negotiations between Reinsdorf and the City of Glendale were still in process for the purchase of the Coyotes. However, in 2013, the Coyotes were sold to IceArizona, a group of investors that did not include Reinsdorf.|$|E
25|$|The Taliban and Al Qaeda {{forces were}} {{defeated}} within two months.

25|$|The {{decision}} on the entry of the Phalangists into the refugee camps was taken without consideration of the danger – which the makers and executors of the decision were obligated to foresee as probable – the Phalangists <b>would</b> <b>commit</b> massacres and pogroms against {{the inhabitants of the}} camps, and without an examination of the means for preventing this danger.|$|E

Before long, the papal legate, Ubaldo Lanfranchi, Archbishop of Pisa, and Philip of Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais, annulled the marriage of Isabella and Humphrey. Baldwin of Forde, Archbishop of Canterbury, forbade her to marry Conrad, stating that both Isabella and Conrad <b>would</b> <b>commit</b> adultery if they married. However, Baldwin of Forde died on 19 November 1190.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{her role}} in {{ensuring}} Güyük's election as Khagan, the relationship between Töregene and her son eventually collapsed. Güyük's brother Koden accused Fatima of using witchcraft to damage his health; when Koden died a few months later, Güyük insisted that his mother hand Fatima over for execution. Töregene threatened her son Güyük that she <b>would</b> <b>commit</b> suicide to spite him. Güyük's men seized Fatima and put her to death by sewing up all of her orifices and dumping her into water; Töregene's supporters in the imperial household were simultaneously purged. Within 18 months of Fatima's death, Töregene herself died under still unexplained circumstances.|$|E
