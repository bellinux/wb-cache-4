Additionally, special forces and Ministry of Internal Affairs troops were deployed. The total number of troops was 16,000 according to the magazine. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, ten light infantry battalions of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th infantry brigades, special forces and an artillery brigade, totalling approximately 12,000 troops, had been concentrated {{by the start of}} the conflict. The primary task of capturing Tskhinvali was accomplished by the 4th Brigade <b>with</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2nd and 3rd Brigades.

5|$|Before the battle, Captain Charles Elliot, {{the chief}} {{superintendent}} of British trade in China, sailed to Kowloon in the cutter Louisa for food supplies, {{accompanied by the}} schooner Pearl and a pinnace from HMS Volage. Upon encountering three Chinese junks, Elliot sent interpreter Karl Gutzlaff with demands to re-allow the supply of provisions. After several hours of unsuccessful correspondence, Elliot delivered an ultimatum that if provisions were not received, the junks would be sunk. When it expired with no results, the British opened fire on the junks, which returned fire <b>with</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fort on shore. During the engagement, the larger junks pursued the British boats which were sailing away after running low on ammunition. But after replenishing their cartridges, the British re-engaged the ships, which retreated to their former position, ending the clash in a stalemate.|$|E

Macrinus fled the battlefield and tried to reach Rome but was captured in Chaceldon and later executed in Cappadocia. He sent his son to the care of Artabanus V of Parthia, but Diadumenianus was also captured before he could reach his destination and executed. After Macrinus' death, the Senate declared him and his son enemies of Rome and had their names struck from the records and their images destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Following the Republic of the Congo's {{independence}} from Belgium in 1960, the country fell into disorder as the army mutinied. Shortly thereafter South Kasai and the State of Katanga declared {{independence from}} the Congolese government. The latter contained {{the vast majority of}} the Congo's valuable mineral resources and attracted significant mining activity under Belgian rule. Many Katangese thought that they were entitled to the revenue generated through the lucrative industry, and feared that under the new central government it would be distributed among the Congo's poorer provinces. Resulting nativist politics <b>with</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Belgian government and private interests such as the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK) precipitated the Katangese secession.|$|E

5|$|In 1230 the Teutonic Knights, a crusading {{military}} order, {{moved to}} Chełmno Land and launched the Prussian Crusade against the pagan Prussian clans. <b>With</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pope and Holy Roman Emperor, the Teutons conquered and converted the Prussians by the 1280s and shifted {{their attention to}} the pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania. For about 100 years the Knights raided Lithuanian lands, particularly Samogitia, as it separated the Knights in Prussia from their branch in Livonia. While the border regions became an uninhabited wilderness, the Knights gained very little territory. The Lithuanians first gave up Samogitia during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384) in the Treaty of Dubysa. The territory was used as a bargaining chip to ensure Teutonic support for one of the sides in the internal power struggle.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{population}} of blue whales occurring off Chile and Peru {{may also be a}} distinct subspecies.

5|$|It {{is largely}} unknown how baleen whales produce sound {{because of the}} lack of a melon and vocal cords. In a 2007 study, it was {{discovered}} that the larynx had U-shaped folds which are thought to be similar to vocal cords. They are positioned parallel to air flow, as opposed to the perpendicular vocal cords of terrestrial mammals. These may control air flow and cause vibrations. The walls of the larynx are able to contract which may generate sound <b>with</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> arytenoid cartilages. The muscles surrounding the larynx may expel air rapidly or maintain a constant volume while diving.|$|E
