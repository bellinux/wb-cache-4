5|$|The PL.8 also {{incorporated}} several {{safety features}} {{in case of}} ditching at sea. Apart from small floats attached directly to the undersides of the lower wing, the main units of the fixed, tailskid undercarriage could be jettisoned on takeoff, {{in order to reduce}} the aircraft's weight. The underside of the fuselage was given a boat-like shape and made watertight for a <b>water</b> <b>landing.</b> Nungesser and Coli's plan was to make a <b>water</b> <b>landing</b> in New York, in front of the Statue of Liberty.|$|E

5|$|Westland also {{manufactured}} SAR {{versions of}} the Sea King for the Royal Norwegian Air Force, the German Navy and the Belgian Air Force. On SAR variants, the cabin was enlarged by a stretch of the fuselage behind the door; another key feature, used for additional flotation in the unusual event of a <b>water</b> <b>landing,</b> inflatable buoyancy bags were housed inside the aircraft's sponsons. Upgrades and changes made to SAR Sea Kings include the addition of radar warning receivers, a cargo hook for the underslung carriage of goods, and the redesigning of the cockpit for compatibility with night vision goggles.|$|E

5|$|Though he {{was only}} a {{lieutenant}} at the time, many of VF-18's green pilots turned to Harris for advice. The squadron's commanding officer similarly recognized Harris's ability and made him flight operations officer. According to later testimony from his peers, the tactical and flight training Harris provided to his outfit helped see them through the war. His prowess on the wing would save a number of them in more direct fashion, both in dog fights and carrier landings. On October 29, Intrepid entered a squall with a Combat Air Patrol inbound. Though many from VB-18 and VT-18 were forced to water land, Harris used his dead reckoning and other navigation skills to find the carrier in the storm. He landed successfully and radioed information to men in the air, saving them from the risks of <b>water</b> <b>landing</b> and preserving valuable aircraft.|$|E

25|$|On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte/Douglas International Airport ditched {{into the}} Hudson River after {{experiencing}} {{a loss of}} both turbines.

Soon after this, one of the ride operators realized what was going on, and stopped the ride. The same ride operator jumped onto the catwalk, and closed the restraints through a panel.

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the success of his Pregnant Guppy, {{constructor}} Jack Conroy discussed his concepts for other outsize transports with Air Progress in their publication, World's Greatest Aircraft (Petersen Publications, 1973). Conroy considered the creation of an outsize transport from the Princess to have been basically feasible, in that it shares a sectional 'double-bubble' fuselage construction {{similar to that of the}} Boeing Model 377 Stratocruiser, on which the Guppies were based. The reason for considering producing such an aircraft was the desire of NASA to possess a means of transporting first stage of the Saturn V rocket by air, if this were possible, to Cape Canaveral; the ability for the aircraft to conduct a <b>water</b> <b>landing</b> would also be advantageous for proximity landing at sea, or on nearby lakes in Florida.|$|E

25|$|In 1911, Lieutenant Longmore and Oswald Short {{installed}} streamlined {{air bags}} on the undercarriage struts and under the tail of Improved S.27 No. 38 to enable the aircraft to land on water. On 1 December 1911, Longmore used the aircraft {{to become the first}} person in the United Kingdom to take off from land and make a successful <b>water</b> <b>landing</b> when he landed in the river Medway off Sheerness, after which No.38 was brought ashore and flown back to Eastchurch. A flying-off platform was constructed over the foredeck and forward 12-inch (305mm) gun turret of the pre-dreadnought battleship HMS Africa, and on 10 January 1912 Samson, piloting No.38, used the platform while Africa was anchored off Sheerness to make the United Kingdom’s first successful aeroplane take-off from a ship. The platform was later transferred to the battleship HMS Hibernia.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time, in situ {{analysis}} of the atmosphere of another planet was performed and the data sent back to Earth; the analysis included chemical composition, temperature and pressure. The measured ratio of carbon dioxide to nitrogen of about 13 corrected the previous estimates so much (an inverse ratio was expected in some quarters) that some scientists contested the observations. The main station detected no radiation belts; relative to Earth, the measured magnetic field was 3000 times weaker, and the hydrogen corona was 1000 times less dense. No atomic oxygen was detected. All the data suggested that water, {{if it had been}} present, had leaked from the planet long before. This conclusion was unexpected considering the thick Venusian clouds. Because of the negligible humidity, the sugar lock system, employed on Venera 4 in case of a <b>water</b> <b>landing,</b> was abandoned in subsequent Venus probes.|$|E
