5|$|In West African cultures, women <b>with</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> {{were highly}} valued. Long, thick hair {{was seen as}} a sign of health, strength, and {{capability}} to bear many children. In keeping with this general theme, women who were too young for marriage would shave a portion of their heads to signal so. This tradition, however, did not extend to every West African culture, as several valued shorter hair.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} Japan, heian gentleman {{were not very}} {{interested}} in a woman's physical beauty and rarely {{had an opportunity to}} see it. The only physical attribute of interest was a woman's hair, which had to be thick and longer than she was tall. The fascination <b>with</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> was one reason why a woman's becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness— it could never again grow to its full length. This explains why Genji refuses to let Murasaki (his de facto wife in the classical Japanese novel The Tale of Genji) take the tonsure when she is ill.|$|E

5|$|Ways of life {{often viewed}} as more rigid, such as {{soldiers}} and religious cultures, frequently have explicit rules regarding hair length. For example, Buddhist monks shave their heads {{as part of their}} order of worship. Similarly, religious men <b>with</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> include the Nazarites of the Hebrew Bible (Samson being a famous example) and the Sikhs. Subservient cultures may view male long hair negatively, and are sometimes detected by their rulers through hair length, {{as was the case with}} the Gaelic Irish under English rule and the Moors under Spanish rule in Medieval Spain.|$|E
5|$|Gilly {{was later}} seen using his new look {{in attempt to}} get the {{affections}} of Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson). After failing he acted out of character and struck up a scam date with Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) to make Steph jealous but it back-fired when his false tooth came loose in Cheryl's mouth. He later has relationships with Cheryl and Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clark). Another change implemented during this period was a dramatic change to the character's appearance after new series producer Lucy Allan and Quinlan came to a mutual decision to transform his hairstyle by shaving it all off, a stark contrast as during his early years he was constantly seen <b>with</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hanson and Hawk later {{reformed}} {{their team}} and competed {{together in the}} Amarillo, Texas-based NWA Western States Sports. While there, they won the NWA Western States Tag Team Championship three times. Hanson's final title reign {{was the only one}} that did not involve Hawk, as he teamed with The Hangman in Montreal, Quebec to win the Canadian International Tag Team Championship in 1981. Hanson then returned to McMahon's New England-based Capitol Wrestling, which had since become the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Using the gimmick of a redneck, complete <b>with</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> and a Confederate flag, he competed for the WWF as a face until his retirement in 1986.|$|E

5|$|The foederati {{make their}} first {{official}} appearance on Trajan's Column, {{where they are}} portrayed in a standardised manner, <b>with</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> and beards, barefoot, stripped to the waist, wearing long trousers held up by wide belts and wielding clubs. In reality several different tribes supported the Romans in the Dacian wars. Their attire and weapons would have varied widely. The Column stereotypes them {{with the appearance of}} a single tribe, probably the most outlandish-looking, to differentiate them clearly from the regular auxilia. Judging by the frequency of their appearance in the Column's battle scenes, the foederati were important contributors to the Roman operations in Dacia. Another example of foederati are the 5,500 captured Sarmatian cavalrymen sent by Emperor Marcus Aurelius (r. 161–180) to garrison a fort on Hadrian's Wall after their defeat in the Marcomannic Wars.|$|E

25|$|Like {{his earlier}} directorial ventures Asoka and The Terrorist (a.k.a. Malli), Santosh {{was also the}} cinematographer for Anathabhadram. Kavya Madhavan {{replaced}} Meera as the female lead and gave a performance that established her as the top heroine of the Malayalam Film Industry that year, aided by both commercial success and critical acclaim. Prithviraj Sukumaran as the male lead also had his biggest success of 2005, out of the five films he did that year. Manoj K Jayan {{was to have a}} sannyasin look <b>with</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> in the proposed Sabu Cyril version, but sported a more contemporary look in the version that was eventually shot, winning much critical accolades.|$|E
25|$|His {{government}} {{supervised the}} people's lives very closely. Early in his rule, Banda instituted a dress code rooted in his socially conservative predilections. Women {{were not allowed}} to wear see-through clothing, have visible cleavage, trousers, or wear skirts or dresses that went above the knee. The only exception to this was at vacation resorts and country clubs, where they could not be seen by the general public. Banda explained that these restrictions were not designed to oppress women, but instill respect and dignity for them. Men's hair had to be no longer than collar length, and foreign visitors at the airport were given mandatory haircuts if necessary. Any man who ventured into public <b>with</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> could also be seized by police and subjected to an involuntary haircut.|$|E

25|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot of running water. Rihanna is then {{presented}} undressing and climbing into a bathtub. Throughout {{the rest of the}} video, the singer is presented nude in the tub full of cloudy green water; subtle camera angles protect her modesty. Rihanna is shown wearing little make-up and <b>with</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> tangled and wet over one side of her face. The singer seems morose and sad as she occasionally flickers her eyes to the ceiling and puts her head in her hands, showing off long manicured nails and a diamond stud earring. The low-key video also features Mikky Ekko, who performs his parts of the song separately including scenes of him {{perched on the edge of}} a different bathtub, gazing into a mirror, in front of an unlit fireplace, and sitting on a grand chair. The video switches between the pair throughout the course of the video until it concludes with a single tear falling from Rihanna's eye as she sinks lower into the bathtub.|$|E
25|$|When {{creating}} Himari, author Milan Matra {{opted to}} have her character be easy to draw. He came up with her design easily, but became stuck in regards to her name and her style of speech. Eventually he decided on the name Himari and an old-fashioned speech style. Himari was originally going to have short hair in the final chapter but Matra decided to go <b>with</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair,</b> and use the short haired designs for her evil side, Black Himari, which appears earlier in the series. Himari also has a sister named Hime who was originally {{going to be a}} male character. Matra made the change saying {{that he did not want}} his readers to wrap their hearts around two different male characters which would have also impacted Himari's storyline. When asked at a book fair in Taiwan why he chose a cat to represent the main character, Matra replied that he thinks that cats in general are cute. In the story, Himari states that her mother died while giving birth to her while her father might have been another species of demon cat, or possibly a stray.|$|E
25|$|Thirty {{years before}} the events of Ring, Akiko Miyaji, a {{reporter}} whose fiancé and fellow reporter was killed during Shizuko Yamamura's publicized ESP demonstration years before, interviews Sudo, an elementary school principal and a former teacher of Shizuko's daughter, Sadako, attempting to gain information and evidence that Sadako inherited her mother's nensha powers. Meanwhile, a 19-year-old Sadako joins an acting troupe as an understudy as a therapy to her nightmares suggested by her doctor. Sadako has natural beauty and charisma for the play, infuriating her senior, Aiko Hazuki, whose relationship with the troupe director, Yusaku Shigemori, sours due to the latter's newfound favor for the young trainee. Aiko is later found murdered by a figure in white, thus Sadako takes her place for the upcoming play as the lead character. Sadako attracts and reciprocates {{the attention of the}} troupe sound director, Hiroshi Toyama, much to the disappointment of costume designer and Toyama's girlfriend, Etsuko Tachihara. While praised by Shigemori and Toyama, other troupe members grow to distrust and fear Sadako, as they suspect that she is the one who caused Aiko's death and other supernatural occurrences, including strange dreams pertaining to a well and an apparition of a girl in white <b>with</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> very similar to Sadako.|$|E
