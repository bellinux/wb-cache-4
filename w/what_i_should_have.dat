What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video.

500|$|Only days later, Carey began posting {{irregular}} voice {{notes and}} messages on her official website: [...] "I'm {{trying to understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself." [...] Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been [...] "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" [...] when she posted the letters. On July26, she was hospitalized, citing [...] "extreme exhaustion" [...] and a [...] "physical and emotional breakdown". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} the solemn protest of my Jewish neighbors, I feel I ought to express clearly and {{unequivocally}} ... my sincere regret that by any act of commission or omission, I should have seemed to lend countenance ... to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{known to be a}} cruel libel imputing human sacrifice as a practice now or {{at any time in the}} history of the Jewish people.|$|E

6000|$|... "Or mayn't I {{rather go}} to the other place? From how much embarrassment <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{relieved}} my father! <b>What</b> a friend <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> made for Percival!

60|$|<b>What</b> truth? <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{been hard}} put {{to it to}} explain. Probably, if pressed, I would have burst into tears simply. I was young enough for that.|$|R
2500|$|Brian and Patrick {{continued}} to combat homophobia in the NHL after Brendan's death; Patrick, along with Brian Kitts and Glenn Witman, founded You Can Play {{as a tribute}} to his brother. The name You Can Play originates from a piece Patrick Burke wrote for outsports.com. In the piece, Patrick talks about the overwhelmingly positive experience surrounding Brendan's coming out: [...] "I waited to get a negative email, or to read a damning article, or to hear a snide comment at a game. I waited, and I waited, and I waited…and I got <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> expected the entire time: love, support, and admiration." [...] He talks of letters and emails that poured in to his family, and he also talks of fellow scouts and hockey personnel pulling him aside and giving their support. He summarizes his feelings in the revelation that across the hockey world, what matters is whether or not you can play. [...] "If you can play, we welcome you." [...] The quote was adapted to the catchier [...] "If you can play, you can play" [...] by the campaign.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{how very}} kind you are!" [...] Bertram exclaimed, {{looking down at}} her gratefully. [...] "I'm sure <b>I</b> don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> ever <b>have</b> done in this crisis without you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For mercy's sake, don't, your highness! I {{made the}} pasty {{according}} to the best rules; nothing has been left out. Ask the prince <b>what</b> else <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> put in.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like! <b>Have</b> you got it? Oh, my dear boy! your fortune is made {{if you go}} to that {{well-established}} and flourishing place, {{with those}} good men to help you along!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{think of}} any reason," [...] replied Alison. [...] "Still, it isn't <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> anticipated. What can have {{influenced}} him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> expected," [...] said Mr. Hawley, {{mounting}} his horse. [...] "Any cursed alien blood, Jew, Corsican, or Gypsy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's only <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{expected}} from you, Red Cloud," [...] she murmured gratefully. [...] "But is Doctor Robinson game for it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Next day," [...] she uttered distinctly, [...] "I didn't think. I remembered. That was enough. <b>I</b> remembered <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> forgotten. Never. And Captain Anthony {{arrived at}} the cottage in the evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said my wife, [...] "for I took no {{additional}} trouble {{to get your}} meals. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> did, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done if you had not come. To be sure I did spend a few minutes preparing your room. I will charge you seven twenty-fourths of a cent for that, thus making your bill twenty-three cents--even money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, Mr Melmotte. On {{matters such}} as that I think that I can see my own way. I have been in fault in coming in to the Board without {{understanding}} <b>what</b> duties <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to perform--.' ...|$|R

60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--This is to {{announce}} to you, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> believe <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been done sooner, {{that we are}} at Skerryvore. We were both tired, and I was fighting my second cold, so we came straight through by the west.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said I, [...] "my {{remittance}} at last! <b>What</b> a bother <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> missed it! Can you lend me {{a hundred}} francs until to-morrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything," [...] he confessed. [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{done without}} her. She {{has been the}} most {{wonderful}} friend any one could have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my goodness! If {{anybody else}} had caught you I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done. I don't {{see how you}} could be so venturesome!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{admired her}} {{more and more}} every time I looked at her, and I {{determined}} that, {{as soon as the}} proper time <b>should</b> come, <b>I</b> would make earnest love to her, and tell her <b>what,</b> perhaps, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> told her long ago. But just now I had other matters on my mind.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have the}} best reason to be {{impressed}} with the feeling, mind,' said Nicholas; 'for {{if it had not}} been for your kindness of heart, my good friend, when I had no right or reason to expect it, <b>I</b> know not <b>what</b> might have become of me or <b>what</b> plight <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been in by this time.' ...|$|R
60|$|I was dumbfounded at this {{fresh and}} more {{intimate}} glimpse of her. The beauty {{of her body}} was there {{for all to see}} and worship; but here was my first glimpse of the rare beauties of her mind. In <b>what</b> words <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> answered her <b>I</b> do not know, for at that moment we suffered an interruption.|$|R
6000|$|... "You may defend Mr. Ogilvie, Norman, {{but it is}} not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{expected}} from him. Why did he make promises, and then neglect his relations?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite my opinion," [...] said Drummle, [...] "and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{suggested}} myself, or done--more likely--without suggesting. But don't {{lose your}} temper. Haven't you lost enough without that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't try. I {{feel now}} that I have done nothing--nothing of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done; but I didn't {{think you were}} to leave so soon. If I had known--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> minded. <b>What</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{felt with}} a husband as wouldn't have wanted me {{ever to have}} my own father in his house? Would that have made me happy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Reason?" [...] {{said the}} captain. [...] "Good gracious, no. <b>What</b> reason <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>have?</b> My leg is a trifle stiff to-day for stiles, but still—" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I ought," [...] said Mr. Carter, {{smiling at}} her. [...] "Besides, <b>what</b> reason <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> for saying I am Bert if I am not?" ...|$|R
