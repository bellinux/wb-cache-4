40|$|Abstract In {{semi-arid}} regions, a major population limi-tation for riparian trees is seedling desiccation {{during the}} dry season that follows annual spring floods. We investi-gated the stress response of first-year pioneer riparian seedlings to experimental water table declines (0, 1 and 3 cm day- 1), focusing on the three dominant cottonwood and <b>willows</b> (<b>family</b> Salicaceae) in California’s San Joa-quin Basin. We analyzed growth and belowground allo-cation response to water stress, and used logistic regression to determine if these traits had an influence on individual survival. The models indicate that high root growth ([3 mm day- 1) and low shoot:root ratios (. 5 g g- 1) strongly predicted survival, but {{there was no evidence that}} plants increased belowground allocation in response to drawdown. Leaf d 13 C values shifted most for the best-surviving species (net change of? 3. 5 per mil from- 30. 0 ± 0. 3 control values for Goodding’s willow, Salix gooddingii), implying an important role of increased water-use efficiency for surviving water stress. Both S. gooddingii and sandbar willow (S. exigua) reduced leaf size from controls, whereas Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) sustained a 29...|$|R

5000|$|The family only {{discovered}} {{he was in}} Montreal in 1967, and so in 1975 started the process {{to try and get}} the body back to Willow Bunch for a proper burial. The University refused and claimed rights over the body, and said that they wanted to continue doing research and didn't want the body displayed anywhere else. In 1989 the family once again tried, this time bringing the media with them as well to put some pressure on the University. This time the effort worked, and so the University decided they could cremate the remains, to prevent anyone from grave-robbing the body. It took two big urns to contain the Giant's ashes. Finally, in 1990, the body of [...] "le Géant Beaupré" [...] or [...] "le Géant de Willow-Bunch" [...] was brought back to <b>Willow</b> Bunch. The <b>family</b> had a memorial service, and his remains now lie in front of the Willow Bunch Museum.|$|R
40|$|WRKY {{proteins}} are the {{zinc finger}} transcription factors that were first identified in plants. They can specifically {{interact with the}} W-box, {{which can be found}} in the promoter region of a large number of plant target genes, to regulate the expressions of downstream target genes. They also participate in diverse physiological and growing processes in plants. Prior to this study, a plenty of WRKY genes have been identified and characterized in herbaceous species, but there is no large-scale study of WRKY genes in willow. With the whole genome sequencing of Salix suchowensis, we have the opportunity to conduct the genome-wide research for <b>willow</b> WRKY gene <b>family.</b> In this study, we identified 85 WRKY genes in the willow genome and renamed them from SsWRKY 1 to SsWRKY 85 on the basis of their specific distributions on chromosomes. Due to their diverse structural features, the 85 willow WRKY genes could be further classified into three main groups (group I–III), with five subgroups (IIa–IIe) in group II. With the multiple sequence alignment and the manual search, we found three variations of the WRKYGQK heptapeptide: WRKYGRK, WKKYGQK and WRKYGKK, and four variations of the normal zinc finger motif, which might execute some new biological functions. In addition, the SsWRKY genes from the same subgroup share the similar exon–intron structures and conserved motif domains. Further studies of SsWRKY genes revealed that segmental duplication events (SDs) played a more prominent role in the expansion of SsWRKY genes. Distinct expression profiles of SsWRKY genes with RNA sequencing data revealed that diverse expression patterns among five tissues, including tender roots, young leaves, vegetative buds, non-lignified stems and barks. With the analyses of WRKY gene <b>family</b> in <b>willow,</b> it is not only beneficial to complete the functional and annotation information of WRKY genes family in woody plants, but also provide important references to investigate the expansion and evolution of this gene family in flowering plants...|$|R
6000|$|Thursday was {{the early}} closing day at Lammam, {{and next to}} Sunday the busiest part of the week at the Potwell Inn. Sometimes {{as many as six}} boats all at once would be moored against the ferry punt and hiring rowboats. People could either have a {{complete}} tea, a complete tea with jam, cake and eggs, a kettle of boiling water and find the rest, or refreshments á la carte, as they chose. They sat about, but usually the boiling water-ers had a delicacy about using the tables and grouped themselves humbly on the ground. The complete tea-ers with jam and eggs got the best tablecloth on the table nearest the steps that led up to the glass-panelled door. The groups about the lawn were very satisfying to Mr. Polly's sense of amenity. To the right were the complete tea-ers with everything heart could desire, then a small group of three young men in remarkable green and violet and pale-blue shirts, and two girls in mauve and yellow blouses with common teas and gooseberry jam at the green clothless table, then on the grass down by the pollard <b>willow</b> a small <b>family</b> of hot water-ers with a hamper, a little troubled by wasps in their jam from the nest in the tree and all in mourning, but happy otherwise, and on the lawn to the right a ginger beer lot of 'prentices without their collars and very jocular and happy. The young people in the rainbow shirts and blouses formed the centre of interest; they were under the leadership of a gold-spectacled senior with a fluting voice and an air of mystery; he ordered everything, and showed a peculiar knowledge of the qualities of the Potwell jams, preferring gooseberry with much insistence. Mr. Polly watched him, christened him the [...] "benifluous influence," [...] glanced at the 'prentices and went inside and down into the cellar in order to replenish the stock of stone ginger beer which the plump woman had allowed to run low during the preoccupations of the campaign. It was in the cellar that he first became aware of the return of Uncle Jim. He became aware of him as a voice, a voice not only hoarse, but thick, as voices thicken under the influence of alcohol.|$|R
