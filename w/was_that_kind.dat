500|$|In July 2013, Dennings {{told reporters}} that the film was about to head into reshoots. In August, Taylor said he shot extra scenes with Hiddleston {{and was about to}} shoot more with Hopkins. Taylor {{explained}} that it was all a part of the [...] "Marvel process" [...] saying, [...] "We're doing full scenes, scenes that were not in the movie before. We're adding scenes, creating scenes, writing scenes for the first time. The one [...] was a fun connective scene... We realised how well Loki was working in the movie, and we wanted to do more with him. So it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of thing, it was like, 'Oh, we could do this, we could jam this in here' because he's such a wonderful guy to watch do his stuff." [...] Also in August, IMAX Corporation and Marvel Entertainment announced that the film would be digitally re-mastered into the IMAX 3D format and released into IMAX 3D theatres internationally beginning October 30, 2013.|$|E
2500|$|According to Jefferson Airplane's Spencer Dryden, {{the idea}} for [...] "a kind of Woodstock West" [...] began when he and bandmate Jorma Kaukonen {{discussed}} the staging of a free concert with the Grateful Dead and Rolling Stones in Golden Gate Park. Referring to the Stones, Dryden said, [...] "Next to the Beatles they were the biggest rock and roll band in the world, and we wanted them to experience what we were experiencing in San Francisco." [...] As plans were being finalized, Jefferson Airplane were on the road, and by early December they were in Florida, believing the concert plans for Golden Gate Park were proceeding. But by December 4, the plans had broken down, in Paul Kantner's account, because the city and police departments were unhelpful; innate conflict between the hippies of Haight-Ashbury and the police was manifested in obstructiveness. Sears Point Raceway was suggested, but its owners wanted $100,000 in escrow from the Rolling Stones. At the last moment, Dick Carter offered his Altamont Speedway in Alameda County for the festival. Jefferson Airplane flew out of Miami on December 5. Kantner said the location was taken {{in a spirit of}} desperation: [...] "There was no way to control it, no supervision or order." [...] According to Grace Slick, [...] "The vibes were bad. Something was very peculiar, not particularly bad, just real peculiar. It <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of hazy, abrasive and unsure day. I had expected the loving vibes of Woodstock but that wasn't coming at me. This was a whole different thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|British {{director}} Brian Grant {{was hired}} to direct Summer's video for [...] "She Works Hard for the Money". The video was a success, being nominated for MTV Music Video Awards for Best Female Video and Best Choreography; Summer {{became one of the}} first black artists, and the first African-American Female Artist to have her video played in heavy rotation on MTV. Grant would also be hired to direct Summer's Costa Mesa HBO concert special, A Hot Summers Night. Grant who was a fan of the song State of Independence had an idea for a grand finale. He wanted a large chorus of children to join Summer on stage at the ending of the song. His team looked for local school children in Orange County, to create a chorus of 500 students. On the final day of rehearsals, the kids turned up and they had a full rehearsal. [...] According to Grant, [...] "It looked and sounded amazing. It was a very emotional, very tearful experience for everyone who was there." [...] He thought if this <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of reaction in rehearsal, then what an impact it would have in the concert. After the rehearsal Grant was informed that he could not use the kids because the concert would end after 10 pm; children could not be licensed to be on stage at such a late hour (California had strict child labor laws in 1983). [...] "It's a moment that I regret immensely: a grand finale concept I came up with that couldn't be filmed in the end". When the final sequence was filmed, Summer's daughter Mimi and her family members joined her on stage for [...] "State of Independence".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Just so, and I {{do believe}} it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of vanity that took from her her power of discerning and the instinctive {{shrinking}} from evil.' ...|$|E

6000|$|In her {{limitless}} gratitude {{the happy}} mother waived rank {{and hugged him}} too, calling him [...] "the angel of God in disguise." [...] And he probably was in disguise if he <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of an official. He was dressed for the character.|$|E
6000|$|... “No, I don’t {{think he}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind.</b> Besides, he <b>was</b> very angry at Merwell and Jasniff and {{wanted nothing more}} to do with them.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{it would}} be just like those Rovers to do {{something}} like that," [...] came from Nappy Martell. [...] "They <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of fellows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Self-sufficiency!" [...] {{she said}} with a groan; but with a sudden turn she exclaimed, [...] "You don't trust to my {{surrendering}} my judgment. I don't think I <b>am</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} have done right," [...] Cheyne said. [...] "A little rough on him! I had already figured he <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of a man. Well, I hear {{the rest of the}} boys coming back, and I'll send up a {{sergeant}} who knows a good deal about these accidents to look after him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Kind of a for Kind of. [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of a man." [...] Say {{that kind}} of man. Man here is generic, and a genus {{comprises}} many kinds. But there cannot {{be more than one}} kind of one thing. Kind of followed by an adjective, as, [...] "kind of good," [...] is almost too gross for censure.|$|E
6000|$|... "’I like sailors,’ she ses; ’one thing is, my boy was a sailor; {{and another}} thing is, they’ve got such feelin’ ’earts.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I expect Jim has {{had other}} accidents; as you remarked, he <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of man. Did he get hurt {{when you were}} {{with him in the}} woods?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of thing!' said she, in {{an altered}} tone, her cheeks glowing; 'it is very silly {{of him to}} get himself talked about; {{but of course it}} is all nothing.' ...|$|R
60|$|ARISTOCRACY, n. Government by {{the best}} men. (In this sense the word is obsolete; so <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of government.) Fellows that wear downy hats and clean shirts--guilty of {{education}} and suspected of bank accounts.|$|R
60|$|Again there <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of rummy {{something}} in his manner. It {{was the way he}} said it, don't you know. He didn't like the suit. I pulled myself together to assert myself. Something seemed to tell me that, unless I was jolly careful and nipped this lad in the bud, he would be starting to boss me. He had the aspect of a distinctly resolute blighter.|$|E
60|$|Ethelberta was not {{disposed}} {{to believe that}} Christopher would have called, had time favoured him to the utmost. Between himself and her there <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of division which is more insurmountable than enmity; for estrangements produced by good judgment will last when those of feeling break down in smiles. Not the lovers who part in passion, but the lovers who part in friendship, are those who most frequently part for ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "After all," [...] said Ellams, [...] "there was no {{theatrical}} climax. One day {{a launch}} brought us a cablegram. Wyndham was wanted at home, the ebb tide was running and a mailboat {{was due to}} call at Takana lagoon. In an hour Columbine dropped down stream and my notion is {{it was a relief}} to Wyndham the cablegram arrived. If it had not arrived, he would have stayed. He <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of man." ...|$|E

We're both <b>that</b> <b>kind.</b> YOU know, teacher," [...] he added, {{squeezing}} her hand chummily. [...] "Isn't it splendid to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind,</b> teacher?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Croyden, [...] "only it doesn't {{happen to}} <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of key. It's a West Indian island all right, but there's a summer {{hotel on the}} other end of it not two miles away." ...|$|R
500|$|... {{you took}} all the {{characteristics}} and makeup, you'd want to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of official." [...] His godfather, Johnny Stevens, was an American League umpire and worked four World Series in a career that spanned from 1948 to 1975.|$|R
60|$|He {{realized}} {{now that}} at first glance he should have recognized in her look, her poise, her voice the quality he called thoroughbred. Ragged and stained apparel did not prove her of a common sort. Jean had known a number of fine and wholesome girls of good family; and he remembered his sister. This Ellen Jorth <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of a girl irrespective of her present environment. Jean championed her loyally, even after he had gratified his selfish pride.|$|E
60|$|Her {{stockings}} are loose {{over her}} ankles. I detest that: so tasteless. Those literary etherial {{people they are}} all. Dreamy, cloudy, symbolistic. Esthetes they are. I wouldn't be surprised if it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical. For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts you couldn't squeeze a line of poetry out of him. Don't know what poetry is even. Must be in a certain mood.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{he should}} {{complete}} the parallel, and skip, too, {{was a point}} which {{he had not yet}} acknowledged to himself that he had decided. He never had believed that it need come to that; but, for an instant, when the president said he could wish him nothing better on his way home than a good railroad accident, it flashed upon him that one of the three alternatives before him was to skip. He had the choice to kill himself, which {{was supposed to be the}} gentlemanly way out of his difficulties, and would leave his family unstained by his crime; that matter had sometimes been discussed in his presence, and every one had agreed that it was the only thing for a gentleman to do after he had pilfered people of money he could not pay back. There was something else that a man of other instincts and weaker fibre might do, and that was to stand his trial for embezzlement, and take his punishment. Or a man, if he <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of a man, could skip. The question with Northwick was whether he <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of man, or whether, if he skipped, he would be that kind of man; whether the skipping would make him that kind of man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Dorothy with a laugh, [...] "that {{was easier}} than I expected. It's worth while, sometimes, to {{be a real}} fairy. But I wouldn't like to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind,</b> and live in a dreadful fog all the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you mind," [...] said Miss Asher. [...] "Well, it's because--well, I didn't {{think you}} <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> when I first saw you. But {{you are all}} like. And now will you take me home, or will I have to call a cop?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Sewell, with {{a little}} gesture of comprehension. [...] "Since he has made his mind up, he will, I fancy, manage <b>that,</b> too. Ingleby <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of person. Then, {{if he does not}} do so sooner, he will {{naturally}} marry Hetty Leger." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{discovery}} of the attractive Grace's name and family {{would have been enough}} in other circumstances to lead the doctor, if not to put her personality out of his head, to change the character of his interest in her. Instead of treasuring her image as a rarity, he would at most have played with it as a toy. He <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of a man. But situated here he could not go so far as amative cruelty. He dismissed all reverential thought about her, but he could not help taking her seriously.|$|E
60|$|The third day, however, Bo was better, and, {{refusing to}} remain in bed, she hobbled to the sitting-room, where she divided her time between staring {{out of the window}} toward the corrals and pestering Helen with {{questions}} she tried to make appear casual. But Helen saw through her case and {{was in a state of}} glee. What she hoped most for was that Carmichael would suddenly develop a little less inclination for Bo. It <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of treatment the young lady needed. And now was the great opportunity. Helen almost felt tempted to give the cowboy a hint.|$|E
60|$|And he <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of a boy. He {{should have}} lived, {{and yet he}} should not have lived, because he died at that early age--he couldn't have been more than twenty--he had seen all there was to see in the world that was worth the trouble of living in it; he had seen all of this world that is {{valuable}}; he had seen all of this world that was illusion, and illusion, is the only valuable thing in it. He had arrived at that point where presently the illusions would cease and he would have entered upon the realities of life, and God help the man that has arrived at that point.|$|E

6000|$|... "That would suit {{her well}} enough, I dare say," [...] said Mrs. Plymdale; [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of {{lightness}} about her. But she got that from her mother; {{she never got}} it from her aunt Bulstrode, who always gave her good advice, and to my knowledge would rather have had her marry elsewhere." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Chapter I, [...] "Introduction" [...] (pages 3-7), Barnard {{notes that}} [...] "formal {{organization}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of cooperation among men <b>that</b> <b>is</b> conscious, deliberate, purposeful," [...] and that [...] "successful cooperation in or by formal organizations is the abnormal, not the normal, condition." [...] An individual may belong to many formal organizations, {{some of which}} may be short-lived.|$|R
