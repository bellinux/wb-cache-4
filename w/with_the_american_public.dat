5|$|Other {{countries}} considered similar memorials. The US {{constructed a}} Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in 1921; while {{the idea was}} clearly a foreign concept, it proved very popular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> and by 1936 was attracting over 1.5 m visitors a year and acting as an informal national monument to the war. Edwin Redslob, part of the German government, supported a similar scheme in 1925, but without success, and Mainz Cathedral and Ulm Minster were later proposed as options for a tomb. In Germany, a tomb was not finally built until 1935, when it {{was sponsored by the}} Nazi government; the final memorial contained 20 bodies of unknown German soldiers from the Eastern front. Other countries also constructed tombs, including Belgium and Portugal, and as in France and Britain these tombs were placed in capital cities; there was an abortive attempt to place the Romanian tomb at Mărăşeşti, but this proved impractical for both logistic and ceremonial reasons. Canada, Australia and New Zealand declined to build their own tombs, as they were considered to be represented by the burial in London.|$|E

25|$|Following the 1973 oil crisis; however, smaller vehicles, often {{imported}} from Japan, {{became more and}} more popular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> as these vehicles featured better fuel economy ratings. In the late 1970s, the US government passed minimum fuel economy standards. In the 1980s, American automobile manufacturers drastically downsized their cars. Only a few vehicles, such as those using the Ford Panther platform retained their original size.|$|E
25|$|Miranda was {{encouraged}} by the U.S. government as part of Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy, designed to strengthen ties with Latin America. It was believed that performers like her would give the policy a favorable impression <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public.</b> Miranda's contract with 20th Century Fox lasted from 1941 to 1946, shortly after the creation (in 1940) of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. The goal of the OCIAA, based in Rio de Janeiro, was to obtain support from Latin American society and its governments for the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{other members}} of this {{commission}} were Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Elbridge Gerry. However, when the envoys arrived in October 1797, they were kept waiting for several days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister Talleyrand. After this, the diplomats were met by three of Talleyrand's agents. Each refused to conduct diplomatic negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, and another to the Republic of France. The Americans refused to negotiate on such terms. Marshall and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained. This diplomatic scandal {{became known as the}} XYZ Affair, inflaming anti-French opinion in the United States. Marshall arrived in New York on June 17. His handling of the affair, as well as public resentment toward the French, made him popular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public.</b> He opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts, enacted by the Federalists in response to the crisis.|$|E
5000|$|Mass-market Amigas were {{considerably}} {{cheaper than}} PCs and Macs at the time.

This perception was furthered {{by the fact that}} most Commodore retail outlets were toy stores, and marketing campaigns were mismatched <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public's</b> needs and wants.

25|$|Beginning in 2013, Cuban and U.S. {{officials}} held secret talks brokered {{in part by}} Pope Francis and hosted in Canada and Vatican City {{to start}} the process of restoring diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States. On 17 December 2014, the framework of an agreement to normalize relations and eventually end the longstanding embargo was announced by Castro in Cuba and Obama in the United States. Cuba and the United States pledged to start official negotiations {{with the aim of}} reopening their respective embassies in Havana and Washington. As part of the agreement, aid worker Alan Gross and an unnamed Cuban national working as a U.S intelligence asset were released by the Cuban government, which also promised to free an unspecified number of Cuban nationals from a list of political prisoners earlier submitted by the United States. For its part, the U.S. government released the last three remaining members of the Cuban Five. Reaction to this change in policy within the Cuban-American community was mixed, and Cuban-American senators Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) all condemned the Obama administration's change in policy. However, opinion polls indicated the thaw in relations was broadly popular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public.</b>|$|E
25|$|USS Ferret {{was part}} of a naval fleet that sailed to the Caribbean to subdue the {{occurrence}} of pirate raids on merchant ships that had increased to almost 3,000 by the early 1820s. The financial losses to the United States was great while murder and the practice of torture were common. Losses to American ships and merchants had increased to such proportions that the situation began making headlines in American newspapers. In little time merchants and shippers along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> were demanding that the U.S. Navy take definite action against piracy that was out of control in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. In November 1822 when the captain of the USS Alligator was killed in a battle with the notorious Cuban pirate Domingo that was the last straw. Response was quick and by 22 December President James Monroe authorized the creation of the West Indies squadron for purposes of seeking and routing out pirates and their numerous strongholds about the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. They were also directed to suppress the international slave trade which also operated out of this region and outlawed in the United States. Following Monroe's authorization the Secretary of the Navy, Smith Thompson, promoted David Porter to commodore, allocated $500,000 to him and appointed him to take commanded of and outfit the squadron for war against the pirates. British interests in the Caribbean also threatened, the West Indies squadron fought piracy in a concerted effort with the Royal Navy.|$|E
500|$|Another chapter compares how the American, English, and French {{educational}} systems foster {{private and public}} identities. She writes that the French public school system is best for its neutral secularity and disregard of [...] "parentally inspired discriminations", which {{are not allowed to}} influence the common nature of the school. This is contrasted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> school system's trends of increased privatization and non-neutrality. American school voucher programs use public school money towards private schools, departing from the mission of the common public school and further compounding school inequality and ethnic segregation. Levinson concludes that parental choice limits capacity for autonomy and, consequently, individual liberty.|$|E

5000|$|Members of the U.S. Army Special Forces will emphatically {{assert that}} the [...] "Green Beret" [...] is a hat and not the man who wears it. Nevertheless, {{for a time in}} the 1960s the Green Berets and the men who wore them became a {{national}} fad emerging {{in a wide variety of}} popular culture referents. After a decline in popularity during the 1970s — coinciding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public's</b> backlash against <b>the</b> Vietnam War — the Green Berets gripped the popular imagination again beginning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Rambo film franchise in 1982. They continue to appear as both major and minor referents in popular culture — especially in movies and television — often serving as a shorthand signifier for a shady or covert military background for a fictional character. As a dramatic device, this can cut both ways — i.e., lead an audience to either admire or fear (or both) a character.|$|R
500|$|As a BBC production, Persuasion {{originally}} {{received a}} budget of £750,000. The British broadcaster proposed a collaboration <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> television station WGBH Boston, a partnership that had also produced the American anthology television series Masterpiece Theatre as well as literary adaptations like the serial Pride and Prejudice. Rebecca Eaton, executive producer of Masterpiece Theatre, approved the co-production as she had a preference for Persuasion out of all Austen's novels. [...] The decision led to additional funding. Eaton would cite Persuasion as a successful example of WGBH using its small budget to invest in television projects, though she later expressed regret that the adaptation was two hours rather than a [...] "luscious" [...] six-part miniseries. Additionally, the French company Millesime co-produced the film in exchange for airing it on television in France. This decision further increased funding to £1,000,000. Mobil Oil Corporation, a major sponsor of Masterpiece Theatre, co-produced the film.|$|E

500|$|The Public Relations Society of America {{was formed}} in 1947 by {{combining}} the American Council on Public Relations and the National Association of Public Relations Councils. The society had its first annual conference in Philadelphia, where Richard Falk was given PRSA's first [...] "annual citation" [...] for advancing the field of public relations. Several ethical violations in the field led to discussions about ethics within the society. At the 1952 annual conference, a speaker used Adolf Hitler {{as an example of}} the potential abuse of communications. The society published its first code of conduct and its first Anvil awards two years later. The code of conduct was later ratified in 1959 and again in 1963. PRSA merged <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Public</b> Relations Association in 1961 and started its accreditation program for public relations professionals the next year.

500|$|Copland {{was one of}} ten {{internationally known}} composers who {{accepted}} invitations to contribute music for the opening. His {{would be the first}} new piece to be heard. Other compositions included the Eighth Symphony of American composer William Schuman, an Overture Philharmonique by French composer Darius Milhaud and [...] "Andromache's Farewell" [...] for soprano and orchestra by American composer Samuel Barber. It would also be Copland's first purely symphonic piece since his Third Symphony of 1947, although he had penned orchestral works in a number of genres throughout the 1940s and 50s. According to Taruskin, Copland's receipt of such a commission testified to both his status as a creative figure and his close relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public.</b> This position was unique among [...] "serious" [...] American composers and derived from the populist works he had written in the 1930s and 40s. However, from the 1950s Copland's public works—the ones for which he had developed his populist style—were increasingly written in what he called his [...] "difficult" [...] or [...] "private" [...] style. That style had become increasingly non-tonal.|$|E
500|$|Within {{weeks of}} the Chinese attack, MacArthur was forced to retreat from North Korea. Seoul fell in January 1951, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to {{contemplate}} the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely. European countries did not share MacArthur's world view, distrusted his judgment, and were afraid that he might use his stature and influence <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> to re-focus American policy away from Europe and towards Asia. They were concerned that this {{might lead to a}} major war with China, possibly involving nuclear weapons. Since in February 1950 the Soviet Union and China had signed a defensive alliance committing each to go to war if the other party was attacked, the possibility that an American attack on China would cause World War III was considered to be very real at the time. [...] In a visit to the United States in December 1950, the British prime minister, Clement Attlee, had raised the fears of the British and other European governments that [...] "General MacArthur was running the show." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Mikoyan {{eventually}} {{left for}} Washington, {{which was the}} first time a senior governing member of the USSR's Council of Ministers visited the United States on a diplomatic mission to its leadership. Furthermore, Mikoyan approached the mission with an unprecedented informality, beginning with phrasing his visa request to US Embassy as [...] "a fortnight's holiday" [...] to visit his friend, Mikhail Menshikov, the then Soviet Ambassador to the United States. While the White House was taken off guard by this seemingly impromptu diplomatic mission, Mikoyan was invited to speak to numerous elite American organizations such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the Detroit Club in which he professed his hopes for the USSR to have a more peaceful relationship with the US. In addition to such well received engagements, Mikoyan indulged in more informal opportunities to meet the public such as having breakfast at a Howard Johnson's restaurant on the New Jersey Turnpike, visiting Macy's Department Store in New York City and meeting celebrities in Hollywood like Jerry Lewis and Sophia Loren before having an audience with President Dwight Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. Although Mikoyan failed to alter the US's Berlin policy, he was hailed in the US for easing international tensions with an innovative emphasis on soft diplomacy that largely went over well <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public.</b>|$|E

500|$|By 1930, MacArthur was still, at age 50, the {{youngest}} of the U.S. Army's major generals, and the best known. He left the Philippines on 19 September 1930 and for a brief time was in command of the IX Corps Area in San Francisco. On 21 November, he was sworn in as Chief of Staff of the United States Army, with the rank of general. While in Washington, he would ride home each day to have lunch with his mother. At his desk, he would wear a Japanese ceremonial kimono, cool himself with an oriental fan, and smoke cigarettes in a jeweled cigarette holder. In the evenings, he liked to read military history books. About this time, he began referring to himself as [...] "MacArthur". He had already hired a public relations staff to promote his image <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public,</b> together with a set of ideas he was known to favor, namely: a belief that America needed a strongman leader to deal with the possibility that Communists might lead all of the great masses of unemployed into a revolution; that America's destiny was in the Asia-Pacific region; and a strong hostility to the British Empire. One contemporary described MacArthur as the greatest actor to ever serve as a U.S Army general while another wrote that MacArthur had a court rather than a staff.|$|E

In 2004, the Maker's Mark Secretariat Center, dedicated to reschooling former racehorses and matching them to new homes, opened at the Kentucky Horse Park. In 2010, Chenery developed the Secretariat Vox Populi ("voice of the people") Award, which is voted for by racing fans. It is intended to acknowledge [...] "the horse whose popularity and racing excellence best resounded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> and gained recognition for Thoroughbred racing."

40|$|From 1935 – when Italy invaded Ethiopia – until World War II, the Italian {{government}} sent {{across the}} Atlantic {{a series of}} exhibitions of contemporary art serving a diplomatic mission in offsetting Fascist Italy’s belligerent image in <b>American</b> <b>public</b> opinion. This article addresses the group show of twenty-nine young painters that in 1935 set the guidelines of subsequent Italian art policy in the United States. It follows the itinerary of the exhibition in some of its venues across the country, and assesses its multifaceted reception in a fluctuating intercultural terrain in which the cultural imperatives implicitly assigned to Italian painting – with their economic and ideological underpinnings – negotiated meaning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public’s</b> expectations, critical paradigms, political preconceptions, fascination or suspicion for Mussolini, and local community values. Ultimately, Italian propagandistic ambitions remained largely frustrated. Art itself – its aesthetic quality – remained invisible, obscured by the catchwords of both Italian and American critical discourses. Local critics proved uncomfortable at handling the work of artists outside the Parisian school; alternatively, Italian art was understood through <b>the</b> paradigm of <b>American</b> regionalism. Indeed, <b>the</b> Italian shows, engineered to disseminate the “Italianness” of contemporary Italian painting across America, prove {{an indicator of the}} state of <b>the</b> art of <b>American</b> criticism of <b>the</b> time, especially beyond the East Coast, and illuminate how the cultural Other was acknowledged in a period of increasing nationalist self-retrenchment in art and politics...|$|R
