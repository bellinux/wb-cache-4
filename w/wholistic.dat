25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{ineffectiveness}} of prisons at preventing crime, the high costs of maintaining them, and the detrimental socio-economic effects of mass incarceration, many nations (e.g. Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands) have been working towards policies of large-scale decarceration, addressing crime and violence with alternative strategies such as fines, community service, and restorative justice processes. In addition to moving towards a more <b>wholistic</b> style of punishment, Nordic Countries in particular are focusing their efforts on prevention. In Sweden local police now work with county government to target at-risk youths. Swedish children from dysfunctional homes are provided more education and after-school activities to try and keep them out of trouble. In addition, police in Nordic countries are less likely to arrest youth for minor violations of the law. If a teenager steals food from a grocery store, they are often given community service time.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wholistic</b> {{reference}} is {{reference to the}} whole—with respect to the context.

According to this principle every proposition of number theory, even an equational proposition such as 5 + 7 = 12, refers {{not only to the}} individual numbers that it happens to mention but to the whole universe of numbers. The relation verb ‘refers’ is being used in its broad sense (loosely “is about”) and not as a synonym for ‘names’ in the sense of “is a name of”.|$|E

50|$|The term {{universe}} of discourse generally refers to the collection of objects being discussed in a specific discourse. In model-theoretical semantics, a {{universe of}} discourse is the set of entities that a model is based on. The concept {{universe of discourse}} is generally attributed to Augustus De Morgan (1846) but the name {{was used for the}} first time in history by George Boole (1854) on page 42 of his Laws of Thought in a long and incisive passage well worth study. Boole's definition is quoted below. The concept, probably discovered independently by Boole in 1847, played a crucial role in his philosophy of logic especially in his stunning principle of <b>wholistic</b> reference.|$|E
5000|$|Gendlin {{gave the}} name [...] "felt sense" [...] to the unclear, pre-verbal sense of [...] "something"—the inner {{knowledge}} or awareness {{that has not}} been consciously thought or verbalized—as that [...] "something" [...] is experienced in the body. It {{is not the same as}} an emotion. This bodily felt [...] "something" [...] may be an awareness of a situation or an old hurt, or of something that is [...] "coming"—perhaps an idea or insight. Crucial to the concept, as defined by Gendlin, is that it is unclear and vague, and it is always more than any attempt to express it verbally. Gendlin also described it as [...] "sensing an implicit complexity, a <b>wholistic</b> sense of what one is working on".|$|E

50|$|His 1980 {{critical}} {{reconstruction of}} Boole’s original 1847 system revealed previously unnoticed gaps and errors in Boole’s work and established the essentially Aristotelian basis of Boole’s philosophy of logic. A 2003 article provides a systematic comparison and critical evaluation of Aristotelian logic and Boolean logic; it also reveals {{the centrality of}} <b>wholistic</b> reference in Boole's philosophy of logic. According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle’s logic. Boole did not dispute one point that Aristotle made, but he did “go under, over, and beyond” Aristotle’s logic by 1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations,2) extending the class of problems it could treat—to assessing validity he added solving equations--,and 3) expanding the range of applications it could handle—e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.|$|E

Heartland Center for <b>Wholistic</b> Health in Great Bend continues the tradition of health care as a founded ministry in Kansas.

50|$|George Boole (1815-1864) {{introduced}} this principle into modern logic: Even though he {{changed from a}} monistic fixed-universe framework in his 1840s writings to a pluralistic multiple-universe framework in 1854, he never wavered in his frank avowal {{of the principle of}} <b>wholistic</b> reference. Indeed, he took it as an essential accompaniment to his theory of concept formation and proposition formation. For Boole, the essential first step in the process of conceiving of a proposition preliminary to making a judgement of its truth or falsity - or even using it in a deduction, however hypothetically - was to conceive of the universe of discourse. See Boole 1854/2003, xxi, 27, 42, 43. One statement of his principle is in the sentence immediately following his definition of universe of discourse, which is his first use of the expression 'universe of discourse' and probably the first {{in the history of the}} English language. See the next section.|$|E
50|$|People {{are living}} longer and {{developing}} different needs, particularly those related to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and chronic conditions that require lifelong care, such as diabetes, hypertension, and cancer.

We introduced the Family Health Team (FHT) approach, based on the World Health Organization-indicated values of primary health care, in our primary health facilities (PHFs).The FHT offers comprehensive primary health care services based on <b>wholistic</b> care of the entire family, emphasizing long-term provider-patient relationships and ensuring person-centeredness, comprehensiveness, and continuity.
