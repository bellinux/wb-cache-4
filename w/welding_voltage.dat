Comparing signature images from moment to moment in a weld provides a useful estimate of how stable the welding process is.

50|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{high-power}} semiconductors such as the {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT), it is now possible to build a switched-mode power supply capable of coping with the high loads of arc welding. These designs are known as inverter welding units. They generally first rectify the utility AC power to DC; then they switch (invert) the DC power into a stepdown transformer to produce the desired <b>welding</b> <b>voltage</b> or current. The switching frequency is typically 10 kHz or higher. Although the high switching frequency requires sophisticated components and circuits, it drastically reduces the bulk of the step down transformer, as the mass of magnetic components (transformers and inductors) that is required for achieving a given power level goes down rapidly as the operating (switching) frequency is increased. The inverter circuitry can also provide features such as power control and overload protection. The high frequency inverter-based welding machines are typically more efficient and provide better control of variable functional parameters than non-inverter welding machines.|$|E

The size and shape of the particulates will determine their ability to infiltrate the human body. Hence, the sensitivity of particulate fume size to welding parameters such as arc voltage (20 – 36 V) and metal transfer mode (dip, globular and spray) was assessed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was used for determining particulate fume size and it was found to be an accurate, reproducible, and relatively simple technique. The results revealed a higher percentage of ultra fine particulates (i. e. in 3 ̆c 20 nm and 20 – 40 nm intervals) in ‘low welding voltage’ fume plume compared with ‘high welding voltage’ fume plume. Fundamentally, the fume plume created during dip metal transfer at low <b>welding</b> <b>voltages</b> (20 – 26 V) had much lower levels of particulate fume concentration compared with spray metal transfer at high <b>welding</b> <b>voltages</b> (30 - 36 V). TEM also revealed that for the range of <b>welding</b> <b>voltages</b> and metal transfer modes investigated, the particulates produced were predominantly less than 100 nm in diameter and spherical. Spherical particles (3 ̆c 100 nm) have been reported elsewhere to reach the alveoli in rats and, hence, may be of relevance with respect to the health of welders. Slightly faceted crystalline particulates and fume particle sizes of up to 800 nm in diameter were also observed with TEM. It should be noted that the agglomeration behaviour of these particulates in the fume plume is considered important but not entirely understood. The particle size results suggest that the key to welder safety is to minimize cumulative exposure to particulate fume over their working life, irrespective of the welding parameters used. Innovative fume extraction techniques, clean workshops, automated welding, and low welding fume consumables should all form part of an integrated solution to help ensure the health and well-being of welding personnel...|$|R
