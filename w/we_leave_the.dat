2500|$|When Cao Cao's forces {{arrived at}} Yi (易), Guo Jia said, [...] "A swift army is powerful. Now, as we've {{travelled}} a long distance, {{we have much}} heavy baggage so we cannot launch a swift attack. If the enemy learns of our approach, they will definitely prepare defences. Why don't <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> heavy baggage behind and send our light forces to take a shortcut and launch a surprise attack?" [...] Cao Cao led his army through a secret passage at Lulong Pass (盧龍塞) and headed directly towards the Wuhuan chieftains' headquarters. The Wuhuan were shocked when they heard of Cao Cao's approach and they hastily assembled their army, but were defeated by Cao Cao at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain. Tadun was killed in battle. The Yuan brothers fled to Liaodong to join the warlord Gongsun Kang, who captured and executed them and then sent their heads to Cao Cao.|$|E
2500|$|May's {{supporters}} {{included a}} number of Cabinet ministers, such as Amber Rudd, Chris Grayling, Justine Greening, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Fallon and Patrick McLoughlin. She won {{the first round of}} voting on 5 July, receiving support from 165 MPs, with rivals Andrea Leadsom receiving 66 votes and Michael Gove 48. After the results were announced, May said she was [...] "pleased" [...] and [...] "grateful" [...] for the support of other MPs and confirmed that she wanted to unite the party and the UK, to negotiate the [...] "best possible deal as <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> EU", and to [...] "make Britain work for everyone". The two candidates with the fewest votes, Liam Fox and Stephen Crabb, immediately announced their support for May. May came in first place in the second ballot on 7 July with an overwhelming majority of 199 MPs, compared with 84 for Leadsom and 46 for Gove, who was eliminated. Afterwards, May stated that she was delighted with her support among MPs, and she progressed to a vote of the Conservative Party membership against Leadsom.|$|E
