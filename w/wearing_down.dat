5|$|Australia dropped Bill Brown, who {{had scored}} 73 runs at a batting average of 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. Brown was Australia's reserve opener, but Bradman opted to play {{him out of}} {{position}} in the middle-order, instead of using a specialist. Brown had also struggled in his unfamiliar position in the matches against Worcestershire and the Marylebone Cricket Club, scoring 25 and 26. According to O'Reilly, Brown had appeared {{out of place in}} the middle-order because he was used to the opener's classical role of defending against and <b>wearing</b> <b>down</b> the opening bowlers, rather than attacking. He was replaced by the all rounder Sam Loxton, who had hammered an unbeaten 159—including several sixes—against Gloucestershire, and that innings was particularly noted for his quick footwork, which he used to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard.|$|E
5|$|Brown was rested for the {{following}} match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test. Loxton scored 159 not out, featuring in two century partnerships and propelling Australia to 7/774 declared, which was its highest score of the tour and {{laid the foundation for}} an innings victory. Loxton’s effort was enough to oust Brown from his middle-order position for the Third Test at Old Trafford. According to O’Reilly, Brown had appeared out of place in the middle-order because he was used to the opener’s classical role of defending against and <b>wearing</b> <b>down</b> the opening bowlers, rather than attacking. During the Test, which was drawn, Barnes was injured and off spinner Ian Johnson was used as a makeshift opener as Morris was the only specialist left after Brown’s omission. Afterwards, Brown managed only eight as Australia defeated Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Sensational Sherri stood at ringside as Shawn Michaels defended his Intercontinental Championship against Marty Jannetty. She {{did not reveal}} her {{allegiance}} to either man. Jannetty gained the early advantage, knocking Michaels {{out of the ring}} and diving onto him through the ropes. He then attacked Michaels by jumping off the top rope, but Michaels countering this move by hitting him on the way down. Michaels hit Jannetty's shoulder against the ring post and focused on <b>wearing</b> <b>down</b> the shoulder once both men had re-entered the ring. Michaels missed an attack from the top rope, which allowed Jannetty to punch him repeatedly. Michaels recovered and threw Jannetty out of the ring, but Jannetty then suplexed Michaels over the rope and onto the arena floor. Sherri turned on Michaels by slapping him in the face, and Jannetty threw Michaels back into the ring with a belly-to-back suplex. Jannetty performed a powerslam and a DDT on Michaels. Michaels attempted to punch Jannetty but knocked the referee unconscious instead. Sherri came into the ring and tried to hit Michaels with her shoe. Michaels moved out of the way, and Sherri hit Jannetty instead. When the referee recovered, Michaels performed a superkick on Jannetty and pinned him to retain the championship.|$|E

5|$|On 30 July, {{to protect}} Cobra's flank {{and prevent the}} {{disengagement}} and relocation of further German forces, the British VIII Corps and XXX Corps launched Operation Bluecoat south from Caumont toward Vire and Mont Pinçon. Bluecoat kept German armoured units fixed on the British eastern front and continued the <b>wearing</b> <b>down</b> {{of the strength of}} German armoured formations in the area. The breakthrough in the centre of the Allied front surprised the Germans, when they were distracted by the Allied attacks {{at both ends of the}} Normandy bridgehead. By the time of the American breakout at Avranches, there was little to no reserve strength left for Unternehmen Lüttich (Operation Liège), the German counter-offensive, which had been defeated by 12 August, leaving the 7th Army with no choice but to retire rapidly east of the Orne river, with a rearguard of the remaining armoured and motorised units, to allow time for the surviving infantry to reach the Seine. After the first stage of the withdrawal beyond the Orne, the manoeuvre collapsed for a lack of fuel, Allied air attacks and the constant pressure of the Allied armies, culminating in the encirclement of German forces in the Falaise pocket.|$|E

25|$|Bad weather {{operations}} completely overtaxed fighter {{units and}} inflicted high losses which caused {{a drop in}} morale and confidence in the High Command. The OKL itself {{did not understand the}} need for economical employment of strength with respect to the RLV. All raids had to be met at full strength, rapidly <b>wearing</b> <b>down</b> the defenders. Contributing to the <b>wearing</b> <b>down</b> of fighter units was the over-long use of the heavy fighter, the Bf 110 and Me 410, insisted by Hitler and Göring. Göring permitted no realistic reflection on the loss of air superiority, but squandered time and energy in the disparagement of the Jagdwaffe. Both Zerstörer types had to be withdrawn from daylight combat by the spring of 1944 due to losses. The USAAF's new commander of the Eighth Air Force, Major General Jimmy Doolittle, changed fighter tactics as 1944 began, devastated the Luftwaffes day fighter defences {{for the rest of the}} war over Germany and achieved near-complete air supremacy for the Allies by the time Operation Overlord was launched in early June 1944.|$|E

By the start of 1970, however, the Israeli Air Force had established complete aerial superiority over the front lines along the Suez Canal, and the launching of Operation Priha in January laid bare Egypt's inability to counter Israeli supremacy not only along the canal but in the Egyptian heartland as well.|$|E

25|$|The Bangladeshi wickets {{receive a}} lot of rain fall in little time which {{reflects}} the soggy nature. The conditions vary from grounds like Sher-e-Bangla Cricket Stadium and Chittagong Divisional Stadium. The basic idea of producing wickets in Bangladesh is to avoid using grassroots when they are building up the layers of soil. The roots hold the water and retain moisture for an extended period. It helps bind the wicket better, making it a harder surface eventually. It also slows the process of <b>wearing</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
25|$|In early 1863 there {{occurred}} extreme {{deficiencies in}} the ordnance stores. Paper fuses and friction primers were describes as useless, gunpowder of low quality, leather goods and wood in bad condition and the guns themselves <b>wearing</b> <b>down.</b> In consequence General Braxton Bragg appointed an artillery board in June; and Smith was part of it.

25|$|Eventually, Gen. Ma Anliang's passive defence, {{rather than}} chasing {{the far more}} agile rebel army, succeeded in <b>wearing</b> <b>down</b> Bai.

According to Gansu legend, Bai Lang died at Daliuzhuang, he was decapitated and his head put on display. However, official Chinese documents say he vanished in Shanxi and his body was never found. Yuan Shikai ordered Bai Lang's family tombs destroyed, and had the corpses cut to pieces. Bai's headless body was left to rot.|$|E

MiQuale Lewis had two one-yard touchdowns in the second half and finished with 165yards, one short of his career high. He also caught two passes for 51yards. For the third straight game, the Cardinals did not draw a penalty. Despite the victory, The Cardinals dropped three spots to #17in the BCS Poll, but stayed in the same spot in the Associated Press and USA Today coaches poll.|$|E
25|$|Protracted war {{and staying}} power. American airmobile tactics caused {{substantial}} casualties to the VC and NVA {{in thousands of}} such confrontations, but the communist strategy of attritional, protracted war, aided by plentiful manpower, was designed to absorb these losses, while <b>wearing</b> <b>down</b> their opponents over time. Successful air-mobile tactics also failed to address what happened after the mobile force and their helicopters departed. The population was often still left unsecured, subject once more to communist control, intimidation and infiltration. GVN/ARVN follow-up action might continue to be ineffective. Cross-border sanctuary routes were still open, and {{the bulk of the}} networks of tunnels, base camps and fortification honeycombing a region usually survived. Once their opponents had left, communist forces eventually regrouped, replaced their losses, and returned.|$|E

25|$|Next, Owen Hart and Yokozuna, {{accompanied}} by Jim Cornette and Mr. Fuji, defended their WWF Tag Team Championship against the Allied Powers (Lex Luger and The British Bulldog). The challengers got the advantage early on, with Luger <b>wearing</b> <b>down</b> Yokozuna by smashing Yokozuna's {{head into the}} top turnbuckle. Yokozuna accidentally fell onto Hart's foot, sparking a confrontation between the tag team partners. After a few minutes, the two settled their differences, the challengers retained the advantage {{for much of the}} match. The finish came after the Allied Powers double-teamed on Yokozuna. Following a back suplex, the referee ordered Bulldog, who wasn't the legal man, out of the ring. Hart hit the distracted Luger with a double axe handle from the top rope, allowing Yokozuna to pin Luger with a leg drop.|$|E
25|$|Early {{symptoms}} {{may include}} loss of precision muscle coordination (sometimes first manifested in declining penmanship, frequent small injuries to the hands, and dropped items), cramping pain with sustained use, and trembling. Significant muscle pain and cramping {{may result from}} very minor exertions like holding a book and turning pages. It may become {{difficult to find a}} comfortable position for arms and legs with even the minor exertions associated with holding arms crossed causing significant pain similar to restless leg syndrome. Affected persons may notice trembling in the diaphragm while breathing, or the need to place hands in pockets, under legs while sitting or under pillows while sleeping to keep them still and to reduce pain. Trembling in the jaw may be felt and heard while lying down, and the constant movement to avoid pain may result in the grinding and <b>wearing</b> <b>down</b> of teeth, or symptoms similar to temporomandibular joint disorder. The voice may crack frequently or become harsh, triggering frequent throat clearing. Swallowing can become difficult and accompanied by painful cramping.|$|E
25|$|In 1779 Johnstone was offered, and accepted, a post as {{commodore}} of the Lisbon Station , {{despite his}} previous {{attacks on the}} ministry, and his support for conciliation over military intervention. He justified himself with the argument that since France had entered the war on the American side, {{he could no longer}} support staying out of the war. He was promised an assignment on the Portuguese station, before which he cruised off the French coast in his flagship , looking for evidence of invasion preparations. It soon became known that the French and Spanish fleets intended to unite and form a large single fleet to invade England. Johnstone took Romney to join Admiral Sir Charles Hardy's Channel Fleet, and pressed him to seek battle. Hardy instead preferred to avoid action at first, <b>wearing</b> <b>down</b> the enemy fleet at sea while his own continued to refit and resupply from the naval bases along the English coast. Hardy's tactics were successful, and rather than confront a fresh and well-equipped British fleet, the enemy armada abandoned their plans and returned to French ports.|$|E
