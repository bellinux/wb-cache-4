50|$|In agriculture, <b>windrow</b> <b>composting</b> is the {{production}} of compost by piling organic matter or biodegradable waste, such as animal manure and crop residues, in long rows (windrows). This method is suited to producing large volumes of compost. These rows are generally turned to improve porosity and oxygen content, mix in or remove moisture, and redistribute cooler and hotter portions of the pile. <b>Windrow</b> <b>composting</b> is a commonly used farm scale composting method. Composting process control parameters include the initial ratios of carbon and nitrogen rich materials, the amount of bulking agent added to assure air porosity, the pile size, moisture content, and turning frequency.|$|E

Data averaged over seven growing seasons indicated that population levels of root-lesion nematodes (primarily Pratylenchus penetrans) were higher in root-zone soil in potato plots treated with either compost or manure compared to the untreated control plots. The soil amendments did not affect root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne hapla) population densities in the potato plots, but clover-cyst nematodes (Heterodera trifolii) were more numerous in the root-zone soils of barley treated with compost compared to the untreated plots. Numbers of bacterial-feeding nematodes (primarily Diplogaster lheritieri) were greater in soil in potato plots treated with manure and in soil around barley roots than in untreated plots. Total yields of potato tubers averaged over seven growing seasons increased by 27 % in the plots treated with either compost or manure. Grain yields of barley also were increased by 12 % when compost was applied.

However, over the past 30 years, pathogenic E. coli {{have been responsible for}} several outbreaks of foodborne illness linked to contaminated produce. The introduction of Escherichia coli to an agricultural soil, via contaminated water, compost, or raw manure, exposes the bacterium to a medley of ecological forces not found in a mammalian gut environment. This study assesses a variety of abiotic and biotic soil factors that influence the ability of an 2 ̆ 2 invasive 2 ̆ 2 copiotrophic coliform bacterium to survive in compost-amended agricultural soil. The study included both field and laboratory components. In the lab experiment, a cocktail of rifampicin-resistant generic E. coli strains was added to sterile and non-sterile extracts of eight different composts and one soil sample from the field sites. E. coli abundance was monitored over a one-week period and composts were analyzed for their nutrient profile. In the field experiment, the same E. coli cocktail was sprayed on plots with the following treatments: 1) dairy <b>windrow</b> <b>compost,</b> 2) dairy vermicompost, 3) poultry <b>windrow</b> <b>compost,</b> or 4) no compost. E. coli abundance, soil water potential, soil temperature, extracellular enzyme activity, microbial respiration, phospholipid fatty acid biomarker abundance, and genetic sequencing of the microbial community were measured over a six-month field season. The lab experiment showed that E. coli were able to grow well in sterile compost extracts, without microbial competition for nutrients. Conversely, E. coli populations were only able to survive in non-sterile soil extracts. These results suggest that copiotrophic organisms adapted for high-nutrient environments may depend on the extracellular enzyme activity of native oligotrophic organisms to acquire sufficient nutrients to survive in soils. Results of the field experiment showed clear and interdependent effects of soil moisture and nutrient availability on microbial community dynamics and E. coli survival. Data suggest that saturated soils cause a decrease in microbial extracellular enzyme activity, and drying-rewetting cycles can cause respiration bursts, nutrient mineralization, and shifts in community composition. The saturation of soils, which mobilizes nutrients and may result in a decrease in competition from aerobic organisms, correlated directly with increased survival of E. coli. Additionally, amendment with ammonium-rich poultry compost resulted in the maintenance of high levels of E. coli throughout the field season. Despite an increase in microbial biomass from dairy vermicompost amendment, poultry compost was the only compost that had a significant effect on E. coli survival. The results suggest that nitrogen availability and water potential are strong drivers of E. coli 2 ̆ 7 s survival in soils. Correlations among abiotic factors, community composition, and E. coli survival reveal insights into the complex relationships that occur in disturbed agricultural soil environments. Further research on E. coli 2 ̆ 7 s response to targeted organisms, abiotic soil properties, and nutrient inputs could have implications for agricultural considerations in food safety and microbial ecology...|$|R

Nitrate-N concentrations from runoff ranged from 0. 1 to 6. 7 mg/L. Phosphorus concentrations were consistently higher in the leachate than in the runoff.

30|$|In {{light of}} all the above, this study was {{initiated}} by establishing a total of seven pilot scale indoor and outdoor static <b>composting</b> <b>windrows</b> that consisted of three agro-industrial waste streams, namely olive cake (the solid by-product of olive processing), grain dust, and coffee-barley, or mixtures thereof.

Composting kinetics modeling is necessary to design and operate composting facilities that comply with strict market demands and stringent environmental regulations (Hamelers 2004). This can be achieved once the composting kinetics is well understood. (Hamoda et al. 1998). Proper modeling of the progress of substrate degradation is of great importance in the prediction of operating variable of the composting process. One of the most commonly used approaches in modeling the composting kinetics is the substrate degradation models, where the independent variable is either the quantity or concentration of the substrate remaining. In the present study, remaining amount of the substrate was selected as indicator to model the composting kinetics and to find out which reaction order the composting kinetics follow.|$|R

40|$|<b>Windrow</b> <b>composting</b> of {{livestock}} manure materials provides {{a strategy for}} converting organic wastes into a recyclable soil fertility product that is less hazardous to the environment. Although outdoor <b>windrow</b> <b>composting</b> can produce runoff that is detrimental to surface water quality, vegetative filter strip (VFS) buffers were reported to significantly reduce runoff and contaminants from a <b>windrow</b> <b>composting</b> research site. To estimate the efficacy of VFS buffers and other best management practices on runoff from future <b>windrow</b> <b>composting</b> facilities, a computer hydrologic model may provide a valuable tool for predicting runoff losses from these proposed sites. This research evaluated a windrow composting/vegetative filter strip buffer (WCVFS) hydrologic model for estimating runoff volume losses from a livestock manure-based <b>windrow</b> <b>composting</b> site with a fly ash composting pad surface and VFS buffers. Runoff and physical attribute data from six rainfall events during 2002 to 2004 at a central Iowa <b>windrow</b> <b>composting</b> research site {{were used in the}} WCVFS model evaluation. Three rainfall events were designated as “wet” composting period events (2002 and 2003 seasons), and three were designated as “dry” composting period events (2004 season). Runoff data were comprised of average observed runoff volumes from three compost windrow area:VFS buffer area ratio treatments that included 1 : 1, 1 : 0. 5 (large and small VFS buffer areas, respectively), and a 1 : 0 (no buffer) control. The WCVFS model performance was good to very good for the 2003 wet composting period model validation rainfall event with no significant differences among 1 : 1, 1 : 0. 5, and 1 : 0 ratio treatments for simulated versus observed runoff volumes. In contrast, WCVFS model performance was unsatisfactory for the 2004 dry composting period validation event with significantly higher simulated runoff volume from the 1 : 0. 5 ratio treatment versus observed runoff volumes. There were no significant differences for the 1 : 1 and 1 : 0 treatments. The WCVFS model effectively estimated 1 : 1, 1 : 0. 5, and 1 : 0 treatment runoff volumes from the earlier wet composting period and 1 : 1 and 1 : 0 treatment runoff volumes from the later dry composting period rainfall events. However, the soils data-derived VFS buffer runoff and infiltration functions in the WCVFS model flow routing component may not have sufficiently accounted for some short-term hydrologic changes in VFS buffer soil and fly ash pad surfaces. This could have resulted in overestimation of dry composting period simulated runoff volume from the smaller 1 : 0. 5 ratio VFS buffer area treatment. Consequently, the use of other alternatives to soils data-derived VFS buffer runoff and infiltration functions should be evaluated in future WCVFS model simulation trials to potentially improve runoff volume prediction accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Compost {{maturity}} is {{an important}} determinant of end use for composted municipal yard debris, and generally refers to the effect the compost has on plants. The rate of microbial respiration is an indicator of compost stability. The objectives of this research were to: i) determine whether continuous aeration resulted in more rapid maturity of composted yard debris than windrow turning; ii) determine which maturity indicators distinguish between mature and immature compost; iii) measure rates of CO₂ evolution during active composting and curing; iv) adapt the CO₂ detection tube technique for compost; and v) evaluate rapid compost stability tests (Solvita test, self-heating test and CO₂ detection tubes) for potential use by commercial composters. Land Recovery, Inc. of Puyallup, WA, composted yard debris under careful process control. Two compost piles were studied for 113 d; one was subjected to continuous forced aeration and periodic turning. The other was managed as a turned windrow. We found that forced aeration resulted in mature compost about 20 days before <b>windrowing.</b> <b>Compost</b> pH, C content and respiration rate were all useful indicators of compost maturity. Carbon fell from 400 k kg⁻¹ to 250 g kg⁻¹ and pH rose from 5 to 7. The CO₂ evolution rate fell from 16 to 2 mg CO₂-C g C⁻¹ d⁻¹. Maturity correlated somewhat with compost odor. Neither percent germination nor an odor/color scale were reliable indicators of maturity for theses composts. All the rapid tests were correlated with alkaline trapping of microbially respired CO₂. The Solvita test took 4 h to administer; values (1 to 8 Solvita scale) were 2 to 4 during active composting, 3 to 6 during early curing and 6 to 7 during late curing.

Current bioaerosol monitoring techniques provide only a snapshot of bioaerosol concentrations spatially and temporally, whereas dispersion models have the potential to offer a more continual overview of bioaerosol levels, alongside existing sampling methods. However, dispersion models have not been successful at accurately predicting bioaerosol concentrations from open <b>windrow</b> <b>composting</b> facilities, generally under predicting concentrations by at least one order of magnitude. This is predominantly {{due to a lack of}} knowledge and data surrounding the complex nature of bioaerosol release and transportation, particularly when the compost is agitated. This study aimed to improve the reliability in the outputs of the ADMS dispersion model, specifically in the open <b>windrow</b> <b>composting</b> scenario, by performing several model tests alongside selected input parameter quantification improvements. This involved completing a sensitivity analysis, and a model calibration and validation specific to this scenario for the first time. Results from the sensitivity analysis showed that the use of wet and dry deposition modules is significant, and the majority of model inputs associated with the representation of the source of the emission are sensitive. These findings helped select the model input parameters for quantification improvements. Novel preliminary measurements of bioaerosol temperature, velocity and concentration at the source of composting agitation activities were completed. These values provided more accurate model inputs. Collectively, these results allowed the model to be successfully calibrated, and consequently, validated for the first time for this specific scenario, resulting in model outputs corresponding to within one order of magnitude to measured data. This has helped to generate an initial set of modelling recommendations, allowing modellers to use the ADMS dispersion model in a reliable manner, when applied to the open <b>windrow</b> <b>composting</b> scenario. Eventually, these improved model outputs may be used to predict bioaerosol exposure levels at sensitive receptors, particularly in conditions where current monitoring methods are not feasible...|$|E

They have a steel drum with paddles that are rapidly turning.
