500|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Trent Reznor expressed his intentions to write {{material for a}} new release while on tour promoting With Teeth. He reportedly began work on the new album by September 2006. Reznor devised much of the album's musical direction on his laptop. Reznor told Kerrang! in a later interview, [...] "When I was on the [...] tour, to keep myself busy I just really hunkered down and was working on music the whole time, so this kept me in a creative mode and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> the tour I felt like I wasn't tired and wanted to keep at it." ...|$|E
500|$|Cudi also {{incorporated}} {{quotes from}} his favorite movies into the album, wherever he saw fit. The first release with a movie quote was [...] "Immortal", where Cudi sampled Adam Sandler in his 1995 film Billy Madison: [...] "That’s {{one of my}} favorite movies, man. From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how I felt <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So {{there had to be a}} way that I could express myself. So I had to find some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies. I put on Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{stated that}} she had Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince [...] "planned for years", but she spent two months going over her plan before she began writing seriously. This was a lesson learned after she did not check the plan for Goblet of Fire and had to rewrite {{a third of the}} book. She started writing the book before her second child, David, was born, but she took a break to care for him. The first chapter, [...] "The Other Minister", which {{features}} the meeting between the Muggle Prime Minister, the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, and his successor, Rufus Scrimgeour, was a concept Rowling tried to start in Philosopher's Stone, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Order of the Phoenix, but she found [...] "it finally works" [...] in Half-Blood Prince. She stated that she was [...] "seriously upset" [...] writing the end of the book, although Goblet of Fire was the hardest to write. When asked if she liked the book, she responded, [...] "I like it better than I liked 'Goblet', 'Phoenix' or 'Chamber' <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> them. Book six does what I wanted it to do and even if nobody else likes it (and some won't), I know it will remain one of my favourites of the series. Ultimately you have to please yourself before you please anyone else!" ...|$|E

500|$|Day of the Tentacle was a {{moderate}} commercial success; according to Schafer, it sold around 80,000 copies upon release. The game was critically acclaimed. Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World wrote in September 1993, [...] "Calling Day of the Tentacle {{a sequel to}} Maniac Mansion [...] {{is a little like}} calling the space shuttle a sequel to the slingshot". He enjoyed the game's humor and interface, and praised the designers for removing [...] "dead end" [...] scenarios and player character death. Ardai lauded the voice acting, writing that it [...] "would have done the late Mel Blanc proud", and compared the game's humor, animation, and camera angles to [...] "Looney Toons [...] gems from the 40's and 50's". He concluded, [...] "I expect that this game will keep entertaining people for quite some time to come". In April 1994 the magazine said of the CD version that Sanders's Bernard was among [...] "many other inspired performances", concluding that [...] "Chuck Jones would be proud". Sandy Petersen of Dragon stated that its graphics [...] "are in a stupendous cartoony style", while praising its humor and describing its sound and music as [...] "excellent". Although the reviewer considered it [...] "one of the best" [...] graphic adventure games, he noted that, like LucasArts' earlier Loom, it was extremely short; he wrote that he [...] "felt cheated somehow <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> the game". He ended the review, [...] "Go, Lucasfilm! Do this again, but do make the next game longer!".|$|E
500|$|When Swift {{was first}} signed to Big Machine Records, {{it was a}} new and {{extremely}} small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an [...] "uphill climb" [...] and said, [...] "There was this moment where I sat there and was like, ‘When {{are we going to get}} a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" [...] After reassuring to herself that it would be different in the future, she wrote the beginning of [...] "Change". She let the track sit for a while, waiting for a remarkable event to trigger its completion. She then completed the track the day after she won the Horizon Award at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards and saw Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine Records, crying. [...] "That’s <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> , because I knew I couldn’t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion of all the people who worked so hard for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|So I {{sat down}} and did a huge list of {{everything}} I had read ... and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> the list I handed it to them [...] They said that's impossible, you couldn't read that many books in a year, two years, and I had read all of those books in {{two and a half}} weeks - and well, that's The Secret.|$|E

2500|$|Francis Ford Coppola {{was drawn}} to S. E. Hinton's novel Rumble Fish because of the strong {{personal}} identification he had with the subject matter— a younger brother who hero-worships an older, intellectually superior brother, which mirrored the relationship between Coppola and his brother, August. A dedication to August appears as the film's final end credit. The director said that he [...] "started to use Rumble Fish as my carrot for what I promised myself <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> The Outsiders". Halfway through the production of The Outsiders, Coppola decided {{that he wanted to}} retain the same production team, stay in Tulsa, and shoot Rumble Fish right after The Outsiders. He wrote the screenplay for Rumble Fish with Hinton on Sundays, their day off from shooting The Outsiders. During rehearsals, Dillon got used to the adult-like acting behavior and situations after having been in The Outsiders. Dillon and Rourke developed a friendship when filming, getting used to their interesting, mischievous characters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{completion}} of the screenplay, concerned Sparks that Cyrus {{would not be able}} to successfully execute the role: [...] "The first thing I thought <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> the screenplay was, wow, I hope she can do this, this is a tough role because I'm bringing you through a whole gamut of emotion and you're just a 16-year-old girl who's done the Disney Channel. Are you able to do this as an actress?", After visiting the set and watching Cyrus film, Sparks' worries abated. To play the New York teen, Cyrus worked with a dialect coach to lose her Southern accent and learned to play classical piano. After she completed filming, Cyrus said that in a case of life imitating art, she had matured and [...] "changed a lot" [...] over the course of her summer in Georgia, similar to the way Ronnie does in the film. [...] "Showing this movie, I feel like I'm really showing a part of my growth as a person as well. So I'm really excited for people to see it." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{living in}} Queens, New York, Jennifer Lee Quick began drawing up ideas for Off Beat. A BFA in animation, she {{approached}} Tokyopop {{when the company}} was doing portfolio reviews for students and graduates at the School of Visual Arts. Originally, she had intended for the manga to be a joint project with her best friend, Becky Cloonan, but Quick was forced to fly solo due to conflicts with Cloonan's schedule."They liked what they saw, {{and asked me to}} send them a pitch sometime. At the time, I was working on Once in a Blue Moon so I didn't have time to send a pitch. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> that project, my long time best friend, Becky Cloonan was contacted by Tokyopop to send a pitch proposal. I remembered that I had been asked to send one as well, so we briefly considered sending a joint proposal for Off Beat (at the time she had talked about possibly working on the project with me). Her schedule got booked though, so I wasn't sure about submitting the pitch on my own. She encouraged me to go ahead though, so I went for it." ...|$|E

60|$|I was {{not mistaken}} in my {{anticipation}} of Sylvia's sympathy. She listened with sparkling eyes, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finished,</b> {{clapped her hands}} with delight.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> {{speaking}} {{she gently}} withdrew her hands from mine {{and turned away}} amongst the trees, doubtless to fly from me, trembling at my words, like a frightened young fawn from the hunter.|$|E
60|$|The ring lay on {{the table}} between us. Colonel Ray had not yet taken it up. In grim silence he listened to my faltering words. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> he smiled upon me as one might upon a child that needed humouring.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 February 2009, {{during a}} radio interview, Benaud {{announced}} that he would be retiring from television commentary. Benaud said: [...] "I'll be doing Australian cricket next year—2010—but I don't do any television at all anywhere else now and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finish</b> next year, then I'll be doing other things...

60|$|I {{was never}} {{interested}} enough in cocktails {{to know how}} they were made. So I got a bar-keeper in Oakland to make them in bulk and ship them to me. When I had no guests I didn't drink. But I began to notice, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> my morning's work, that I was glad if there were a guest, for then I could drink a cocktail with him.|$|E
60|$|Yesterday I burnt, in {{the field}} at Gad's Hill, the {{accumulated}} letters and papers of twenty years.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Craig McLean of The Independent, McAloon observed that the prime mover behind the album was his long-term manager, Keith Armstrong. McAloon stated that [...] "Keith {{was trying to help}} me, to make some money. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>finish</b> something <b>I</b> listen to it intensively for a short period, then never look at it again. And I'm not really that interested. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard this I thought, 'Oh boy, this is good.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|In December 2012, he {{explained}} that he was halfway done recording the album, saying: [...] "It's coming baby, first quarter. Anywhere, February, March, April...

6000|$|He smiled. [...] "That's because I {{was born}} a naturalist and a sportsman.
