However, willie wagtail rapidly became widely accepted sometime after 1916. Wagtail is derived from its active behaviour, while the origins of willie are obscure.

5|$|The russet sparrow's {{breeding}} season is short, lasting about three months. The Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus {{has been recorded}} breeding from April to August, the nominate subspecies breeds from May to July, and the subspecies intensior is believed to breed in March. During its {{breeding season}}, the russet sparrow is not gregarious, and its nests are dispersed uniformly rather than clustered. Its nests are most frequently built in tree cavities, often disused woodpecker nests. The russet sparrow has been recorded breeding alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow and <b>white</b> <b>wagtail</b> in black kite nests, {{taking advantage of the}} territorial defence of the kites to avoid nest predation. Other nest locations include the eaves of thatched roofs, stone walls and embankments, and electric junction boxes. In Bhutan, it nests in holes in the outer walls of monasteries, often alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow. In Sakhalin, it will sometimes build free-standing nests in bushes. The russet sparrow also uses the disused nests of the red-rumped swallow, and a pair of russet sparrows has been recorded attempting to oust a pair of black-crested tits from their nest.|$|E

25|$|Though it {{is known}} to be a host species for the common cuckoo, the <b>white</b> <b>wagtail</b> {{typically}} deserts its nest if it has been parasitised.

25|$|The <b>white</b> <b>wagtail</b> is an insectivorous bird of open country, often near {{habitation}} and water. It prefers bare {{areas for}} feeding, {{where it can}} see and pursue its prey. In urban areas it has adapted to foraging on paved areas such as car parks. It nests in crevices in stone walls and similar natural and man-made structures.|$|E
25|$|<b>White</b> <b>wagtail</b> is {{resident}} in the milder parts of its range such as western Europe and the Mediterranean, but migratory {{in much of}} the rest of its range. Northern European breeders winter around the Mediterranean and in tropical and subtropical Africa, and Asiatic birds move to the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia. Birds from the North American population also winter in tropical Asia.|$|E
50|$|The white-browed wagtail is {{the largest}} species of wagtail at 21 cm length. It is a slender bird, with the {{characteristic}} long, constantly wagging tail of its genus.

25|$|The <b>white</b> <b>wagtail</b> (Motacilla alba) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the wagtail family Motacillidae, {{which also}} includes the pipits and longclaws. This species breeds in much of Europe and Asia and parts of north Africa. It is resident in the mildest parts of its range, but otherwise migrates to Africa. It has a toehold in Alaska as a scarce breeder. In Ireland and Great Britain the darker sub-species the pied wagtail (M. a. yarrellii) predominates.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{composition}} of the diet of white wagtails varies by location, but terrestrial and aquatic insects and other small invertebrates form the {{major part of the}} diet. These range from beetles, dragonflies, small snails, spiders, worms, crustaceans, to maggots found in carcasses and, most importantly, flies in the order Diptera. Small fish fry have also been recorded in the diet. The <b>white</b> <b>wagtail</b> is somewhat unusual in the parts of its range where it is non-migratory as it is an insectivorous bird that continues to feed on insects during the winter (most other insectivorous birds in temperate climates migrate or switch to more vegetable matter).|$|E
25|$|Within the wagtail genus Motacilla, {{the white}} wagtail's closest {{relatives}} {{appear to be}} other black-and-white wagtails such as the Japanese wagtail, Motacilla grandis, and the white-browed wagtail, Motacilla madaraspatensis (and possibly the Mekong wagtail, Motacilla samveasnae, the phylogenetic position of which is mysterious), with which it appears to form a superspecies. However, mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data suggests that the <b>white</b> <b>wagtail</b> is itself polyphyletic or paraphyletic (i.e. the species is not itself a single coherent grouping). Other phylogenetic studies using mtDNA still {{suggest that there is}} considerable gene flow within the races and the resulting closeness makes Motacilla alba a single species. Some studies have suggested the existence of only two groups : the alboides group, with M. a. alboides, M. a. leucopsis and M. a. personata; and the alba group, with M. a. alba, M. a. yarrellii, M. a. baicalensis, M. a. ocularis, M. a. lugens, and M. a. subpersonata.|$|E

50|$|Ward and Zahavi cited {{a variety}} of species that {{demonstrate}} behaviors supporting the ICH but no species exhibited all of the behaviors. Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) exhibit synchronized breeding patterns, as well as have displays to attract birds to join the same nesting site.

40|$|Young {{individuals}} of many passerines undergo a partial moult and replace {{most of their}} body feathers and a variable number of coverts and minor wing feathers. In many species, this moult generates perceptible coloration differences, which may act as status signals. This study analyses how the extent of partial moult is related to different estimators of condition. A total of 43 young <b>White</b> <b>Wagtails</b> Motacilla alba caught in an urban roost {{in the city of}} Seville were analysed. The extent of their partial moult was positively correlated to the heterophil-lymphocyte ratio, but not to the abundance of leukocytes or to body mass. Individuals with more adult-like plumage may be exposed to higher stress due to the aggressiveness of territorial adults. Consequently, the increased heterophil-lymphocyte ratio found in the study is probably a consequence of the extent of moult rather than an explanation of intraspecific variation in the extent of moult.

500|$|The russet sparrow's vocalisations are {{described}} by most sources as [...] "the sweetest and most musical" [...] of any sparrow. Its basic call is a cheep or chilp, {{similar to that}} of other sparrows. This call is monosyllabic, unlike the house sparrow's chirrup call, and is softer than that of the other sparrows. This call is given as a flight call, or by displaying males. Recorded variations include a chweep given by males at the nest and a trilled cheeep. Sometimes the male strings calls together and sings them in a strident tone, to create a sort of short song, transcribed as cheep chirrup cheeweep or chreet-chreet-chreet. The song is interspersed with sibilant chu-swik notes {{similar to those of the}} <b>white</b> <b>wagtail.</b> A thin swee swee vocalisation not unlike that of an Indian robin has been reported, but the context of this call is unrecorded.

European greenfinches, linnets, whitethroats, common chaffinches and willow warblers all nest in the gorse bushes that flank the sheep pastures, along with European stonechat and the whinchat. Barn swallows, house martins and common swifts nest in the farm buildings, alongside house sparrows and <b>white</b> <b>wagtails,</b> while the woodlands are the haunt of the Eurasian nuthatch, common treecreeper, great spotted woodpecker and European green woodpecker. common wood pigeons, stock doves and Eurasian collared doves also breed in the woods, along with the Eurasian woodcock.

50|$|The {{white stork}} breeds in open {{farmland}} areas {{with access to}} marshy wetlands, building a large stick nest in trees, on buildings, or on purpose-built man-made platforms. Each nest is 1 - 2 m in depth, 0.8 - 1.5 m in diameter, and 60 - 250 kg in weight. Nests are built in loose colonies. Not persecuted as it {{is viewed as a}} good omen, it often nests close to human habitation; in southern Europe, nests can be seen on churches and other buildings. The nest is typically used year after year especially by older males. The males arrive earlier in the season and choose the nests. Larger nests are associated with greater numbers of young successfully fledged, and appear to be sought after. Nest change is often related to a change in the pairing and failure to raise young the previous year, and younger birds are more likely to change nesting sites. Although a pair may be found to occupy a nest, partners may change several times during the early stages and breeding activities begin only after a stable pairing is achieved.Several bird species often nest within the large nests of the white stork. Regular occupants are house sparrows, tree sparrows, and common starlings; less common residents include Eurasian kestrels, little owls, European rollers, <b>white</b> <b>wagtails,</b> black redstarts, Eurasian jackdaws, and Spanish sparrows. Paired birds greet by engaging in up-down and head-shaking crouch displays, and clattering the beak while throwing back the head. Pairs copulate frequently throughout the month before eggs are laid. High-frequency pair copulation is usually associated with sperm competition and high frequency of extra-pair copulation; however, extra-pair copulation is infrequent in white storks.|$|R
40|$|The {{breeding}} {{ecology of}} <b>White</b> and Japanese <b>Wagtails,</b> Motacilla alba and M. grandis, was studied along a river in central Japan. The home ranges {{of the two}} species greatly overlapped along the river, but no interbreeding occurred. M. grandis spent {{more time on the}} river than M. alba and defended territories there. M. alba used the river as part of the entire home range, and did not defend the river areas as territories. Singing activity and breeding started earlier in M. grandis than in M. alba. The early breeding of M. grandis was related to the lack of moulting in spring, less necessity for pair formation due to the existence of pairs in the winter, and the greater dependency on larval than on adult insects. Songs were very different between the two species. The bowing display that preceded the pre-copulation display was found only in M. alba. During the pre-copulation display, male M. grandis lifted both wings above the horizontal while male M. alba drooped both wings. The pre-copulation display of M. grandis was similar to that of Large Pied Wagtails M. maderaspatensis in India, suggesting a closer relationship of the two species than to M. alba. The Japanese Wagtail Motacilla grandis is endemic to Japan and is thought to have differentiated in geologically recent times from the continental White Wagtai...|$|R
