50|$|Variations have {{included}} multiple batteries and motors but regulations {{were put in}} place in the late 1980s by the FAI to limit the <b>winch</b> <b>power</b> used in FAI class competitions.|$|R
50|$|Drills {{are often}} used simply as motors to drive a variety of applications, {{in much the same}} way that {{tractors}} with generic PTOs are used to <b>power</b> <b>ploughs,</b> mowers, trailers, etc.|$|R
50|$|Lever winches are winches {{that use}} {{self-gripping}} jaws instead of spools to move rope or wire through the <b>winch.</b> <b>Powered</b> by moving a handle back and forth, they allow {{one person to}} move objects several tons in weight. Brand names include Tirfor™ and Griphoist™.|$|R

5000|$|The LTA Windpower PowerShip uses lift {{from both}} an {{aerostat}} and wings. It operates close to neutral buoyancy and doesn't require a <b>winch.</b> <b>Power</b> {{is generated by}} turbines with the propellers on {{the trailing edge of}} the wings. The system is designed {{to be able to take}} off and land unattended.|$|R
50|$|The {{catapult}} {{approach is}} also used for towing gliders into the air. This can be accomplished using an elastic bungee cord arrangement, or more commonly using a cable wound onto a <b>winch,</b> <b>powered</b> by a large diesel engine. The bungee approach is rarely used for man-carrying gliders, as the acceleration is uncontrolled and can yield very high G-forces. It is commonly used to launch model gliders however. Manned gliders are commonly launched simply by towing them aloft behind a powered aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|Since {{its latest}} renovation, the {{funicular}} uses angled lift technology with electrical traction {{and is no}} longer a funicular in the proper sense: it no longer functions with the traditional alternative movement of funiculars (where the descending cabin acts as a counterweight to the ascending one). The machinery resides in the higher station; it is composed of two totally independent AKROS <b>winches</b> <b>powered</b> by [...] motors. The cabins each weigh [...] unladen, [...] when full. They have a service brake and an emergency brake. The carriages and chassis were made by Skirail, and the electrics by Poma.|$|R
50|$|India's {{agricultural}} sector today still faces issues of efficiency due lack of mechanization with poorer conditions of farmers, {{as well as}} small farm sizes. In India traditional agriculture is still dominant as many farmers depend on livestock in crop production, for manure as fertilizers, and the use animal <b>powered</b> <b>ploughs.</b> According to 2011 statistics, the average farm in India is about 1.5 acres, minuscule when compared the average of 50 hectares in France and or 178 hectares in United States and 273 hectares in Canada.|$|R
40|$|Tuna and {{tuna-like fishes}} are under-exploited {{resources}} of Indian EEZ. Exploitation of oceanic tuna and billfishes are possible only by longlining and purse seining. Existing {{deep sea fishing}} vessels in India are mostly trawlers equipped for bottom trawling for shrimps and fishes. Most of them are stem trawlers and few are double riggers. Hence the deck layout is not suitable for either longlining or purse seining. Both longlining and purse seining for oceanic tuna and billfishes are specialized techniques which require special onboard facilities, deck layout and deck machineries like line haulers, chute, shooting and hauling accessories for longlining and special powerful purse <b>winch,</b> <b>power</b> block etc. for tuna piu'se seining...|$|R
5000|$|Chain-boat {{navigation}} [...] or chain-ship navigation is {{a little-known}} {{chapter in the}} history of shipping on European rivers. From around the middle of the 19th century, vessels called chain boats were used to haul strings of barges upstream by using a fixed chain lying on the bed of a river. The chain was raised from the riverbed to pass over the deck of the steamer, being hauled by a heavy <b>winch</b> <b>powered</b> by a steam engine. A variety of companies operated chain boat services on rivers such as the Elbe, Rhine, Neckar, Main, Saale, Havel, Spree and Saône as well as other rivers in Belgium and the Netherlands. Chain boats were also used in the United States.|$|R
50|$|On {{arrival of}} the train {{at one of the}} {{approximately}} 60 different dumping grounds, a three-ton steel plow was put on the last car (or a car carrying the plow was attached as the last car) and a huge winch with a braided steel cable stretching the length of all cars was attached to the engine. The <b>winch,</b> <b>powered</b> by the train’s steam engine, pulled the plow the length of the dirt loaded train by winching up the steel cable. The plow scraped the dirt off the railroad cars, allowing the entire trainload of dirt cars to be unloaded in ten minutes or less. The plow and winch were then detached for use on another train. Another plow, mounted on a steam engine, then plowed the dirt spoils away from the track.|$|R
5000|$|The vast {{interior}} of Poland was salt-starved, its maritime districts lying under rainy skies and fronting the Baltic Sea. By medieval times {{the process of}} mining for fossil salt supplemented the age-old techniques of evaporating sea salt in tidal pans. By the 14th century, at Wieliczka near Kraków, Braudel reports that peasant extraction of salt from brine evaporated in large shallow iron pans had been eliminated by the early industrialisation of salt mining. [...] "Galleries and shafts were now dug {{to a depth of}} 300 metres, and enormous <b>winches</b> <b>powered</b> by teams of horses brought blocks of salt to the surface. At its peak, production stood at 40,000 tons a year and the mines employed 3,000 workers. By 1368, the cooperation of the Polish state had been obtained." ...|$|R
50|$|Before {{committing}} {{to a new}} tug design, Navy Region Northwest upgraded two of the older s, Menominee (YT-807) and Washtucna (YTB-826), with improved power systems and z-drive propulsion units. Experience with these and two other YTBs with improved <b>winch</b> and <b>power</b> equipment lead to the decision to build new tugs.|$|R
50|$|The mast {{is made of}} glued clean wood, conical, without stays or shrouds. Boom, pole, gaff, {{spreaders}} {{and such}} are completely omitted. The mast is supported by two ball bearings, one at the keel and one at the deck hole, and can thus rotate freely. The rotation is created using a wooden collar, with a V-shaped track, around the mast below deck. Around this collar an infinite rope sling runs through two blocks to a <b>winch,</b> <b>powered</b> by hand or an electric motor. In this way the sail is rolled onto the mast when less area is needed or when the sailing is finished. As {{a result of the}} conic mast, the clew will move up the less sail that exposed. As a result of the mast taper the clew will end up higher and higher the closer it is to the mast.|$|R
5|$|<b>Powered</b> <b>winches</b> {{were used}} on cargo ships {{to speed the}} {{handling}} of heavy loads. One winch was operated {{at each of the}} ship's five cargo holds. During loading operations, the winches were worked hard, requiring steady maintenance to remain operable. Winch brakesa safety feature provided for stopping the load from falling if the <b>winch's</b> main <b>power</b> was lostwere not often used by a skilled winch operator, as the load could be more quickly maneuvered using various power settings than by application of the brakes. Disused brakes sometimes seized up and stopped working. The winches on the SS E. A. Bryan were steam-powered and showed signs of wear, even though the ship was only five months old.|$|R

50|$|Beside {{having one}} more axle {{and a larger}} {{capacity}} than the SBA111, the SBAT111S has a turbocharged engine, a 100-kN <b>winch</b> and a <b>power</b> take-off when a 55-kNm hydraulic crane is fitted or other hydraulic operated units.|$|R
50|$|For many of {{its early}} years the site was {{inaccessible}} by land. Stores, materials and equipment brought by boat were hauled up to the lighthouse by a flying fox <b>winching</b> system originally <b>powered</b> {{by a pair of}} horses.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} FATs, the CMP was usually used to tow either the 25 pounder gun-howitzer or the 17 pounder {{anti-tank}} gun. A <b>power</b> <b>winch</b> was located above the rear axle for manoeuvring the gun or unbogging the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fine example}} of [...] "stone art" [...] {{can be found at}} the O'Gormans; the marked stone makes up part of the gate to Ballinkillin Lodge. In addition, in 1984 a [...] "cist" [...] grave was {{uncovered}} by Shea <b>Power</b> whilst <b>ploughing</b> on Doran's land. It consisted of a 2 x 1 [...]5 ft shallow chamber with a cap stone, containing two earthenware urns with human bones and grain.|$|R
50|$|Steam donkey, or donkey engine, is {{the common}} {{nickname}} for a steam-powered winch, or logging engine, widely used in past logging operations, though not limited to logging. They were {{also found in the}} mining, maritime, and nearly any other industry that needed a <b>powered</b> <b>winch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Puretic {{power block}} line was {{introduced}} in the 1950s and was the key factor in the mechanization of purse seining. The combination of these blocks with advances in fluid hydraulics and the new large synthetic nets changed the character of purse seine fishing. The original Puretic power block was driven by an endless rope from the warping head of a <b>winch.</b> Nowadays, <b>power</b> blocks are usually driven by hydraulic pumps powered by the main or auxiliary engine. Their rpm, pull and direction can be controlled remotely.|$|R
50|$|At {{the back}} end of the truck is a powered reel with video cable {{reinforced}} with kevlar or steel wire braid. Some trucks also contain a <b>powered</b> <b>winch</b> that booms out from the truck allowing for lowering and retrieval of the inspection equipment from the pipeline.|$|R
40|$|A {{modular unit}} which is {{adaptable}} to several existing deep sea submersibles {{was developed to}} extend their working abilities and acquire knowledge of components and techniques for working in the deep sea environment. This work systems package is composed of an aluminum pipe structure on which are mounted two six-function grabber arms, a seven function manipulator, tool suit, 1, 000 /lb. capacity <b>winch,</b> electrohydraulic <b>power</b> supply, electronics housing, lights, and television. The unit {{is designed to be}} operated by itself either remotely or with divers, attached to manned submersibles, or mounted on unmanned cable-controlled submersibles...|$|R
40|$|The cutter {{suction dredge}} {{is the most}} {{commonly}} used dredging equipment for dredging navigable waterways. The capital costs of these dredges are in the millions of US dollars and the dredging projects involve the removal of hundreds of thousand to just over a million cubic yards of dredged sediments. Production engineers usually accomplish estimating the production of dredges, and controlling the operation of the dredge is usually the responsibility of the dredge operator (leverman). In order to improve the performance and education of the production engineer and the leverman, cutter suction dredge simulators are available for training of these dredging personnel. Two dredge simulator short courses have been conduct since 1999 and the experience gained from these courses shows that they are valuable training tools. The simulators consist of dredging controls and instrumentation interfaced with a personal computer. Software has been developed that accurately models or simulates the dredge movement, the hydraulic transport, and the cutting of the sediments. Results of the dredge simulation exercise are recorded and used to critique the simulator exercise in order to demonstrate dredging fundamentals such as effects of cavitation, critical velocity, <b>winch</b> <b>power,</b> pump power, and maneuvering of the dredge. Short course participants indicate the simulator is realistic and that it is valuable for training new operators and production engineers...|$|R
25|$|On July 14, 2009, GGYC filed {{a motion}} with the court asking that SNG be found in {{contempt}} for changing the rules for the match in secret {{to allow them to}} build a boat with <b>powered</b> <b>winches</b> and moveable ballast which were allegedly illegal under the SNG rules that should apply to the race. SNG filed a competing motion asking that GGYC be disqualified as a challenger if they did not produce a Custom House Certificate for their challenging yacht within 14days, and it disputed the allegations made by GGYC, arguing that the use of <b>powered</b> <b>winches</b> and moveable ballast was common for high performance catamarans racing under SNG's rules, and that the April 2009 version of the SNG rules should apply, since it was only on that date that GGYC was recognized as Challenger of Record.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{equipment}} for the Rakhsh includes a central tyre inflation system that allows the driver to adjust the tyre pressure to suit the terrain being crossed, tyres fitted with run flats, differential locks and a <b>powered</b> <b>winch.</b> As it will be deployed in high ambient temperatures an air conditioning system is fitted as standard.|$|R
50|$|The {{boat was}} {{selected}} amongst the Best Boats of 2013 by Sail Magazine and praised for its speed, comfort, construction quality and ergonomics, but criticized for its learning curve {{and a need}} for <b>power</b> <b>winches.</b> It was also praised by Cruising World, being awarded 'Most Innovative' for 2013 and garnering compliments for its interior design, performance and detailing.|$|R

500|$|The {{armoured}} recovery vehicle, {{known as}} the AMX-30D (AMX-30 Dépanneur-Niveleur), was designed to recuperate or help maintain vehicles in the field. Work on the AMX-30D began in 1966, as the French Army researched developing a recovery vehicle to be issued to units receiving the AMX-30 tank. A prototype was produced and delivered for experimentation in 1971, and in February 1973 {{the first of a}} pre-series of five vehicles was delivered.

50|$|Another {{factor in}} {{the decline of the}} harvests were the {{shortage}} of drought <b>power</b> for <b>ploughing</b> and reaping was even more acute in 1932 than in the previous year. The number of working horses declined from 19.5 million on July 1, 1931 to 16.2 million on July 1, 1932. The desperate efforts to replace horses by tractors failed to compensate for this loss. In 1931, the total supply of tractors to agriculture amounted to , 393,000 produced at home and 578,000 imported. But in 1932, because of the foreign trade crisis and home producing establishing, no tractors at all were imported.|$|R
5000|$|Descriptions of {{tractors}} as [...] "general-purpose" [...] and [...] "all-purpose" [...] {{had been}} used loosely and interchangeably in the teens and early twenties; but a true all-purpose tractor would be one that not only brought <b>power</b> to <b>ploughing,</b> harrowing, and belt work but also [...] the horse team entirely. This latter step is what changed the financial picture to heavily favor the mechanization of agriculture. The Farmall was so successful at total horse replacement that it became a strong-selling product. With {{the success of the}} Farmall line, other manufacturers soon introduced similar general- to all-purpose tractors with varying success.|$|R
40|$|From {{the time}} of immemorial the buffalo has been {{the main source of}} <b>power</b> for the <b>ploughing</b> {{operation}} of paddy cultiviation in Sri Lanka. Since the introduction of mechanical power in 195 Os, it has been gradually pushed away from paddy fields, mainly in the dry zone. But in some localities in the dry zone, buffalo power still retains the place it has held in paddy production. This paper is intended to identify the reasons for why buffalo power is still favoured in some localities in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Hureegama, a small dry zone village of which the farmers heavily depend on buffalo <b>power</b> for <b>ploughing</b> has been selected and its socio-economic and physical conditions were observed with a view to identify their impacts on farmers’ preference for buffalo power. In the light of the survey it has been found that the uncertainty involved in water supply, the relatively high buffalo work output, the flexibility in the implementation of water management regulations, the adequate availability of buffalo power and the difficulties in obtaining tractor/power tiller custom services collectively generate favourable circumstances for the continuous existence of the usage of buffalo power for puloughing...|$|R
