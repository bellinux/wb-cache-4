5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, the larvae drawing oxygenated <b>water</b> <b>through</b> the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping {{it out of}} the wider, anterior end. The larvae move around inside the tubes and this helps maintain the water current; the lower the oxygen content of the water, the more active the larvae need to be. This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae.|$|E

It is suspected that these Antarctic subglacial lakes may be connected by a network of subglacial rivers. Centre for Polar Observation & Modelling glaciologists propose that many of the subglacial lakes of Antarctica are at least temporarily interconnected. Because of varying water pressure in individual lakes, large subsurface rivers may suddenly form and then force large amounts of <b>water</b> <b>through</b> the solid ice.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{have what}} can be {{described}} as an incomplete gut; the gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach and possesses a single opening to the outside, which operates as both a mouth and anus. Waste and undigested matter is excreted through this opening. The mouth is typically slit-like in shape, and bears a groove at one or both ends. The groove, termed a siphonophore, is ciliated, and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate <b>water</b> <b>through</b> the gastrovascular cavity.|$|E

40|$|A particle-tracking {{experiment}} {{based on}} Bluelink ReANalysis (BRAN) {{is designed to}} explore the contribution of {{a branch of the}} South China Sea Throughflow, the Karimata Strait (KS) transport, to the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean. Results of the particle-tracking experiment show that most of the KS transport enters the Indian Ocean {{during the first half of}} a calendar year, with a maximum transport of more than 3 Sv in March-April. The annual average contribution of the KS transport to the ITF is 1. 6 Sv, 13 % of the annual mean ITF transport, while in February-April, the contribution is above 20 %. Interannual variations of the KS transport into the Indian Ocean are modulated by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). More SCS <b>waters</b> <b>through</b> KS can enter the Indian Ocean during El Nino phase, and less SCS <b>waters</b> <b>through</b> KS can enter the Indian Ocean during La Nina phase.

5|$|The {{standard}} {{method of cooling}} is passing a coolant (usually <b>water)</b> <b>through</b> a series of holes drilled through the mould plates and connected by hoses to form a continuous pathway. The coolant absorbs heat from the mould (which has absorbed heat from the hot plastic) and keeps the mould at a proper temperature to solidify the plastic at the most efficient rate.|$|E
5|$|A sponge's body is {{hollow and}} {{is held in}} shape by the mesohyl, a jelly-like {{substance}} made mainly of collagen and reinforced by a dense network of fibers also made of collagen. The inner surface is covered with choanocytes, cells with cylindrical or conical collars surrounding one flagellum per choanocyte. The wave-like motion of the whip-like flagella drives <b>water</b> <b>through</b> the sponge's body. All sponges have ostia, channels leading to the interior through the mesohyl, and in most sponges these are controlled by tube-like porocytes that form closable inlet valves. Pinacocytes, plate-like cells, form a single-layered external skin over all {{other parts of the}} mesohyl that are not covered by choanocytes, and the pinacocytes also digest food particles that are too large to enter the ostia, while those {{at the base of the}} animal are responsible for anchoring it.|$|E

5|$|Dissolved {{oxygen in}} fresh water is {{measured}} {{to indicate the}} health {{of plant and animal}} life. It enters <b>water</b> <b>through</b> the atmosphere and from aquatic plant photosynthesis, and is affected by water pressure and temperature. Rapid decomposition of organic materials will decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen in the river, as will nutrients added to the water artificially by wastewater treatment runoff or drainage from fertilized agricultural fields. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Florida recommend no less than 5mg of oxygen per liter. Several locations on the St. Johns or its tributaries reported at or below these minimums in the 1990s, including the mouth of the Wekiva River, the St. Johns at the town of Christmas, and in the early 2000s at Blue Spring and Blackwater Creek. Sustained low levels of dissolved oxygen may create algal blooms, which may also cause a further decrease in dissolved oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Imperatritsa Mariya {{proved to}} be very bow-heavy in service and tended to ship large amounts of <b>water</b> <b>through</b> her forward casemates.

This did not fully cure the problem so Volias, as she was known by then, forward pair of 130mm guns were removed while she was fitting out. Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya did not suffer from the same degree of trim by the bow by virtue of her greater size and retained her forward guns.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, Cade was {{approached}} by Dewayne Douglas, an assistant coach for the Florida Gators football team, about the extreme dehydration faced by Gator football players practicing in the high temperatures and humidity of the Deep South in late summer and early fall. Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not urinate during practice and games. Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that football players were losing <b>water</b> <b>through</b> perspiration and failing to replace fluid during practice and games. Cade's research team discovered that football players were losing up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) during the three hours of a college football game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss was water. A player's plasma volume could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in the sweat.|$|E
5|$|In fact, tadpoles {{developing}} in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous. Pond tadpoles {{tend to have}} deep bodies, large caudal fins and small mouths; they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation. Stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths, shallow bodies and caudal fins; they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria. They also feed on diatoms, filtered from the <b>water</b> <b>through</b> the gills, and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond, ingesting edible fragments. They have a relatively long, spiral-shaped gut {{to enable them to}} digest this diet. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles and fish. Young of the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) can occasionally be cannibalistic, the younger tadpoles attacking a larger, more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} known {{for more than a century}} that {{consumption}} of raw or insufficiently cooked shellfish can be associated with infectious diseases. These are caused either by bacteria naturally present in the sea such as Vibrio spp. or by viruses and bacteria from sewage effluent that sometimes contaminates coastal waters. As filter feeders, bivalves pass large quantities of <b>water</b> <b>through</b> their gills, filtering out the organic particles, including the microbial pathogens. These are retained in the animals' tissues and become concentrated in their liver-like digestive glands. Another possible source of contamination occurs when bivalves contain marine biotoxins as a result of ingesting numerous dinoflagellates. These microalgae are not associated with sewage but occur unpredictably as algal blooms. Large areas of a sea or lake may change colour as a result of the proliferation of millions of single-cell algae, and this condition is known as a red tide.|$|E
