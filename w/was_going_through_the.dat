25|$|At {{the same}} time the Colorado Charter Schools Act <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{legislative}} process, the Dennison option school in Lakewood was straining at the limits of its site capacity providing a K-8 program. In response to the need to expand Dennison's program through high school, a group of parents proposed a combined junior and senior high school that would relocate the 7th and 8th grades from Dennison and add the high school at a rate of one grade level per year. Naming themselves the Initiating Committee, they submitted an application to the Jefferson County School Board to operate as an educational option school with a request to be considered for a charter school if the educational option request was denied on December 17, 1993.|$|E
25|$|While Sea Side Park <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{process of}} being incorporated, the Senate Amusement Company of Philadelphia was working on plans to build an oceanside {{attraction}} in Seaside Heights within feet of the border to Sea Side Park. Their plan was to build a covered pier to house a carousel. The structure was built in 1915 {{under the direction of}} Joseph Vanderslice of Senate Amusement Company. Budget issues caused the business to not open in 1916, and the amusement ride and building was subsequently sold to Frank Freeman. The combination of the completion of the Toms River Bridge on October 23, 1914, and the DuPont Avenue carousel and boardwalk are what likely led to the 219% population growth shown between the 1910 and 1920 censuses in Sea Side Park.|$|E

500|$|... "New York" [...] was {{met with}} mixed reviews by many critics. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "We didn't {{actually}} expect the New Directions to win nationals, but the episode just felt like it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> motions rather than seizing {{the opportunity to do}} something truly spectacular." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff called the episode a [...] "good piece of television", and gave it a [...] "B+". He said it [...] "wasn't as good" [...] as the first-season finale, [...] "Journey to Regionals", [...] "largely because it wasted {{a lot of time on}} performances designed solely to show off how the show was actually in New York and also because it borrowed a lot of that episode's set pieces without finding anything remotely as powerful as the performance of 'Bohemian Rhapsody. Robert Canning of IGN gave [...] "New York" [...] a [...] "good" [...] grade of 7.5 out of 10 and stated, [...] "while not as epic as Nationals in New York should have been, 'New York' was a decent close to an enjoyable season." [...] The Atlantic Meghan Brown said the episode was [...] "an uneven end to an uneven season, with a few killer numbers, strange resolutions, and head-scratching plot devices", while her colleague Kevin Fallon opined that the season finale was [...] "no exception" [...] to Glee having [...] "been undeniably frustrating in season two", though [...] "there was still ample reason to tune in and enjoy".|$|E
500|$|Yours Truly is {{the result}} of three years of work. The project {{underwent}} significant conceptual and sonic changes throughout that time. Grande began working on the album in August 2010 while she was filming Victorious and formally started to work on it with a record label after she was signed to Republic Records on August 10, 2011. By September 10 of that year, Grande already had twenty songs prepared and <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> process of narrowing it down to thirteen. The first single, a bubblegum pop song called [...] "Put Your Hearts Up", was released on December 12, 2011. The single was aimed at young audiences, perhaps intending to cater to Grande's core audience, which at that time was almost entirely made up by kids who knew her from Victorious. During an interview in June 2012, Grande described everything on the album as being [...] "50s, 60s doo-wop-inspired" [...] and revealed that two new singles were going to be released before the album, one of which was called [...] "Do You Love Me?" [...] and featured SkyBlu. Other songs that Grande had rights to, named and later leaked as being part of the album included [...] "Honeymoon Avenue", [...] "Voodoo Love", [...] "Pink Champagne", [...] "Boyfriend Material", [...] "Tattooed Heart", [...] "Daydreamin'" [...] and [...] "You're My Only Shawty". The latter never made it onto Yours Truly and was eventually given to Demi Lovato to record and include on her 2011 R album Unbroken. as [...] "You're My Only Shorty".|$|E

A 2012 study found that when answering yes or no questions, ouija use was significantly more accurate than guesswork, suggesting that it might draw on the unconscious mind.

They are real life superheroes and I am representing their emotions on screen". Adding that he never had felt such responsibility towards any other character he had played to date, he told the media that the film did not take any stance on mercy-killing. Roshan said that he was able to identify with Ethan Mascarenhas because, when he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Guzaarish script, he had been nursing a knee problem and doctors told him that the knee will never be okay. According to Roshan, the script [...] "..energised me so much that I was not depressed about my knee problem anymore".|$|E
