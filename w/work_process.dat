5|$|Self-managed work teams (also {{referred}} to as autonomous work groups) allow their members to make a greater contribution at work and constitute a significant competitive advantage for the organization. These work teams determine how they will accomplish the objectives they are mandated to achieve and decide what route they will take to complete the current assignment. Self-managed work teams are granted the responsibility of planning, scheduling, organizing, directing, controlling and evaluating their own <b>work</b> <b>process.</b> They also select their own members and evaluate the members' performance. Self-managed work teams have been favored for their effectiveness over traditionally managed teams due their ability to enhance productivity, costs, customer service, quality, and safety.|$|E
5|$|Welding can be {{dangerous}} and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding. Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; {{this is why it}} is classified as a hot <b>work</b> <b>process.</b> To prevent injury, welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc, but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E

25|$|Other thinkers soon {{offered more}} {{ideas on the}} roles that workers play in mature {{industrial}} systems. These included ideas on improvement of the individual worker with attention to the worker's needs, not just {{the needs of the}} whole. James Hartness published The Human Factor in Works Management in 1912, while Frank Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth offered their own alternatives to Taylorism. The human relations school of management evolved in the 1930s to complement rather than replace scientific management, with Taylorism determining the organisation of the <b>work</b> <b>process,</b> and human relations helping to adapt the workers to the new procedures. Today's efficiency-seeking methods, such as lean manufacturing, include respect for workers and fulfillment of their needs as integral parts of the theory. (Workers slogging their way through workdays in the business world do encounter flawed implementations of these methods that make jobs unpleasant; but these implementations generally lack managerial competence in matching theory to execution.) Clearly a syncretism has occurred since Taylor's day, although its implementation has been uneven, as lean management in capable hands has produced good results for both managers and workers, but in incompetent hands has damaged enterprises.|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{evolution}} in ubiquitous technologies {{has increased the}} demand and enabled for computational support of work anywhere, anytime. Mobility implies migrating computer systems from relatively static physical environments to highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the technical principles and representation of a constraint-based configuration method for <b>work</b> <b>processes.</b> Methods developed for the configuration of modular systems comprising components have traditionally adopted a representation where the properties and compatibility requirements are expressed as constraints associated with individual components. However, this representation does not accurately capture constraints on paths and subprocesses and is therefore unsuitable for process configuration. This article extends established constraint-based configuration methods with a constraint language for specifying properties of execution paths in <b>work</b> <b>processes.</b> A framework for semiautomated process customization is presented. It integrates the extended constraint language with a metamodel of the <b>work</b> <b>processes</b> in an organization and allows to adapt generic <b>work</b> <b>processes</b> to fit the requirements of specific development projects. Heuristic search methods are applied to build valid process configurations by incrementally resolving constraint violations. The declarative framework facilitates the adaptation of abstract <b>work</b> <b>processes</b> {{as well as the}} validation and repair of existing processes. The approach was developed {{in the context of a}} real-world system of complex design and development processes where it was shown that significant process improvements and reduction in effort required to edit process models can be achieved. ...|$|R

Victor, who lived and worked separately from Alexander and Leonid, would come at a later stage as devil's advocate, pinpointing weaknesses of intermediate drafts. Neither Leonid nor Victor questioned Alexander's lead in defining overall exterior looks and composition.

To Vesnins' credit, they never incorporated such ideas in their projects.|$|E
40|$|To {{better serve}} society, {{infrastructure}} organizations must manage their civil infrastructure systems effectively and efficiently, employing {{best practices in}} infrastructure management and relevant information systems. As information systems mature, communications follow a general trend away from informal human-to-human communications towards computer-to-computer information exchange. For efficient implementation of computer-based exchange of information, these communications must be formally described. As {{part of a larger}} study into the formalization of communications within the infrastructure industry, this paper examines the level to which <b>work</b> <b>processes</b> and communications are formalized and designed at present within the domain of infrastructure management. The research adopts a maturity model approach. There are many maturity models available in different industries, but their focus is on the maturity of the way <b>work</b> <b>processes</b> and communication are operated and managed, not the way these <b>work</b> <b>processes</b> and communications are formalized and designed. To address the issue, an Infrastructure Management-Process Maturity Model (IM-PMM) is developed to assess the degree to which <b>work</b> <b>processes</b> and communications are formalized within a specific engineering domain, namely infrastructure management. A five-step approach is used to develop the IM-PMM: define the problem, compare existing maturity models, develop the model, apply the model, and evaluate the maturity model. This paper describes the development and application of the Infrastructure Management-Process Maturity Model (IM-PMM) that can benchmark the current level of maturity of <b>work</b> <b>processes</b> and communications in the domain of infrastructure management. The proposed IM-PMM uses a scale of five levels of maturity (stages) and uses three core elements (i. e. process/transaction map definition, actor/role definition, and information definition) to benchmark existing <b>work</b> <b>processes,</b> plus one additional element (message definition) to benchmark existing communications. The proposed model has been applied and tested in the domain of infrastructure management using a structured interview approach. The resulting data show that existing <b>work</b> <b>processes</b> and communications are typically accomplished in an ad hoc manner, emphasizing the need for further improvements in the way that <b>work</b> <b>processes</b> and communications are defined if infrastructure organizations intend to deploy advanced information systems. The proposed IM-PMM would help the transaction development personnel (including transaction analysts, transaction designers, software developers, process modellers, and industry experts) to assess and benchmark the maturity of the <b>work</b> <b>processes</b> and communications in the domain of infrastructure. As part of the evaluation, the proposed IM-PMM is verified through testing and applying it in the domain of infrastructure management; future work will conduct validation through industry expert review...|$|R
