Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. Aquaculture {{has been}} the world's fastest growing food {{production}} technology in recent decades {{and the effects of}} its developments are felt in seafood markets worldwide. As a result, fishermen face an additional challenge that has the potential to impact their choice of whether to reduce participation, what species to target, and how often and to what extent to invest into capital. The price of seafood and the design of the management system, including the absence of one, are key indicators of how aquaculture and capture fisheries interact. Understanding the complex dynamics of this interaction is important for policy makers and fishers equally. This paper presents a continuous-time bioeconomic model that links fishing fleet dynamics as a function of aquaculture prices for the closest substitute species, and renewable resource dynamics, under three main management systems: open access, maximum economic yield, and regulated restricted access. The dynamics for the fishing fleet are described through numerical simulations focusing on the markets targeted, capital investment and fleet life expectancy conditional on market interactions between the fisheries and aquaculture at different levels of substitutability and with different assumptions with respect to the perceived quality of the <b>wild</b> <b>product</b> compared to the farmed. Finally, we will extrapolate our findings to world regions where fishermen’s livelihoods depend on commercial fishing, and to those that might expect to be impacted by the emergence or progress in aquaculture...|$|E
40|$|Humans {{have been}} farming {{plants and animals}} for over 10, 000 years. Meat, grain, {{medicinal}} ingredients, fabrics and cloths can all be produced efficiently and cheaply on farms or synthesised. If there is plentiful supply then why does the wildlife trade continue to threaten populations of our remaining natural environments? Clearly the available products do not present an appropriate substitute for the <b>wild</b> <b>product</b> given their prices, attributes or availability. Farming the desired species is therefore an intuitively neat solution to trade issues facing some species. However, I argue and present data to support that argument, that farming is not a panacea for wildlife trade problems. This thesis begins by outlining a theoretical framework around the impact which farming might have upon the poaching of species from the wild. Once the pre-requisites for a successful farming policy to protect wild populations were identified the thesis began to test these for existing trades. Chapters 2 and 3 quantitatively examine the substitutability of wild and farmed products with data from the Atlantic salmon (Salmo sa/ar) market in the UK and the bear bile (Ursus spp.) markets in China. Chapter 3 examines demand for wildlife derived pharmaceuticals by examining the health seeking behaviour in a dual system of traditional Chinese and western medicines. The fifth chapter estimates the total size {{of the market for}} wild bear bile after 3 decades of competition from legal farmed bile. The thesis then tests the assumption that competition from the farmed alternative will significantly diminish the incentive to hunt bears for bile by interviewing rural Cambodians. The last two chapters represent methodological work incidental to the core work of this thesis. A novel method to measuring attitudes was developed (and used in chapter 5) to measure moral attitudes towards bear bile use. Finally a method for measuring the marginal value of small changes in available habitat was developed and published {{during the course of this}} thesis.

40|$|This book debates the {{emergent}} proprieties of rural and peri-urban South Africa since land and agrarian reforms were initiated after {{the transition to}} democracy in 1994. It explores how these reforms have broadened options for the use of land and natural resources. Reform-minded policies in South Africa have assumed that if access to land and other natural resources is less problematic, the use of these resources would be intensified which in turn would alter the structure and dynamic of rural and urban poverty. Reforming Land and Resource Use in South Africa examines in detail, and from several disciplinary perspectives, whether and how this has occurred, and if not, why not. A key argument that this collection pursues is whether land reform has resulted in transformed use of natural (i. e. land, crops, cattle, rangeland, <b>wild</b> <b>products</b> etc.) and other strategic resources (labour, knowledge, institutions, networks etc.), and the value communities and household place on them. The contributions explore a combination of new or alternative meanings of land, including a look beyond crops and cattle per se to include the collection and selling of <b>wild</b> <b>products,</b> as well as a discussion of how land for agriculture has become redefined by land reform beneficiaries as urban land, for settlement and urban employment opportunities, in addition to urban-based agricultural activities. This book pursues an analysis of land reform dynamics at various levels of aggregation. National and regional level analyses of poverty and the ramifications of the property clause are combined with analyses at disaggregate levels such as the land reform project or village...|$|R

40|$|Rising urban {{prosperity}} is escalating {{demand for}} <b>wild</b> animal <b>products</b> in Vietnam. Conservation interventions seek to influence consumer demand, but {{are based on}} a limited understanding of consumers and consumption behaviour. This report presents key findings of a structured survey (n= 915) and semi-structured interviews (n= 78) to investigate the social context of consumption of <b>wild</b> animal-derived <b>products</b> among the population of central Hanoi. Wildmeat is the product most commonly reported consumed-predominantly by successful, high-income, high-status males of all ages and educational levels-and is used as a medium to communicate prestige and obtain social leverage. As Vietnam′s economy grows and its population ages, demand for wildmeat and medicinal products is likely to rise. Given the difficulties of acting on personal rather than collective interests and the symbolic role of wildmeat in an extremely status-conscious society, reducing demand is challenging. Influencing consumer behaviour over the long term requires social marketing expertise and has to be informed by an in-depth understanding, achieved using appropriate methods, of the social drivers of consumer demand for <b>wild</b> animal <b>products.</b> In the meantime, strengthened enforcement is needed to prevent the demand being met from consumers prepared to pay the rising costs of finding the last individuals of a species...|$|R
40|$|Vietnam is an {{established}} thoroughfare for illegal wildlife trade, and rapidly growing urban prosperity is increasing domestic demand for <b>wild</b> animal <b>products.</b> Consumer-targeted interventions, including awareness campaigns and social marketing, and supply-side approaches such as wildlife farming to reduce demand for wild animals, {{are increasingly being}} used alongside regulatory measures to curb illegal trade. These approaches are based on limited information about wild animal consumers and consumption behaviour in urban Vietnam. In particular, {{little is known about}} the characteristics of consumers, the context of consumption, the values associated with <b>wild</b> animal <b>products,</b> the ability of farmed wild substitutes to satisfy consumer demand and current awareness levels and attitudes regarding wild animals. Focusing on the central Hanoi population, this thesis investigates all of these issues using a structured questionnaire survey (n= 915) and a series of semi-structured interviews (n= 77). There is considerable demand for <b>wild</b> animal <b>products,</b> and for <b>wild</b> meat in particular, amongst the population of central Hanoi. Wild meat consumers tend to be high-income men of all ages working in high-status positions as businessmen, finance professionals and government officials. Consumption of medicinal products is positively related to age and education. Wild meat is a prestige food used to demonstrate wealth and status and there are considerable social pressures to consume it. Preferences for wild-caught products show farmed substitutes will not satisfy demand for wild products; widespread farming may actually increase overall demand for <b>wild</b> animal <b>products</b> by introducing new consumers and encouraging existing consumers to place greater emphasis on the origin of products. Wildlife-related awareness does not reduce consumption behaviour and the population surveyed displayed a largely utilitarian attitude towards wild animals. The thesis concludes with recommendations to reduce wildlife decline driven by overexploitation for trade in Vietnam. ...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via the DOI in this record. Unsustainable wildlife trade affects biodiversity and the livelihoods of communities dependent upon those resources. Wildlife farming has often been proposed to promote sustainable trade but characterizing markets and understanding consumer behaviour remain neglected, but essential, steps with important implications for its design and evaluation. We used sea turtle trade in the Cayman Islands {{as a case study}} - where turtle meat for consumption has been produced for almost 50 years, to explore consumer preferences towards wild-sourced (illegal) and farmed (legal) products and potential conservation implications. Combining methods innovatively (including indirect questioning and choice experiments), we conducted a nationwide trade assessment. Whilst 30 % of resident households had consumed turtle in the previous 12 months, the purchase and consumption of <b>wild</b> <b>products</b> was relatively rare (e. g. 64 - 742 resident households consumed wild turtle meat, representing 0. 3 - 3. 5 % of resident households), although representing an important threat to wild turtles in the area due to reduced populations. We found marked differences among groups of consumers with price and source of product playing an important role in their decisions. Despite the long-term practice of farming turtle, some consumers showed a strong preference for <b>wild</b> <b>products,</b> demonstrating limitations of wildlife farming as a single tool for sustainable wildlife trade. By using a diversified toolset to investigate demand for wildlife products, we obtained insights about consumer behaviour {{that can be used to}} develop conservation demand-focused initiatives. Lack of long-term social-ecological assessments, a common issue worldwide, hinders the evaluation and learning potential of wildlife farming as conservation tool. This information is key to understanding under which conditions different interventions (e. g. bans, wildlife farming, social marketing) are likely to succeed. This article is protected by copyright.

40|$|Study of Non Woody Forest Products Exploitation and Market in Kinshasa. In {{spite of}} the {{considerable}} number of ethnobotanic studies carried out in many regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo, almost no information {{is available on the}} exploitation and commerce of the <b>wild</b> <b>products</b> (non woody forest products, "produits forestiers non ligneux" – PFNL) of the Congolese provinces in general and the urban province of Kinshasa in particular. Nevertheless, these products are largely used and marketed. Therefore, direct observations in situ, and socio-economic and ethnoecologic investigations (including interviews) were organized in the urban province of Kinshasa to analyse various aspects of consumption of these <b>wild</b> <b>products.</b> The purpose of these investigations was to collect information regarding the use and the marketing of PFNL products by the populations living in the zones surrounding the urban area. The analysis of the various types of exploitation and use of the PFNL has shown twelve categories of PFNL use: energy, food, construction of music instruments, saw mill applications, drink, drugs, dye, packing, construction of baskets, textile fabrication, construction and ornamentation. The majority of these PFNL originate not only from the secondary forests and from forest galleries, but from shrubby savannas and the marshes as well. The exploitations and uses of the PFNL vary rather largely with the level of income, the purchasing power, the attachment with food practices and with local traditions. The various levels of semi-monthly income by owner of the PFNL are estimated for the following plants which were used as vegetables: Gnetum africanum Welw., (275. 0 $); Pteridium aquilinium Hieron. (166. 7 $); Dracaena camerooniana Baker. (75. 5 $); Dioscorea praehensilis (Benth.) (71. 0 $); Psophocarpus scandens (Endl.) Verdc. (58. 7 $).

We also conduct the Law of One Price (LOP) test between price series. Our data base consists of monthly domestic price series for fish purchased by French households from 2007 to 2012. Our empirical results show that the fresh fish markets for whole wild and farmed sea bream are partially integrated, while those for whole wild and farmed sea bass are not integrated.
