5|$|On April 15, 2009, Helms {{was drafted}} to the ECW brand {{as part of}} the 2009 Supplemental Draft. Helms made his ECW debut as a {{backstage}} interviewer on April 28, 2009, reverting to his Gregory Helms ring name, interviewing Evan Bourne. He started a storyline where, while he <b>was</b> <b>interviewing</b> someone, a scripted accident would occur, leading to Helms leaving the interview seconds before the person in distress was saved by The Hurricane. On the August 11, 2009 episode of ECW, Helms was attacked by Paul Burchill after Helms denied being The Hurricane. The Hurricane later attacked Burchill in the ring dressed in his Hurricane attire, to save Yoshi Tatsu. The next week on ECW, he made his in-ring debut for the brand as The Hurricane, and defeated Burchill. He continued to feud with Burchill, who attempted to expose The Hurricane's true identity, until the November 17 episode of ECW when The Hurricane defeated Burchill in a mask versus career match.|$|E

25|$|In {{his five}} decades of research, he {{practices}} a Franciscan philosophy {{of knowledge in}} action. He was not content to speculate about these new peoples, but met with, interviewed and interpreted them and their worldview {{as an expression of}} his faith. While others – in Europe and New Spain – were debating whether or not the indigenous peoples were human and had souls, Sahagún <b>was</b> <b>interviewing</b> them, seeking to understand who they were, how they loved each other, what they believed, and how they made sense of the world. He fell in love with their culture. Even as he expressed disgust at their continuing practice of human sacrifice and their idolatries, he spent five decades investigating Aztec culture.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, OCBC {{sold its}} 29.9% {{stake in the}} group to Indonesia's Lippo Group (under Auric Pacific Singapore) for S$203 million as they could not own more than 5% in {{non-core}} assets. In October 2006, there was a controversial board meeting, with new owner Lippo booting out long serving chairman Michael Wong Pakshong. Another board member, Chew Gek Khim, who narrowly retained her seat in the board, resigned on 30 October 2006, after serving the board for 18 years. Chew {{was the chairman of}} its remuneration and nominating committees of the corporation. She is the granddaughter of the late Tan Sri Dr. Tan Chin Tuan, the latter invested in the company when he was at OCBC. Days later, the two remaining independent directors resigned from the company's board. They are Cham Tao Soon and Winston Tan. Stephen Riady told the media that he <b>was</b> <b>interviewing</b> candidates for new independent directors back in September. Stephen has been a board director of the company since Auric Pacific acquired the company.

[...] "There {{are real}} characters among them", he later wrote, [...] "and you know I have a fancy for {{anything out of the}} ordinary." [...] In August 1866, he took a month off in order to prepare a new edition of Leaves of Grass which would not be published until 1867 after difficulty in finding a publisher. He hoped it would be its last edition. In February 1868, Poems of Walt Whitman was published in England thanks to the influence of William Michael Rossetti, with minor changes that Whitman reluctantly approved. The edition became popular in England, especially with endorsements from the highly respected writer Anne Gilchrist. Another edition of Leaves of Grass was issued in 1871, the same year it was mistakenly reported that its author died in a railroad accident. As Whitman's international fame increased, he remained at the attorney general's office until January 1872. He spent much of 1872 caring for his mother who was now nearly eighty and struggling with arthritis. He also traveled and was invited to Dartmouth College to give the commencement address on June 26, 1872.|$|E
