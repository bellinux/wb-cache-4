5|$|After the war, the Proms {{continued}} much as before. The second {{halves of}} concerts still featured piano-accompanied songs rather than serious classical music. Chappell's, having taken over {{sponsorship of the}} Proms and spent £35,000 keeping the Queen's Hall going during the war, wished to promote songs published by the company. The management of Chappell's were also less enthusiastic than Wood and Newman about promoting new orchestral works, most of <b>which</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> profitable.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi had {{selected}} {{a number of}} songs from his own record collection for the film's soundtrack, <b>which</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> used in the film due to {{the high costs of}} licensing the songs. The film was initially scored by singer Dan Hicks, who became involved with the production of the film in 1974. Because of the delay of the film's release, Hicks' label released the material from these sessions under the title It Happened One Bite. When the film was released in 1982, it had been rescored by John Madara.|$|E

Macartney played in only five first-class matches and scored two centuries in these fixtures. In two non-first-class matches, he took 11/23 and 10/29 in an innings.|$|E

He first proposed this to the Geological Society of London in 1858, and went into more detail in an 1875 paper in the society's quarterly journal. By this time, new material had been uncovered from Elgin that indicated that Stagonolepis was not a fish, but a reptile.

5|$|Fighting colonial wars in Portuguese colonies {{had absorbed}} forty-four {{percent of the}} overall Portuguese budget. This led to an obvious {{diversion}} of funds from necessary infrastructural developments in Portugal itself. This contributed to the growing unrest in the European nation.

More importantly however, the party had been squeezed out by the tougher line on immigration issues by mainstream politicians such as Minister for Integration and Immigration Rita Verdonk, who largely adopted Fortuyn's policies. By the end of the decade, former LPF supporters had mostly moved to support Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV).|$|E

There was no formal contract, and client and architect disagreed on costs for carved stonework. Adam sued for £5,796 12s 11⅓d, and the matter was initially resolved in his favour.

5|$|In {{his pursuit}} of a {{unification}} of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, <b>which</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.|$|E

5000|$|It is a {{traditional}} model which goes {{back at least to}} some of the classical Greek philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined solely by how it relates to a reality; that is, by whether it accurately describes that reality. As Aristotle claims in his Metaphysics: [...] "To say that that <b>which</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> and that <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>is,</b> is a falsehood; therefore, to say that <b>which</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is,</b> and that <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>is</b> true".|$|R
