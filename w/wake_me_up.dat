500|$|Burt {{is shown}} to have deeply loved his first wife, Kurt's mother, a strong woman who died eight {{years prior to the}} premiere of the show. He later characterizes his life after losing her as [...] "being asleep". Kurt {{introduces}} him to Carole Hudson, Finn's widowed mother, and they begin dating. He falls in love with her and she with him: he tells Finn that she is an [...] "angel who came down to <b>wake</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> after all these years". At Carole's behest, Burt becomes something of a father figure to Finn, taking him to ball games, though this development does not sit well with Kurt, who works to win his father's attention back from Finn by emulating his father's dress and interests before Burt realizes how hurt Kurt is. The relationship between Burt and Carole progresses {{to the point that they}} decide to live together, and she and Finn move in with the Hummels, since their house is the larger of the two. However, after Finn uses a homophobic slur against Kurt, Burt tells Finn that his behavior is unacceptable and he cannot live in the house any more, imperiling his romance with Carole. Following his appearance in this episode, O'Malley spoke of future reconciliation between Burt and Finn. He stated, [...] "One of the things I think is really important in life and for human beings is to forgive and be able to rise up from our mistakes. I'm hoping that Finn and Burt are able to cross that chasm." ...|$|E

I couldn't offer any reason why and I don't think the medical profession knew either." [...] In the winter of 1953-54, Gimblett spent 16 weeks in Tone Vale Hospital, a psychiatric institution, where he was given electro-convulsive therapy, and was released in time to join the Somerset team {{for the start of}} the 1954 season.

[...] Schoolboy Q said he arranged the song to juxtapose the process of selling prescription pills and addiction: [...] "I put the OxyContin and selling it {{at the end of the}} relapse or the addiction," [...] he said. [...] "I sold OxyContin and then I got addicted [...] This way, I showed that I got addicted then I sold it. That was a crazy record. That's true shit—the first part of it when my daughter tried to <b>wake</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> and I was dead to the world. That was my little secret. I always had the cup with me.

2500|$|After {{leaving the}} seminary, Fernandes moved to Bombay in 1949 {{in search of}} a job. His life was tough in Bombay, and he had to sleep on the streets, until he got a job as a {{proofreader}} for a newspaper. He relates to the beginning of his career by saying, [...] "When I came to Bombay, I used to sleep on the benches of Chowpatty Sands. In {{the middle of the night}} policemen used to come and <b>wake</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> and ask me to move on." [...] He came into contact with veteran union leader Placid D'Mello, and the socialist Rammanohar Lohia, who were the greatest influences on his life. Later, he joined the socialist trade union movement. He rose to prominence as a trade unionist and fought for the rights of labourers in small scale service industries such as hotels and restaurants. Emerging as a key figure in the Bombay labour movement in the early 1950s, Fernandes was a central figure in the unionisation of sections of Bombay labour in the 1950s. As a labour organiser, he served many prison terms when his workforce engaged in fights with company goons. He served as a member of the Bombay Municipal Corporation from 1961 to 1968.

[...] Chauncey's father Chief Yellow Robe (Tasinagi), first known as White Thunder, assumed the name Yellow Robe name for his heroic war deeds against a Yellow Robe family of Crow Indians. [...] Tasinagi was a descendant of two famous leaders of the Sioux nation, Sitting Bull and Iron Plume. Tasinagi signed the Treaty of 1868, [...] fought in the Battle of the Little Big Horn and died in 1904 at the age of eighty-seven, Chauncey's mother Tachcawin (Deer Woman), was a niece of Sitting Bull and had seven children with Chief Yellow Robe. As a boy, Chauncey lived on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. [...] "Kills in the Woods" [...] was trained in Lakota skills of making bows and arrows, riding ponies bareback, foot racing, wrestling and swimming. [...] "Sometimes during a morning of a winter blizzard my father used to <b>wake</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> out of my warm bed of buffalo robes and dare me to go out and lay down in the deep snow and roll in it 'as I had come into the world'. This was not as a punishment, but a [...] test of endurance." [...] Chauncey did not see a white man until he was ten or eleven years old. When he did, he could not decide if it was a man or an animal, and as the creature approached, he decided it was an evil spirit and ran to the tipi of his father. Canowicakte spent many hours in the tipi of his grandfather and grandmother. They were his tutors in legends and history of the tribe. He was expected to memorize all these stories so that he in turn would be able to relate them to his children. [...] He was taught respect and reverence for Wakan-tanka, the Great Mystery. [...] He learned of the great and inspiring deeds of the famous chiefs, warriors and medicine men. He was trained in the old customs of how to make bows and arrows for hunting and for wars. He learned how to hunt deer and buffalo. He enjoyed wrestling, swimming and foot racing with his companions. Later in his life, Chauncey would spend many hours telling his children the Lakota tales he was told by his grandparents.|$|E
