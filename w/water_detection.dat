40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>detection</b> is a {{critical}} perception requirement for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) autonomous navigation over cross-country terrain. During the Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliances (RCTA) program, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) developed a set of <b>water</b> <b>detection</b> algorithms {{that are used to}} detect, localize, and avoid water bodies large enough to be a hazard to a UGV. The JPL <b>water</b> <b>detection</b> software performs the detection and localization stages using a forward-looking stereo pair of color cameras.

40|$|The German SAR {{interferometry}} mission TanDEM-X {{performed on}} two TerraSAR-X satellites flying in close formation {{will provide a}} global Digital Elevation Model (DEM). A by-product is so-called the Water Indication Mask (WAM). The purpose of this supplementary information layer is to support the DEM editing process. Water surfaces usually show lower coherence in an interferometric data set due to temporal de-correlation and low backscattering. Consequently the corresponding elevation values derived from the interferogram are random and produce a virtual relief. This paper introduces the operational <b>water</b> body <b>detection</b> workflow that synergistically evaluates amplitude and coherence information. The presented results of two test sites reveal that the methodology is globally applicable, classifications are highly accurate and the algorithm is appropriate for operational image processing. The <b>water</b> body <b>detection</b> consists of two steps: the <b>Water</b> Body <b>Detection</b> (WBD) derived of one single DEM scene and the mosaicking of multiple WBD to a single Water Indication Mask (WAM).

In June 2005 a dataset of in situ measured reflectance spectra, airborne hyperspectral images, experimental reflectance and absorption spectra of Noctiluca scintillans was collected. The strong optical signature of dense Noctiluca scintillans blooms suggests that mapping these blooms should be feasible. A detection {{algorithm is proposed}} based {{on a combination of}} a high reflectance threshold with a condition of sharp increase in reflectance in the range 520 - 580 nm.
