500|$|Ani {{has been}} {{listed on the}} [...] by World Monuments Fund (WMF) since 1996. In May 2011 the WMF and the Turkish Ministry of Culture {{launched}} <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> conservation project focusing on the cathedral and the nearby Church of the Redeemer. The project is funded by the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation of the U.S. State Department. Before the project a steel structure was installed around the cathedral, said to prevent its cracked sandstone walls from collapsing. The WMF and its Turkish partner, the NGO Anadolu Kültür, say they will work on [...] "stabilization and protection" [...] of the cathedral. Turkey's Minister of Culture Ertuğrul Günay stated [...] "We hope that giving new life to the remains of once-splendid buildings, such as the Ani Cathedral and church, will bring new economic opportunities to the region." [...] Armenian officials responded with skepticism. According to Gagik Gyurjyan, president of ICOMOS-Armenia, the Turkish Ministry of Culture rejected the preliminary agreement between Anadolu Kültür and the Armenian side to engage Armenian experts in restoration works. Osman Kavala, president of Anadolu Kültür, stated {{that the lack of}} formal bilateral relations between Armenia and Turkey may have prevented Armenian experts from being included in the project. Kavala stated in a 2011 interview that an estimated $1 million would be spent on the project, which was scheduled to start in 2012 and end in 4 years. Yavuz Özkaya, an architect who participated in the projects carried out in Ani, stated in March 2014 that studies on preservation and restoration of the cathedral were completed and they had begun to be implemented. These works included clearing the roofs, installing a temporary structure at the separation point between the western and southern walls, strengthening, proper completion of roof tiles and taking preventative measures.|$|E

2500|$|The brick tea is {{packaged}} [...] {{either in}} the courtyard or in the street outside, and {{it is quite a}} complicated process. When the coolies bring it in from Ya'an, it has to be repacked before being consigned upcountry, for in a coolie's load the standard subunit is four bricks lashed together, and these would be the wrong shape for animal transport. So they are first cut in two, then put together in lots of three, leaving <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> gam, which is half a yak's load. Tea {{which is going to be}} consumed reasonably soon is done up in a loose case of matting, but the gams, which are bound for remote destinations, perhaps even for Lhasa, are sewn up in yakhides. These hides are not tanned but are merely dried in the sun; when used for packing they are soaked in water to make them pliable and then sewn very tightly around the load, and when they dry out again the tea is enclosed in a container which is as hard as wood and is completely unaffected by rain, hard knocks, or immersion in streams. The Tibetan packers are a special guild of craftsmen, readily identifiable by the powerful aroma of untanned leather which they exude.|$|E
