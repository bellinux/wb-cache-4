5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1980s, several studies {{suggested}} a link between children's consumption of aspirin and Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal disease. By 1986, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> on all aspirin, further suppressing sales. The makers of Tylenol also {{filed a lawsuit against}} Anacin aspirin maker American Home Products, claiming that the failure to add <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> before 1986 had unfairly held back Tylenol sales, though this suit was eventually dismissed.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to discover the most effective <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> to decrease the intensity of instant noodle consumption on college student in Malang. This research used survey method by giving questionnaires to 1000 students, consisted with 477 male students and 523 female students from four universties in Malang, among them are 262 from Universitas Brawijaya, 235 from Universitas Islam Negeri Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang, 300 from Universitas Negeri Malang, and 203 from Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang, with age ranged from 17 - 22 years old. The result shows that 228 students, about 22. 8 % chose information <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> as the most effective, 551 students, about 55. 1 % chose pictorial <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> as the most effective, and 221, about 22, 1 % chose question <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> as the most effective <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> to decrease the intensity of instant noodle consumption...|$|R

In the United States, the Surgeon General recommended in 1981, and again in 2005, that women abstain from alcohol use while pregnant or while planning a pregnancy, the latter to avoid damage even in the earliest stages (even weeks) of a pregnancy, as the woman {{may not be aware}} that she has conceived. In the United States, federal legislation has required that <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> be placed on all alcoholic beverage containers since 1988 under the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Federal Trade Commission in the USA {{considered}} {{the lack of}} privacy for children on the Internet, and created the Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). COPPA limits the options which gather information from children and created <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> if potential harmful information or content was presented. In 2000, Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) was developed to implement safe Internet policies such as rules, and filter software. These laws, awareness campaigns, parental and adult supervision strategies and Internet filters can all help to make the Internet safer for children around the world.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, a {{case-control study}} {{carried out in}} the United Kingdom also {{demonstrated}} an association between Reye syndrome and aspirin exposure. In June 1986, the United Kingdom Committee on Safety of Medicines issued warnings against the use of aspirin in children under 12 years of age and <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> on aspirin-containing medications were introduced. UK surveillance for Reye syndrome documented a decline in the incidence of the illness after 1986. The reported incidence rate of Reye syndrome decreased from a high of 0.63 per 100,000 population less than 12 years of age in 1983/84 to 0.11 in 1990/91.|$|E

25|$|However, in 2000, the <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> {{were removed}} because {{scientists}} learned that rodents, unlike humans, {{have a unique}} combination of high pH, high calcium phosphate, and high protein levels in their urine. One {{or more of the}} proteins that are more prevalent in male rats combine with calcium phosphate and saccharin to produce microcrystals that damage the lining of the bladder. Over time, the rat's bladder responds to this damage by overproducing cells to repair the damage, which leads to tumor formation. Since this does not occur in humans, there is no elevated risk of bladder cancer.|$|E
25|$|There were {{no legal}} {{restrictions}} on the importation or use of opium in the United States until the San Francisco Opium Den Ordinance, which banned dens for public smoking of opium in 1875, a measure fueled by anti-Chinese sentiment and the perception that whites were starting to frequent the dens. This was followed by an 1891 California law requiring that narcotics carry <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> and that their sales be recorded in a registry; amendments to the California Pharmacy and Poison Act in 1907 made {{it a crime to}} sell opiates without a prescription, and bans on possession of opium or opium pipes in 1909 were enacted.|$|E
25|$|As {{the flight}} test program proceeded, Boeing {{encountered}} {{problems in the}} 747-400's production process, leading it to disclose delivery delays of up to one month for the first 20 aircraft built. A primary reason for the delays was the unprecedented complexity of interior configurations offered to airlines, which ranged from lavatory and galley locations to the color shades of cabin <b>warning</b> <b>labels.</b> Coupled with new, relatively inexperienced workers, a lack of veteran technicians, interior configurations needing costly re-work, and teething problems with electronics integration on the advanced flight deck, 747-400 production fell behind schedule. The company managed to resolve early production issues by mid-1989, with all three 747-400 engine variants delivered within four months of each other, and overall delays not exceeding several weeks.|$|E

25|$|The {{classification}} of a laser {{is based on}} the concept of accessible emission limits (AEL) that are defined for each laser class. This is usually a maximum power (in W) or energy (in J) that can be emitted in a specified wavelength range and exposure time that passes through a specified aperture stop at a specified distance. For infrared wavelengths above 4 μm, it is specified as a maximum power density (in W/m2). It {{is the responsibility of the}} manufacturer to provide the correct {{classification of}} a laser, and to equip the laser with appropriate <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> and safety measures as prescribed by the regulations. Safety measures used with the more powerful lasers include key-controlled operation, warning lights to indicate laser light emission, a beam stop or attenuator, and an electrical contact that the user can connect to an emergency stop or interlock.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, {{cigarette}} companies advertised {{frequently on}} television programs. To combat this {{move by the}} cigarette companies, the Federal Communications Commission required television stations to air anti-smoking advertisements {{at no cost to}} the organizations providing such advertisements. In 1970, Congress took their anti-smoking initiative one step further and passed the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act, banning the advertising of cigarettes on television and radio starting on January 2, 1971. After the television ban, most cigarette advertising took place in magazines, newspapers, and on billboards. However, in 1999 all cigarette billboard advertisements were replaced with anti-smoking messages, with some of these anti-smoking messages playing parodies of cigarette companies advertising figures and slogans. Since 1984, cigarette companies have also been forced to place Surgeon's General warnings on all cigarette packs and advertisements because of the passing of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. Restrictions on cigarette companies became even tighter in 2010 with the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The act prohibits tobacco companies from sponsoring sports, music, and other cultural events and also prevents the display of their logos or products on T-shirts, hats, or other apparel. The constitutionality of both this act and the Food and Drug Administration's new graphic cigarette <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> are being questioned under cigarette companies' first amendment rights.|$|E
