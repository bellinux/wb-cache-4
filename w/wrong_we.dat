Donovan (who had negotiated the release of Francis Gary Powers) to start a fundraiser for Risner's bail. However, the U.S. State Department stepped in and put a stop to it. After years of conflict with the bureaucracy of political and military command, Hagerstrom retired from the Air Force, maintaining that [...] "Vietnam was <b>wrong,</b> <b>we</b> shouldn't have been there".|$|E
500|$|Aside from this, Adams {{generally}} stayed quiet.

[...] He did, however, privately attack the president over his Embargo Act, {{despite the fact that}} it was voted for by his son John Quincy, a U.S. senator. Another incident began in relation to Mercy Otis Warren in 1806. Warren, an old friend, had attacked Adams in a pamphlet for his [...] "partiality for monarchy" [...] and [...] "pride of talents and much ambition." [...] A tempestuous correspondence ensued. In time, the friendship healed.|$|E

In 2010, in an interview on BBC Radio 1, Williams elaborated, [...] "'It is one of those situations in life that could be very explosive and could go completely <b>wrong.</b> <b>We</b> had that big chat and the most amazing thing happened at the end of it.

500|$|Following the race, Mercedes apologised to Hamilton for the pit call, which {{commentators}} such as F1Fanatic's Keith Collantine, Formula One {{correspondent for}} The Guardian Paul Weaver, and former Formula One driver David Coulthard felt cost him the victory. Team boss Toto Wolff told the press: [...] "We got our numbers <b>wrong.</b> <b>We</b> {{thought we had}} the gap for Lewis to take fresh tyres and come back out in the lead behind the safety car, ahead of Nico and covering off any risk of another competitor taking fresh tyres. But the calculation was incorrect and he came out in third place." [...] Indeed, {{more than half of}} the teams made a pit stop at least one car when the safety car was deployed, just as Hamilton did. However, he as race leader caught up with the safety car quicker and lost a considerably larger amount of time on his way into the pit lane, leading to him coming out behind Rosberg and Vettel.|$|E

Fish's mother then put her son into Saint John's Orphanage in Washington, where he was frequently abused. He began to enjoy the physical pain that the beatings brought.

2500|$|I am {{told that}} the more you rehearse, the better you play. This is <b>wrong.</b> <b>We</b> often try to reduce the {{unforeseen}} to a controllable level, to prevent a sudden impulse that escapes our ability to control, yet also responds to an obscure desire. Let's allow improvisation to have its place and play its role. I think that the true interpreter {{is the one who}} improvises. We have mechanized the art of conducting to an awful degree, in the quest of perfection rather than of dream [...] As soon as rubato is obtained and calculated scientifically, it ceases to be true. Music making is something else than searching to achieve an accomplishment. But striving to attain it is beautiful. Some of Michelangelo's sculptures are perfect, others are just outlined and the latter ones move me more than the first perfect ones because here I find the essence of desire, of the wakening dream. That's what really moves me: fixing without freezing in cement, allowing chance its opportunity.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{interface}} mission, theology and psychology in an exploration of what hinders and what enables conciliatory existence. Whereas common approaches to reconciliation focus on redressing past <b>wrongs,</b> <b>we</b> propose identity formation that would prevent such <b>wrongs.</b> <b>We</b> consider how people integrate elements of their social context into a social identity that influences how they perceive "the other. " Understanding this to be divine action that transforms psychological processes, we draw from all three disciplines to understand the dynamics of how we {{come to see the}} other. Biblical theology provides penetrating narratives into the nature of fallen humanity and its proclivity toward self-aggrandizement and strife. Psychosocial analysis recognizes that the processes of socialization so necessary to promote belonging and identity formation, are also quite capable of turning others into objects of scorn and hatred. Yet, both theology and psychology, posit that despite however distorted human nature may be, it has the potential of being re-created. We locate the work of reconciliation as beginning with the being and action of God on behalf of humanity and demonstrated powerfully in the transformation of the apostles in the book of Acts...|$|R
