5|$|In 1726, anatomist Nathaniel St André {{claimed to}} have {{delivered}} rabbits from Mary Toft, a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> at No.27 Leicester Square. The event was widely reported around London, attracting interest from King George I and Royal Society president Hans Sloane. Shortly afterwards, the woman was caught trying to buy a rabbit in secret, and the incident was uncovered as a hoax.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{skeletal}} {{remains of a}} <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> around 425AD were discovered {{in the vicinity of}} Beachy Head on the Eastbourne Downland Estate. The remains were found to be of a 30 year-old woman who grew up in East Sussex, but had genetic heritage from sub-Saharan Africa, giving her black skin and an African skeletal structure. Her ancestors came from below the Saharan region, {{at a time when the}} Roman Empire extended only as far as North Africa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece of the <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, {{as though he had}} come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E

5|$|Notably, the Queen was {{the first}} {{character}} to ever speak in an animated feature film. She was voiced by Lucille La Verne, who achieved her voice change {{for the role of}} the Witch by removing her false teeth. Joe Grant, who contributed the design for her Witch form, noticed La Verne's changing attitude and posture when voicing the Queen and Witch, and sketched these poses and her body language down for animation reference. He also said he based the Witch's concept art on a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> across the street from him. The character's foreign dubbing voice actresses included Jiřina Petrovická in Czechoslovakia, Clara Pontoppidan, Kirsten Rolffes, Lise Ringheim in Denmark, Rauni Luoma and Seela Sella in Finland, Claude Gensac in France, Dagny Servaes in Germany, Ilus Vay in Hungary, Tina Lattanzi and Dina Romano in Italy, Tanie Kitabayashi in Japan, Blanca de Castejón and Cristina Montt in Mexico, Zinaida Sharko in Russia, and Helena Brodin, Hjördis Petterson and Lil Terselius in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|After {{shooting}} Magruder {{and killing}} Arnaud, Logan then fled {{the scene with}} Kromah in a silver-painted Dodge Charger with Maryland license plates, with Kromah driving the vehicle. After leaving the house, Kromah took the weapon from Logan and attempted to wipe off any residual evidence, such as fingerprints, from it. The two then disposed of the murder weapon by burying it at a nearby forested cemetery and abandoned the getaway vehicle. Kromah was captured and charged as an accomplice to the murder; he pleaded guilty on April 24, 2003 to being an accessory after the fact to a murder. In the meantime, Logan stayed briefly at the residence of Twyla James, a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in Largo, Maryland. James would later be arrested and charged as an accessory to murder as she transported Logan, whom she had known was a murder suspect and fugitive sought by legal authorities, to her residence and allowed him to stay there. Logan was apprehended {{two days after the}} murder, on August 31, 2002, at a shed near the Quebec Arms Apartments in Hyattsville, Maryland, on the 8200 block of 14th Avenue. He was spotted there by undercover policemen, who had received information that it had been an area that Logan was known to frequent in the past. Logan was found hiding in the shed by policemen, who then used a police canine and a taser to subdue and apprehend him.|$|E

25|$|As an {{integral}} part of human culture and civilization, shoes have found their way into our culture, folklore, and art. A popular 18th century nursery rhyme is There was an Old <b>Woman</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Lived</b> in a Shoe. This story tells about an old woman living in a shoe with a lot of children. In 1948, Mahlon Haines, a shoe salesman in Hallam, Pennsylvania, built an actual house shaped like a work boot as a form of advertisement. The Haines Shoe House was rented to newlyweds and the elderly until his death in 1962. Since then, it has served as an ice cream parlor, a bed and breakfast, and a museum. It still stands today and is a popular roadside attraction.|$|E

25|$|In January 1861, {{a band of}} Apaches {{raided the}} ranch of John Ward, stole some livestock, and kidnapped {{the son of a}} Mexican <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> with Ward. Ward wrongly {{believed}} that the unrelated Chiricahua Apache chief Cochise and his followers were responsible and he demanded that the United States Army confront Cochise, recover the livestock, and rescue the boy. A month later, the army responded by sending Lieutenant George Nicholas Bascom and fifty-four men into Apache Pass, where several people had been massacred by the Chiricahuas in the past. After setting up camp about a mile from a Butterfield Overland Mail waystation, Bascom lured Cochise and several of his relatives into his tent and threatened to hold him hostage until Ward's property and the boy were returned. Furious and insulted, Cochise cut through the wall of the tent, eluded the guards posted outside, and attempted to free the other hostages by offering to exchange them for several of his own prisoners. When Bascom refused, the Chiricahuas killed their prisoners, and Bascom responded by hanging Cochise's hostage relatives.|$|E
25|$|The governess {{occupied}} a uniquely awkward {{position in the}} Victorian household, because she was neither a servant nor yet {{a member of the}} host family. She worked in the upper-class home of the landed gentry or aristocracy. She herself had a middle-class background and education, yet was paid for her services. As a sign of this social limbo she frequently ate on her own, away {{from the rest of the}} family and servants. By definition, a governess was an unmarried <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in someone else's home, which meant that she was subject to their rules. In any case, she had to maintain an impeccable reputation by avoiding anything which could embarrass or offend her employers. If a particular governess was young and attractive, the lady of the house might well perceive a potential threat to her marriage, and enforce the governess' social exclusion more rigorously. As a result of these various restrictions, the lifestyle of the typical Victorian governess was often one of social isolation and solitude, without the opportunity to make friends. The fact that her presence in the household was underpinned by an employment contract emphasized that she could never truly be part of the host family.|$|E

500|$|Several {{theories}} have been advanced {{to account for}} the incorporation of shoes into the fabric of a building, one of which is that they served as some kind of fertility charm. There is a long-standing connection between shoes and fertility, perhaps exemplified by the nursery rhyme, [...] "There was an Old <b>Woman</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Lived</b> in a Shoe", and the custom of casting a shoe after a bride as she leaves for her honeymoon or attaching shoes to the departing couple's car. Archaeologist Ralph Merrifield has observed that in the English county of Lancashire women who wished to conceive might try on the shoes of a woman who had just given birth, a custom known as smickling.|$|E
500|$|Murrell left no will. His son Edward later {{claimed that}} Murrell's {{landlord}} soon buried a wooden chest {{with the old}} man's papers {{in the garden of}} the cottage, deeming their associations with magic to be dangerous. Edward claimed that he subsequently dug the chest up again. Murrell's personal effects were treated as souvenirs, and several were treated as though they retained magical and supernatural associations for many years after his death. Murrell's [...] "trick" [...] telescope was sold by his son for half-a-guinea; the purchaser was allegedly found dead shortly after with half-a-guinea lodged in his throat, resulting in claims that the telescope itself brought bad luck onto anyone who possessed it. In 1960, Maple commented that Murrell's whalebone umbrella had been owned by a local undertaker until fairly recently, while he also noted that Murrell's carved chest was in the possession of a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> at Southend-on-Sea.|$|E

While there he took his summer cruises on the battleships [...] and [...] during World War I. He was commissioned as an ensign on graduation on 5 June 1920. His class was graduated in two groups due to the disruption caused by World War I.

500|$|In May 1894, Courtenay {{followed}} Lloyd to the Empire, Leicester Square, {{where she}} was performing, and attempted to batter her with a stick, shouting: [...] "I will gouge your eyes out and ruin you!" [...] His assault missed Lloyd, but struck Burge in the face instead. [...] As {{a result of the}} incident, Lloyd was sacked from the Empire for fear of a reprisal. Lloyd left the marital home, moving to 73 Carleton Road, Tufnell Park and successfully applied for a restraining warrant, which prevented Courtenay from contacting her. [...] A few weeks later, Lloyd began an affair with the music hall singer Alec Hurley, which resulted in Courtenay initiating divorce proceedings in 1894 on the grounds of her adultery. That year, together with a short tour of the English provinces, Lloyd travelled to New York with Hurley, where she appeared at the Imperial Theatre, staying for two months. On her return to England, she appeared in the Liverpool Christmas pantomime as the principal boy in Pretty Bo-Peep, Little Boy Blue, and the Merry Old <b>Woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in a Shoe. [...] Her performance was praised by the press, who called her [...] "delightfully easy, graceful and self-possessed." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's title phrase {{originated}} from Bono asking his brother how his struggling business was going, and the brother responding, [...] "It's like running to stand still." [...] Bono {{had not heard}} the phrase before, and he thought it expressed what heroin addiction {{and the effects of}} the drug on the body were like; a writer later described the title as a [...] "perfect distillation of the dynamic of feeding on addiction." [...] Bono had heard a real story about a pair of heroin addicts, a man and a <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in the Ballymun towers. [...] Out of money and unable to pay the rent due to their habit, the man became a heroin smuggler, operating between Dublin and Amsterdam and taking enormous risks for a big payday. Bono felt the man was decent at heart but was constrained by his squalid living conditions, as well as poor choices, and Bono wanted to illustrate how these poor conditions affected their lives. [...] The resulting lyric does not describe any of this explicitly, but instead [...] the emotional atmosphere that the couple live in. [...] In doing so, the song is not judgmental and shows sympathy for the woman. [...] A character monologue from Wim Wenders' 1984 film Paris, Texas, was also a significant influence on Bono's writing of the song.|$|E
500|$|As {{she struggles}} with her condition, doctors suggest to Karl that {{going back to}} {{familiar}} surroundings may trigger the return of her memories. Susan is brought to Ramsay Street, but nothing happens. Woodburne stated that Susan hates her hair and her clothes and wants to change everything. Karl takes her to Lyn Scully's salon and manages to persuade her to have her hair styled rather than cut short. While she is at the salon, Susan remembers her high school sweetheart, Craig Benson (Tim Hughes), and decides to find him. [...] Woodburne told Herbison [...] "As far as she's concerned, Craig is her boyfriend and they're in love. So she looks {{him up in the}} phone book and sets off to find him." [...] Woodburne added that there was a danger the storyline could cross a line and become silly, but the crew tried to portray the fear a person would feel when everything is suddenly unfamiliar. Susan falls in love with Karl and her memories return during their vow renewal service. During a 2012 interview, Woodburne told a What's on TV reporter that she and the writers initially joked about the storyline, but they found some truth in it. She explained [...] "It was actually based on a story of a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in England. The same thing happened to her. She fell over in a supermarket. Between leaving the supermarket and getting home, she'd lost 30 years. I don't think she recovered. She had a husband and grown-up children and she had no idea who they were.
