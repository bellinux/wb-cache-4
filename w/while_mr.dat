5|$|Shawn Michaels was {{suspended}} in late 1993 {{and forced to}} vacate the Intercontinental Championship, <b>while</b> <b>Mr.</b> Perfect began a feud with Diesel. The WWF planned to have Perfect and Diesel face each other {{as part of an}} elimination match at Survivor Series 1993, but Mr. Perfect was replaced by Randy Savage at the last minute. Mr. Perfect would not wrestle another pay per view match for the company until Royal Rumble 2002.|$|E
5|$|In October 1998, Mr. Niebla {{suffered}} an injury, which forced CMLL to vacate the CMLL World Trios Championship {{as it was}} not clear when Mr. Niebla would be able to wrestle again. They held a three-show, eight-team tournament from December 4 to December 12, 1998. Former champions Atlantis and Lizmark teamed up with Emilio Charles Jr. for the tournament, <b>while</b> <b>Mr.</b> Niebla actually returned to action in time to be in the tournament as well, teaming up with Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Shocker. In the finals the trio of Dr. Wagner Jr., Blue Panther and Black Warrior defeated Los Guapos (Scorpio Jr., Bestia Salvaje and Zumbido) to lay claim to the championship.|$|E
5|$|Lurie's script {{received}} a rewrite by Pamela Pettler, {{who worked with}} Burton on Corpse Bride, but the director hired Big Fish screenwriter John August in December 2003 to start from scratch. Both August and Burton were fans of the book since their childhoods. August first read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when he was eight years old, and subsequently sent Dahl a fan letter. He {{did not see the}} 1971 film prior to his hiring, which Burton believed would be fundamental in having August stay closer to the book. The writer updated the Mike Teavee character into an obsessive video game player, as compared to the novel, in which he fantasized about violent crime films. The characters Arthur Slugworth and Prodnose were reduced to brief cameo appearances, <b>while</b> <b>Mr.</b> Beauregarde was entirely omitted.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Burns sends hired goons to the Simpson {{house in}} order to take Homer back to Mr. Burns' Manor to negotiate. <b>While</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns is setting the agenda for the discussion, Homer is struck by the urgent need to use the rest room. Homer asks Mr. Burns where the rest room is and {{immediately}} leaves, leading Mr. Burns to conclude that Homer is a tough negotiator who is unwilling to even hear him out. At a later union meeting, Homer tries to resign, tired of meeting with Mr. Burns. The union misunderstands his frustration, and the members nearly unanimously decide to strike. Mr. Burns is undeterred by the strike and tries several methods of breaking it up, but fails. On an edition of Kent Brockman's talk show Smartline, Mr. Burns is allowed an opening tirade and he threatens dire events if the strike is not concluded.|$|E
25|$|On 21 June 2010, Hawkwind {{released}} a studio album entitled Blood of the Earth on Eastworld Records.

25|$|The Bloomfields {{are rich}} and much crueller than Agnes had expected. Mrs. Bloomfield spoils her {{children}} <b>while</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bloomfield constantly finds fault with Agnes's work. The children are unruly and Agnes is {{held accountable for}} them despite being given no real authority over them. Tom, the oldest Bloomfield child, is particularly abusive and even tortures small animals. In less than a year, Agnes is relieved of her position, since Mrs. Bloomfield thinks that her children are not learning quickly enough. Agnes returns home.|$|E

Many talk radio programs played a role in collecting signatures to force a recall election.|$|E
25|$|As of 1904, Flagler started what {{everybody}} considered a folly: {{the extension of}} the FEC to Key West which would later be known as the Overseas Railway, at the time considered the eighth wonder of the world and surely the most daring infrastructure ever built exclusively with private funds. The first train—a construction engineers train—arrived in Key West on January 21, 1912, <b>while</b> <b>Mr.</b> Flagler's special train and other passenger trains arrived the next day, January 22, 1912, and that is considered the first day of service on the new route.|$|E
25|$|In April 1999, <b>while</b> <b>Mr.</b> Day {{was still}} Treasurer, {{he wrote a}} letter criticizing Red Deer lawyer and public school board trustee Lorne Goddard for {{representing}} a defendant who was ultimately convicted on charges of possessing child pornography. In the letter, Mr. Day suggested that Mr. Goddard's argument in court that the Canadian Constitution protected his client's right to possess child pornography implied that he himself believed that pedophiles have the right to own such materials, and that this further implies that he also must believe that teachers {{should have the right to}} pornographic images of their students.|$|E

500|$|Bo's downfall, and the {{subsequent}} reassessments of the Chongqing model, has been viewed by some commentators as a victory for Wang Yang's Guangdong model. In assessing the fall-out, John Wagner Givens wrote that [...] "If there is a hope among China's leadership, it might be Mr. Bo's predecessor Wang Yang. <b>While</b> <b>Mr.</b> Wang may not have Bo's populist flair, {{he appears to have}} made some real, though small, political reforms." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1868, Vaughan died.

The rest of Buffland's society, as displayed at a party at Temple's house, is composed of [...] "a group of gossipy matrons, vacuous town belles, and silly swains".|$|E
