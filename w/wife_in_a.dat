5|$|Chotiner {{continued}} to practice law. In 1962, his wife Ruth obtained an interlocutory divorce decree against him. After the decree became final, Chotiner married again in 1965. In January 1966, attorney and land developer Charles W. Hinman {{was arrested and}} charged with plotting to have Chotiner murdered. Chotiner had represented Hinman's <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> contested divorce case, and Hinman had been jailed for eleven days for failure to pay his fees. No actual attempt on his life took place. Hinman was sentenced to between one and five years in prison.

5|$|Feynman's {{salary was}} $380 a month, about half {{what he needed}} to cover his modest living {{expenses}} and Arline's medical bills. The rest came from her $3,300 in savings. On weekends, Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car borrowed from his good friend Klaus Fuchs. Asked who at Los Alamos was most likely to be a spy, Fuchs speculated that Feynman, with his safe cracking and frequent trips to Albuquerque, was the most likely candidate. When Fuchs confessed to being a spy for the Soviet Union in 1950, this would be seen in a different light. The FBI would compile a bulky file on Feynman.|$|E

5|$|Most modern {{historians have}} exonerated Robert Dudley from murder or a cover-up. Apart from {{alternatives}} for a murder plot as causes for Amy Robsart's death, his correspondence with Thomas Blount and William Cecil {{in the days}} following has been cited as proofs of his innocence; the letters, which show signs of an agitated mind, making clear his bewilderment and unpreparedness. It has also been judged as highly unlikely that he would have orchestrated the death of his <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> manner which laid him open to such a foreseeable scandal.|$|E

5|$|MacLaren played little cricket in 1898, {{initially}} {{owing to}} his teaching commitments {{and the need}} to establish himself and his <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new home. After making his first appearance in July, he did not play again until August. He played nine first-class games, scoring 478 runs at 29.87, before his season was ended by neuralgia. Despite his frequent absences—again he missed {{the first part of the}} season—Lancashire re-appointed MacLaren as joint captain for 1899. That summer, the Australians toured England and the first Test took place before MacLaren had played any cricket. For the second game, MacLaren replaced W. G. Grace as England captain; the other candidate for the leadership was Stanley Jackson, who was senior to MacLaren at Harrow and had preceded him into the England side, but MacLaren was favoured owing to his previous experience in the role with Lancashire and England.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of this Slavic colony was first mentioned in the 1850s, and was unknown outside Italy until 1855 when linguist Medo Pucić from Dubrovnik did one of his journeys to Italy and overheard a tailor in Naples speaking with his <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> language very similar to Pucić's own.

25|$|A {{month before}} Black Tuesday, Evans sent his assistant, Charles Dwelley, to Concrete to edit the newly {{acquired}} newspaper. The youngest editor in Washington State at the time, twenty-one-year Dwelley worked {{and lived with}} his pregnant <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wooden newspaper building and operated two 19th century Linotype machines for 9-point and 12-point fonts, so all headings needed to be set by hand.

25|$|He took María Josefa Tafoya, the {{daughter}} of a prominent Taos family who were Mexican citizens, as his <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> common-law marriage. By the late 1820s and early 1830s, the Mexican authorities were growing concerned about American settlers and their influences in Nuevo México. They began to impose increasingly severe restrictions on trade and trapping. Perhaps in part to avoid these restrictions, Young was baptized a Catholic in 1830 (perhaps he also became a Mexican citizen and formalized his marriage to Maria Tafoya; however, if he did so, no record of these two events survives).|$|E
25|$|After {{accompanying}} {{her father}} to Manila on her return to Hong Kong, and before heading back to Dapitan to live with Rizal, Josephine introduced herself to members of Rizal's family in Manila.

Rizal and Josephine lived as husband and <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> common-law marriage in Talisay in Dapitan. The couple had a son who lived only for a few hours after Josephine suffered a miscarriage; Rizal named him after his father Francisco.|$|E
