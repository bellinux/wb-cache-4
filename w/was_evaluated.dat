5|$|As {{with the}} Ju 87 A-0, the B-1s were {{returned}} discreetly to the Reich. The {{experience of the}} Spanish Civil War proved invaluable - air and ground crews perfected their skills, and equipment <b>was</b> <b>evaluated</b> under combat conditions. The Ju 87 had not been tested against numerous and well-coordinated fighter opposition; this lesson was learned later at great cost to the Stuka crews.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{to future}} {{development}} aircraft, such as swept wings {{and more powerful}} Pegasus engines, {{led to the development}} of the Kestrel.

30|$|A policy <b>is</b> <b>evaluated</b> {{by first}} {{evaluating}} its target. If the policy {{does not apply}} to the request, NotApplicable is returned. If the policy does apply, its condition <b>is</b> <b>evaluated</b> (in case of an atomic policy) or its sub-policies <b>are</b> <b>evaluated</b> (in case of a composed policy) and the result is returned. For composed policies, the sub-policies <b>are</b> <b>evaluated</b> in the given order; as a consequence, the policy tree <b>is</b> <b>evaluated</b> depth-first. For now, we assume all sub-policies and expressions to <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> sequentially.|$|R

Wheldon was extricated from his car and was airlifted to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada. He was officially pronounced dead on arrival two hours later at 1:54PM Pacific Daylight Time. The official cause of Wheldon's death was given by the Clark County Coroner as blunt force trauma to his head due to the incident.

5|$|Following an {{alliance}} contracted in 1912, Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia {{declared war on}} the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Their goal was to definitely expel Turks from Europe. The First Balkan War started on 8 October 1912 and lasted six weeks. Serbians reached Skopje on 26 October. The Turkish forces had left the city the day before. The Serbian annexation led to the exodus of many Turks: 725 Turkish families left the city on 27 January 1913. The same year, the city population <b>was</b> <b>evaluated</b> at 37,000 by the Serbian authorities.|$|E
5|$|The Gneiss-2 {{airborne}} radar <b>was</b> <b>evaluated</b> in the Pe-3 beginning in July 1942 {{and it was}} sent to both Moscow and Stalingrad for combat trials in late 1942.

The M V1 was fitted with two Daimler Benz DB 601 inline engines while the M V2 and M V3 had the Bramo 323 A and D respectively. The Ministry of Aviation favoured the {{widespread}} use of the DB 601, but demand for the DB 601s in fighter aircraft and the lack of production forced the use of the Bramo.|$|E
