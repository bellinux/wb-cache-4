5|$|After a gap of two years, Sukumar's next directorial 100% Love (2011) was released. Sukumar {{envisioned the}} film's concept 15 years ago, which dealt <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> {{conflicts}} couples {{face and the}} way they solve them, and made changes based on the technological and behavioural developments {{of the students in the}} colleges. 100% Love featured Naga Chaitanya and Tamannaah in the lead roles and was produced by Allu Aravind and Bunny Vasu. 100% Love was commercially successful; it received the Best Home-viewing Feature Film award at the annual Nandi Awards ceremony. Sukumar earned another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director– Telugu at the 59th Filmfare Awards South, and a nomination for the Best Director– Telugu at the 1st South Indian International Movie Awards.|$|E
5|$|The {{encryption}} {{resembles the}} RSA algorithm. This algorithm encodes data in 3-byte blocks. First, the each byte is permuted through an 8-position permutation, then the bits are {{split into two}} 12-bit integers (by taking the low 4 bits of the second byte and the 8 bits of the first byte as the first 12-bit integer, and the 8 bits of the third byte and the 4 high bits of the second integer as the second 12-bit integer). Each is individually encrypted by taking them to the 3491st power, mod 4097; the bits are then reassembled into 3 bytes. The encrypted text is then stored in a string variable {{as part of the}} program. To shroud the would be visible and noticeable text it is compressed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> Lzw before final storage. As the Macintosh Common Lisp compiler compresses the main program code into the executable, this was not that necessary.|$|E

25|$|The problem <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> {{quantum well}} diode {{described}} above {{is that the}} thin layer is simply too small to effectively confine the light. To compensate, another two layers are added on, outside the first three. These layers have a lower refractive index than the centre layers, and hence confine the light effectively. Such a design is called a separate confinement heterostructure (SCH) laser diode.|$|E

25|$|Each car {{featured}} {{a selection of}} political pamphlets, posters, and newspapers for distribution, and a small library. Trains also included a mobile darkroom {{for the development of}} photographs. A key element of the trains was a special film exhibition car, in which politically-oriented movies could be shown. This represented for many peasants their first exposure to the medium of film and the experience could be compelling and effective, reaching a large audience <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> message to support the new revolutionary government. During its first of operation the agit-train October Revolution conducted 430 free film showings, reaching an audience estimated in the hundreds of thousands.|$|E
25|$|The 2006–07 Regionalliga Nord season saw Magdeburg <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> goal of non-relegation {{and setting}} the {{foundation}} for qualifying for the new 3rd Liga in the 2007–08 season. In December 2006 Magdeburg moved to their new stadium, dramatically increasing attendance. With their fans as support, Magdeburg started a run of great results after the winter break that opened up the opportunity to win promotion to the Second Bundesliga immediately, a feat only two other teams (FC Gütersloh and Carl Zeiss Jena) had achieved before. But despite having a five-point lead on the third-placed team three matchdays {{before the end of}} the season, Magdeburg eventually finished in a disappointing third place. In the Saxony-Anhalt-Cup the reserves won the club's seventh title.|$|E

500|$|The term countershading has {{a second}} meaning {{unrelated}} to [...] "Thayer's Law". It {{is that the}} upper and undersides of animals such as sharks, and of some military aircraft, are different colours to match the different backgrounds when seen from above or from below. Here the camouflage consists of two surfaces, each <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> function of providing concealment against a specific background, such as a bright water surface or the sky. The body of a shark or the fuselage of an aircraft is not gradated from light to dark to appear flat when seen from the side. The camouflage techniques used are the matching of background colour and pattern, and disruption of outlines.|$|E

500|$|Knowing {{that they}} could not match the quality of other computer-animated films, the film was instead {{designed}} to imitate the look of stop motion. Cory Edwards cited Rankin-Bass as an inspiration and explained, [...] "If we approach our look like that – photographed miniatures in stop-motion – and if that nostalgia resonates with our audience as far as that look, then we're not going to shoot ourselves in the foot trying to put every freckle and hair on photoreal creatures." [...] Edwards contrasted the technically innovative, but critically panned 1986 film Howard the Duck <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple,</b> but beloved puppet character Kermit the Frog to illustrate to his crew the importance of well-written, likeable characters over technical quality.|$|E
500|$|After the Beatles' final {{commercial}} concert on 29 August 1966, Lennon was {{deprived of}} the routine of live performances; he felt lost and considered leaving the band. Since his involuntary introduction to LSD, he had increased {{his use of the}} drug and was almost constantly under its influence for much of 1967. According to biographer Ian MacDonald, Lennon's continuous experimentation with LSD during the year brought him [...] "close to erasing his identity". The year 1967 saw the release of [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", hailed by Time magazine for its [...] "astonishing inventiveness", and the group's landmark album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which revealed Lennon's lyrics that contrasted strongly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> love songs of the Lennon–McCartney's early years.|$|E
500|$|The 2014 {{reintroduction}} of {{the product}} featured a first for the company, a primarily digital-focused promotion headed by the company's online media agency Code and Theory. To start off the promotion, the company announced the forthcoming reintroduction {{a few weeks before}} the product was set to be released <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> tweet [...] "You asked. We answered. ChickenFriesAreBack." [...] The company also expanded its social media footprint specifically for the Chicken Fries promotion, adding new Tumblr and Snapchat accounts to their stable of social media outlets. The idea behind the large social media push was monetary, instead of spending capital on a traditional multi-week, multi-media advertising campaign the company would have product-loyalists spread the word at a fraction of the cost of traditional advertising.|$|E

500|$|Wilds {{adopted the}} then-popular Italianate style for his design of Park Crescent, {{which has been}} {{described}} as the most ambitious development of his architectural career. It has been criticised for being an unsuccessful composition, [...] "showing ... his limitations as an architect" [...] with the [...] "muddled and disappointing" [...] proportions of the interior (garden-facing) façades. The gabled roofs on each house are large in proportion {{to the rest of the}} exterior, giving a [...] "top-heavy", [...] "busy and awkward" [...] appearance. This contrasts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> curves of the rear elevations, facing the streets on the outside. The gables form part of an attic storey which extends from the top of the two- and three-storey houses in the terrace. [...] They are treated as24 semi-detached villas at the front, but the rear resembles a plain terrace on all three sides. The linking element between the pairs of villas is a series of three-storey towers topped with pediments. These also provide a unifying element between houses of different heights, which {{has been described as}} a mark of Wilds's ingenuity.|$|E
