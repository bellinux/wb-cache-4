5|$|Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach {{described}} {{the screen as}} violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western <b>Wall</b> <b>area.</b> He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall. It stressed that {{the removal of the}} screen was necessary, but expressed regret over the ensuing events.|$|E
5|$|Although XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} {{to attack}} on Singapore Naval Base again on 6February, this raid was cancelled {{on the third}} of the month by Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the commander of Allied forces in the Southeast Asian theatre. Mountbatten ordered that the naval installations at Singapore and Penang not be targeted as they would be needed by Allied forces following the projected liberation of Malaya and Singapore later in 1945. After requesting clarification of this order, Ramsey met with Mountbatten at Kandy. In this meeting Mountbatten assigned targets in the Kuala Lumpur area as XXBomber Command's first priority, while second priority was given to carefully selected areas of Singapore. These areas excluded the King GeorgeVI Graving Dock and several other docks and areas with heavy machinery, but allowed attacks on the West <b>Wall</b> <b>area</b> of Singapore Naval Base, naval oil stores and commercial dock facilities. Saigon was assigned as XXBomber Command's third priority and fourth priority was given to oil storage dumps on islands near Singapore.|$|E

25|$|Increasing {{the size}} of the windows meant {{reducing}} the <b>wall</b> <b>area</b> considerably, something which was made possible only by the extensive use of flying buttresses on the outside. These buttresses supported the considerable lateral thrusts resulting from the 34m high stone vaults, higher and wider than any attempted before in France. These vaults were quadripartite, each bay split into four webs by two diagonally crossing ribs, unlike the sexpartite vaults adopted in many earlier Gothic cathedrals such as at Laon.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{construction}} methods, {{most of the}} structures, underneath the wet-stucco walls, are simple brick masonry. Exceptions were Andrei Burov's medium-sized concrete block panel houses (such as the Lace building, 1939–41) and large buildings like the Seven Sisters which necessitated the use of concrete. The masonry naturally dictated narrow windows, thus leaving a large <b>wall</b> <b>area</b> to be decorated. Fireproof terra cotta finishes were introduced during the early 1950s, though this was rarely used outside of Moscow. Most of the roofing was traditional wooden trusses covered with metallic sheets.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} an intravascular imaging antenna to image abdominal aorta atherosclerotic plaque in swine using 3. 0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Atherosclerotic model was established in 6 swine. After 8 months, swine underwent an MR examination, which was performed using an intravascular imaging guide-wire, and images of the common iliac artery and the abdominal aorta were acquired. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was performed in the right femoral artery; images at {{the same position as}} for the MR examination were obtained. The luminal border and external elastic membrane of the targeted arteries were individually drawn in the MR and IVUS images. After co-registering these images, the vessel, lumen, and vessel <b>wall</b> <b>areas</b> and the plaque burden in the same lesions imaged using different modalities were calculated and compared. The diagnostic accuracy of intravascular MR examination in delineating the vessel wall and detecting plaques were analyzed and compared using IVUS. Compared with IVUS, good agreement was found between MRI and IVUS for delineating vessel, lumen, and vessel <b>wall</b> <b>areas</b> and plaque burden (r value: 0. 98, 0. 95, 0. 96 and 0. 91, respectively; P< 0. 001).

The upper floor of the Gatehouse is surmounted by a crow-stepped gable and held Ludwig II's first lodging at Neuschwanstein, from which he occasionally observed the building work before the hall was completed. The ground floors of the Gatehouse were intended to accommodate the stables.|$|E
25|$|The {{deterioration}} of wood occurred at typically vulnerable areas, {{such as the}} exposed end grain of arches and muntins and where wood members intersect. The humidity in the building was a contributing factor to wood deterioration. The level of moisture in the building was exacerbated by two conditions. First, the building’s natural ventilation system had been removed in a past repair. The ventilators, which were originally located in the low <b>wall</b> <b>area,</b> had been filled in, and some ridge ventilators were inoperable. The air flow through the ventilators, which would have assisted in the evaporation of water, was not occurring. Second, the penetration of rain water from {{the exterior of the}} building, because of inadequate or deteriorated waterproofing, had increased the level of moisture in the wood. The copper sheathing that had originally capped the arch exteriors, in addition to acting as a moisture barrier, may have been acting as a biocide through copper oxides inhibiting wood rot.|$|E

40|$|Vessel {{elements}} from macerations of roots and stems of Hanguana malayana were studied with {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). Vessel elements are present in both stems and roots. The vessel elements of roots are slightly more specialized than those of stems in having greater differentiation of perforation plates from lateral <b>wall</b> <b>areas.</b> Long areas of transition between lateral <b>wall</b> <b>areas</b> and perforation plates, consisting of 10 or more pits (arguably perforations) with porose membranes or threadlike pit membrane remnants, characterize vessel elements of both stems and roots of Hanguana. Tracheids may be present, but cannot be identified with certainty. The vessel elements of Hanguana are like those of Acorus (Acoraceae) in primitiveness and {{are among the most}} primitive recorded for monocotyledons.

2500|$|In September 1928, Jews praying at the Wall on Yom Kippur placed {{chairs and}} a mechitza, {{consisting}} of a few wooden frames covered with cloth which separated the men and women. Jerusalem's British commissioner Edward Keith-Roach, while visiting the Muslim religious court overlooking the prayer area, pointed out the screen, mentioning {{that he had never}} seen it at the wall before. This precipitated emotional protests and demands from the assembled sheiks that it be removed. Unless it was taken down, they said, they would not be responsible for what happened. The screen was described as violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any [...] "construction" [...] at the Western <b>Wall</b> <b>area</b> and played into Muslim fears of Zionist expropriation of the site, though such screens had been put up from time to time. Keith-Roach told the beadle that the screen had to be removed because of the Arabs' demands. The beadle requested that the screen remained standing {{until the end of the}} prayer service, to which Keith-Roach agreed. When the Jewish beadle failed to remove the screen as agreed, ten armed men were sent in, urged on by Arab residents who were shouting, [...] "Death to the Jewish dogs!" [...] and [...] "Strike, strike". A violent clash with worshipers took place, and it was destroyed.|$|E

40|$|Background: Emerging {{evidence}} of histopathological analyses suggests that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) {{play an important}} role in vascular diseases. Neointimal hyperplasia can be reduced by intravenous transfusion of EPCs after vascular injury in mice. Therefore, it would be advantageous to develop an in vivo technique that can explore the temporal and spatial migration of EPCs homing to the damaged endothelium noninvasively. Methodology/Principal Findings: The left carotid common artery (LCCA) was injured by removal of endothelium with a flexible wire in Kunming mice. EPCs were collected by in vitro culture of spleen-derived mouse mononuclear cells (MNCs). EPCs labeling was carried out in vitro using Fe 2 O 3 -poly-L-lysine (Fe 2 O 3 -PLL). In vivo serial MR imaging was performed to follow-up the injured artery at different time points after intravenous transfusion of EPCs. Vessel <b>wall</b> <b>areas</b> of injured artery were computed on T 2 WI. Larger MR signal voids of vessel wall on T 2 WI was revealed in all 6 mice of the labeled EPC transfusion group 15 days after LCCA injury, and it was found only in 1 mouse in the unlabeled EPC transfusion group (p = 0. 015). Quantitative analyses of vessel <b>wall</b> <b>areas</b> on T 2 WI showed that the vessel <b>wall</b> <b>areas</b> of labeled EPC transfusion group were less than those of unlabeled EPC transfusion group and control group fifteen days after artery injury (p, 0. 05). Histopathological analyses confirmed accumulation and distribution of transfused EPCs at the injury site of LCCA. Conclusions/Significance: These data indicate that MR imaging might be used as an in vivo method for the tracking of EPC...|$|R
