25|$|Rollerball pens {{employ the}} same ballpoint mechanics, {{but with the}} use of <b>water-based</b> <b>inks</b> instead of {{oil-based}} inks. Compared to oil-based ballpoints, rollerball pens are said to provide more fluid ink-flow, but the <b>water-based</b> <b>inks</b> will blot if held stationary against the writing surface. <b>Water-based</b> <b>inks</b> also remain wet longer when freshly applied and are thus prone to smearing—posing problems to left-handed people (or right handed people writing right-to-left script)—and running, should the writing surface become wet.|$|R
50|$|Solvent-based inks {{began to}} be used, which were safe for food packaging, but harmful to the environment. The Environmental Law of the 1980s, led to {{printers}} trying out <b>water-based</b> <b>inks.</b> Today, most printers are easily adapted to <b>water-based</b> <b>inks,</b> allowing printers to recycle ink for later use.|$|R
30|$|The ink {{industry}} {{is one of}} the growing markets in the world, particularly due to increasing market of printing inks for packaging applications [1]. Currently, {{there are two types of}} printing inks based on composition: (1) solvent-based inks that are formulated using solvents an (2) <b>water-based</b> <b>inks</b> that are formulated using water as solvent. The volatile organic compounds present in solvent-based inks result in environmental issues regarding their use, which lead to the increasing demand for the more environment-friendly <b>water-based</b> <b>inks</b> [2].|$|R
50|$|Gel pens: While they {{designed}} the world's first pen using <b>water-based</b> <b>ink,</b> {{they also have}} a line of gel pens. The Mitsubishi Pencil Company incorporated a retractable tip to make the world's first retractable gel pen.|$|E
50|$|The {{functionality}} of {{the machine}} is based on pens manufactured especially for the device. The pens have multiple tips side by side, and <b>water-based</b> <b>ink</b> is led into them along threads. It is possible to program stop-lines on the equipment by mounting pens on shafts equipped with cams that lower and raise them at predetermined points.|$|E
50|$|In 1959, the {{invention}} of plastisol provided an ink more durable and stretchable than <b>water-based</b> <b>ink,</b> allowing much more variety in T-shirt designs. Very few companies continue to use water-based inks on their shirts. The majority of companies that create shirts prefer plastisol due {{to the ability to}} print on varying colors without the need for color adjustment at the art level.|$|E
50|$|Signs {{created with}} large-format {{printers}} may use solvent <b>inks,</b> <b>water-based</b> <b>inks,</b> latex inks or ultraviolet-curable/cured inks. The last material {{is the most}} modern, and can be printed directly onto many different substrates such as wood, metal and plastic, adhesive-backed or non-adhesive films. Adhesive-backed films are then laminated to another substrate.|$|R
30|$|<b>Water-based</b> {{printing}} <b>inks</b> {{have been}} successfully used in different printing applications, all of them involving application of the ink on various surfaces or substrates [1]. While solvent-based inks {{have been successfully}} used on both porous substrates (e.g., paper) and non-porous substrates (e.g., plastic), <b>water-based</b> <b>inks</b> {{are found to be}} incompatible to non-porous substrates, resulting to poor substrate wetting. This poor ink-substrate adhesion due to the water’s inherently high surface tension: non-porous substrates like polyethylene films have a surface energy of 28 – 32  mN/m, while water has a surface energy of 73  mN/m. Substrate wetting has been a main problem in the use of <b>water-based</b> <b>inks</b> for printing in non-porous substrates, and to achieve successful substrate wetting, the surface tension of the ink must be lower than the surface energy of the substrate to be printed on [3].|$|R
50|$|The Environmental Protection Agency {{has worked}} with the flexographic {{industry}} in the design of a project to help flexographic businesses, promoting <b>water-based</b> <b>inks</b> for their low power consumption, and UV curable ink systems, because they use less ink.|$|R
5000|$|Water-based {{roller ball}} ink {{is more likely}} to smudge than a ballpoint pen's {{oil-based}} ink because <b>water-based</b> <b>ink</b> dries more slowly than its counterpart. Also if one writes in a notebook, closing it before the ink dries can stain the opposite page. This can also prove a problem for left-handed writers or users of right-to-left scripts. Gel ink dries much more rapidly than liquid-ink, making it much more, but not completely, resistant to smudging.|$|E

50|$|Some users mix inks {{to create}} their own colours. Some {{combinations}} of inks may cause unexpected colour changes, even if the inks are from the same manufacturer. This is a result of chemical reactions between the different components. The colour of many dyes depends on pH, and some lose their colour entirely outside a certain pH range. Mixing inks may also alter the solubility of some dye components; for example, an alcohol-based ink may contain components that are insoluble in water, and these will precipitate or coagulate if the alcohol-based ink is mixed with a <b>water-based</b> <b>ink.</b>|$|E
50|$|Digital textile {{printing}} {{is often referred}} to as direct-to-garment printing, DTG printing, or digital garment printing. It is a process of printing on textiles and garments using specialized or modified inkjet technology. Inkjet printing on fabric is also possible with an inkjet printer by using fabric sheets with a removable paper backing. Today, major inkjet technology manufacturers can offer specialized products designed for direct printing on textiles, not only for sampling but also for bulk production. Since the early 1990s, inkjet technology and specially developed <b>water-based</b> <b>ink</b> (known as dye-sublimation or disperse direct ink) have made it possible to print directly onto polyester fabric. This is mainly related to visual communication in retail and brand promotion (flags, banners and other point of sales applications). Printing onto nylon and silk can be done by using an acid ink. Reactive ink is used for cellulose based fibers such as cotton and linen. Inkjet technology in digital {{textile printing}} allows for single pieces, mid-run production and even long-run alternatives to screen printed fabric.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With the {{advantages}} of no pollution and no poison, the <b>water-based</b> <b>ink,</b> as {{a new type of}} green packaging material, is especially applicable to the food, medicine and drink packaging. However, the traditional domestic <b>water-based</b> <b>ink,</b> featuring some disadvantages in the properties of stability, gloss and so on, increasingly evolves into an enormous obstacle to the widespread application of the packaging and the rapid development of the whole industry. In this paper, the polyurethane resin is adopted to replace the ordinary binder resin in the experiment of the <b>water-based</b> <b>ink,</b> and the gloss of the polyurethane <b>water-based</b> <b>ink</b> is also studied. It is shown that the gloss of <b>water-based</b> <b>ink</b> is influenced by the dispersion of pigment, water content and surface tension of <b>water-based</b> <b>ink</b> system, hydrotropic agent and some other factors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this contribution, {{structured}} latex particles with a poly(stryrene-butyl acrylate-methacrylate) {{core and}} a poly(butyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid-diacetone acrylamide (DAAM)) shell, {{which can be}} used as binders of <b>water-based</b> <b>ink,</b> were prepared by emulsion polymerization. The emulsion can cure in the course of film forming at ambient temperature through the reaction between DAAM and the adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to characterize the structures and study the properties of the latices. In addition, influences of DAAM monomer dosage and the mole ratio of DAAM to ADH on the mechanical properties of self-crosslinkable core-shell lattices were also discussed. It was found that the core-shell crosslinkable particles with a low glass transition temperature (Tg) core and a high Tg shell have better film properties and would be more applicable to binders of <b>water-based</b> <b>ink</b> for plastic film, in comparison with those particles with a high Tg core and a low Tg shell...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{water-based}} inks {{have been}} of more and more interest to the printing and ink industry, because of their environmental benefits. Compared with solvent-based inks, water-based inks have more complex formulations because of their higher surface tensions, lower drying speed, foaming problems, pH balance, and different rheological properties. The transition from solvent-based to waterborne inks has been facilitated by advances in both the chemistry and the printing technologies employed. With the new development in rheology modifiers and their increasing application in water-based gravure inks, a more complete investigation of their chemistry, thickening mechanism and effects on water-based gravure ink systems is necessary. This paper explores the significant effects of various rheology modifiers, including non-associative and associative thickeners, on the rheological properties of a water-based rotogravure ink system. Particular emphasis is given to thickening efficiency (viscosity profiles of each rheology modifier in a model system), pH stability, particle size, system compatibility, temperature stability, and printability on vinyl substrates. Wire-wound lab rods and a Moser Sheet-fed Gravure Proofing Machine were employed to produce printed samples for characterizing {{the performance of the}} formulated inks. The purpose of these investigations is to acquire a complete understanding of rheology modifiers ’ effects on the <b>water-based</b> <b>ink</b> system, as well as to help select appropriate rheology modifiers for <b>water-based</b> <b>ink</b> systems in order to achieve better print quality...|$|E
