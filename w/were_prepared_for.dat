5|$|The Second Avenue Subway was {{supposed}} to be the flagship project of the Program for Action. In a 1964 report, it was given top priority on a list of projects to be completed. Prior attempts to build the line had failed, and the city wished to have a Second Avenue subway line to alleviate overcrowding on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. Twenty-two blocks of tunnel were ultimately constructed, excluding seven blocks in the East Village that <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> tunneling operations, but never excavated.|$|E
5|$|Apparently formidable, the Libyan {{military}} disposition in Chad was {{marred by}} serious flaws. The Libyans <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> a war {{in which they would}} provide ground and air support to their Chadian allies, act as assault infantry, and provide reconnaissance. By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. Libyan garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who were fighting in a foreign country, and the structural disorganization of the Libyan army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's fear of a military coup against him. This fear led him to avoid the professionalization of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Bridges {{and other}} key points <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> {{demolition}} at short notice by preparing chambers filled with explosives. A Depth Charge Crater was a site in a road (usually at a junction) prepared with buried explosives that could be detonated to instantly form a deep crater as an anti-tank obstacle. The Canadian pipe mine (later known as the McNaughton Tube after General Andrew McNaughton) was a horizontally bored pipe packed with explosives– once in place this {{could be used to}} instantly ruin a road or runway. Prepared demolitions had the advantage of being undetectable from the air—the enemy could not take any precautions against them, or plot a route of attack around them.|$|E

5|$|Dunstan saw {{reform of}} the Legislative Council as an {{important}} goal, and later a prime achievement, of his Government. Labor, {{as a matter of}} party policy, wanted to see the Legislative Council abolished. Dunstan, seeing this as unfeasible in his term, set about to reform it instead. Two bills <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> Legislative Council reform; one to lower the voting age to 18 and introduce universal suffrage, and another to make councillors elected from a single statewide electorate under a system of proportional representation. The LCL initially blocked both bills, stating that it would only accept them if modifications were made to the second one. Changes were conceded; unlike the House of Assembly, voting would not be compulsory and the preference system was to be slightly altered. Once the amendments were made, the legislation was passed.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Let It Be... Naked, a reconceived {{version of}} the Let It Be album, with McCartney supervising production, was released.

5|$|Initial {{reactions}} to the approaching hurricane in the Yucatán Peninsula were regarded as calm by the United States media. Mexican officials declared an emergency alert by September 2, although they did not advise any evacuations. Meteorologists in the United States urged those living near the coast to move inland immediately. Fearing significant loss of life and property, the Red Cross began preparations for the approaching hurricane in Belize. The following day, the Mexican Army rushed to set up emergency operation centers and shelters in five cities. Mobile communication units and relief teams <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> deployment following the storm's passage. Many of the nearly 35,000residents {{in and around the}} city of Chetumal evacuated to higher ground.|$|E

5|$|Natural predators of the Puerto Rican amazon {{include the}} red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), the broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus), the {{peregrine}} falcon (Falco peregrinus) and the pearly-eyed thrasher (Margarops fuscatus). The thrasher invaded Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century {{and has been}} a problem for the parrot population since 1973; to combat this, specially designed deep nests <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> the parrots in subsequent years to prevent competition from the invaders. Introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera), the related Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis), black rats (Rattus rattus) and Indian mongooses (Herpestes javanicus) may compete for nesting cavities, and the latter two may eat eggs and chicks.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders {{decided to}} attack Damascus from the west, where {{orchards}} would {{provide them with}} a constant food supply. They arrived at Daraiya on 23 July. The following day, the Muslims <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> the attack and constantly attacked the army advancing through the orchards outside Damascus. The defenders had sought help from Saif ad-Din Ghazi I of Mosul and Nur ad-Din of Aleppo, who personally led an attack on the crusader camp. The crusaders were pushed back from the walls into the orchards, where they were prone to ambushes and guerrilla attacks.|$|E

5|$|A year later, in September 1911, Italy {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire. The two battleships and the ancient central battery ironclad —which had {{been built in the}} mid-1870s—had been on a summer training cruise since July, and so <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> the conflict. On 1 October, shortly after the outbreak of war, Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet was moored at Beirut. The following day, the fleet departed for Constantinople for repairs in preparation to engage the Italian fleet. Nevertheless, the bulk of the Ottoman fleet, including Barbaros Hayreddin, remained in port for the duration of the war. By the end of the war, Barbaros Hayreddin and her sister were in very poor condition. Their rangefinders and the ammunition hoists for their main battery guns had been removed, their telephones did not work, and the pipes for their pumps were badly rusted. Most of the watertight doors could not close, and the condensers remained problematic.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Kaiser Barbarossa and her sisters were brought out of reserve and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914. The ships <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> war very slowly, and they were not ready for service in the North Sea until the end of August. They were initially tasked with coastal defense, though they served in this capacity for a very short time. In mid-September, the V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic, under the command of Prince Heinrich. He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on Windau, but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan. Instead, the V Squadron was to carry the landing force, but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. Kaiser Barbarossa and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day, disembarked the landing force, and then proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties. Before the end of the year, the V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic.|$|E
5|$|In 1173 HenryII betrothed his {{youngest}} son, Prince John, to {{the daughter of}} Count Humbert, an influential lord in Provence. John had no land, {{but as part of}} the arrangement Henry promised him the castles of Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau. HenryII's eldest son, also called Henry, had been crowned King of England alongside his father but had no land of his own and was angered by the situation. His discontent grew and Henry the Young King demanded some of the land promised to him be handed over, claiming to have the support of the English barons and his father-in-law, King LouisVII of France. While the king was at Limoges he was informed of a conspiracy involving his wife and sons to overthrow him. Choosing to keep his eldest son by his side, HenryII set off north to Normandy, ensuring along the way that his castles in Aquitaine <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> war. En route they stayed at Chinon; under the cover of darkness Henry the Young King escaped and set off to Paris to join the court of LouisVII. Two of Henry the Young King's brothers, Richard and Geoffrey, joined him in rebellion along with the barons of France and some in England. War followed, lasting until 1174, and Chinon, Loudun, and Châtellerault were key to HenryII's defence.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{continued}} to make progress in the liberation of France, and on 4 August Hitler ordered a counter-offensive (Operation Lüttich) from Vire towards Avranches. The operation included LSSAH, Das Reich, 2nd, and 116th Panzer Divisions, with support from infantry and elements of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen under SS-Oberstgruppenführer Paul Hausser. These forces were to mount an offensive near Mortain and drive west through Avranches to the coast. The Allied forces <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> this offensive, and an air assault on the combined German units proved devastating. On 21 August, 50,000 German troops, including most of the LSSAH, were encircled by the Allies in the Falaise Pocket. Remnants of the LSSAH which escaped were withdrawn to Germany for refitting. Paris was liberated on 25 August, and {{the last of the}} German forces withdrew over the Seine by the end of August, ending the Normandy campaign.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Pondicherry was {{a colonial}} {{military}} {{operation in the}} early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars. Britain and France both controlled colonies on the Indian Subcontinent and when the French National Convention declared war on Britain on 1 February 1793, both sides <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> conflict in India. British India was centred on the principal ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta, administered by the East India Company. French India was governed from Pondicherry (modern Puducherry) on the Coromandel Coast. British forces in India were considerably stronger than the French, with the British Indian Army supported by British Army detachments and a Royal Navy squadron under Rear-Admiral William Cornwallis. Pondicherry's defenses were strong, but the garrison was too small to effectively man the walls, and although a French frigate squadron was stationed at the distant Île de France, it was unable to effectively protect the French Indian coast.|$|E
5|$|Upon the war's end, Mihail Kogălniceanu and Ion Brătianu {{headed the}} Romanian {{delegation}} to the Congress of Berlin. In this capacity, they protested Russia's offer to exchange the previously Ottoman-ruled Northern Dobruja for Budjak, a portion of southern Bessarabia that Romania had received under the 1856 Treaty of Paris. This came after months of tension between Romania and Russia, generated over the territorial issue and the Russian claim to be representing Romania at Berlin: Kogălniceanu's envoy (Eraclie Arion) had even threatened the Russians with a Romanian denunciation of their alliance, and 60,000 Romanian soldiers <b>were</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> Budjak's defense. The Conference's ultimate decision (Berlin Treaty) {{was in favor of}} Russia's proposal, largely due to support from Andrássy and William Henry Waddington, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs. Additional pressures came from Bismarck. The Russians themselves did register some setbacks {{by the end of the}} Conference. Their demands for Romania to allow indefinite military transit through Northern Dobruja were made ineffectual by the opposition of other European states, and Kogălniceanu was able to obtain the retrocession of Snake Island.|$|E
