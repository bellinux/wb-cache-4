5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward {{toward the center of}} the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force <b>with</b> <b>equal</b> upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E
5|$|Transforming a curve <b>with</b> <b>equal</b> normal speeds at {{all points}} {{has been called}} the grassfire transform. Curves evolved in this way will in general develop sharp corners, the trace of which forms the medial axis of the curve. A closely related curve {{evolution}} which moves straight segments of a polygonal curve at equal speeds but allows concave corners to move more quickly than unit speed instead forms a different type of topological skeleton of the given curve, its straight skeleton.|$|E

5|$|By definition, any two atoms with an {{identical}} number of protons in their nuclei {{belong to the}} same chemical element. Atoms <b>with</b> <b>equal</b> numbers of protons but a different number of neutrons are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons (hydrogen-1, by far the most common form, also called protium), one neutron (deuterium), two neutrons (tritium) and more than two neutrons. The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single proton element hydrogen up to the 118-proton element oganesson. All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive, although the radioactivity of element 83 (bismuth) is so slight as to be practically negligible.|$|E

5|$|For atoms {{with low}} atomic numbers, a nucleus {{that has more}} {{neutrons}} than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron–proton ratio is closer to one. However, as the atomic number increases, {{a higher proportion of}} neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei <b>with</b> <b>equal</b> proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium) and as Z increases, the neutron–proton ratio of stable isotopes increases. The stable isotope with the highest proton–neutron ratio is lead-208 (about 1.5).|$|E
