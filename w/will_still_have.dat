5|$|Although faster-than-light travel {{has been}} seriously {{considered}} by physicists such as Miguel Alcubierre, Tough speculates that the {{enormous amount of}} energy required to achieve such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> an advantage for various applications. 2013 research at NASA's Johnson Space Center, however, shows that faster-than-light travel with the Alcubierre drive requires dramatically less energy than previously thought, needing only about 1 metric ton of exotic mass-energy to move a spacecraft at 10 times the speed of light, in contrast to previous estimates that stated that only a Jupiter-mass object would contain sufficient energy to power a faster-than-light spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|While earlier cases {{expressed}} {{this stage}} of the test as a determination of whether a law is discriminatory, the Court of Appeal has warned against the confusing of the concepts of differentiation and discrimination. A differentiating law is one that draws distinctions between groups of people. A discriminatory law or executive act, on the other hand, is one that contravenes Article 12(1) and hence is unconstitutional. Therefore, the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory, as the other two stages <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> to be taken into consideration. If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure, it is a good law and the objection fails.|$|E

40|$|If {{there is}} no doubt that the {{tradition}} of the ancient theatre has transmitted to us something of its own experience, to the point that we name as tragedies some works from Shakespeare and Goethe and we take as tragic some moments of the Pasolini and Bergman movies as well, for example, how is it possible to talk about the death of the tragedy, about the rupture of the tragic impulse? At the same time, how is it possible that a world without gods, with an understanding of the action that conceives it leaded by an inner faculty that did not even existed in the 5 th century BC in Greece, the <b>will,</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> a place for something called tragedy? The solution to these questions depends on the history understanding that leads the researcher, thinker or collector who build them up. The difference is clear if we understand as opposite concepts transhistoricity – typical of the answer from Vernant and Naquet to these same questions – and intransmissibility, indicated by Hannah Arendt on the use of quotes...|$|R

25|$|A place cell {{is a type}} of {{pyramidal}} neuron within the hippocampus that becomes active when an animal enters a particular place in its environment; this place is known as the place field. A given place cell will have only one, or a few, place fields in a typical small laboratory environment, but more in a larger region. There is no apparent topography to the pattern of place fields, unlike other brain areas such as visual cortex—neighboring place cells are as likely to have nearby fields as distant ones. In a different environment, typically about half the place cells <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> place fields, but these will be in new places unrelated to their former locations.|$|E

25|$|Since the ICTR was {{established}} as {{an ad hoc}} international jurisdiction, the ICTR is scheduled to close {{by the end of}} 2014, after it completes trials by 2009 and appeals by 2010 or 2011. Initially, the U.N. Security Council established the ICTR in 1994 with an original mandate of four years without a fixed deadline and set on addressing the crimes committed during the Rwandan Genocide. As the years passed, it became apparent that the ICTR would exist long past its original mandate.

25|$|Beginners tend {{to point}} with the rod {{to where they}} want to throw, but the {{movement}} of the hand has to be a controlled speed-up and then come to an abrupt stop. The rod will then start to unfurl and the tip of the rod will reach a high speed in the required direction. The high speed of the rod tip toward the target gives the impulse to make the cast, the abrupt stop and retreat of the rod tip is essential for the formation of a loop. Experienced fishermen also improve the speed of the line leaving the rod tip by a technique called hauling, applying a quick fast pull with the hand holding the line. At the end of the cast when the line is stretched the line as a whole <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> speed and the fisherman can let some extra line through their fingers making a false throw, either forward or backward or to finish the cast and start fishing.|$|E

25|$|At {{this point}} Einstein brings into play the first screen {{as well and}} argues as follows: since the {{incident}} particles have velocities (practically) perpendicular to the screen S1, and since {{it is only the}} interaction with this screen that can cause a deflection from the original direction of propagation, by the law of conservation of impulse which implies that the sum of the impulses of two systems which interact is conserved, if the incident particle is deviated toward the top, the screen will recoil toward the bottom and vice versa. In realistic conditions the mass of the screen is so large that it will remain stationary, but, in principle, it is possible to measure even an infinitesimal recoil. If we imagine taking the measurement of the impulse of the screen in the direction X after every single particle has passed, we can know, {{from the fact that the}} screen will be found recoiled toward the top (bottom), whether the particle in question has been deviated toward the bottom or top, and therefore through which slit in S2 the particle has passed. But since the determination of the direction of the recoil of the screen after the particle has passed cannot influence the successive development of the process, we <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> an interference figure on the screenF. The interference takes place precisely because the state of the system is the superposition of two states whose wave functions are non-zero only near one of the two slits. On the other hand, if every particle passes through only the slit b or the slit c, then the set of systems is the statistical mixture of the two states, which means that interference is not possible. If Einstein is correct, then there is a violation of the principle of indeterminacy.|$|E
