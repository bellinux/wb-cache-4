5|$|Logging {{remained}} {{a mainstay of}} industry in Missoula with the groundbreaking of the Hoerner-Waldorf pulp mill in 1956, which resulted in protests over the resultant air pollution. An article in Life magazine thirteen years later speaks of Missoulians sometimes needing to drive with headlights on during the day to navigate through the smog. In 1979, still almost 40% of the county's labor income came from the <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> products sector. The lumber industry was hit hard by the recession of the early 1980s, and Missoula's economy began to diversify. By the early 1990s, the disappearance {{of many of the}} region's log yards, along with legislation, had helped clean the skies dramatically.|$|E
5|$|In Britain and Australia, early {{memorials}} {{were closely}} linked to the need to promote military recruitment and the state had an ambivalent attitude towards the informal memorials that emerged during the conflict. In Britain, stone memorials to the war began to be erected in towns and villages from 1915 onwards; some of these were given out by the state as rewards to communities for meeting military recruitment targets. In Australia, the existing memorials to mark the Boer War were used initially for commemorative ceremonies intended to increase military recruitment. As casualties increased, rolls of honour listing the dead began to be displayed in Britain and honour tablets with the names of those who had enlisted were put up inside Australian buildings: Australia used these lists to apply moral pressure on those who were not yet joined up. Informal memorials began to multiply as the war progressed. Local Australian groups erected small monuments, such as drinking fountains and stone pillars, {{to the point where the}} government became concerned about the expenditure on them and passed a law in 1916 to control their numbers. In Britain, some Anglican church leaders began to create street war shrines to the dead. These cheap, local memorials were mainly constructed in working class districts, often built from <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper,</b> and were used for holding short services in honour of the dead and to hold donations of flowers. They were criticised, however, as promoting Catholic ritualism. Official support for the shrines only came after a national newspaper campaign, efforts by the Lord Mayor of London and a well-publicised visit from Queen Mary to a shrine, and standardised stone shrines then began to replace the earlier, temporary versions.|$|E

25|$|To {{maintain}} the country's comparative advantage in forest products, Finnish authorities moved to raise lumber output toward the country's ecological limits. In 1984 the government published the Forest 2000 plan, {{drawn up by}} the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The plan aimed at increasing forest harvests by about 3 percent per year, while conserving forestland for recreation and other uses. It also called for enlarging the average size of private forest holdings, increasing the area used for forests, and extending forest cultivation and thinning. If successful, the plan would {{make it possible to}} raise wood deliveries by roughly one-third {{by the end of the}} twentieth century. Finnish officials believed that such growth was necessary if Finland was to maintain its share in world markets for <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> products.|$|E

25|$|The use of fire {{in warfare}} {{has a long}} history. Fire was the basis of all early thermal weapons. Homer {{detailed}} the use of fire by Greek soldiers who hid in a wooden horse to burn Troy during the Trojan war. Later the Byzantine fleet used Greek fire to attack ships and men. In the First World War, the first modern flamethrowers were used by infantry, and were successfully mounted on armoured vehicles in the Second World War. In the latter war, incendiary bombs were used by Axis and Allies alike, notably on Tokyo, Rotterdam, London, Hamburg and, notoriously, at Dresden; in the latter two cases firestorms were deliberately caused in which a ring of fire surrounding each city was drawn inward by an updraft caused by a central cluster of fires. The United States Army Air Force also extensively used incendiaries against Japanese targets in the latter months of the war, devastating entire cities constructed primarily of <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> houses. The use of napalm was employed in July 1944, {{towards the end of}} the Second World War; although its use did not gain public attention until the Vietnam War. Molotov cocktails were also used.|$|E

2500|$|After [...] {{established}} the shogunate in Edo, daimyo (vassal lords) and hatamoto (senior retainers) residences were built around Edo Castle and housed {{a large number}} of samurai. Merchants and artisans who supported the life of the samurai soon migrated to Edo in flocks and resulted in a population boom. The population of Edo grew from roughly 400,000 in 1640 (Kan'ei 17) to around 800,000 in 1693 (Genroku 6), and grew to about 1,100,000 by 1721 (Kyōhō 6). In contrast to the vast residential areas of the samurai, chōnin were confined to much smaller areas. The growing population pushed their population density to an extremely high degree. Their residences were densely arranged in compact areas, and shabby [...] were common. [...] The per capita living space, kitchen and closet included, was usually the size of six tatami mats. On top of that, the <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> construction materials easily became fuel for a fire. All these conditions naturally led to a high possibility of fire accidents.|$|E
40|$|Paper {{is one of}} {{the most}} common mass {{products}} used nowadays. Present paper consumption has reached almost 400 million metric tons globally. Such a huge volume of production requires stable and continuous supply of raw materials in the form of <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> recovered <b>paper.</b> This article presents the current situation in the field of raw materials supply for the paper industry. Firstly it needs to be underlined that in the 21 st century recovered paper has already become as equally an important raw material as <b>wood,</b> <b>and</b> soon the production of paper from secondary fibre pulps may match the volume of production of paper from virgin pulps. Moreover a detailed insight into future challenges and possibilities of broadening the raw materials base for the production of paper is also given. Finally the best possible methods to ensure a constant supply of <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> recovered <b>paper</b> for industry are also featured...|$|R
