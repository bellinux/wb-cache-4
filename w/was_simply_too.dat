5|$|Mother Gothel {{has been}} mostly well {{received}} by film critics, who enjoyed the character's humor, complexity, charisma and showmanship, dubbing her a scene stealer, while praising Murphy's performance enthusiastically. However, some critics felt that Gothel <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> passive – a weaker, less intimidating Disney villainess than Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty (1959) and Cruella de Vil from One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961).|$|E
5|$|During the project's {{development}} phase, the siting {{and size}} of the Nike-X bases became a major complaint of smaller cities. Originally intended to protect only the largest urban areas, Nike-X was designed to be built at a very large size with many missiles controlled by an expensive computer and radar network. Smaller sites were to be left undefended in the original Nike-X concept since the system <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> expensive to build with only a few interceptors. These cities complained that they were not only being left open to attack, but that their lack of defenses might make them primary targets. This led to a series of studies on the Small City Defense (SCD) concept. By 1964 SCD had become part of the baseline Nike-X deployment plans, with every major city being provided some level of defensive system.|$|E
5|$|The route {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} in the modern history of the race, with substantial criticism that it <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> hard for a three-week-long race. Of the seven stages categorized as 'high mountain', six had summit arrivals, highlighted by the three stages before the second rest day ending at Grossglockner in Austria, the exceptionally steep Monte Zoncolan, and a tall and steep peak near the Fascia Valley in Gardeccia. There was also, for the fifth consecutive Giro, a climbing time trial, this one to the Nevegal. Of the race's 18 mass-start stages, only three ended with the majority of the field together at the front of the race.|$|E

Some states appeared unlikely ever to approve women's suffrage, {{in some cases}} because state laws made constitutional revision extremely difficult, and in others, especially in the Deep South, because opposition <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> strong.|$|E
25|$|On April 14, 2001, Hopkins won a {{unanimous}} decision over WBC champion Keith Holmes in New York City. Trinidad, however, knocked out Middleweight mainstay William Joppy in an impressive five rounds.

25|$|Using two {{trawlers}} {{to operate}} one trawl net. Both trawlers would sail in line astern formation; the first would fish {{while the second}} would attempt to fend off Icelandic vessels. Unfortunately, this not only {{cut the number of}} vessels engaged in fishing in half: it was also ineffective against Icelandic vessels, as the high standard of seamanship required to steer a heavy, unwieldy trawler in tight formation in rough Atlantic seas <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> much for a civilian fisherman.|$|E

25|$|The raid on Babylon {{could not}} have been {{intended}} to exercise sovereignty over the region; it <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> far from Anatolia and the Hittites' center of power. It is thought, however, that the raid on Babylon brought an end to the Amorite dynasty of Hammurabi and allowed the Kassites to take power, and so might have arisen from an alliance with the Kassites or an attempt to curry favor with them. It might also be that Mursili undertook the long-distance attack for personal motives, namely as a way to outdo the military exploits of his predecessor, Hattusili I.|$|E
25|$|The legal code of Moroland was reformed. Disputes between Moros and non-Christians {{had been}} left to Moro laws and customs, with Philippine laws only {{applying}} to disputes with Christians. This led to a double standard, with a Moro who killed a Christian facing a stiff prison sentence, but with a Moro who killed another Moro facing only a maximum fine of 150 pesos. Wood attempted to codify Moro law, but there <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> much variance in laws and customs between the different tribes and even between neighboring cottas. Wood placed the Moros underneath the Philippine criminal code, but actual enforcement of this proved difficult.|$|E
25|$|While in the 18th {{century the}} fact that one of its House of Lords {{entrance}} opened directly onto a street caused little worry, in the Ireland of 1922 with a civil war raging, the building <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> insecure {{to be used as a}} modern-day parliament building. While the House of Commons entrance was surrounded by railings, it offered only minimal parking space and minimal security from attack, and practically no means of escape in the event of an attack. In contrast Leinster House was located well in from the streets that surrounded it, had considerable parking potential and was far more secure in the event of an anti-treaty republican attack on the Free State Dáil and Seanad.|$|E

25|$|The {{chairman}} of the company, J. W. Pattinson, died in April 1931, after serving as chairman for 24 years. He was replaced by J. C. Kidd, another long-standing director, and Captain Borlase's son-in-law. He carefully analysed {{the decline in the}} company's profitability, concluding that the price of lead <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> low. Operations were gradually scaled down, and a loss of £1,635 was made in the year to March 1933. The amount of proven ore reserves was still increasing, but the company was unable to finance the exploitation of new ground. Knowing the mine could be made profitable, the manager made a last attempt, in February 1934, to persuade the board of directors to inject enough capital to make Greenside a large-scale producer. No action was taken on his report and the company went into liquidation in March 1935.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-eighties {{the stock}} of {{purebred}} mares had dwindled to just a handful, though there were some mares only {{a generation or two}} removed. In 1983 a group of supporters formed a special breed association {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Weser-Ems Studbook, approving stallions that were half-Hanoverian, half-Ostfriesen or Alt-Oldenburg. However, as the mares themselves were typically only halfbred, the foals did not have the desired type, and furthermore the genepool <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> small. To replenish it, the breeders looked to the studs where Ostfriesen/Alt-Oldenburger stallions had stood for generations, picking up a few horses here and there. More horses came from greater strongholds: Silesian Heavy Warmbloods of Poland, the Danish Oldenbourgs, and the Groningen horse of the Netherlands. But the efforts of Dr. Herta Steiner, Moritzburg State Stud Equerry, were the keystone to saving the breed. She had championed for the last remaining heavy warmbloods in Saxony and Thuringia. Soon the old type was revived.|$|E
25|$|Falk et al. (2007) offered further {{evidence}} that the claims of a microcephalic H.sapiens were not credible. Virtual endocasts of an additional nine microcephalic brains and ten normal human brains were examined, and {{it was found that}} the floresiensis skulls are similar in shape to normal human brains, yet have unique features which are consistent with what one would expect in a new species. The frontal and temporal lobes of the floresiensis brain were found to be highly developed, in strong contrast to the microcephalic brain, and advanced in ways different from modern human brains. This finding also answered past criticisms that the floresiensis brain <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> small to be capable of the intelligence required for the members of H.floresiensis to create the tools found in their proximity. Falk et al. (2007) conclude that the onus is now upon the critics that continue to claim microcephaly to produce a brain of a microcephalic that bears resemblance to the floresiensis brain.|$|E

50|$|Executive pay {{formulas}} in the US {{sometimes are}} criticized on grounds `morality` and `fairness`—that they <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> large—and sometimes on pragmatic grounds—that the packages are {{not designed to}} give executives incentive to perform and maximize shareholder value.|$|R
25|$|In the one-day series again Pakistan in the UAE, BBC Sport {{commentator}} Jonathan Agnew {{stated that}} Hales' technique <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> fallible outside off stump, planting his front foot on middle stump {{and playing with}} a bat two feet away from his body. Agnew surmised that whilst in 20 and 50 over cricket with no slips Hales {{could get away with}} this issue, in test cricket he could not. In the first three tests in South Africa, Hales' technique was cruelly exposed by their fast-bowling attack. In the first Tests he made scores of 10 and 26, although England {{went on to win the}} game by 241 runs. In a high scoring second Test, Hales made 60 in the first innings but was dismissed for just five in the second. In the third Test, he was out for one in the first innings as England made 323. He was out for 18 in the second innings, as England went onto secure a seven wicket victory. In the final match of the series, he again struggled, and after making 15 in the first innings, he was out for just one in the second innings as England were bowled out for just 101. Despite the heavy defeat, England won the series 2-1.|$|E
25|$|Brazil vs Uruguay 1970 – strike package: Jairzinho – Pelé – Tostão. The example below, {{is drawn}} {{from one of the}} most famous strike teams in World Cup history- Pelé, Tostão and Jairzinho. This goal, against Uruguay in the 1970 semi-final, captures the power of the move. The fast winger Jairzinho set the stage- {{dribbling}} down the right flank before finding Pelé ahead. Tightly marked, and with his back to the goal, Pelé immediately played a subtle pass to Tostão. The Brazilian center-forward drew the defence to him with a short dribble before finding Jairzinho again on the wing. This exchange of passes gave Jairzinho a lead on other defenders and he made the most of it – accelerating down the wing, selling a dummy (letting the ball run after pretending to stop and play it) on Uruguayan defender Matosas, and muscling him aside as he approached the enemy goal. Uruguayan keeper Mazurkiewicz came off his line but it <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> late, as Jairzinho slotted the ball into the net. Of note in this sequence is the attacking space created by the tight exchanges between Jairzinho, Pelé, and Tostão. Even the Uruguayans, playing one of the most densely packed, solid defences seen in a World Cup could not stop it. Jairzinho is surrounded by opposing defenders when the sequence starts, but at the end, he only has one to deal with. Also of note is the unselfish passing of Brazilian striker Tostão, with his skill creating countless openings for his teammates throughout the 1970 tournament.|$|E
25|$|Despite taking pole {{position}} {{in the first two}} rounds, mechanical problems halted his chances of victory. He spun numerous times in South Africa, and at Monaco, his engine blew up at the start, and the win went to his teammate Denny Hulme. At the Dutch Grand Prix, he scored his first podium of the season, with second place, behind Scotsman Jim Clark. He retired in the Belgian Grand Prix with another blown engine. He fixed this by winning the French Grand Prix at the Bugatti Circuit in Le Mans. He came fourth at the British Grand Prix, behind Chris Amon, his teammate Hulme, and Clark. At the German Grand Prix, he had a huge battle with Amon, and Brabham eventually finished ahead of the New Zealander, by only half a second. Hulme was the winner. At the first ever Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park, he took a huge win, ahead of Hulme, in cold and rainy conditions. At the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Brabham had to finish second, only a few car lengths behind John Surtees, who took his last GP win. Hulme retired from the race, cutting the gap to 3 points between the two, as the circus headed for the United States, at Watkins Glen for the United States Grand Prix. Brabham outqualified his teammate, and finished fifth in the race, and with Hulme on the podium, this meant the championship chances were looking slim for Black Jack, as the circus went to Mexico for the championship deciding and final race of the season. Once again, Black Jack outqualified his teammate, and needed to win, with Hulme fifth or lower. But Jim Clark <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> fast during the whole weekend, and dominated the race from pole to win, with Brabham finishing over 1 minute and 25 seconds behind. Hulme finished third, and so the New Zealander won the championship, while Brabham settled for second place. The team secured the Constructors' Championship, with 67 total points scored, and 23 points ahead of Lotus which scored a total of 44 points.|$|E

50|$|The {{communist}} victory insured further {{isolation of}} the nationalist strongholds {{along the coast of}} Zhejiang, such as Dachen Archipelago and Yijiangshan Islands, and another nationalist threat to the vital coastal sea lines of communication was eliminated.

500|$|Upon {{viewing the}} {{proposed}} expanded {{version of the}} film, I felt that the cut <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> long and the pacing completely thrown off.

I chose to go in and recut that proposed long version into a more streamlined and polished alternate version of the film. For marketing purposes, this version is being called [...] "The Director's Cut." ...|$|E
500|$|Minas Geraes was modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard from June 1931 to 1938, while São Paulo led a {{naval force}} {{that broke the}} naval {{blockade}} of Santos during the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932.
