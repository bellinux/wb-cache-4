5|$|After {{agreement}} {{from the}} Cardiff Athletic Club, the freehold {{of the south}} ground was transferred solely to the WRU in July 1968. Work could then begin on the new National Stadium. Glamorgan County Cricket Club <b>would</b> <b>move</b> to Sophia Gardens and the cricket ground to the north would be demolished and a new rugby union stadium built for Cardiff RFC, who <b>would</b> <b>move</b> {{out of the south}} ground, allowing the National Stadium to be built, for the sole use of the national rugby union team.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire {{formerly}} {{housed the}} U.S. headquarters of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. In 2003 Takeda {{announced that it}} <b>would</b> <b>move</b> its headquarters, {{which at the time}} housed 1,600 employees, to Deerfield, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 {{review of}} Asian nuthatches {{suggested}} {{that there are still}} unresolved problems in nuthatch taxonomy and proposed splitting the genus Sitta. This suggestion <b>would</b> <b>move</b> the red- and yellow-billed south Asian species (velvet-fronted, yellow-billed and sulphur-billed nuthatches) to a new genus, create a third genus for the blue nuthatch, and possibly a fourth for the beautiful nuthatch.|$|E

5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for compactification is {{to consider}} a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, {{it appears to have}} only one dimension, its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it <b>would</b> <b>move</b> in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Despite his low {{score in}} the {{preceding}} match against Middlesex, Harvey was called into the team for the Fourth Test at Headingley {{at the expense of}} Barnes. The selectors had overlooked Brown as a replacement for Barnes's opening position. Instead, vice-captain Hassett <b>would</b> <b>move</b> from the middle-order to accompany Morris {{at the top of the}} innings, while Harvey would slot into the middle-order.|$|E
5|$|Following President Obama's {{announcement}} that the United States <b>would</b> <b>move</b> towards normalizing relations with Cuba, Pritzker traveled to Cuba. Although Obama's {{change in policy}} did not end the U.S. trade embargo, since ending the embargo required an act of Congress, Pritzker met with Cuban trade ministers and other officials to discuss the changing {{relationship between the two}} countries and {{to lay the groundwork for}} more economic involvement.|$|E

50|$|In {{hopes of}} getting a better signal, WSUN-TV tried to swap {{frequencies}} with Tampa Bay's new educational television station, WEDU, in the late 1950s. Under the proposed deal, WSUN-TV <b>would</b> have <b>moved</b> to channel 3, while WEDU <b>would</b> have <b>moved</b> to channel 38 and kept WSUN-TV's old equipment. However, WEDU turned down this proposal.|$|R
5|$|Furious {{with the}} marriage, Babli's family asked for {{intervention}} {{from the local}} khap panchayat, which annulled the marriage. The khap also announced a social boycott on Manoj's family. Anyone who kept ties with them would be fined ₨25,000. Ompati tried to persuade her family that Babli did nothing dishonourable and that she and Manoj <b>would</b> <b>move</b> back home soon.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, the United States Bureau of Reclamation chief design engineer, John L. Savage, {{surveyed}} {{the area and}} drew up a dam proposal for the 'Yangtze River Project'. Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the U.S. for training. The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships; the ships <b>would</b> <b>move</b> into locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes with cables <b>would</b> <b>move</b> the ships from one lock to the next. In the case of smaller water craft, groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency. It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river {{above and below the}} dam too great for alternative methods. Some exploration, survey, economic study, and design work was done, but the government, {{in the midst of the}} Chinese Civil War, halted work in 1947.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 reports emerged that, {{as part of}} {{the plans}} for the renewal of its Royal Charter, the BBC was {{considering}} moving whole channels or strands of production from London to Manchester. Early discussions involved a plan where the BBC <b>would</b> <b>move</b> to a new media village proposed by Granada Television at its Bonded Warehouse site at Granada Studios in the city.|$|E

[...] The Cycling hub would have been in Madison, Wisconsin.|$|R
50|$|A {{compromise}} {{was agreed}} upon where the Ladd Carriage House <b>would</b> be <b>moved</b> temporarily while a new garage would be dug out, then the building <b>would</b> be <b>moved</b> {{back onto the}} lot. The plans for the condo tower were scaled back so that the tower's footprint only took up half the block, not three-quarters of it.|$|R

5|$|Near 4:00 PM, with {{fourteen}} batteries {{destroyed and}} an hour left until dark, Ivry decided to call off the operation, assuming the optimal result had been achieved and that the Syrians <b>would</b> <b>move</b> more SAMs into place the next day. The operation was stopped shortly after 4:00 PM. Colonel Aviem Sella, {{a member of the}} operation staff, later said that Sharon severely criticized that decision.|$|E
5|$|On April 30, 2008, the FTA {{reversed}} the earlier decision and approved the above-ground project, {{saying that it}} met standards for cost efficiency, construction and ridership, moving it closer to receiving the $900 million in federal funding. Officials told The Washington Post that the project <b>would</b> <b>move</b> into the final design stage. The FTA approved funding for the project on December 4, 2008.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{equations}} {{of general relativity}} are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, <b>would</b> <b>move</b> on a trajectory which {{is determined by the}} Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.|$|E
5|$|The MTR Corporation {{eventually}} {{decided to}} adopt more advanced technologies, and in 1993 {{announced that it}} <b>would</b> <b>move</b> towards using contactless smartcards.

5|$|There was inevitably a {{slowdown}} in the pace of military operations, as Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah <b>would</b> <b>move</b> slowly and steadily and was a more cautious commander. The conquest of Syria continued under his Generalship and, Abu Ubaidah being an admirer of Khalid, gave him command of the cavalry and used him as a military advisor.|$|E

5|$|A {{native of}} {{what would become the}} {{province}} of Ontario, May moved to Manitoba soon after completing education in his hometown. In Manitoba, he would take to briefly farming, before entering into the construction industry, which he would establish prominence in. After doing work for the railway, he <b>would</b> <b>move</b> to Winnipeg where he would join a contracting firm and become involved in the construction of many buildings. After moving west and living briefly in Carberry, Manitoba, May came to Edmonton in 1902.|$|E
5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into the front line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would {{be taken to the}} forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition, {{and the manner in which}} they were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group <b>would</b> <b>move</b> forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions <b>would</b> <b>move</b> into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E
