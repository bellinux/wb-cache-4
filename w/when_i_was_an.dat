"My career {{could be}} divided up into two sections: the first being <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> out-and-out fast bowler and played for England when I {{probably}} {{should not have}} done; and the second being when I slowed down a bit, learned how to swing the ball and did not play for England when I probably should have done. His final Test was only twelve months after his England debut, and his first and last ODIs were played {{less than a month}} apart. Cricket commentator Colin Bateman opined, [...] "his fleeting taste of Test cricket should have been added to in 1987 and 1988 when he was the most consistent fast bowler in the country, taking 194 wickets, but in 1989, when England were desperate for pace bowlers, his omission amounted to wanton neglect by a regime which questioned his desire". In 1988, when Agnew was selected as a Cricketer of the Year, Wisden recorded this verdict on the contrariness of Agnew's Test career: [...] "Asked about Agnew's omission, the chairman of selectors, P. B. H. May, expressed concern about his fitness – rather a baffling statement to make about someone who bowled more overs than any other fast bowler in the Championship." ...|$|E

In his early teens, Ice Cube developed an interest in hip hop music, and began writing raps in Los Angeles George Washington Preparatory High School's typewriting class. Jackson penned his first rap song in the ninth grade after a friend, whom Jackson names [...] "Kiddo", challenged him to write a song during a typewriting class. He claims Kiddo lost the challenge. On the origins of his rapper name, Ice Cube says that it came from his older brother. He is quoted as saying [...] "He threatened to slam me into a freezer and pull me out <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> ice cube.
