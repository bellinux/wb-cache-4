5|$|Brown {{has said}} the rescue efforts of Army National Guard during the Northeastern United States {{blizzard}} of 1978 impressed him. He joined the Massachusetts Army National Guard when he was 19, receiving his basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and attending Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) classes at the campus of Northeastern University. He was trained in infantry, quartermaster, and airborne duties, and in 1994 he joined the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG). He {{was active in the}} Guard for 35 years rising to the rank of colonel. As the Army National Guard's head defense attorney in New England, Brown defended Guard members who had disciplinary difficulties such as positive drug tests, and provided estate planning and real estate advice to those who were about to deploy to <b>war</b> <b>zones.</b> He spent ten days to two weeks with the Guard in Kazakhstan and a week in Paraguay.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} call-up of reservists to man the {{garrison}} artillery, the commanding {{officers of the}} other militia units were directed to begin preparations to raise an infantry division and a light horse division for home defence tasks. By the end of August 1914 the Government had judged that a force of this size was unnecessary given that Australia was distant from the <b>war</b> <b>zones.</b> Instead, {{it was decided to}} maintain {{only a small number of}} infantry battalions and light horse regiments on active duty at any one time. By the end of 1914 the home defence force comprised 100,000 reservists, of whom 56,000 were members of the Citizen Forces and 51,000 were rifle club volunteers. Despite fears of sabotage and uprisings by German-Australians, no domestic threat eventuated. From 1915, only skeleton garrisons were maintained at coastal forts, but the personnel manning them were forbidden to enlist in the AIF. This ban was lifted in April 1915 but the presence of a German commerce raider in Australian waters caused a mobilisation from February to April 1916, while another occurred in April 1918 for the same reason. In June 1918, 9,215 home service troops were on active duty in Australia, alongside 2,476 regular soldiers. Up to 50,000 militiamen enlisted in the AIF during the war.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 2000s the Caribous were {{becoming}} difficult to maintain, and {{were no longer}} capable of operating in <b>war</b> <b>zones</b> as they lacked electronic warfare systems {{and other forms of}} self-protection. As a result, it was decided in late 2008 to retire the aircraft and replace them with Beechcraft King Air 350s on an interim basis until another tactical transport entered service. The Caribous were gradually retired from May 2009, the last leaving service on 27 November that year when A4-140 was flown to Canberra and handed over to the Australian War Memorial for preservation. By the time the aircraft were retired, No. 38 Squadron had been operating Caribous for 45 years. Three King Air 350s were transferred to No. 38 Squadron from the Army's 173rd Surveillance Squadron on 20 November 2009, and deliveries of a further five newly built aircraft were completed in July 2010. At least one of the Army aircraft {{is believed to have been}} fitted with ground surveillance sensors, and this capacity was retained after it was transferred to the Air Force. No. 38 Squadron's King Airs were initially operated by Army personnel, who were given the choice of transferring to the RAAF or converting to helicopters at the end of their posting. The other No. 38 pilots were converted to the type at the Army's Oakey Army Aviation Centre, but the squadron began conducting its own conversion courses after the second batch of five aircraft were delivered.|$|E

40|$|Exposure to <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> {{stressors}} is common, {{yet only}} a minority of soldiers experience clinically meaningful disturbance in psychological function. Identification of biomarkers that predict vulnerability to <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> stressors is critical for developing more effective treatment and prevention strategies not only in soldiers but also in civilians who are exposed to trauma. We investigated the role of the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5 -HTTLPR) genotype in predicting the emergence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive and anxiety symptoms as a function of <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> stressors. A prospective cohort of 133 U. S. Army soldiers with no prior history of deployment to a <b>war</b> <b>zone,</b> who were scheduled to deploy to Iraq, was recruited. Multilevel regression models were used to investigate associations between 5 -HTTLPR genotype, level of <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> stressors, and reported symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety while deployed to Iraq. Level of <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> stressors was associated with symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety. Consistent with its effects on stress responsiveness, 5 -HTTLPR genotype moderated the relationship between level of <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> stressors and symptoms of emotional disturbance. Specifically, soldiers carrying one or two low functioning alleles (S or LG) reported heightened symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety in response to increased levels of exposure to <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> stressors, relative to soldiers homozygous for the high functioning allele (LA). These data suggest that 5 -HTTLPR genotype moderates individual sensitivity to <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> stressors and the expression of emotional disturbance including PTSD symptoms. Replication of this association along with identification of other genetic moderators of risk can inform the development of biomarkers that can predict relative resilience vs. vulnerability to stress...|$|R
