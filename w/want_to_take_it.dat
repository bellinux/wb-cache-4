There's always been trouble about the licence and if you dropped your guard you could bet our bottom dollar there'd be plenty of people who'd <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> away. The licence fee is the basis on which the BBC is based and if you destroy it, broadcasting... becomes a wasteland.|$|E

[...] He also announced plans for new reissues of the three Experience albums: [...] "Everything in the present catalogue is a budget release... They're all 25-year-old packages. [...] I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> high-level... with all these new elements". [...] Along with new artwork and liner notes, the MCA reissue was remastered with only one track selection and order for both the European and America markets. [...] The 17-track CD included the first three Experience British singles (both A-sides and B-sides), followed by the 11 songs as they appeared on the Track/Polydor UK album release.|$|E

My first thought would be, 'Maybe I could call her up, maybe I {{could get on}} that record.' The most obvious [...] is it's neither one of our records. It's not like you made an {{original}} idea. She's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. We go to sample {{the same thing and}} my record came out first. I'm sorry. What can I do?" [...] He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Eurogamer, Chahi emphasised that the developers tried initially to avoid including overt religious elements in the game. Tribal worship, totems, and animal-shaped monuments are examples of the quasi-religious characters of From Dust. Chahi explained that, during one mission, the player would physically divide an ocean in order to assist their tribe in crossing it and so forth. He indicated that Ubisoft Montpellier were reluctant: [...] "we didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> in this direction", but the [...] "game kept pushing us back to it". When asked {{the meaning of the}} game's title, Bunier remarked that [...] "it's just another universe, another place, something people create from dust". Separately, Chahi commented that the game centered on the fragility of life and brevity of humankind.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "No Russian" [...] was {{conceived}} {{during the initial}} brainstorming sessions for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 plot. The developers at Infinity Ward wanted to discuss how terrorists operate in the modern era, and sought to create an unimaginable, albeit plausible scenario that the player would feel uncomfortable in. Lead writer Jesse Stern noted that despite the grim subject matter, people instinctively {{want to know what}} it is like to experience these attacks, and cited documentaries about the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the Columbine High School massacre as evidence. According to Stern: [...] "These are human beings who perpetrate these acts, so you don't really want to turn a blind eye to it. You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> apart and figure out how that happened and what, if anything, can be done to prevent it. Ultimately, our intention was to put you as close as possible to atrocity." ...|$|E

Nelly also earned nominations for Album of the Year and Best Rap Album for the album Nellyville as well as Record of the Year and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for the song [...] "Dilemma" [...] (featuring Kelly Rowland), for a total five. Regarding his nominations, Nelly commented: [...] "It's always good to be nominated, especially for something {{as big as the}} Grammys. Just the recognition itself is an award. But you want that little gold record player. You just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> home." [...] The award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance was presented to Nelly at Madison Square Garden in New York City, though not broadcast on television. His performances of [...] "Hot in Herre" [...] and [...] "Dilemma" [...] alongside Rowland at the awards ceremony included pyrotechnics. In addition, Nelly received the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.|$|E

2500|$|The {{notion of}} levels of {{decision}} {{is presented in}} a different manner by Frankfurt. Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the [...] "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) {{to the effect that}} one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are [...] "wanton addicts", [...] "unwilling addicts" [...] and [...] "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

The minister also reminded that even if Malaysia is seen as an attractive country for the refugees to taking up the jobs that locals did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> due to dangerous, dirty or demeaning nature, both the refugees and the migrant workers should not just take the law into their own hands when in Malaysia.

We were killing ourselves as it was with the work, and David was insisting that we take lessons. He was also upset about the publishing thing, and didn't think people were taking care of business, and he became dissatisfied with everything from photography to the management.
