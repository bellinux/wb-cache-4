Hoffman was already familiar with the play and appreciated the opportunity {{to bring it to}} the screen; in preparing for the role, he talked extensively to a priest <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> the era. The film had a mixed reception, with some critics such as Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian suspicious of it as Oscar bait, but Hoffman gained second consecutive Best Supporting Actor nominations at the Oscars, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes, and was also nominated by the Screen Actors Guild.|$|E

25|$|Scholar Lü Liuliang (1629–1683), <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> the {{transition}} between the Ming and the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, refused {{to serve the}} new dynasty because he claimed that upholding the difference between Huaxia and the Yi {{was more important than}} respecting the righteous bond between minister (臣) and sovereign (君王). In 1728, failed Imperial examination candidate Zeng Jing (曾靜), influenced by Lü's works, called for the overthrow of the Manchu regime. The Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1723–1735), whom Zeng accused of ten major crimes, took this event as an opportunity to educate the Qing's Chinese subjects. In a series of discussions with Zeng Jing, the emperor proclaimed that Chinese were not inherently superior to the barbarians. To justify his statements, he declared that King Wen, the sage king and the founder of the Zhou dynasty, was of Western Yi origin, but this did not hurt his greatness.|$|E

Salinger allowed that [...] "the few men <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> Bloody Mortain, a battle in which her father fought, were left with much to sicken them, body and soul", but she also painted a picture of her father as a man immensely proud of his service record, maintaining his military haircut and service jacket, and moving about his compound (and town) in an old Jeep.|$|E

Shumaker and Saffel contend that the Sci-Fi Dine-In provides a reasonable compromise when vegetarians and non-vegetarians are looking to eat together, {{and that it is}} also suitable for both large and small families with young children. The restaurant tends to be popular with children, and it is common for people <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> the 1950s to enjoy the restaurant for its nostalgia value. Paul Schultz of the Daily News writes, [...] "Anyone who is a fan of trashy sci-fi movies of the 1950s should check [...] out".

500|$|Description of the Western Isles of Scotland is {{the oldest}} known account of the Hebrides and the Islands of the Clyde, two chains of islands off {{the west coast of}} Scotland. The author was Donald Monro, a clergyman who used the title of [...] "Dean of the Isles" [...] and <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> the Scottish Reformation. Monro wrote the {{original}} manuscript in 1549, although it was not published in any form until 1582 and was not widely available to the public in its original form until 1774. A more complete version, based on a late 17th-century manuscript written by Sir Robert Sibbald, was first published as late as 1961. Monro wrote in Scots and some of the descriptions are difficult for modern readers to render into English. Although Monro was criticised for publishing folklore and for omitting detail about the affairs of the churches in his diocese, Monro's Description is a valuable historical account and has reappeared in part or in whole in numerous publications, remaining {{one of the most widely}} quoted publications about the western islands of Scotland.|$|E

[...] The kinderwhore look consisted of torn, ripped tight or low-cut babydoll and peter pan collared dresses, slips, heavy makeup with dark eyeliner, barrettes, and leather boots or Mary–Jane shoes.

Love has claimed that she took the style from Divinyls frontwoman Christina Amphlett. The look became very popular in 1994. During the mid-1990s, the rise of [...] "heroin chic", a trend that Maxim Furek links to the role that the drug played in the grunge scene, led to controversy.

500|$|Amy Strong of The Library Journal, {{perhaps because}} Angelou's life {{during the time}} the book took place was full of more {{personal}} loss than conflict and struggle, considered Song less profound and intense than the previous books in Angelou's series. [...] She predicted that Song′s direct and plainspoken style would be popular. [...] Publishers Weekly, in its review of the book, agreed with Strong and saw [...] "a certain resignation" [...] in Song, instead of [...] "the contentiousness" [...] in Angelou's other autobiographies. [...] The reviewer also stated that those <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> the era Angelou described would appreciate her assessment of it, and that Song was [...] "a story of tragedy and triumph, well stated and clearly stamped by her own unique blend of Afro-Americanism". [...] The assassinations in Song provided the book with depth as Angelou described the events of her life, which would be [...] "mere meanderings" [...] if described by a less skilled writer. [...] The reviewer {{was able to see}} Angelou's [...] "gracious spirit" [...] and found the book [...] "satisfying", although he considered it a [...] "sometimes flat account" [...] that lacked [...] "the spiritual tone of Angelou's essays, the openness of her poetry and the drama of her other autobiographies".|$|E
