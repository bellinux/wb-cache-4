25|$|This is {{the most}} common open hole {{completion}} used today. It is basically the same described on the vertical open hole completion but on a horizontal well it enlarges significantly the contact with the reservoir, increasing the production or injection rates of your well. Sand control on a horizontal well is completely different from a vertical well. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer rely on the gravity for the gravel placement. Most service companies uses an alpha and beta wave design to cover the total length of the horizontal well with gravel. It's known that very long wells (around 6000ft) were successfully gravel packed in many occasions, including deepwater reservoirs in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 the Environment Agency {{announced}} it favours compulsory metering in water-scarce southern England. The measure is controversial. Consumer groups fear it will penalise poorer families {{with lots of}} children, and the disabled, who use more water. The announcement also represents a U-turn for Labour, which fiercely opposed compulsory water meters when in opposition, describing them as a 'tax on family life'. In March 2006 the company Folkestone & Dover Water Services was granted the power to install compulsory water meters in a landmark ministerial ruling under which it was given 'water scarcity status' by Environment Minister Elliot Morley. In a written ministerial statement, Mr Morley said: 'In {{many parts of the}} country, water is a precious resource which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer simply take for granted.' The company says that Folkestone and Dover are in one of the driest areas in the UK. Many parts of the Middle East had more rain than this area, and it is getting even drier and warmer due to climate change.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the novel, Little Bee {{considers}} how {{she would}} explain England to [...] "the girls back home" [...] in Nigeria. Cleave uses the girls as a Greek chorus, providing a foil to allow the cultural dissonance experienced by Little Bee to be made explicit. He feels the device is more natural than having Little Bee narrate her alarm first hand, allowing the reader to appreciate the cultural gulf, and Little Bee to seem knowing as opposed to tragic. Through Little Bee's narration, Cleave examines human culture from the opposite perspective as science fiction does, having an extraordinary protagonist explore an ordinary world. This contemporary realism gives a significance to mundane events experienced by Little Bee, while bringing into focus [...] "sad and ignoble" [...] aspects of English culture such as the detention system. Cleave commented: [...] "We have become accustomed to viewing our own actions in soft focus, but the alien narrator has not yet acquired this cultural immunity. She sees us as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer see ourselves." ...|$|E

[...] Subsequently, Deng returned home and decided to negotiate with local authorities. [...] On July 10, the family agreed to settle out of court for 70,600 yuan (~$11,200 USD). Additionally, the township agreed to pay Feng's medical bills if she contracted a disease from the abortion. [...] "I've given up legal appeals and agreed to take the compensation offered by the township government," [...] Deng remarked. [...] "We just want our normal life back." [...] He added, [...] "It has never been about the money. As ordinary people, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer take the pressure from {{all sides of the}} society". [...] Zhang said the family gave up on pursuing criminal charges because local law enforcement was uncooperative, explaining that [...] "if the prosecutors don't fulfill their responsibilities , it's impossible to do." [...] An official told Xinhua, China's official state news agency, that the government was committed to providing for the family's financial needs if they should encounter future financial difficulties and that the government would also provide medical care for the Dengs' ailing mother.|$|E

2500|$|It is hyperreal. It is a {{universe}} of simulation, which is something altogether different. And this is so not because Dick speaks specifically of simulacra. SF has always done so, but it has always played upon the double, on artificial replication or imaginary duplication, whereas here the double has disappeared. There is no more double; one is always already in the other world, an other world which is not another, without mirrors or projection or utopias as means for reflection. The simulation is impassable, unsurpassable, checkmated, without exteriority. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer move [...] "through the mirror" [...] to the other side, as we could during {{the golden age of}} transcendence.|$|E

2500|$|The Maxwell {{equations}} {{can also}} be formulated on a spacetime-like Minkowski space where space and time are treated on equal footing. The direct spacetime formulations make manifest that the Maxwell equations are relativistically invariant. Because of this symmetry electric and magnetic field are treated on equal footing and are recognised as components of the Faraday tensor. This reduces the four Maxwell equations to two, which [...] simplifies the equations, although <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer use the familiar vector formulation. [...] In fact the Maxwell equations [...] in the space + time formulation are not Galileo invariant and have [...] Lorenz invariance a hidden symmetry. This was {{a major source of}} inspiration for the development of relativity theory. The space + time formulation is not a non-relativistic approximation, however, they describe the same physics by simply renaming variables. [...] For this reason the relativistic invariant equations [...] are usually simply called the Maxwell equations as well.|$|E

When we make an arrest in this case and charges are filed, there must be no mistake. We must get the right man or no man at all."
