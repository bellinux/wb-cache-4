The site originally chosen, a field about a mile outside Tunbridge Wells was deemed unsuitable as there <b>were</b> <b>obstacles</b> surrounding it. It was decided to continue the pageant at Penshurst. Five civil de Havilland Moths and three Armstrong Whitworth Siskins from No. 56 Squadron RAF, based at nearby RAF Biggin Hill attended. The pageant was to promote the proposed Tunbridge Wells Flying Club, whose President was to be Sir Robert Gower. It was reported that part of Penshurst Airfield had been rented by the club. Sir Robert entertained Sir Sefton Brancker at Penshurst on 5 December 1927 when Brancker called in {{on his way to}} Lympne Aerodrome where he was to visit the East Kent Flying Club.|$|E

However, the scandals of Reagan's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce and the neglect of the president <b>were</b> <b>obstacles</b> from the start, and Kemp was unsuccessful at either of his major initiatives: enacting enterprise zones and promoting public housing tenant ownership. [...] The goal of these two plans was to change public housing into tenant-owned residences and to lure industry and business into inner cities with federal incentives. Although Kemp did not affect much policy as HUD's director, he cleaned up HUD's reputation, and developed a plan to salvage the troubled Federal Housing Administration. He halted or revamped corrupt programs and developed an antidrug offensive, which enabled him to collaborate with Director of the National Drug Control Policy Bill Bennett. He supported [...] "Operation Clean Sweep" [...] and similar movements to prohibit firearm possession in public housing.|$|E

2500|$|Adair died in 1885, {{after only}} his third {{visit to the}} JA. Cornelia, widowed {{for the second time}} after 18 years of marriage, {{continued}} the partnership, but sometimes questioned Goodnight’s judgment. For the rest of her life, Cornelia took an intense personal interest in the growth and operation of the ranch, though she was often in England or Ireland. [...] She insisted on a remuda of all bay horses, and imported purebred Hereford cattle from England. In 1887, Goodnight withdrew from the arrangement and limited his ranching activities. Falling beef prices, the arrival of farmers to the canyon, the decline of the open range, and the arrival of the Fort Worth and Denver Railway <b>were</b> <b>obstacles</b> to continued large-scale ranching. In the dissolution, Goodnight acquired the [...] Quitaque Ranch in Briscoe County with 20,000 head of cattle and remained manager of the JA for another year.|$|E

JScript, a reverse-engineered implementation of Netscape's JavaScript, {{was part of}} Internet Explorer 3. [...] JScript was also available for server-side scripting in Internet Information Server. Internet Explorer 3 also included Microsoft's first support for CSS and various extensions to HTML, but in each case the implementation was noticeably different to that found in Netscape Navigator at the time. These differences {{made it difficult for}} designers and programmers to make a single website work well in both browsers, leading to the use of [...] "best viewed in Netscape" [...] and [...] "best viewed in Internet Explorer" [...] logos that characterized these early years of the browser wars. JavaScript began to acquire a reputation for being one of the roadblocks to a cross-platform and standards-driven Web. Some developers took on the difficult task of trying to make their sites work in both major browsers, but many could not afford the time. With the release of Internet Explorer 4, Microsoft introduced the concept of Dynamic HTML, but the differences in language implementations and the different and proprietary Document Object Models remained and <b>were</b> <b>obstacles</b> to widespread take-up of JavaScript on the Web.|$|E
