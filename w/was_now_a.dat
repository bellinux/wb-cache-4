5|$|The {{presence}} of Messiah at God's right hand means that for His people there <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> way {{of access to}} God more immediate and heart-satisfying than the obsolete temple ritual had {{ever been able to}} provide.|$|E
5|$|Around 1939, the old aqueduct, which <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> popular hiking trail, started {{becoming}} a popular route with cyclists. Soon after, {{there was a}} proposal to redevelop the trail as a bike path. This proposal never came to fruition, although in the mid-1970s, the city built a separate bike path along Mosholu Parkway, the Bronx River Parkway, and Pelham Parkway between Jerome Avenue and Pelham Bay Park.|$|E

50|$|The band never officially split up, {{but they}} have not played {{together}} since 1992. Marc <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> business consultant, Mark <b>is</b> <b>now</b> studying to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lawyer, Paul <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> doctor, Michael <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> teacher, Ian <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> clinical research associate, and Nigel <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> lecturer.

5|$|By 16:00, {{with the}} Franco-Bavarian troops besieged in Blenheim and Oberglau, the Allied centre of 81 squadrons (nine squadrons had been {{transferred}} from Cutts' column), supported by 18 battalions was firmly planted amidst the French line of 64 squadrons and nine battalions of raw recruits. There <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> {{pause in the}} battle: Marlborough wanted to concert the attack upon the whole front, and Eugene, after his second repulse, needed time to reorganize.|$|E
5|$|Cassel was {{annexed to}} France the {{following}} year {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the war. The annexation led to the town's defences being dismantled; it was considered indefensible, as it was within easy firing range of the nearby Mont des Récollets, and it would have cost far too much to fortify both hills. In addition, the revised frontier following the treaty <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> significant distance from Cassel and without the proximity of the border, the town was no longer seen as having much strategic significance.|$|E
5|$|Famously, {{the much}} smaller Greek army held the pass of Thermopylae against the Persians {{for three days}} before being outflanked by a {{mountain}} path. Much of the Greek army retreated, before the Spartans and Thespians who had continued to block the pass were surrounded and killed. The simultaneous Battle of Artemisium was {{up to that point}} a stalemate; however, when news of Thermopylae reached them, the Allied fleet also retreated, since holding the straits of Artemisium <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> moot point.|$|E

50|$|Formerly Llandecwyn {{had other}} churches. Llenyrch Methodist Chapel {{was built in}} 1861 as a Sunday school and was open until the 1920s. It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> private house. Brontecwyn Chapel (Weslyan Methodist) was {{the home of the}} Llandecwyn Revolt School. The chapel closed in the 1990s and <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> holiday rental cottage. Capel Bach, Brontecwyn, <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> woodstore for a larger house. Capel Newydd (Calvinistic Methodist), was a few yards from Capel Bach, but <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> ruin.|$|R
5|$|Groves {{met with}} Arnold again in September 1943. He {{informed}} Arnold that there <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> second bomb shape under consideration, the Fat Man, and formally requested that further tests be carried out, that {{not more than}} three B-29s be modified to carry the weapons, and that the USAAF form and train a special unit to deliver the bombs. Arnold delegated responsibility for this to Major General Oliver P. Echols. In turn, Echols designated Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson as the Project Officer.|$|E
5|$|He {{eventually}} {{did receive}} a degree. Just before {{the publication of}} his Dictionary in 1755, Oxford University awarded Johnson the degree of Master of Arts. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1765 by Trinity College Dublin and in 1775 by Oxford University. In 1776, he returned to Pembroke with Boswell and toured the college with his former tutor Adams, who <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> Master. During that visit he recalled his time at the college, his early career, and expressed his later fondness for Jorden.|$|E
5|$|Highway 82 <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> four-lane road all the {{way from}} Glenwood Springs to Aspen. But that traffic still had to narrow to two lanes to cross the Maroon Creek Bridge at the latter city's western boundary. The old bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985, was {{functionally}} obsolete and structurally deficient. Cracks and other damage were forcing temporary closures of the bridge to trucks. Over 100 years old by that point, the oldest bridge in use on a Colorado highway, it could not be expanded any further.|$|E
50|$|Roz Weston joined ET Canada. Natasha Ramsahai, {{the morning}} weather person on Toronto Today, <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> {{meteorologist}} for Citytv Toronto, while Bill Coulter, the evening weather person on Toronto Tonight, <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> meteorologist for CP24. Tracy Moore and Dina Pugliese both joined Citytv Toronto. Wei Chen <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> host on CBC Radio One.|$|R

5000|$|There are two {{remaining}} pubs in Hellesdon: The Bull At Hellesdon and The Whiffler. The former pub The Man On The Moon <b>is</b> <b>now</b> the Hellesdon doctor's surgery. Another former pub, The Bignold Arms, <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> fish restaurant and takeaway and [...] "The Firs" [...] <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> Tesco Express. The Falcon <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> Co-op Daily. Hellesdon railway station {{closed in the}} 1950s.|$|R
5|$|In 1861 a {{proposal}} {{was made to}} construct a road from Blackfriars to the Mansion House; this {{would have resulted in}} the complete demolition of the College. However, protests from the heralds resulted in only parts of the south east and south west wings being sliced off, requiring extensive remodelling. The College <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> three-sided building with an open courtyard facing the New Queen Victoria Street laid out in 1866. The terrace, steps and entrance porch were also added around this time.|$|E
5|$|John II was {{succeeded by}} his first cousin Manuel I, in 1495. This king {{was the first to}} convert the {{traditional}} square armorial banner into a rectangular (2:3) field with the coat of arms on its centre. Specifically, the flag <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> white rectangle centrally charged with the coat of arms (bearing eleven castles) on an ogival or heater-shaped shield and surmounted by an open royal crown. This flag was used exclusively as the kingdom's banner since Manuel I possessed a personal standard which included the armillary sphere for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Managing {{to right}} himself, he became faint from the {{escaping}} gas and lashed {{himself to the}} ropes to prevent a fall. Realising the attempt <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> danger to himself and the balloon, L'Estrange set out the grappling hooks to catch onto something and bring the balloon down. However the ropes had become tangled and the hooks were too short.|$|E
25|$|Kim Ji-sung and An Yoo-mi {{decided to}} take another route. Kim <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>an</b> actor trainee under N Company, while An stayed with Blessing Entertainment and <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> model.|$|R

5|$|Margaret <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> widow {{with seven}} of her eight {{children}} under the age of 18 and financially dependent on her. She returned to live near her mother in Independence, swapping land for a nearby property that became known as the Mrs. Sam Houston House. The Texas legislature eventually gave Margaret an amount equivalent to her husband's unpaid gubernatorial salary; nevertheless, in order to afford Sam Jr.'s enrollment at medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, she rented out the Ben Lomond plantation.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on the 28th Brigade's {{left flank}} the Shropshires met slight resistance, {{securing}} Hill 210 southwest of Kowang-San by 10:10. They were then relieved by the Canadians by nightfall {{in preparation for}} the third phase of the operation. The brigade plan <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> day behind schedule, although with the unexpected ease experienced by the Canadians, overall, the divisional attack was still running according to plan. However, determined to hold on following the loss of Hill 355, the Chinese moved in fresh troops, heavily reinforcing a number of positions, including Maryang San.|$|E
5|$|On 4 June 2009, Oasis {{played the}} first of three concerts at Manchester's Heaton Park and after having to leave the stage twice due to a {{generator}} failure, came on the third time to declare the gig <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> free concert; it delighted the 70,000 ticket holders, 20,000 of whom claimed the refund. The band's two following gigs at the venue, on 6 and 7 June, proved a great success, with fans turning out in the thousands despite the changeable weather and first night's sound issues.|$|E
50|$|Topcliffe has a {{park and}} two pubs, The Angel and The Swan. The old school house of Topcliffe <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> post office, the toll house <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>an</b> {{ordinary}} cottage.|$|R
50|$|The song then {{shifts to}} the present. Eddie <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>an</b> {{insurance}} salesman and {{retired from the}} band, due to arthritis. Rita <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> housewife with a part-time job at the dime store.|$|R
50|$|The Crown Hotel - the {{original}} {{site of the}} hotel which gave its name to Crown Square <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> building society office. The Crown <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> Wetherspoon's pub just along Bakewell Road.|$|R
5|$|One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America {{was that}} the piano nobile now tended {{to be placed on}} the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the {{tradition}} in Europe. This service floor, if it existed at all, <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> discreet semi-basement. This negated the need for an ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be a feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.|$|E
5|$|The Nebraska Cornhuskers {{began the}} 1996 season having won the {{national}} championship in both 1994 and 1995. Though Nebraska <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> member of a new conference—the former Big Eight Conference had been merged with four Texas schools to become the Big 12—it was widely expected that Nebraska would repeat the performance {{for a third time}} in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Coast Air terminated their flights, but {{stated that}} they still had an agreement with Vildanden. Skien Lufttransport on their hand stated that Vildanden <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> sleeping company, and that the contract therefore was terminated. Both companies considered the incident a legal matter. In December, the two companies settled outside court.|$|E
50|$|Later Coombe Keynes' {{population}} declined {{until it}} <b>is</b> <b>now</b> only <b>a</b> hamlet. The lost {{part of the}} settlement was immediately east of the parish church. The area <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> field {{what appear to be}} platforms where cottages stood and a hollow way {{that would have been a}} lane. This depopulated area <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|R
50|$|Ysgol Glan Clwyd <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> well {{established}} school. There <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> class for non-Welsh speakers to learn. Later in school the learners {{will join the}} regular class. Each year is separated into registration classes with letters.|$|R
