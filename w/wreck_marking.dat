60|$|Lister got up with {{an effort}} {{and went to the}} pump, which {{presently}} began to throb. The mended engine ran well and the regular splash of water, flung out from the big discharge pipe, drowned the languid rumble of the surf. The hull shook; shadowy figures crossed the beam of light from the furnace, and vanished in the dark. Twinkling lamps threw broken reflections on the water that looked like black silk, lightning flashed in the background, and when the swell broke with phosphorescent sparkles about the <b>wreck</b> Lister <b>marked</b> the height the pale illumination crept up her plates. She would not lift that tide, but the pump was clearing the hold, and he hoped much water was not coming in. If the leakage was not excessive, her bow ought to rise when the next tide flowed.|$|R
50|$|Swan was towed to Bunbury, Western Australia, {{and over}} the next twelve months, the ship was cleared of {{environmental}} hazards (such as oil and plastics) and diver hazards (such as cabling), and had access holes cut. The engine and boiler rooms were sealed off. After preparations were completed, the ship was towed to a point 1.3 nmi km from Point Picquet (Meelup Beach), near Dunsborough, Western Australia. Swan was scuttled on the morning of 14 December 1997; an event observed by an estimated 10,000 spectators on shore, plus numerous spectator craft. The actual detonation was performed by a six-year-old child, whose father had won a raffle for the honour. Swan sank quickly at , in 30 m of water, and came to rest on the sandy bottom in a nearly upright position. The <b>wreck</b> is <b>marked</b> with red buoys at the bow and stern.|$|R
50|$|Benjamin Holden in 1756 bought four {{mainland}} tracts and {{the island}} between his plantation and the ocean. This island extended from Lockwood's Folly Inlet west 6 mi to Bacon Inlet. Benjamin and his sons used the island for fishing and cattle grazing. During the Civil War Holden Beach and Lockwood's Folley Inlet became the resting place of several shipwrecks: the Confederate blockade runners CSS Elizabeth and CSS Bendigo and the Union blockade ship USS Iron Age. The remains of the Iron Age {{can be seen on}} the eastern end of the island during the periods of low tide. Its <b>wreck</b> is <b>marked</b> with an orange navigation warning buoy and is located between Holden Beach and Oak Island. While the vessel's wreck is roughly 200 ft long, only the base of the engine's exhaust funnel and a small portion of superstructure are visible above water. The ship is easily reached during low tide by swimming, but the wreck is extensively covered in abandoned fishing hooks and gear that may present potential hazards.|$|R
50|$|Hamlin's 2013 {{season began}} with an on-and-off track feud with former {{teammate}} Joey Logano. Initially started on Twitter, the on track incidents began at Bristol in March, where Hamlin spun Logano in turns 1 and 2, leading Logano to confront Hamlin after the race. The rivalry continued into the next race at Auto Club Speedway, where the two fought for {{the lead in the}} closing laps. In the final corner, the two collided, allowing JGR teammate Kyle Busch to win the race, and sending Hamlin's 11 car into a non-SAFER barrier wall near pit road. This <b>wreck</b> would <b>mark</b> the beginning of a difficult season for Hamlin, as he suffered a lower back fracture and was forced to sit out several races. Veteran Mark Martin replaced Hamlin at one of Denny's better tracks, Martinsville Speedway, where he scored a top 10. Brian Vickers then drove the car for the next three races, scoring an 8th-place finish at Texas. Though Hamlin returned to the car at Talladega Superspeedway, he never returned to form during the year, with only 8 top 10s on the year. He did score a win at the season finale at Homestead.|$|R

[...] 15 pages, 9 figures, 1 tableThis study {{is focused on the}} potential of using the multibeam acoustic backscatter both for sea-floor {{characterization of}} the Galicia Bank and for identification of sea-bottom oil spills. An extended multibeam data set was acquired during the RG- 1 and RG- 2 surveys aboard RV Hespérides in 2003 for the geological and geophysical {{characterization of the}} Galicia Bank, where the oil tanker Prestige wreck is located. 3 -D images have been made by integrating bathymetry and backscatter data. Multibeam data have been additionally supported by gravity core information in order to correlate sea-floor acoustic backscatter with the surficial sediments and their physical properties. The major factors that seem to control the zonation of the backscatter intensity images are (i) the type of the sedimentary processes (gravitational, turbiditic, hemipelagic), which control at the same time, the grain size distribution, and (ii) the sea-bottom morphologies, such as basement outcrops. However, there are some backscatter halos that cannot be explained by these processes.

60|$|Notwithstanding {{the boat}} sailed {{particularly}} fast, and worked beautifully, {{it could not}} equal the impatience of Mulford to get on. Passing away to the north-east a sufficient distance, as he thought, to weather on the wreck, the young man tacked at last, and had the happiness to see that every foot he proceeded was now in a direct line toward Rose. It was only while tacking he perceived that all the fins had disappeared. He felt little doubt that they had deserted him, in order to push for the wreck, which offered so much larger, and so much more attainable prey. This increased his feverish desire to get on, the boat seeming to drag, in his eyes, {{at the very moment}} it was leaving a wake full of eddies and little whirlpools. The wind was steady, but it seemed to Mulford that the boat was set to leeward of her course by a current, though this could hardly have been the case, as the <b>wreck,</b> the sole <b>mark</b> of his progress, would have had at least as great a drift as the boat. At length Mulford--to him it appeared to be an age; in truth it was after a run of about twenty minutes--came near the goal he so earnestly sought, and got an accurate view {{of the state of the}} wreck, and of those on it. The hull of the schooner had, in truth, sunk entirely beneath the surface of the sea; and the party it sustained stood already knee-deep in the water. This was sufficiently appalling; but the presence of the sharks, who were crowding around the spot, rendered the whole scene frightful. To the young mate it seemed as if he must still be too late to save Rose from a fate more terrible than drowning, for his boat fell so far to leeward as to compel him to tack once more. As he swept past the wreck, he called out to encourage his friends, begging them to be of good heart for five minutes longer, when he should be able to reach them. Rose held out her arms entreatingly, and the screams of Mrs. Budd and Biddy, which were extorted by the closer and closer approach of the sharks, proclaimed the imminency of the danger they ran, and the importance of not losing a moment of time.|$|R
