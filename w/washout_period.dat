40|$|Nicotinic acid (NiAc) is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of adipose tissue lipolysis. Acute administration results in a rapid reduction of plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations. Sustained NiAc exposure is associated with tolerance development (drug resistance) and complete adaptation (FFA returning to pretreatment levels). We conducted a meta-analysis on a rich pre-clinical data set of the NiAc-FFA interaction to establish the acute and chronic exposure-response relations from a macro perspective. The {{data were analyzed using}} a nonlinear mixed-effects framework. We also developed a new turnover model that describes the adaptation seen in plasma FFA concentrations in lean Sprague-Dawley and obese Zucker rats following acute and chronic NiAc exposure. The adaptive mechanisms within the system were described using integral control systems and dynamic efficacies in the traditional [Formula: see text] model. Insulin was incorporated in parallel with NiAc as the main endogenous co-variate of FFA dynamics. The model captured profound insulin resistance and complete drug resistance in obese rats. The efficacy of NiAc as an inhibitor of FFA release went from 1 to approximately 0 during sustained exposure in obese rats. The potency of NiAc as an inhibitor of insulin and of FFA release was estimated to be 0. 338 and 0. 436 [Formula: see text], respectively, in obese rats. A range of dosing regimens was analyzed and predictions made for optimizing NiAc delivery to minimize FFA exposure. Given the exposure levels of the experiments, the importance of <b>washout</b> <b>periods</b> in-between NiAc infusions was illustrated. The <b>washout</b> <b>periods</b> should be [Formula: see text] 2 h longer than the infusions in order to optimize 24 h lowering of FFA in rats.

40|$|Background-—Endothelial {{dysfunction}} is {{an independent}} predictor for cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM). Glucagon like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) reportedly exerts vasodilatory actions, and inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4), an enzyme-degrading GLP- 1, are widely used to treat T 2 DM. We therefore hypothesized that DPP- 4 inhibitors (DPP- 4 Is) improve endothelial function in T 2 DM patients and performed 2 prospective, randomized crossover trials to compare the DPP- 4 I sitagliptin and an a-glucosidase inhibitor, voglibose (in study 1) and the DPP- 4 Is sitagliptin and alogliptin (in study 2). Methods and Results-—In study 1, 24 men with T 2 DM (465 years) were randomized to sitagliptin or voglibose for 6 weeks without <b>washout</b> <b>periods.</b> Surprisingly, sitagliptin significantly reduced flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD; 51 % compared with baseline, P< 0. 05) of the brachial artery despite improved diabetic status. In contrast, voglibose did not affect FMD. To confirm this result and determine {{whether it is a}} class effect, we conducted another trial (study 2) to compare sitagliptin and alogliptin in 42 T 2 DM patients (668 years) for 6 weeks with 4 -week <b>washout</b> <b>periods.</b> Both DPP- 4 Is improved glycemic control but significantly attenuated FMD (7. 2 / 4. 3 %, P< 0. 001, before/after sitagliptin; 7. 0 / 4. 8 %, P< 0. 001, before/after alogliptin, respectively). Interestingly, FMD reduction was less evident in subjects who were on statins or whose LDL cholesterol levels were reduced by them, but this was not correlated with parameters including DPP- 4 activity and GLP- 1 levels or diabetic parameters.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{recovery}} of receptor binding and of isoprenaline-stimulated cyclic AMP responses after chronic (2 - 5 days) exposure of tissue-cultured living rat heart cells to several beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Most experiments were performed with [3 H]- (+/-) -carazolol and [3 H]-(+/-) -CGP 12177, as prototypes of high affinity lipophilic and hydrophilic ligands respectively. Chronic antagonist treatment did not alter {{the total number of}} receptors nor did it cause intracellular accumulation of the ligands. At the end of the treatment, radiolabelled antagonists were displaced either by 'infinite' dilution of the incubation medium or by competitive displacement with the non-labelled ligand (-) -timolol. In dilution assays dissociation of carazolol from specific sites was biphasic with t 1 / 2 values of 41 +/- 14 and 219 +/- 15 min. Dissociation of CGP 12177 was monophasic with t 1 / 2 of 102 +/- 2 min. Timolol enhanced the dissociation rates of both radioligands and suppressed the slow phase of carazolol dissociation. Isoprenaline-stimulated cyclic AMP formation did not recover in parallel with the release of the two antagonists from receptor binding sites. To reach about 80 % of control values for receptor availability or cyclic AMP response required 3 h and 24 h <b>washout</b> <b>periods,</b> respectively, after carazolol (0. 2 nM) treatment, or 1. 5 and 12 h <b>washout</b> <b>periods</b> after CGP 12177 (4 nM) treatment. Such a 'decoupling' effect was not observed during recovery from chronic exposure to the antagonists, timolol and propranolol. We conclude that some antagonists cause a novel form of desensitization that is not linked to their partial agonistic potency. Moreover, carazolol-type drugs seem to induce an additional isomeric form of the beta-receptor that is not recognized by other antagonists. These observations could explain the well known discrepancy between long duration of action and rapid removal from the circulation of several antagonists in current therapeutic use...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{manage the}} {{interaction}} between fosamprenavir/ritonavir and posaconazole, we hypothesized that ritonavir can be replaced by posaconazole as an alternative booster of fosamprenavir with no significant influence on posaconazole pharmacokinetics. METHODS: This was an open-label, randomized, three period, cross-over, single-centre trial in 24 healthy volunteers. All subjects received the following three treatments for 10 days, separated by <b>washout</b> <b>periods</b> of 17 days: posaconazole 400 mg twice daily; fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700 / 100 mg twice daily; posaconazole 400 mg twice daily with fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily. RESULTS: Twenty subjects completed the trial. Geometric mean ratios (GMR; + 90 % confidence interval) of posaconazole AUC and C(max) when taken with fosamprenavir versus posaconazole alone were 0. 77 (0. 68 - 0. 87) and 0. 79 (0. 71 - 0. 89), respectively. The GMRs of amprenavir AUC and C(max) when taken as fosamprenavir and posaconazole versus fosamprenavir/ritonavir were 0. 35 (0. 32 - 0. 39) and 0. 64 (0. 55 - 0. 76), respectively. No serious adverse events were reported during the trial. CONCLUSION: Unboosted fosamprenavir {{should not be used}} concomitantly with posaconazole...|$|R
