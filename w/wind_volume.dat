40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 100 - 102) This thesis {{examines the}} direct {{influence of the}} French Symbolists upon the poetry and aesthetics of W. B. Yeats. The first part defines French SYmbolist theory and includes {{a discussion of the}} major poets and words of the movement, from Baudelaire to Mallarme. The second part if the thesis describe Yeats' relationship to the Symbolists and the effect of Symbolist thought upon his aesthetics. Yeats's interest in French thought and art began early in life. It was strengthened by his involvement with the Rhymers' club and his friendship with Arthur Symons, and eventually led him to Paris and direct contact with influential Symbolist figures. The outgrowth of this interest emerged as Yeats's first aesthetic philosophy in Ideas of Good and Evil, a thinly veiled translation of Symbolist thought and the poetry volume, The Wind Among the Reeds. The third part of this thesis examines the direct influence of the Symbolists upon both content and structure of the <b>Wind</b> <b>volume.</b> The Symbolists's disavowal of the material world and their desire to reach a supernatural ideal is both a central theme of Yeats <b>Wind</b> <b>volume</b> and a determinant of its structure. The aim of the Symbolists was to evoke, to intimate, and to avoid direct expression in order to convey a sense of ideal reality directly to the reader. The Wind volume's aim is the same; the language sharply diverges from Yeats's early work in its new technical prowess, a potency directly attributable to Symbolist method...|$|E
40|$|Stars between about 4 and 25 {{solar masses}} spend a {{significant}} fraction of their post-main sequence lifetime as red supergiants (RSGs) and lose material via stellar winds during this period. For RSGs more massive than 10 solar masses, this mass loss becomes of evolutionary significance, and probably determines the upper mass limit of RSGs in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Despite decades of observations, the driving mechanism responsible for mass loss in RSGs remains unknown. Mainly {{this is because}} the optical spectrum accessible from the ground provides almost no useful wind diagnostics, and what information is obtained is spatially averaged over the entire <b>wind</b> <b>volume.</b> However, within the last decade, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of many useful ultraviolet wind diagnostics have been obtained at a high signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution.

40|$|Abstract. The {{hot star}} wind {{momentum}} problemη = ˙M�∞/(L/c) ≫ 1 is revisited, {{and it is}} shown that the conventional belief, {{that it can be}} solved by a combination of clumping of the wind and multiple scattering of photons, is not self-consistent for optically thick clumps. Clumping does reduce the mass loss rate ˙M, and hence the momentum supply, required to generate a specified radio emission measureε, while multiple scattering increases the delivery of momentum from a specified stellar luminosity L. However, in the case of thick clumps, when combined the two effects act in opposition rather than in unison since clumping reduces multiple scattering. From basic geometric considerations, it is shown that this reduction in momentum delivery by clumping more than offsets the reduction in momentum required, for a specifiedε. Thus the ratio of momentum deliverable to momentum required is maximal for a smooth wind and the momentum problem remains for the thick clump case. In the case of thin clumps, all of the benefit of clumping in reducingηlies in reducing ˙M for a givenεso that extremely small filling factors f ≈ 10 − 4 are needed.

In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the line-profile variability (lpv) of Hα for a large sample of O-type supergiants (15 objects between O 4 and O 9. 7), in an objective, statistically rigorous manner. We employed the Temporal Variance Spectrum (TVS) analysis, developed by Fullerton, Gies & Bolton (1996) for the case of photospheric absorption lines and modified by us {{to take into account}} the effects of wind emission. By means of a comparative analysis we were able to put a number of constraints on the properties of this variability – quantified in terms of a mean and a newly defined fractional amplitude of deviations – as a function of stellar and wind parameters. The results of our analysis show that all the stars in the sample show evidence of significant lpv in Hα, mostly dominated by processes in the wind. The variations occur between zero and 0. 3 v ∞ (i. e., below ∼ 1. 5 R ⋆), in good agreement with the results from similar studies. A comparison between the observations and corresponding line-profile simulations indicates that for stars with intermediate wind densities the properties of the Hα variability can be explained by simple models, consisting of coherent or broken shells (blobs) uniformly distributed over the <b>wind</b> <b>volume,</b> with an intrinsic scatter in the maximum density contrast of about a factor of two.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} X-ray spectrum of the eclipsing high mass X-ray binary Vela X- 1 (4 U 0900 - 40) using archival data from ASCA. The observation covers a time interval centered on eclipse of the X-ray pulsar by the companion. The spectrum exhibits two distinct sets of discrete features: (1) recombination lines and radiative recombination continua from mostly H- and He-like species produced by photoionization in an extended stellar wind; and (2) fluorescent K-shell lines associated with near-neutral species also present in the circumsource medium. Using a detailed spectral model that explicitly accounts for the recombination cascade kinetics {{for each of the}} constituent charge states, we are able to obtain a statistically acceptable (chi_r^ 2 = 0. 88) fit to the observed spectrum and to derive emission measures associated with the individual K-shell ions of several elements. We find a best-fit mass loss rate of ~ 2. 7 x 10 ^- 7 M-solar/yr, which is approximately a factor of 10 lower than previous estimates of the mass loss rate for the Vela X- 1 companion star, which have primarily been determined from P Cygni profiles, and X-ray absorption measurements. We argue that this discrepancy can be reconciled if the X-ray irradiated portion of the wind in Vela X- 1 is structurally inhomogeneous, consisting of hundreds of cool, dense clumps embedded in a hotter, more ionized gas. Most of the mass is contained in the clumps, while most of the <b>wind</b> <b>volume</b> (> 95 %) is occupied by the highly ionized component.

Traditionally the coil uses copper wounded coils for producing the working flux for plunger attraction. Recent Cu price increases motivate careful examination of approaches to minimize Cu use.

Al wire is particularly attractive. The cost of Al is lower than it might appear from the cost per unit mass when the much lower density of Al is also considered, and the disadvantage of higher resistivity becomes less important.

40|$|The {{connection}} of stellar winds to many astrophysical problems ranges from star formation, through stellar evolution, to {{the dynamics of}} the interstellar medium in galaxies. In order to understand the winds from hot O and B type stars, we must determine and explain the distribution of such physical variables as density, velocity, and temperature throughout the <b>wind</b> <b>volume.</b> ^ This thesis presents an innovative technique similar to that of tomography in medical imaging, and its implementation in determining very accurate wind parameters for spectroscopic binary stars. It is based on the observation that certain aspects of the morphological variation of the observed wind-line profiles can be attributed to purely geometrical effects: as the stars revolve around their common center of mass, the geometry of a binary presented to the observer changes with phase. Therefore, at one time the stars will align so that the front star/wind occults/shadows the companion star and its wind, and at a later time, they will appear side-by-side and the shadowing effects will be minimal. These effects depend upon the inclination of the binary orbital plane to the observer 2 ̆ 7 s line of sight. ^ The evidence for binary wind line variability which the present study analyzes exists in sequences of ultraviolet spectra secured by the International Ultraviolet Explorer satellite at various phases of the orbit, and which sample different geometrical aspects. The presence of winds is initially quantified by deriving wind light curves and by comparing these to photospheric light curves. Subsequently, the wind lines are modeled so as to determine the structure of each wind, and to locate any wind-interaction effects between the two such as density enhancements and/or shocks. ^ This dissertation reports the results of studying the wind structure and interaction for four binaries. As an additional 20 binaries have a sufficient number of images to be analyzed, {{it can be seen that}} the work reported here commences a much larger scale effort which will eventually claim the most accurate wind parameters derived from wind profile modeling. ...|$|E
40|$|We perform local {{excitation}} calculations {{to obtain}} line opacities and emissivity ratios and {{compare them with}} observed properties of H, He I, O I, Ca II, and Na I lines to determine the density, temperature, and photon ionization rate. We find that UV photoionization is the most probable excitation mechanism for generating the He I 10830 opacities that produce all the associated absorption features. We also calculate the specific line flux at an observed velocity of v_obs = +/- 150 km/s for both radial wind and infall models. All the model results, together with observed correlations between absorption and emission features and between narrow and broad emission components, are used to deduce {{the origins of the}} strong H, He I, and Ca II broad line emission. We conclude that the first two arise primarily in a radial outflow that is highly clumpy. The bulk of the <b>wind</b> <b>volume</b> is filled by gas at a density ~ 10 ^ 9 cm^- 3 and optically thick to He I 10830 and H alpha, but optically thin to He I 5876, Pa gamma, and the Ca II infrared triplet. The optically thick He I 5876 emission occurs mostly in regions of density {{greater than or equal to}} 10 ^ 11 cm^- 3 and temperature greater than or equal to 1. 5 x 10 ^ 4 K, while the optically thick H alpha and Pa gamma emission occur mostly in regions of density around 10 ^ 11 cm^- 3 and temperature between 8750 and 1. 25 x 10 ^ 4 K. In producing the observed line fluxes at a given v_obs, the covering factor of these emission clumps is sufficiently small not to incur significant absorption of the stellar and veiling continua in either He I or H lines. The strong Ca II broad line emission likely arises in both the magnetospheric accretion flow and the disk boundary layer, where the gases dissipate part of their rotational energies before infalling along magnetic field lines. The needed density and temperature are ~ 10 ^ 12 cm^- 3 and less than or equal to 7500 K. Comment: Accepted to MNRAS, 88 pages, 24 figure...|$|E
