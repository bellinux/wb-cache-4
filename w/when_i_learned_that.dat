500|$|During summer 2001, Black Isle Studios {{employed}} three development teams. These {{included the}} Icewind Dale team, the team developing Torn, {{and a team}} working on an unannounced project. Before and during Torns development, several members of its team expressed interest in developing another game using the Infinity Engine. The development team was not made aware of Black Isle Studios' decision to develop Icewind Dale II until Torns cancellation. Lead designer J. E. Sawyer described, [...] "I don't know when the producers {{decided to make the}} game, but I was told that we were making the game <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> TORN was being cancelled ... on a Wednesday afternoon", and that Feargus Urquhart [...] "asked me to work with Steve Bokkes to create a story and area overview by Thursday afternoon. Steve and I talked about {{it for the rest of}} the day. I went home that night and worked on the overviews until the next day. I came in and turned the docs in, and after the Friday division meeting, the project was in development." [...] During this period, Interplay Entertainment relied on Black Isle Studios' games to alleviate financial trouble, which put pressure to release games quickly. The decision to develop Icewind Dale II was based partly on the original Icewind Dales reception, and the development teams' ability to create a game with the Infinity Engine relatively quickly. Sawyer said of the decision, [...] "In all honesty, the reasons for making Icewind Dale II have to do with limiting risks and maximizing our chances for a popular title." [...] Conceptualization of Icewind Dale II progressed during the development of the Icewind Dale expansions, and production began late July 2001, shortly after the completion of [...] After six months of development, Icewind Dale II was officially announced on February 4, 2002.|$|E

2500|$|Later in January 2008, Clinton {{backed out}} of a cover photo shoot with Vogue over {{concerns}} by the Clinton camp that she would appear [...] "too feminine," [...] which prompted the magazine's editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, to write, [...] "Imagine my amazement, then, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Hillary Clinton, our only female presidential hopeful, had decided {{to steer clear of}} our pages at this point in her campaign for fear of looking too feminine. The notion that a contemporary woman must look mannish in order to be taken seriously as a seeker of power is frankly dismaying. How has our culture come to this? How is it that The Washington Post recoils from the slightest hint of cleavage on a senator? This is America, not Saudi Arabia. It's also 2008: Margaret Thatcher may have looked terrific in a blue power suit, but that was 20 years ago. I do think Americans have moved on from the power-suit mentality, which served as a bridge for a generation of women to reach boardrooms filled with men. Political campaigns that do not recognize this are making a serious misjudgment." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{capacity}} {{of art to}} communicate my concern regarding the extinction of plant life in Tasmania {{is the subject of}} my investigation. Extinct plants distil and foreshadow my broader concerns for the future of all living entities. The plants that are lost due to extinction are often the silent victims of our land use practices. Making nature: Extinct Tasmanian plants, is an installation of art works that commemorate the extinction of twenty two Tasmanian plants. The art works take the form of embroidered wreaths, funeral urns and a memorial board. My aim in creating the art work is to encourage reflection regarding the role that members of our society have played in the loss of these plants. We may unwittingly be contributing to extinction and thereby â��making natureâ�� in the process. A part of my motivation for creating this body of work has been to highlight the grief <b>I</b> feel <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> a plant species has been extinguished. My objective has been to represent the extinct plants in a manner that may elicit an experience of beauty amongst the viewers of my art. Beauty has the potential to arouse meaningful connections between the viewer and the plants, whereas, extinction eradicates that possibility and destroys the prospect of relationships between living things. Therefore, my use of beauty in the art work is subversive, because I am not seeking to provide pleasure; I have sought, instead, to generate a sense of anguish due to the loss of these plants. My investigative work draws associations with the art of Andy Warhol, Gregory Pryor, Janet Laurence, Fiona Hall and Christian Boltanski. Significant aspects of their work are discussed in relation to issues that I have examined in my art, including extinction, beauty and loss. Theories that examine the idea of beauty, including the reasons why it matters to us and how it affects us are explored. I argue that in the presence of beauty we can be moved to critical reflection. Such aesthetic and cognitive judgements surrounding beauty may lead to a greater awareness of the human impact on the natural environment. The project makes a contribution to the field of visual art through the theoretical examination of beauty in the context of contemporary arts practice. This visual work makes a contribution to knowledge by testing the {{capacity of}} art to create a commemorative site for reflection about the impact of extinction in Tasmania...|$|R
