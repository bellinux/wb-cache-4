5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of iron ore deposits {{in the north of}} Sweden, Lappland became a frontier for industrial development, instead of an exotic <b>wilderness</b> <b>of</b> the Sami culture and midnight sun. Opportunistically, Carl Adam Victor Lundholm published his Lappland, det stora svenska framtidslandet (Lappland, the great Swedish land of the future). He engaged noted Swedish artists—such as Karl Tirén, Alfred Thörne, Per Daniel Holm and Hjalmar Lindberg—to create the illustrations. Since Bauer was an inexperienced illustrator by comparison, Lundholm tested his abilities by sending him to create some drawings of Sami people at Skansen.|$|E
5|$|In the 1620s, the Spanish sent five {{military}} {{expeditions to}} investigate rumors of mines and other Europeans in the interior, {{but only two}} reached La Tama, in 1625 and 1627. The first crossed the <b>Wilderness</b> <b>of</b> Ocute but was turned back at Cofitachequi due to the old war, while the second was allowed into Cofitachequi. After this, Spanish expansion efforts focused on the Timucua and Apalachee provinces west of St. Augustine rather than Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{has four}} {{ecological}} provinces: Prairie Parkland, {{in the southwestern}} and western parts of the state; the Eastern Broadleaf Forest (Big Woods) in the southeast, extending in a narrowing strip to the state's northwestern part, where it transitions into Tallgrass Aspen Parkland; and the northern Laurentian Mixed Forest, a transitional forest between the northern boreal forest and the broadleaf forests to the south. These northern forests are a vast <b>wilderness</b> <b>of</b> pine and spruce trees mixed with patchy stands of birch and poplar.|$|E

5|$|There was an {{important}} link between the Raglan Castle and the surrounding parkland, in particular the Home Park and the Red Deer Park. Historian Robert Liddiard suggests that {{on the basis of}} the views from the castle at this time, the structured nature of the parks would have contrasted with the <b>wilderness</b> <b>of</b> the mountain peaks framing the scene beyond, making {{an important}} statement about the refinement and cultured nature of the castle lord. In the 15th century there were also extensive orchards and fish ponds surrounding the castle, favourably commented upon by contemporaries.|$|E

However, Avar groups survived the destruction of their empire: Regino of Prüm wrote that the Magyars first [...] "roamed the <b>wildernesses</b> <b>of</b> the Pannonians and the Avars" [...] in the Carpathian Basin after their flight from the Pontic steppes. According to historian András Róna-Tas, these <b>wildernesses</b> <b>of</b> the Avars (solitudo Avarorum) were situated in the plains along the rivers Tisza and Danube, including Crişana.|$|R
5|$|In 1974, R.A. Powell raised two fisher kits for {{the purpose}} of {{performing}} scientific research. His primary interest was an attempt to measure the activity of fishers in order to determine how much food the animals required to function. He did this by running them through treadmill exercises that simulated activity in the wild. He compared this to their food intake and used the data to estimate daily food requirements. The research lasted for two years. After one year, one of the fishers died due to unknown causes. The second was released back into the <b>wilderness</b> <b>of</b> Michigan's Upper Peninsula.|$|E

She notes that in the quiet of the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that {{it will be difficult to}} maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death. These words appear to foreshadow the end of , as the singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual/ghostly side.|$|E

The succession, which occurred in the new <b>wilderness</b> <b>of</b> Glacier Bay was stated to be a raw landscape. A simile given is that “It was like seeing an owl with no feathers”. A vegetative wilderness has been created, which has resulted in the coastal forest. 333 Vascular plant species of individual taxa have been recorded in the Glacier Bay.

5|$|The American generals leading their {{shipbuilding}} effort {{encountered a}} variety of challenges. Shipwright was not a common occupation in the relative <b>wilderness</b> <b>of</b> upstate New York, and the Continental Navy had to pay extremely high wages to lure skilled craftsmen away from the coast. The carpenters hired to build boats on Lake Champlain were the best-paid employees of the navy, excepting only the Navy's Commodore, Esek Hopkins. By the end of July {{there were more than}} 200shipwrights at Skenesborough. In addition to skilled help, materials and supplies specific to maritime use needed to be brought to Skenesborough, where the ships were constructed, or Fort Ticonderoga, where they were fitted out for use.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s, the Whigs {{split from}} the Democratic-Republicans in {{response}} to national policies. The Whigs held a strong majority in the General Assembly in that decade. In 1843, {{the remnants of the}} old slavery party had strengthened into the Democratic Party and swept into power, the Whigs never regained their majority and the Democrats maintained power until the middle of the American Civil War. In 1836 the General Assembly passed the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act and set plans into motion to modernize the state's infrastructure. The <b>wilderness</b> <b>of</b> northern and central Indiana was slowly developed as the General Assembly approved the construction of roads, canals, railroads, and numerous other infrastructure projects. This led the state to near bankruptcy in the late 1830s, but it was avoided when the General Assembly spun off the failing canals, and half of their debts, to private companies in 1841. The failure of the projects was the main factor in the Whig's loss of power.|$|E

Furthermore, the values that wilderness provides us will dramatically increase as climate change proceeds. Section II of this article describes the basics <b>of</b> <b>wilderness</b> protection, including the evolution of our relationship with <b>wilderness,</b> the history <b>of</b> the <b>Wilderness</b> Act, and what, how, and why wilderness is protected under the Act.

Section IV argues for passive management <b>of</b> <b>wilderness</b> areas, as it is consistent with the text and purpose of the Act and it best preserves ecological stability.
