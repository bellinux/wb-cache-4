5|$|As President Antonín Novotný {{was losing}} support, Alexander Dubček, First Secretary of the {{regional}} Communist Party of Slovakia, and economist Ota Šik challenged him {{at a meeting of}} the Central Committee. Novotný then invited Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev to Prague that December, seeking support; but Brezhnev <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> extent of the opposition to Novotný and thus supported his removal as Czechoslovakia's leader. Dubček replaced Novotný as First Secretary on 5 January 1968. On 22 March 1968, Novotný resigned his presidency and was replaced by Ludvík Svoboda, who later gave consent to the reforms.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt was {{an ardent}} conservationist, {{assisted}} in this by like-minded appointees, including Interior Secretary James R. Garfield and Chief Forester Gifford Pinchot. Taft {{agreed with the}} need for conservation, but felt it should be accomplished by legislation rather than executive order. He did not retain Garfield, an Ohioan, as secretary, choosing instead a westerner, former Seattle mayor Richard A. Ballinger. Roosevelt <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> replacement, believing that Taft had promised to keep Garfield, and this change was one of the events that caused Roosevelt to realize that Taft would choose different policies.|$|E
5|$|Ross Goodall {{uploaded}} {{the message}} from Capaldi to the video-sharing website YouTube on 6 November 2014. He commented at the video's YouTube location that he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> online response, and {{that at the time}} of initial posting was unaware it would become viral. He later explained that he had uploaded it only to share it with family members on completion of the memorial services for Thomas's grandmother. Thomas's father wrote that the video greatly affected his son, and enabled him to cope with grief and feel comforted. He praised Capaldi for his kind act and explained that the video improved his son's mental well-being throughout the ordeal.|$|E

5|$|Bryant and Milam {{were indicted}} for murder. The grand jury's prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Caldwell, was not {{confident}} {{that he could get}} a conviction in a case of white violence against a black male accused of insulting a white woman. A local black paper <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> indictment and praised the decision, as did the New York Times. The high-profile comments published in Northern newspapers and by the NAACP were of concern to the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; he worried that his office {{would not be able to}} secure a guilty verdict, despite the compelling evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys at a Sumner law firm offered their services pro bono. Their supporters placed collection jars in stores and other public places in the Delta, eventually gathering $10,000 for the defense.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} days, Irwin sold his rights from his {{scoreboard}} business for $2000. Though he sent $1500 to May and only $500 to Elizabeth, his Boston widow <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gesture since Irwin rarely visited Boston and provided almost no {{financial support to}} their family. In fact, May {{said that he had}} not been away from New York {{for more than a few}} days at a time in 27 years. She said that his only long trips were baseball-related, when he would scout players in other cities. Before he left New York for the final time, he told May that he was going to say goodbye to friends in Boston and that he would return to New York. Though neither woman knew of the other, Irwin's New York son Harold learned about an unknown brother while he was visiting his father in the hospital just before Irwin's death.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the game}} was slow to gain popularity. Defender did not attract much {{attention}} at the 1980 AMOA show. In retrospect, Jarvis believed many passersby were intimidated by its complexity. The game, however, was well received in arcades, and crowds gathered around the cabinet during its first nights of play testing. The success spurred Williams to release a cocktail version as well. Defender eventually became Williams' best selling arcade game, with over 55,000units sold worldwide. By 2004, {{the game was}} a popular collector's item; the upright cabinets were common, while the cocktail models were more rare. Since its release, it {{has become one of}} the highest grossing arcade games ever, earning over US$1billion. Williams employee Larry Demar <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> game's popularity, stating that it was the only game he'd seen able to earn that quantity of quarters. Six months after its release, the game was one of the top earners in the United States video game industry. Mark Stearny of JoyStik magazine called Defender the most successful game in 1981, commenting that it outperformed Pac-Man.|$|E

5|$|The first {{title to}} be {{conceived}} was Advent Children, original envisioned as a short film presentation created by Visual Works, the animation studio behind CGI cutscenes for the company's games. Early in pre-production, {{plans to make}} Advent Children a video game rather than a film were considered, but due to several factors including Visual Works' lack of experience with actual game production, it remained a film. One of the main conditions for the project's launch was to reunite the original staff members of Final Fantasy VII: Nojima, art director Yusuke Naora, composer Nobuo Uematsu. After Advent Children began development, it was decided by the team that one title {{was not enough to}} fully explore the VII universe. In response, Before Crisis, Dirge of Cerberus and Crisis Core were conceived so as to embrace more aspects of the world and characters. Nomura himself <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> creation of the games, having originally assumed that the film would be the sole product of the project.|$|E
5|$|When the Germans {{launched}} {{the invasion of}} Crete on 20 May, Kippenberger, {{like most of the}} defenders of the island, <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sight of hundreds of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) descending under parachutes. He quickly recovered and was making his way to his headquarters, when a burst of gunfire from a paratrooper was directed his way. After twisting his ankle in avoiding the gunfire, he stalked and killed the paratrooper with a shot to the head. His brigade was positioned east of Maleme airfield, on the Galatas plains. It was well positioned to counterattack scattered paratroopers who were beginning to consolidate into a good starting position from which an attack on the airfield could be launched. His request to do so was denied by the acting divisional commander, Brigadier Edward Puttick. An attack launched later without Kippenberger's knowledge failed although he believed the outcome could have been different if his troops had been involved.|$|E
25|$|It {{was only}} in 1014, {{at the request of}} the German King Henry II who had come to Rome to be crowned Emperor and <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{different}} custom in force there, that Pope Benedict VIII, who owed to Henry his restoration to the papal throne after usurpation by Antipope Gregory VI, had the Creed, with the addition of Filioque, sung at Mass in Rome for the first time.|$|E

25|$|The initial fan {{reaction}} was mixed with some accusing {{the show of}} adding her to attract more 18–35 male audience members, which was denied by Braga. The character's attire, numerous form-fitting catsuits with distinct rib-lines and a high stiff neck, was criticized by veteran Star Trek writer/producer Ronald D. Moore, who felt she should have a more Borg-like appearance. Her outfit also annoyed some who {{felt that it was}} an attempt by the show's creators to make her sexually appealing to some viewers, without any storyline purposes intended. Ryan <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> immediate fan reaction on the internet, as there was a full website devoted to her which was created only six days after her casting.|$|E
25|$|The Taliban {{promoted}} {{the use of}} the extended family, or zakat system of charity to ensure women should not need to work. However, years of conflict meant that nuclear families often struggled to support themselves let alone aid additional relatives. Qualification for legislation often rested on men, such as food aid which had to be collected by a male relative. The possibility that a woman may not possess any male relatives was dismissed by Mullah Ghaus, the acting foreign minister, who said he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> degree of international attention and concern for such {{a small percentage of the}} Afghan population. For rural women there was generally little change in their circumstance, as their lives were dominated by the unpaid domestic, agricultural and reproductive labour necessary for subsistence.|$|E
25|$|To {{support the}} Irish Rebellion of 1798 the French sent a naval {{expedition}} to Ireland that landed 1,099 soldiers under Jean Joseph Amable Humbert in August 1798. Unaware that Humbert {{was forced to}} surrender on 8 September, a second force of 2,844 troops under Hardy left for Ireland on 16 September. The naval squadron led by Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart was intercepted in the Battle of Tory Island {{and almost all of}} its ships captured, Hardy and most of his men becoming prisoners. He was exchanged in time to join the Army of the Danube in March 1799, but he was ill at the time and did not stay with the army long. Hardy assumed the rank of general of division on 30 July 1799. He was a friend of André Masséna and knew what was happening at his headquarters even though Hardy was not there. During the summer, the French Directory planned to replace Masséna as leader of the Army of the Danube but later decided to confirm him as commander. On 9 September Hardy wrote that Masséna <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> decision.|$|E

500|$|Nintendo {{presented}} a demo clip {{of the new}} game at the 2001 Space World, August 23–26. Response to the cel-shaded design was deeply mixed.

Critics derisively dubbed the game [...] "Celda".

500|$|Cornwallis {{moved to}} Wilmington, North Carolina to regroup, {{and then made}} the {{controversial}} decision to bring his army into Virginia, which he saw as the supply base for Greene's army. [...] Joining with the army of Phillips, he maneuvered against the growing Continental presence led by Lafayette, while continuing to raid and destroy economic and military targets in the state. [...] Eventually his decision to enter Virginia reached Clinton, who <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> move.

The Irish Independent <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> speed multiple different satirical adaptations of the Bale commotion audio including [...] "R U Professional" [...] were put together.
