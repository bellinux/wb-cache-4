5|$|Thomson and Thompson (Dupont et Dupond in Hergé's {{original}} version) are two incompetent detectives {{who look}} like identical twins, their only discernible difference being the shape of their moustaches. First introduced in Cigars of the Pharaoh, they provide much of the comic relief throughout the series, being afflicted with chronic spoonerisms. They are extremely clumsy, thoroughly incompetent, and usually bent on arresting the wrong character. The detectives usually wear bowler hats and carry <b>walking</b> <b>sticks</b> except when sent abroad; during those missions they attempt the national costume of the locality they are visiting, but instead dress in conspicuously stereotypical folkloric attire. The detectives were in part based on Hergé's father Alexis and uncle Léon, identical twins who often took walks together, wearing matching bowler hats while carrying matching <b>walking</b> <b>sticks.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a 63 -year-old female patient with pure akinesia whose gait was fa-cilitated by a handmade converted <b>walking</b> <b>stick.</b> A posterior ventral pallidotomy had been performed, {{but it did}} not alleviate symptoms. Her husband made a <b>walking</b> <b>stick</b> with a wire loop at the bottom, perpendicular to the walking direction. When the patient stepped over the loop, the frozen gait was improved. This converted <b>walking</b> <b>stick</b> is easily made and inexpensive. Although the <b>walking</b> <b>stick</b> did not improve the patient’s gait radically, use of the converted <b>walking</b> <b>stick</b> effectively improved the patient’s daily life because successful treatment of pure akinesia cannot be established.

50|$|In the Eastern Orthodox Church {{and some}} of the Oriental Orthodox Churches an ecclesiastical <b>walking</b> <b>stick</b> is used by bishops, archimandrites and hegumens (abbots) when walking outside.

5|$|Although Hogg spent {{little time}} at the Varner {{plantation}} after Bayou Bend was constructed, she continued to purchase art and antique furniture on its behalf. In the 1950s, she restored the plantation, and each room was given a different theme from Texas history: colonial times, the Confederacy, Napoleonic times (1818), and the Mexican–American War. One room was dedicated to her father, and contained his desk and chair {{as well as his}} collection of <b>walking</b> <b>sticks.</b> She donated the property to the state, and it was dedicated as the Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site in 1958, the 107th anniversary of Jim Hogg's birth.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or <b>walking</b> <b>sticks</b> (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk {{on the surface of the}} water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E

Yet the youth smiled, for {{he saw that}} the world was a world for him, though many discovered it to be made of oaths and <b>walking</b> <b>sticks.</b> He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war.

25|$|<b>Walking</b> <b>sticks</b> (order Phasmatodea), many katydid species (family Tettigoniidae), and moths (order Lepidoptera) {{are just}} a few of the plethora of insects that have evolved {{specialized}} cryptic morphology. This adaptation allows them to effectively hide within their environment because of a resemblance to the general background or an inedible object. When an insect looks like an inedible or inconsequential object in the environment that is of no interest to a predator, such as leaves and twigs, it is said to display mimesis, a form of crypsis.|$|E

25|$|A further investigation, in 2014, {{revealed}} {{that it was}} unlikely he {{had been killed in}} a chariot accident. Scans found that all but one of his bone fractures, including those to his skull, had been inflicted after his death. The scans also showed that he had a partially clubbed foot and would have been unable to stand unaided, thus making it unlikely he ever rode in a chariot; this was supported by the presence of many <b>walking</b> <b>sticks</b> among the contents of his tomb. Instead, it is believed that genetic defects arising from his parents being siblings, complications from a broken leg and his suffering from malaria, together caused his death.|$|E

A particular weaponry on display is the scissor-action dagger, which when thrust into an enemy's body is said to disembowel the victim, on its withdrawal. The other artefacts on display include swords with pistols attached to it, the sword presented by Queen Victoria to Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh (1835–80), guns serving as <b>walking</b> <b>sticks</b> and a small canon.|$|E

25|$|On 15 July 1255, Pope Alexander IV {{issued the}} bull, Cum quaedam salubria, to command {{a number of}} {{religious}} groupings to gather {{for the purpose of}} being amalgamated into a new Order of Hermits of Saint Augustine. The delegates from other small religious communities met in Rome on 1 March 1256, which resulted in a union. Lanfranc Septala of Milan, Prior of the Bonites, was appointed the first Prior General of the newly constituted Order. The belted, black tunic of the Tuscan hermits was adopted as the common religious habit, and the <b>walking</b> <b>sticks</b> carried by the Bonites in keeping with eremetical tradition—and to distinguish themselves from those hermits who went around begging—ceased to be used.|$|E
25|$|Some {{statues of}} Joseph depict his staff as topped with flowers, recalling the non-canonical Protoevangelion's {{account of how}} Mary's spouse was chosen by {{collecting}} the <b>walking</b> <b>sticks</b> of widowers in Palestine, and Joseph's alone bursting into flower, thus identifying him as divinely chosen. The Golden Legend, which derives its account from the much older Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, tells a similar story, although it notes that all marriageable men of the Davidic line and not only widowers were ordered by the High Priest to present their rods at the Temple. Several Eastern Orthodox Nativity icons show Joseph tempted by the Devil (depicted as {{an old man with}} furled wings) to break off his betrothal, and how he resists that temptation. There are some paintings with him wearing a Jewish hat.|$|E
25|$|Local {{fishermen}} {{had always}} {{been aware of the}} existence of the wrecks, and had explored them and removed small artifacts, often using grappling hooks to pull up pieces, which they sold to tourists. In 1446, Cardinal Prospero Colonna and Leon Battista Alberti followed up on the stories regarding the remains and discovered them lying at a depth of , which at that time was too deep for effective salvage. They caused significant damage to the ships by using ropes with hooks to tear planks from them. Alberti learned little more than the type of wood and that it was covered in lead sheathing. In 1535, Francesco De Marchi dove on the wreck using a diving bell. His finds included bricks, marble paving stones, bronze, copper, lead artefacts and a great number of timber beams. He had all of the wood made into items such as <b>walking</b> <b>sticks</b> and boxes. De Marchi apparently sold everything he collected to the nobility and foreign visitors who visited the site to watch his work. From material recovered he added the knowledge that mortise and tenon joints had been used in their construction. Despite the successful salvage of entire structures and parts, there was no academic interest in the ships, so no further research was performed. The objects recovered were lost and their fate remains unknown.|$|E
