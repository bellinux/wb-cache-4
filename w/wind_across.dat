5|$|The {{combination}} of rough seas and winds uprooted {{long stretches of}} trees and wrecked numerous ships. The entire town of Savanna-la-Mar was nearly destroyed by the hurricane's effects, which included damage to several local churches. The storm also virtually destroyed the communities of Green Island, Lucea, and Negril, where a church remained the only standing structure. In Montego Bay, at least 300people were left homeless, many of whom temporarily lived in the courthouse after losing their homes. A total of 42people {{were killed in the}} city. Several other wharves along the coast were swept away due to the waves and <b>wind.</b> <b>Across</b> western Jamaica, roughly a hundred homes were destroyed, while 5,000buildings were damaged or demolished. Due to the destruction caused by the tropical cyclone, Jamaica governor Sydney Olivier, 1st Baron Olivier assessed damage in the western portion of the island. The government of Jamaica ordered the dispatch of artillerymen in order to bring 300tents and other relief supplies to impacted regions. Additionally, money was raised to aid those who became homeless.|$|E

[...] Author Marjory Stoneman Douglas, who would later become famous for publicizing the need for conserving and restoring the Everglades, based the hero of her 1930 short story [...] "Plumes" [...] on Bradley.

500|$|On February 6, {{a slight}} risk of severe weather was issued {{for much of}} the eastern United States from Pennsylvania to the Florida Panhandle as the squall line raced eastward ahead of the cold front. After several {{additional}} tornadoes touched down in Alabama during the early morning hours just before dawn, the primary severe weather threat became damaging <b>wind</b> <b>across</b> the Mid-Atlantic States. No additional tornadoes were reported during the late morning and afternoon as the cold front exited into the Atlantic Ocean, although wind damage was reported across eastern Kentucky, eastern Pennsylvania and most of Georgia. [...] Farther north, snow and freezing rain, at times heavy, continued from Iowa to Quebec until February 7 as the center of the system moved slowly out of the area.|$|E
500|$|The {{young are}} precocial and already covered in down when they {{emerge from the}} eggs. Soon after they are hatched the female leads the chicks {{to one of the}} many wadis that <b>wind</b> <b>across</b> the plains and there she teaches them to peck at and ingest seeds. It is four or five weeks before they are fledged and able to fly. Meanwhile, the problem of {{supplying}} them with water is solved by the male which has specially adapted, absorbent down on his belly. While at the waterhole he immerses himself in the water to saturate the plumage which absorbs a quantity that is sufficient for the chicks to last them until the following day. When he leaves the waterhole with his water-laden feathers, the male emits a repeated high-pitched [...] "queet - queet - queet" [...] calls. When the female and chicks pick up the sounds of his approach, they reciprocate, and by this means the male can find his family even when they have moved away from the nest. On his arrival he assumes an upright posture and raises his wings, displaying the wet belly feathers. This is the sign for the chicks to approach and stand underneath him with their beaks upturned and suck the fluid from between the feathers.|$|E

60|$|The {{drifting}} {{and charging}} {{and a little}} booing went on for some time. Every now and then some one clambered {{to a point of}} vantage, began a speech and was pulled down by policemen. And at last across the confusion came an idea, like a <b>wind</b> <b>across</b> a pond.|$|E
60|$|Winter came late, {{but with}} a fury which appalled the strong hearts of the settlers.

The month of December was {{incredibly}} severe.|$|E
60|$|And {{it was so}} to {{a certain}} extent with Helen.

Then she started, and in a moment more would have been on her way home.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the winter}} {{prevailing}} winds {{are out of}} the north across the panhandle south to [...] near Orlando, but are variable {{in the rest of the}} state.

60|$|Nay, {{even the}} fine dust which is {{sometimes}} {{blown out of}} volcanos is useful to countries far away.

60|$|And Selpa scolded me to sleep, and in {{the morning}} woke me with her chatter, ever declaiming against my madness, ever pronouncing her claim upon me and the claims of our children, till in the end I grew weary, and forsook my far vision, and said never again would I dream of bestriding the wild horse to fly swift as its feet and the <b>wind</b> <b>across</b> the sands and the grass lands.|$|E
60|$|That evening, {{while the}} wind was {{wheeling}} round and round the dwelling, and the calm eye of the lighthouse afar was the single speck perceptible {{of the outside world}} from the door of Ethelberta's temporary home, the music of songs mingled with the stroke of the <b>wind</b> <b>across</b> the iron railings, and was swept on in the general tide of the gale, and the noise of the rolling sea, till not the echo of a tone remained.|$|E

60|$|He {{would read}} tales about hunters and explorers, and imagine himself riding mustangs as fleet as the <b>wind</b> <b>across</b> the prairies of Western America, or coming as a conquering and adored white man into the {{swarming}} villages of Central Africa. He shot bears with a revolver--a {{cigarette in the}} other hand--and made a necklace of their teeth and claws for the chief's beautiful young daughter. Also he killed a lion with a pointed stake, stabbing through the beast's heart as it stood over him.|$|E
6000|$|Chini is {{some twenty}} marches from Simla, {{in the heart}} of the Hills, and the scenery is good if you are in trouble.

[...] So little Dumoise was packed off to Chini, to wear down his grief with a full-plate camera, and a rifle. He took also a useless bearer, because the man had been his wife's favorite servant. He was idle and a thief, but Dumoise trusted everything to him.|$|E
60|$|The {{old lady}} went {{away with her}} medicine, and Mr. Shaynor and I stamped on the tiled floor behind the counter to keep {{ourselves}} warm. The shop, {{by the light of}} the many electrics, looked like a Paris-diamond mine, for Mr. Cashell believed in all the ritual of his craft. Three superb glass jars-- red, green, and blue--of the sort that led Rosamund to parting with her shoes--blazed in the broad plate-glass windows, and there was a confused smell of orris, Kodak films, vulcanite, tooth-powder, sachets, and almond- cream in the air. Mr. Shaynor fed the dispensary stove, and we sucked cayenne-pepper jujubes and menthol lozenges. The brutal east wind had cleared the streets, and the few passers-by were muffled to their puckered eyes. In the Italian warehouse next door some gay feathered birds and game, hung upon hooks, sagged to the <b>wind</b> <b>across</b> the left edge of our window-frame.|$|E
