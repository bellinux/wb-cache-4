40|$|More {{and more}} people are putting away their {{eyeglasses}} and contact lenses as a result of laser vision correction surgery. LASIK, the most widely performed version of this surgical procedure, improves vision by reshaping the cornea, the clear front surface of the eye, using an excimer laser. One excimer laser system, Alcon s LADARVision 4000, utilizes a laser radar (LADAR) eye tracking device that gives it unmatched precision. During LASIK surgery, laser During LASIK surgery, laser pulses must be accurately placed to reshape the cornea. A challenge to this procedure is the patient <b>s</b> constant <b>eye</b> movement. A person <b>s</b> <b>eyes</b> make small, involuntary movements known as saccadic movements about 100 times per second. Since the saccadic movements will not stop during LASIK surgery, most excimer laser systems use an eye tracking device that measures the movements and guides the placement of the laser beam. LADARVision <b>s</b> <b>eye</b> tracking device stems from the LADAR technology originally developed through several Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts with NASA s Johnson Space Center and the U.

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the reliability and}} sensitivity to change of the timed standing balance test in children with Down syndrome (DS). Methods: It was a nonblinded, comparison study with {{a convenience sample of}} subjects consisting of children with DS (n = 9) aged 8 – 17 years. The main outcome measure was standing balance which was assessed using timed standing balance test, the time required to maintain in four conditions, eyes open static, eyes closed static, eyes open dynamic, and eyes closed dynamic. Results: Relative reliability was excellent for all four conditions with an Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) ranging from 0. 91 to 0. 93. The variation between repeated measurements for each condition was minimal with standard error of measurement (SEM) of 0. 21 – 0. 59 s, suggestive of excellent absolute reliability. The sensitivity to change as measured by smallest real change (SRC) was 1. 27 <b>s</b> for <b>eyes</b> open static, 1. 63 <b>s</b> for <b>eyes</b> closed static, 0. 58 <b>s</b> for <b>eyes</b> open dynamic, and 0. 61 <b>s</b> for <b>eyes</b> closed static.

40|$|Background: Benchmarking is {{increasingly}} considered a useful management instrument to improve quality in health care, but {{little is known}} about its applicability in hospital settings. Purpose: The aims of this study were to assess the applicability of a benchmarking project in U. <b>S.</b> <b>eye</b> hospitals and compare the results with an international initiative. Methodology:We evaluated multiple cases by applying an evaluation frame abstracted from the literature to five U. <b>S.</b> <b>eye</b> hospitals that used a set of 10 indicators for efficiency benchmarking. Qualitative analysis entailed 46 semistructured face-to-face interviews with stakeholders, document analyses, and questionnaires. Findings: The case studies only partially met the conditions of the evaluation frame. Although learning and quality improvement were stated as overall purposes, the benchmarking initiative was at first focused on efficiency only. No ophthalmic outcomes were included, and clinicians were skeptical about their reporting relevance and disclosure. However, in contrast with earlier findings in international eye hospitals, all U. S. hospitals worked with internal indicators that were integrated in their performance management systems and supported benchmarking. Benchmarking can support performancemanagement in individual hospitals. Having a certain number of comparable institutes provide similar services in a noncompetitive milieu seems to lay fertile ground for benchmarking...|$|R

Specifically, TeleOph allows a trained nonspecialist in a primary clinic to screen the patients with digital instruments (e. g., camera, ophthalmoscope). The acquired medical data are delivered to the hospital where an ophthalmologist will review the data collected and, if required, provide further consultation for the patient through a real-time secure channel established over a public Internet network. If necessary, the ophthalmologist is able to further sample the images/video of the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>eyes</b> remotely.
