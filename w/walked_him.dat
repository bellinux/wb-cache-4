25|$|The gangsters drove Kilroy {{through the}} back {{streets of the city}} and past an {{industrial}} area. The number of bars and vendor stands in the street began to thin out as they drove Kilroy through a highway in the city's outskirts. The gangsters then turned to a dirt road that stretched between two corn fields. When they got to the private ranch known as Santa Elena, they left Kilroy inside the car overnight. Shortly after dawn, the ranch's caretaker went to see Kilroy and fed him bread, eggs, and water. About twelve hours after Kilroy was kidnapped, Contanzo and his men came to see him. They wrapped his face and mouth with duct tape and <b>walked</b> <b>him</b> through a field to a storage cabin with his hands still tied around his back.|$|E
25|$|Now it {{happened}} that on a cold and wintry day, as Lillinonah was out walking in the woods high above the swift rapids of the Housatonic, she came upon a handsome young white man wandering aimlessly through the forest, stumbling occasionally and falling to his knees before rising once more and continuing on. It was obvious to the Indian maiden {{that the man was}} sick with cold and fever, weak of body and confused of mind. With pity in her heart for the suffering stranger, she offered to assist him back to the village of the Pootatucks, where he might find rest and treatment for his illness. When the white man nodded his assent, she slowly <b>walked</b> <b>him</b> to her home, though he had to lean heavily upon her for support, lest he collapse in the effort.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{was driven}} to a beach cottage, where the rope around his ankles was {{loosened}} sufficiently to enable him to make steps. Ross and his partners <b>walked</b> <b>him</b> into the house, {{one of the men}} leading him on a nylon leash, another holding his handcuffs. Ross and his partners had made the house a virtual prison; the windows were covered with thick nylon straps forming a mesh, to prevent escape. The two doors to the room where he was held were guarded. His captors also took his shoes and fitted the room with motion detectors. According to Shupe and Darnell's (2006) account of court testimony, Scott demanded that he be allowed to leave, and asked Ross whether he would try to make him change his religious beliefs. Ross was said to have replied that that was what he was paid to do. When Scott threatened Ross with criminal prosecution, Ross was said to have threatened Scott that he would handcuff him to the bed frame.|$|E

500|$|Officer Lang {{observed}} that Drayton and Brown were wearing [...] "heavy jackets and baggy pants", despite warm weather that day. Lang suspected Brown and Drayton {{might have been}} using their baggy clothing to conceal weapons or drugs, so he asked Brown, [...] "o you mind if I check your person?" [...] Brown responded, [...] "ure", leaned up in his seat, removed a cellular phone from his pocket, and opened his jacket. Lang patted down the outside of his clothing and felt small packages [...] "similar to drug packages detected on other occasions". Officer Lang then arrested Brown, handcuffed him, and Officer Hoover <b>walked</b> <b>him</b> off the bus. Lang then asked Drayton, [...] "ind if I check you?", to which Drayton responded [...] "by lifting his hands about eight inches from his legs". Lang detected similar objects during a pat down of Drayton's legs, placed him under arrest, and escorted him off the bus. A further search determined that Brown had duct-taped three bundles containing 483 grams of cocaine between several layers of boxer shorts, and Drayton had duct-taped two bundles between several layers of boxer shorts containing 295 grams of cocaine.|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{took the}} decisive {{lead in the}} top of the ninth inning. Matty Alou pinch hit for Larsen and singled to lead off the inning and Kuenn {{grounded}} into a force out at second base. Willie McCovey pinch hit for Hiller and walked to advance Kuenn. Ernie Bowman pinch ran for McCovey and Felipe Alou walked to load the bases. Mays hit a line drive single scoring Kuenn. Roebuck barely managed to knock the ball down to hold Mays to a single and Mays said he was [...] "still mad" [...] after the game because he had expected more off of the hit. Stan Williams relieved Roebuck and Cepeda hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game at 4–4 and advance Alou to third. Mays moved to second on a wild pitch to Bailey and Williams intentionally <b>walked</b> <b>him</b> to reload the bases. Williams walked Davenport to give the Giants a 5–4 lead, and they added to it as Pagán reached on an error by second baseman Larry Burright allowing Mays to score and extend the lead to 6–4. Billy Pierce pitched a perfect bottom of the ninth to end the game, earning his only save of the season. Had the Dodgers not yielded the lead in the final inning they instead would have earned a postseason berth, their first since winning the pennant via a tie-breaker in 1959.|$|E
2500|$|He later {{attributed}} {{his decision}} to an event: on 2 July 1505, he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home. During a thunderstorm, a lightning bolt struck near him. Later telling his father he was terrified of death and divine judgment, he cried out, [...] "Help! Saint Anna, I will become a monk!" [...] He came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break. He left law school, sold his books, and entered St. Augustine's Monastery in Erfurt on 17 July 1505. One friend blamed the decision on Luther's sadness over the deaths of two friends. Luther himself seemed saddened by the move. Those who attended a farewell supper <b>walked</b> <b>him</b> {{to the door of}} the Black Cloister. [...] "This day you see me, and then, not ever again," [...] he said. His father was furious over what he saw as a waste of Luther's education.|$|E

2500|$|Against {{the protests}} {{of the three}} women, the {{officers}} simply covered Sinthasomphone with a towel and <b>walked</b> <b>him</b> to Dahmer's apartment where, {{in an effort to}} verify his claim that he and Sinthasomphone were lovers, Dahmer showed the officers the two semi-nude Polaroid pictures he had taken of the youth the previous evening. The officers later reported having noted a strange scent reminiscent of excrement inside the apartment (this odor emanated from the decomposing body of Hughes). Dahmer stated that to investigate this, one officer simply [...] "peeked his head around the bedroom but really didn't take a good look." [...] The officers then left, with a departing remark that Dahmer [...] "take good care" [...] of Sinthasomphone. Had they conducted a background check upon Dahmer, it would have revealed that he was a convicted child molester under probation. Upon the departure of the two police officers from his apartment, Dahmer again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone's brain; on this second occasion, the injection proved fatal. The following day, May 28, Dahmer took a day's leave from work to devote himself to the dismemberment of the bodies of Sinthasomphone and Hughes, whose decomposing body had been lying in his bedroom as police brought Sinthasomphone back to his apartment. He retained both victims' skulls.|$|E
2500|$|On Monday morning Byrne brought {{two horses}} to be shod, but the {{blacksmith}} suspected something strange in his manner, so {{he noted the}} horse's brands (according to Kenneally, the blacksmith {{was struck by the}} quality of these so-called police horses and thus noted their brands; according also to this version, the shoeing of the horses was charged to the government of New South Wales). About 10am the Kellys, with their hostage Constable Richards, went from the barracks, closely followed on horseback by Hart and Byrne. They all went to the Royal Hotel, where Cox, the landlord, told Richards that his companions were the Kellys. Ned Kelly said they wanted rooms at the Royal, and revealed his intentions to rob the bank. Hart and Byrne rode to the back and told the groom to stable their horses, but not to give them any feed. Hart went into the kitchen of the hotel, a few yards from the back entrance to the bank. Byrne then entered the rear of the bank, when he met the accountant, Mr Living, who told him to use the front entrance. Byrne displayed his revolver and induced him to surrender. Kenneally wrote, [...] "The shock caused Living to stutter and it has been alleged that he stuttered {{for the rest of his}} life." [...] Byrne then <b>walked</b> <b>him</b> and Mackie, the junior accountant, into the bar, where Dan Kelly was on guard. Ned Kelly secured the bank manager, Mr Tarleton, who was ordered to open the safes. When this was done, he was put in with the others. All were liberated at a quarter to three.|$|E
