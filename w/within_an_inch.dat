500|$|French {{forces had}} {{captured}} Aleppo on 23 July without a fight, and after their victory at Maysalun, French troops besieged and captured Damascus on 25 July. Within a short time, {{the majority of}} Faisal's forces fled or surrendered to the French, although parties of Arab groups opposed to French rule continued to resist before being quickly defeated. King Faisal returned to Damascus on 25 July and asked al-Durubi to form a government, although al-Durubi had already decided on the composition of his cabinet, which was confirmed by the French. General Gouraud condemned Faisal's rule in Syria, accusing him of having [...] "dragged the country to <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of destruction", and stating that because of this, it was [...] "utterly {{impossible for him to}} remain in the country". Faisal denounced Gouraud's statement and insisted that he remained the sovereign head of Syria whose authority he was [...] "granted by the Syrian people".|$|E

The song was later performed {{as part of}} her world tour, the Get Sleazy Tour, as {{it was part of the}} concert's set-list. During the performance, Kesha was backed with dancers and band members that were dressed in an array of dinosaur costumes. Actress Heather Morris covered the song in the television series Glee in the episode titled [...] "Prom-asaurus". It was aired on May 8, 2012, and is the 19th episode of that season. The episode's plot revolves around prom with its theme involving dinosaurs. Morris' character, Brittany S. Pierce, covered the song in the episode, performing a choreographed dance routine to it. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote that the episode's performance was [...] "a small victory", and concluded that it was the best performance of that episode. Erin Strecker of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song was [...] "auto-tuned <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of its life", but praised Pierce's performance, writing [...] "but Brittany can totally move."

500|$|Spoilt Rotten {{was chosen}} by Jasper Fforde on the Penguin Books website {{as one of the}} books he would most like to get for Christmas. Fforde wrote that the book, [...] "makes uneasy reading for huggy liberals, and asks harsh {{questions}} over the bizarre sense of sentimentality that seems to have befuddled us Brits ever since millions of us queued up to sign a book of condolences for a princess we didn't know. Dalrymple looks at the downside of an overblown sense of sentiment, which resulted this year with a murderous thug who saw himself as a victim and found 32,000 people agreeing with him, and even opening a tribute Facebook page in his posthumous honor". Spoilt Rotten also made Thomas Sowell's list of Christmas books for 2010. A positive review in The Scotsman stated, [...] "Dalrymple tackles sentimentality on every front. He is frequently witty, always punchy and sometimes rapier-like, as he analyses the 'bunk' of his opponents to <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of its cant". In the Daily Express, Neil Hamilton reviewed the book positively, writing, [...] "Theodore Dalrymple's excellent Spoilt Rotten offers some thought-provoking insights and explains how emotional constipation in our national psyche has become emotional diarrhoea".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{felt that}} the CD version of the album was [...] "not all that much fun to hear, even if the reinterpretations of the 20-year-old hits are interesting. The DVD doesn't feel as cold thanks entirely to the pizzazz of the visuals and the {{determined}} efficiency of the show, but even so, this is primarily {{of interest to the}} diehards who don't mind purchasing another live CD/DVD set just a year after the first." [...] Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine {{felt that the}} concert finale in the album [...] "is a reminder that Madonna's music need not be motivated by sex or politics to be good as long as it displays a smidgen of heart and soul." [...] Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine also complimented the finale of the tour. According to him, [...] " [...] is almost exclusively up-tempo, staged <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of its life yet more vivacious than anything she's done in years. Its CD companion is a pared-down 13 tracks taken from the live show, and good God it smokes." [...] However, he felt that the disc loses its momentum during the [...] "Confessions" [...] part, which demonstrates a trio of individuals confessing about their sufferings in life.|$|E
500|$|The South Drawing Room is at {{the front}} of the house on the West Wing. In earlier times the room had served as a dining room, despite it being about as far from the kitchen as possible. This section of the house was largely remodelled under Henry Holland, but it retains its Georgian elegance today, [...] "gilded to <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of its life", with walls painted in a duck egg blue colour with forest green drapery and peach-patterned sofas. A large mirror with an {{exquisite}} gold frame stands between the two windows. The fireplace was added by the Chelsea stonemason Lancelot Edward Wood in 1802, and the ceiling by master builder Benjamin Broadbent of Leicester in 1865. The ceiling in the Yellow Drawing Room, also known as the Rubens Room because of its four Rubens paintings, is also attributed to Broadbent. There are numerous paintings on the walls, including fifteen Joshua Reynolds portraits and a miniature portrait in one of the alcoves of Admiral Lord Nelson, an associate of George John, Second Earl Spencer. Although Higgerson, the night watchman, guarded the place from 8 pm to 8 am, in 1954 one of the lesser valuable paintings in the South Drawing Room was stolen in the night.|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} me for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, and let me tell you why: I was too young and too stupid to realize that I was in a lot of danger." ...|$|E

Hoare went on to claim that the IRA had come <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of blowing up Hammersmith Bridge, Southwark Power Station, and an aqueduct in North London. They had collected detailed information about important bridges, railway lines, munition dumps, war factories and airfields and even engaged in a plan to blow up the Houses of Parliament.|$|E

2500|$|The western {{style is}} {{seen in a long}} stirrup length, often longer than even that used by {{dressage}} riders, an upright posture (equitation riders are never to lean forward beyond a very slight inclination), and the distinctive one-handed hold on the reins. The reining hand should be bent at the elbow, held close to the rider's side, and centered over the horse's neck, usually <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of the saddle horn. Due to the presence of the saddle horn, a true straight line between rider's hand and horse's mouth is usually not possible. Common faults of western riders include slouching, hands that are too high or too low, and poor position, particularly a tendency to sit on the horse as if they were sitting in a chair, with their feet stuck too far forward. While this [...] "feet on the dashboard" [...] style is used by rodeo riders to stay on a bucking horse, it is in practice an ineffective way to ride.|$|E
2500|$|The Shining {{was among}} the first half-dozen films [...] (after the 1976 films Bound for Glory, Marathon Man, and Rocky), to use the newly {{developed}} Steadicam, a stabilizing mount for a motion picture camera, which mechanically separates the operator's movement from the camera's, allowing smooth tracking shots while the operator is moving over an uneven surface. It essentially combines the stabilized steady footage of a regular mount with the fluidity and flexibility of a handheld camera. The inventor of the Steadicam, Garrett Brown, was heavily involved with the production of The Shining. Brown has described his excitement taking his first tour of the sets which offered [...] "further possibilities for the Steadicam". This tour convinced Brown to become personally involved with the production. Kubrick was not [...] "just talking of stunt shots and staircases". Rather he would use the Steadicam [...] "as it was intended to be used— as a tool which can help get the lens where it's wanted in space and time without the classic limitations of the dolly and crane". Brown used an 18mm Cooke lens that allowed the Steadicam to pass <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of walls and door frames. Brown published an article in American Cinematographer about his experience, and contributed to the audio commentary on the 2007 DVD release.|$|E

[...] Sen also added that although the film has been impressively produced, it has been let down by the over-the-top acting by Khan, while other actors were underused and were given nothing much to do." [...] Rajeev Masand gave the film two out of five stars, calling it [...] "spectacularly boring", and wrote [...] "Don 2 is nicely shot, and there are moments where Shah Rukh Khan is riveting. But that’s not enough to hold your interest for well over two hours…even the actor’s most loyal fans will find themselves yawning." [...] Sonia Chopra of Sify also gave 2.5 out of 5, feeling that the original film was better {{as compared to the}} sequel but praised the action sequences, writing [...] "The car chases are superb and will have you at the edge of your seat. For the rest of the film though, you'll be slouching on that very seat, waiting for the thrills that the Don series promises."
