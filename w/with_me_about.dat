500|$|Interest in {{adapting}} Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? developed {{shortly after}} its 1968 publication. Director Martin Scorsese {{was interested in}} filming the novel, but never optioned it. Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert: [...] "Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done... Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the project. And the first thing I said {{to him when he}} got off the plane was, 'Shall I beat you up here at the airport, or shall I beat you up back at my apartment? ...|$|E
500|$|... "Climax" [...] {{was written}} by Usher, Redd Stylez, Ariel Rechtshaid, and Diplo, who also {{produced}} the song. Diplo introduced the song's concept to Usher, who was working {{with him on a}} new album. Usher wanted to expand his music's style and depth by working with Diplo. Diplo recounted the experience in an interview for The Guardian, saying that [...] "I had explained to him about a moment I had with a girl where I felt like I could die with her and be content, but I didn't and life moved on, and that point in my life was over. It was a sad feeling but it was beautiful. He was relating <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the idea and how many times you think things are perfect and feel that way but they can pass." [...] They discussed the concept throughout the song's development and how it relates to Usher's life, as Diplo [...] "tried to help realise these lyrics and feelings." [...] After conceiving some melody lines, they wrote the song in about an hour.|$|E
2500|$|Later in 1970, {{the sitcom}} Bridget Loves Bernie was {{cancelled}} by American Broadcasting Company because protests by the Jewish community — which had begun with letter writing — evolved into physical threats from the JDL. Meredith Baxter, the female lead, said, [...] "We had bomb threats on the show. Some {{guys from the}} Jewish Defense League {{came to my house}} to say they wanted to talk <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> changing the show." ...|$|E

2500|$|Searle defines {{intentionality}} as {{the power}} of minds to be about, to represent (see Correspondence theory of truth), or to stand for, things, properties and states of affairs in the world. The nature of intentionality {{is an important part}} of discussions of Searle's [...] "Philosophy of Mind". Searle emphasizes that the word ‘intentionality, (the part of the mind directed to/from/about objects and relations in the world independent of mind) should not be confused with the word ‘intensionality’ (the logical property of some sentences that do not pass the test of 'extensionality'). In Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind (1983), Searle applies certain elements of his account(s) of [...] "illocutionary acts" [...] to the investigation of intentionality. Searle also introduces a technical term the Background, which, according to him, has been the source of much philosophical discussion ("though I have been arguing for this thesis for almost twenty years," [...] Searle writes, [...] "many people whose opinions I respect still disagree <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it.") Background he calls the set of abilities, capacities, tendencies, and dispositions that humans have and that are not themselves intentional states. Thus, when someone asks us to [...] "cut the cake" [...] we know to use a knife and when someone asks us to [...] "cut the grass" [...] we know to use a lawnmower (and not vice versa), even though the actual request did not include this detail. Searle sometimes supplements his reference to the Background with the concept of the Network, one's network of other beliefs, desires, and other intentional states necessary for any particular intentional state to make sense. Searle argues that the concept of a Background is similar to the concepts provided by several other thinkers, including Wittgenstein's private language argument ("the work of the later Wittgenstein is in large part about the Background") and Pierre Bourdieu's habitus.|$|E
