5|$|In many ways, Niobium {{is similar}} to {{tantalum}} and zirconium. It reacts with most nonmetals at high temperatures; with fluorine at room temperature; with chlorine and hydrogen at 200°C; and with nitrogen at 400°C, <b>with</b> <b>products</b> that are frequently interstitial and nonstoichiometric. The metal begins to oxidize in air at 200°C. It resists corrosion by fused alkalis and by acids, including aqua regia, hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric and phosphoric acids. Niobium is attacked by hydrofluoric acid and hydrofluoric/nitric acid mixtures.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the association of F 5 gene Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) with the incidence of thrombosis. Blood samples were collected from 40 patients {{during the period from}} November 2014 to January 2015, from Critical Care Unit (CCU) of (Yarmook Hospital, Kadhimiya Hospital), as well as from 10 unrelated healthy control group. This study found the age group between 50 to 60 are more susceptible to thrombosis 45 % and the thrombosis was more frequent in male 55 % from female 45 % the significant (p< 0. 01). Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from whole blood samples, whereas, serum samples were analyzed using troponin test (TNT) for detection of thrombosis. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was achieved on extracted DNA using eleven specific primers for F 5 gene:the first primer (Fve 3) <b>with</b> <b>product</b> size (228 bp), second primer (Fve 4) <b>with</b> <b>product</b> size (310 bp), third primer (Fve 6) <b>with</b> <b>product</b> size(547 bp), fourth primer (Fve 7) <b>with</b> <b>product</b> size (241 bp), fifth primer (Fve 8) <b>with</b> <b>product</b> size (306 bp), sixth primer (Fve 12) <b>with</b> <b>product</b> size (286 bp), seventh primer (Fve 13 a) <b>with</b> <b>product</b> length (260 bp), eighth primer (Fve 13 c) <b>with</b> <b>product</b> size (317 bp), ninth primer (Fve 15) <b>with</b> <b>product</b> size (600 bp), tenth primer (Fve 16) <b>with</b> <b>product</b> size (333 bp) and eleventh primer (Fve 25) <b>with</b> <b>product</b> size (390 bp). PCR products of F 5 gene were sequenced. Result found to be change in DNA which was mostly SNP. This change was in three types: substitution 24. 86 %, insertion 28. 57 % and deletion 28. 57 %, a Leiden mutation was also identified among patients...|$|R

5|$|New Zealand {{units were}} to be capped in number and {{were to be}} {{allocated}} to participants either by grandparenting (gifting) or auctioning. Sectors of the economy were to have progressively entered the NZ ETS, with forestry the first from January 2008 and agriculture last in January 2013. Allocation rules varied between sectors. In general, participants who could pass on costs of the ETS, such as fuel companies, would not be allocated free units. Participants such as exporters <b>with</b> <b>products</b> that are priced internationally, would be allocated free units.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{customer}} {{demand for}} the product, another major reason for the reintroduction was due to a significant rise {{in the cost of}} beef. During the previous few {{months leading up to the}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries, the available cattle stocks had declined since the USDA began record keeping in 1973. This shortage of ground beef caused a spike in the price of beef to all-time highs in June 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, increasing competition from McDonald's, Wendy's and other chains in the fast food industry drove Burger King to boost sales by introducing new products along similar lines. Two major competitors had been revamping their menus <b>with</b> <b>products</b> such as variations on the McDouble from McDonald's and sandwiches based on pretzel-style buns from Wendy's.|$|E

5|$|Produced by Sara Lee's Douwe Egberts brand, BK Joe was Burger King's coffee {{line that}} was first {{introduced}} in 2001 in North America and later in parts of Europe. Advertised as being made from Arabica coffee, the product was made using Douwe's Cafitesse system, a platform that eschews coffee brewed from ground beans {{in favor of a}} beverage made from a coffee concentrate with hot water added. Sara Lee claims the advantage of the system is that each cup of coffee is made at the time of order with minimal waste and labor. The product was not designed to compete <b>with</b> <b>products</b> from companies such as Starbucks, but was intended to appeal to customers who seek a consistent cup of coffee.|$|E

Okuguchi (2005) has shown that Bertrand price-adjusting oligopoly <b>with</b> <b>product</b> differentiation and symmetric firms is quasi-competitive but not perfectly competitive in the limit state of infinite number of firms. This paper formulates and analyzes two types of Cournot output-adjusting oligopoly <b>with</b> <b>product</b> differentiation and symmetric firms, in one of which symmetric firms producing the same goods are assumed to collude, and in the other, collusion is ruled out. The limit states are shown to be different in two oligopolies but they are both quasi-competitive. Copyright � 2007 The Author; Journal compilation � 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
