500|$|Depp and Burton derived their Willy Wonka from children's {{television}} show hosts such as Bob Keeshan (Captain Kangaroo), Fred Rogers, and Al Lewis from The Uncle Al Show, and Depp also took inspiration from various game show hosts. Burton recalled {{from his childhood}} that the characters were bizarre but left lasting impressions. He said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strange amalgamation of these weird children's TV show hosts." [...] Depp based Wonka's look (over-exaggerated bob cut and sunglasses) on Vogue magazine editor Anna Wintour.|$|E
500|$|Hair {{challenged}} many of {{the norms}} held by Western society in 1968. [...] The name itself, inspired {{by the name of}} a Jim Dine painting depicting a comb and a few strands of hair, was a reaction to the restrictions of civilization and consumerism and a preference for naturalism. [...] Rado remembers that long hair [...] "was a visible form of awareness in the consciousness expansion. The longer the hair got, the more expansive the mind was. Long hair was shocking, and it was a revolutionary act to grow long hair. It <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flag, really." ...|$|E

So it's a nice contrast with the house." [...] For the Ministry of Magic set, he noted, [...] "This is an underground world; this is a ministry, so we went to the real ministries, the Muggle ministries – Whitehall, in London – and decided that our magical ministry <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> parallel universe to these real ministries." ...|$|E
500|$|During this period, Ochs {{was taking}} drugs {{to get through}} performances. He had been taking Valium for years to help control his nerves, {{and he was also}} {{drinking}} heavily. Pianist Lincoln Mayorga said of that period, [...] "He was physically abusing himself very badly on that tour. He was drinking a lot of wine and taking uppers. The wine was pulling him one way and the uppers were pulling him another way, and he <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mess. There were so many pharmaceuticals around—so many pills. I'd never seen anything like that." [...] Ochs tried to cut back on the pills, but alcohol remained his drug of choice {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|Jim Varney as Jebidiah Allardyce [...] "Cookie" [...] Farnsworth, a Western-style chuckwagon chef. Varney died of {{lung cancer}} in February 2000, before the {{production}} ended, and the film was dedicated to his memory. Producer Don Hahn was saddened that Varney never saw the finished film, but mentioned that he was shown clips of his character's performance during his site sessions and said, [...] "He loved it." [...] Shawn Keller, supervising animator for Cookie, stated, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sad fact that [...] knew {{that he was not going}} to be able to see this film before he passed away. He did a bang-up job doing the voice work, knowing the fact that he was never gonna see his last performance." ...|$|E

500|$|Disney {{decided to}} release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner because they thought the film would be [...] "too dark and scary for kids", Selick remembered. [...] "Their biggest fear, and why it <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stepchild project, [...] {{they were afraid of}} their core {{audience}} hating the film and not coming." [...] To convey Burton's' involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Burton explained that,"...it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about." [...] The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, and was given a limited release on October 15, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from their}} protests, Theroux {{found them to}} be quite kind, and commented, [...] "It shows you what strange avenues the {{religious}} impulse can take you down. I think another part of the answer is that parts of the Christian Bible are pretty weird. There's a lot of weird stuff in there and when you take that and you add this angry, domineering kind of a father figure, which is Gramps, and you add that he has sort of separated them off from other people, other families and driven them to achieve a lot, and he <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> charismatic guy, and still is up to a point. He was a very verbal, very persuasive, an extremely compelling speaker. All these things added together combined to make a powerful influence." ...|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners later {{noted that}} [...] "Theef" [...] was {{difficult}} to shoot because {{the cast and crew}} had inadequate time to prepare. He explained, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rush thing and we got the script very late. We were totally winging it while we were shooting it". Manners later stated that the episode [...] "came together" [...] in the editing room: [...] "When I looked at the footage, it was like I was looking at somebody else's film. But it cut together real nice and the end result was that 'Theef' {{turned out to be a}} decent little episode". Manners later admitted that the episode was his only credit for the series during which he experienced illness. With Manners out for a day due to his sickness, Rob Bowman took over directing duties for a day.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia. The opening sequence was filmed outside at night, though the subsequent sceneLucy's interrogation and executionoccurred in a motel set constructed on a sound stage. Atypical to the series, the motel room {{did not have a}} noticeable theme. Production designer John Marcynuk commented, [...] "That motel room was essentially a killing floor for the boys...and it <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cold interrogation scene, so we tried to keep it not so friendly. When you walked through it, it definitely felt like a place [...] a murder had been committed. It wouldn't have been the first time a murder had been committed in that room, either. It was the type of place where bad things happen." [...] Marcynuk took a different approach for Gordon's death scene, utilizing green tones and a cool color palette to create a greater visual contrast with the blood.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Architectural Digest, production designer Stuart Craig remarked on creating sets for Part2. Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, [...] "our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That {{was part of the}} fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble." [...] About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, [...] "We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver. John Richardson, the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physical swelling of the treasure on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Neither Carter nor Duchovny were {{contracted}} {{to work on}} the series beyond the seventh season; however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of season in order to bring the two on board for an eighth season.

He explained, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free agent after season seven, and to me, there was not much else to do in terms of the character. So it was really about me wanting to pursue other parts of my career as a writer, director, and actor." [...] Rumors began spreading—and were eventually confirmed—that, since Duchovny had not expressed an interest to appear as a main character in the eighth season, that another character would take Mulder's place. Many fans on the internet believed that Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, would take the role; Pileggi later called this guess [...] "ridiculous." ...|$|E

I just think he's a really smart guy who had a great feel {{for what he had}} to do." [...] In his junior year in 2000, he was a second-team All-American and first-team All-Conference USA, as he set school records by hitting three home runs in one game and 19 for the season; still, he went undrafted. [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> square-shaped body, a guy [...] in a uniform didn't look all that athletic", Cleary said. [...] "He wasn't a tall, prospect-y looking guy.

And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{there was}} still a chance that the seventh season may have been the show's last, the {{character}} of Billy Miles, played by Zachary Ansley and who originally appeared in the pilot episode, was brought back in and featured in [...] "Requiem" [...] to bring the series full-circle. Ansley would also appear in several eighth season episodes as well. After the conclusion of the episode, David Duchovny expressed his desire to leave the series. He explained, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free agent after season seven, and to me, there was not much else to do in terms of the character.

The performance of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] featured The Late Show's Gospel Choir, consisting of five men and five women dressed in red. After filming, Jared Leto described the band's excitement about being asked to record for MTV Unplugged stating, [...] "I think our generation, it <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rite of passage, and if you were invited to do MTV Unplugged, it certainly was a pretty big deal.

500|$|In {{her first}} appearance, Laura San Giacomo plays Harmony Chase, {{a woman who}} hires Keith to {{investigate}} her cheating husband. The two were both series regulars on the NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me!. The two actors had maintained a close friendship after their sitcom was cancelled, and when Rob Thomas brought up a romantic storyline for Keith to Colantoni, he suggested Giacomo for the role. Giacomo accepted the role, later stating, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> no-brainer situation for me. I love Rico, love working with him, {{and it was just}} as much fun as I thought it would be." [...] In addition to sharing in-jokes about Just Shoot Me! while on set, Colantoni also remembered what a good actress he thought she was in their earlier days. After the first appearance, both Colantoni and Giacomo lobbied for more storylines together. Thomas was open to the possibility, saying, [...] "I wouldn't hesitate to go back to this, because I was really happy with how it played out." [...] Giacomo would go on to appear on three episodes of the show.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, while {{attending}} the successful revival of The King and I, Chinese-American playwright David Henry Hwang considered whether other Rodgers and Hammerstein shows could be revived {{and decided to}} work on Flower Drum Song. [...] To Chinese Americans, the musical [...] "represented political incorrectness incarnate. [...] But [...] had a secret soft spot for the movie version. 'It <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> guilty pleasure ... {{and one of the}} only big Hollywood films where you could see a lot of really good Asian actors onscreen, singing and dancing and cracking jokes.'" [...] Ted Chapin, president of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, announced that an unnamed [...] "Asian playwright" [...] had approached him about revising Flower Drum Song. [...] Chapin called the musical [...] "a naive, old fashioned, anti-feminist story with a truly great score.... It's one that ... needs changes." [...] Rodgers' will urged his heirs to do what they believed he would have agreed to (Hammerstein's instructions are unknown), but during her lifetime, his widow Dorothy had refused to countenance major changes in the plays. [...] Hwang's involvement was soon revealed, and in 1997, C. Y. Lee announced that the rewrite had his approval.|$|E

[...] Kirkus Reviews said of Advanced Sex Tips that [...] "the beleaguered humorist’s sex life {{is not all that}} much better: she seems to prefer her pack of dogs". Publishers Weekly contrasted the two books: [...] "Twenty years ago, Heimel's Sex Tips for Girls was a hot item for women with bad attitude; her down-and-dirty, irreverent take on male-female {{relations}} was a welcome relief, after eons of machismo and years of second-wave feminist struggle. Her sequel, however, is a mixed bag".|$|R
