A general name is one which can be predicated of each individual of a multitude; a collective name can not be predicated of each separately, but only of all taken together. “The 76th regiment of foot in the British army,” which is a collective name, is not a general but an individual name; for though it can be predicated of a multitude of individual soldiers taken jointly, {{it can not be}} predicated of them severally.

6000|$|... § 2. It is usual, before {{examining}} the various classes into which names are commonly divided, {{to begin by}} distinguishing from names of every description, those words which are not names, but only parts of names. Among such are reckoned particles, as of, to, truly, often; the inflected cases of nouns substantive, as me, him, John’s; and even adjectives, as large, heavy. These words do not express things of which any thing can be affirmed or denied. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>say,</b> Heavy fell, or A heavy fell; Truly, or A truly, was asserted; Of, or An of, was in the room. Unless, indeed, we are speaking of the mere words themselves, as when we say, Truly is an English word, or, Heavy is an adjective. In that case they are complete names—viz., names of those particular sounds, or of those particular collections of written characters. This employment of a word to denote the mere letters and syllables {{of which it is}} composed, was termed by the schoolmen the suppositio materialis of the word. In any other sense we can not introduce one of these words into the subject of a proposition, unless in combination with other words; as, A heavy body fell, A truly important fact was asserted, A member of parliament was in the room.|$|E
60|$|An adjective, however, {{is capable}} of {{standing}} by itself as the predicate of a proposition; as when we say, Snow is white; and occasionally even as the subject, for we may say, White is an agreeable color. The adjective is often said to be so used by a grammatical ellipsis: Snow is white, instead of Snow is a white object; White is an agreeable color, instead of, A white color, or, The color white, is agreeable. The Greeks and Romans were allowed, {{by the rules of}} their language, to employ this ellipsis universally in the subject {{as well as in the}} predicate of a proposition. In English this can not, generally speaking, be done. We may say, The earth is round; but <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>say,</b> Round is easily moved; we must say, A round object. This distinction, however, is rather grammatical than logical. Since there is no difference of meaning between round, and a round object, it is only custom which prescribes that on any given occasion one shall be used, and not the other. We shall, therefore, without scruple, speak of adjectives as names, whether in their own right, or as representative of the more circuitous forms of expression above exemplified. The other classes of subsidiary words have no title whatever to be considered as names. An adverb, or an accusative case, can not under any circumstances (except when their mere letters and syllables are spoken of) figure as one of the terms of a proposition.|$|E

40|$|In North America {{ice hockey}} is {{considered}} to be the fastest of all teamsports with high demands on leg strength and power. These two factors are crucial for acceleration and the total speed performance during a hockeygame. Skating performance requires a muscle engagement which also occurs during the Y-Balance Test (YBT). Some of the most active muscles during ice skating are biceps femoris, tibialis anterior and vastus medialis, these muscles are also some of the most active muscles during the YBT. The similarities between those two activities enable a possible relationship between skating velocity and YBT. This study investigated the relationship between dynamic postural control and on ice performance which includes 52 meter forward skating. The {{purpose of this study was}} to see if there is a significant correlation between skating velocity and the performance on YBT. Methods: 7 male ice hockey players in ages between 18 - 19 years performed a 52 meter forward skating test and a test for evaluating their dynamic postural control. The method used for measuring the dynamic postural control was the YBT. Results: There was no significant correlation between the YBT longitudinal directions, the total score and 52 meter forward skating. The strongest association (0, 570) was shown between the YBT anterior longitudinal direction and 52 meter forward skating. The total score on YBT did not show a significant correlation with 52 meter forward skating, with a correlationcoefficient of 0, 251. Conclusion: Due to several management errors during the YBT the results showed no significance. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> for certain <b>say</b> that there is no significant correlation due to for instance management errors and the deficiency pf power.

60|$|In the {{dissertation}} which Mr. Herbert Spencer has prefixed to his, in many respects, highly philosophical {{treatise on}} the Mind,(91) he criticises {{some of the}} doctrines of the two preceding chapters, and propounds a theory of his own {{on the subject of}} first principles. Mr. Spencer agrees with me in considering axioms to be “simply our earliest inductions from experience.” But he differs from me “widely as to the worth of the test of inconceivableness.” He thinks that it is the ultimate test of all beliefs. He arrives at this conclusion by two steps. First, <b>we</b> never <b>can</b> have any stronger ground for believing any thing, than that the belief of it “invariably exists.” Whenever any fact or proposition is invariably believed; that is, if I understand Mr. Spencer rightly, believed by all persons, and by one’s self at all times; it is entitled to be received as one of the primitive truths, or original premises of our knowledge. Secondly, the criterion by which we decide whether any thing is invariably believed to be true, is our inability to conceive it as false. “The inconceivability of its negation is the test by which we ascertain whether a given belief invariably exists or not.” “For our primary beliefs, the fact of invariable existence, tested by an abortive effort to cause their non-existence, is the only reason assignable.” He thinks this the sole ground of our belief in our own sensations. If I believe that I feel cold, I only receive this as true because I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> conceive that I am not feeling cold. “While the proposition remains true, the negation of it remains inconceivable.” There are numerous other beliefs which Mr. Spencer considers to rest on the same basis; being chiefly those, or a part of those, which the metaphysicians of the Reid and Stewart school consider as truths of immediate intuition. That there exists a material world; that this is the very world which we directly and immediately perceive, and not merely the hidden cause of our perceptions; that Space, Time, Force, Extension, Figure, are not modes of our consciousness, but objective realities; are regarded by Mr. Spencer as truths known by the inconceivableness of their negatives. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>not,</b> he <b>says,</b> by any effort, conceive these objects of thought as mere states of our mind; as not having an existence external to us. Their real existence is, therefore, as certain as our sensations themselves. The truths which are the subject of direct knowledge, being, according to this doctrine, known to be truths only by the inconceivability of their negation; and the truths which are not the object of direct knowledge, being known as inferences from those which are; and those inferences being believed to follow from the premises, only because <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> conceive them not to follow; inconceivability is thus the ultimate ground of all assured beliefs.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A first {{question}} <b>we</b> <b>can</b> ask is this: The European Community will be able, despite {{the diversity of}} cultural and religious traditions of various civilizations {{that make up the}} mosaic Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, to recover the values deep and genuine so well exposed by Fernand Braudel, in order to counter the current dominance of the processes of globalization and the effect of spatial concentration in accordance with the rules of the so-called free market (land, buildings, services and infrastructure for the mobility) ? New entry into the Community to bring greater security (only apparent) in investments for companies and families (which also affect tourism and the mainly residential on seasonal o the investment on brick), which is used to launch forms of speculation in marginal areas but especially with coastal environmental resources. These initial concentrations are in need of infrastructure networks and therefore proposes the mechanism of traffic and vehicle contract which, if you manage to have a minimal economic and social return, leading inevitably to a congestion and pollution of the area, and to a diffuse spatial to depletion of environmental resources available. At this point there is a certain abandonment and speculative greed will find more beaches, and perhaps there will only groups of residents or desertification will return in time to dominate (maybe {{it was not possible to}} produce historical values). On environmental resources and local communities which will be the effects? This is a model of sustainable tourism development? What is happening in Egypt and Morocco? A second question is: These processes undoubtedly involve, in addition to private operators including national and local governments and then the various systems of organization and management of the territory, the different types of plans and programs and procedures for evaluation and participation. There is a creeping globalization that can influence the behavior of the different actors involved (unfortunately also the so-called cultural and professional circles) and in the name of profit and financial unifies the different cultural and religious traditions? The ultimate goal is improving the quality of life for all (or a few in different parts of the world) but what the environmental effects and irreversibility on free use of resources and real participatory democracy? The European Community as it might encourage virtuous behavior inside and in the relationship? Should be the most developed countries to change their pattern of behavior and development, not statements of principle but with real effectiveness, and therefore propose the economic and financial partnership provided that the reference models are those of tourism integrated, relational and environmentally sustainable. If we see what is happening in Italy (including Sicily) <b>we</b> certainly <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that <b>we</b> give an example.

40|$|Through {{the design}} {{mechanics}} of their explicit and implicit rule systems, their fictional worlds and objects that inhabit them, {{and the particular}} forms of (in-ter) action they invite players to engage in, digital games manage to involve large numbers of players for {{extended periods of time}} in forms of play, either alone or together with others. At the same time, they allow players to enter or leave the game at any time, and to decide from moment to moment whether they are willing to accept the consequences of following, or not following, the game rules as they play. These factual realities of gaming activities alone create a considerable poten-tial for negotiable real world consequences for players, depending on how serious-ly they take the experiential and other outcomes of games they play, the amount of time they spend playing, and whether or not real world material, economic or oth-er cultural values are at stake for them while playing, winning or losing a game, and so on. If we are willing to accept that playing computer games is a real world activity with potential real life consequences for players – i. e. that there may exist experi-enceable, meaningful effects of play activity that are mutually recognisable, inter-subjectively negotiable and ethically appraisable in relation to known systems of cultural values – then why <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> simply <b>say</b> that the fictional worlds generat-ed by these advanced technological artifacts, designed to facilitate player engage-ment and investments of time and energy in what appears to go on in these worlds, are real too, since they clearly constitute an integral part of our everyday experi-ence of the larger cultural reality we live in and are part of?

Similarly {{decreased}} fertility of sows, also boars have a significant reduction in {{the quantity and quality of}} semen during the heating season, compared to ejaculate produced during the cold season. In this paper, we intend to underline the influence of collection season on semen, for three genetic types of boars. This comparative analysis was made between seasons within line and between lines. The values of Student test reveal the existence of different degrees of statistical significance between averages of semen parameters (between seasons), for the three genetic boar lines analyzed. Based on analysis conducted, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> definite superiority of a particular genetic type, on the characters analyzed...|$|E

For our study we examined these three grasses: Ovsík vyvýšený (Arrhenatherum elatius), Sveřep horský (Bromus carharticus) and Bojínek luční (Phleum pratense). Another, the main task was to determine their resistance to drought. The results based on laboratory work, which between them compared the two variants. One was simulated normal emergence of the species and the second emergence stressed by lack of water. Based on these results, we conclude that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> {{that it would be}} a downright drought-resistant types. For the two studied species of grasses (Bojínek and Ovsík) are obvious differences in resistance to drought. Sveřep horský (variety - Tacit), however, proved to be the most drought-resistant species. While most sprouted out bojínek luční (variety - Sobol) ...|$|E

This idea has been motivated by arguments such as the existence of individual differences in personality preferences related to time (morning-type, evening-type, neither-type) and the fact that people have different working hours and sleeping hours. By selecting a few users and looking at their behavior over time we have noted that many users seem to have a quite stable activity behavior over time. Our initial manual analysis has indicated that there might be a possibility to tell individuals apart based on their timeprints. However, by just looking at a set of users’ behavior over time <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> much about how unique a timeprint is.|$|E
