500|$|The segment {{marked the}} first time the Disney studio created a film's main {{characters}} entirely from CGI; only backgrounds, secondary, or tertiary characters had been produced using CGI beforehand. Initially Butoy asked Pixar to handle the computer graphics, but CGI artist Steve Goldberg convinced him to let Disney's own team produce it. The backgrounds were completed by hand. Originally the drain sequence included friendly rats who performed comical gags, but the team found it did not fit the mood {{of the rest of the}} segment. The drains became a more scary environment, something that Butoy said was [...] "what the music <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> to do". Rain animation from Bambi (1942) was scanned into the CAPS system and digitally altered to fit into the segment. The ending was to feature the original ending with the soldier and ballerina melting in the fire, but the music was too upbeat to animate it and was changed. An excerpt of the segment was shown at the 1998 SIGGRAPH conference.|$|E
500|$|In an August 2008 {{interview}} with AbsolutePunk, McKinnon said the band {{were planning to}} start recording once the tour with New Found Glory had finished, [...] "So Oct & Nov." [...] McKinnon said that having Wade, who had previously worked on the band's other albums, on production duties, was {{a way for the}} album to have [...] "A Day To Remember-type feel". Wade also recorded the band's demos for the album, {{in the back of a}} bus. The album itself was recorded at Wade's The Wade Studio, in Ocala, Florida, after the Easycore Tour had finished. Gilbert was touring with New Found Glory in Europe at the time, but with video conferencing he was able to offer input about the record. In September 2008, a demo appeared on the band's MySpace page, entitled [...] "Wax Larry". [...] Documenting the recording process, the band released several webisodes on YouTube, under the name The Real ADTR: Homesick in Ocala, which had been called a spoof of The Real World. The webisodes were aided by director Drew Russ, as guitarist Neil Westfall states: [...] "When he [...] <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> in the beginning that he was getting into video stuff, and we were like 'Well that's kinda crazy 'cause we need a video guy to do these webisodes for us'. And as we started talking he really kinda got our sense of humor". While in the middle of recording Homesick, A Day to Remember released Old Record.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{her trip}} to Uganda, Portman recalls, [...] "...in Uganda I {{met a woman}} named Efuwa {{who was one of}} the first clients of FINCA in Uganda 11 years ago and she—when she started she had 10 children. Her husband was beating her, she was on 80-cents a day and she was—she <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> how she would borrow dirty laundry water from her neighbors to—to clean her clothes because—and her children’s clothes because she couldn’t even afford a little bit of soap. Now 11 years later, she’s opened up a restaurant. Her loans are up to $2,000 now because she’s been such a--you know {{reliable}} client. She hired seven other women. She sends all of her daughters to school. One of them is in University now; they like all pooled their money together to—to send the smartest one to University and it’s just amazing the—the amount of responsibility and pride that these women who have no education and virtually no hope can take with themselves with just a little bit of input." ...|$|E

2500|$|Geffen {{opted to}} refer to the breakup as an [...] "indefinite hiatus," [...] and label {{president}} Jordan Schur reportedly told Barker that [...] "any press you do, make sure you say everything is cool." [...] Immediately following DeVoe's phone call, Hoppus and Barker began laying down new ideas. Recording in Barker's basement and Hoppus' dining room, by necessity everything was electronic, with the two musicians experimenting with electronic drums, samples, keyboards and direct computer recordings. While away on a trip in April 2005, Hoppus participated in an interview with MTV News in which he revealed the band's existence, saying [...] "Right now, Travis and I are using the time off to start this project called Plus-44 [...] It's very exciting, like a breath of fresh air." [...] When the two regrouped, they decided to stop giving interviews about the new project. [...] "It was strange to be talking about music that we were just in the very first steps of writing," [...] recalled Hoppus. [...] "It didn’t feel right to talk about yet." [...] The band's name is a reference to the country code needed when placing a phone call to the United Kingdom, where Hoppus and Barker first discussed making music alone. [...] "When we first started talking about ever doing anything outside of blink was on the last European tour where Tom <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> that he needed to take a year off from the band. [...] We never did anything about it until Tom quit the band, but that's where it first started," [...] said Hoppus. The basement recordings were ambient and quiet by necessity. [...] "We were recording and we didn't want the cops showing up at our house at 2 a.m. because we were recording drums," [...] remembered Hoppus.|$|E
