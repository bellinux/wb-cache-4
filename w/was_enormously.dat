5|$|This article {{showed that}} the {{statistics}} of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper <b>was</b> <b>enormously</b> influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, {{because it was the}} first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out on the train from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but <b>was</b> <b>enormously</b> influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E

5|$|A {{pioneering}} {{work of the}} fantasy genre was The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Elves of Middle-earth {{played a central role}} in Tolkien's legendarium, notably The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings; this legendarium <b>was</b> <b>enormously</b> influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons) are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions as well. They are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to Super Columbine Massacre <b>was</b> <b>enormously</b> negative; {{the title}} was criticized as trivializing the actions of two murderers {{and the lives of}} the innocent. The game's cartoon {{presentation}} and the side-plot into hell were considered by critics as obscuring the game's message, but it received minor note as a game that transcended the stereotypical associations of the medium as entertainment for children. Super Columbine Massacres themes and content led to it being included in discussions as to whether video games cause violence; {{the title was}} later listed as one of the possible motivating factors of the shooter after the 2006 Dawson College shootings. The game has been described as an art game, and Ledonne has become a spokesperson for video games as an emerging art form, producing a documentary in 2008 called Playing Columbine about his game and its impact.|$|E
5|$|Upon its October 1974 release, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{was banned}} {{outright}} in several countries, and numerous theaters later stopped showing {{the film in}} response to complaints about its violence. While it initially drew a mixed reception from critics, it <b>was</b> <b>enormously</b> profitable, grossing over $30 million at the domestic box office. It has since received a positive reappraisal and gained {{a reputation as one}} of the best and most influential horror films in cinema history. It is credited with originating several elements common in the slasher genre, including the use of power tools as murder weapons and the characterization of the killer as a large, hulking, faceless figure. The popularity of the film led to a franchise that continued the story of Leatherface and his family through sequels, remakes, one prequel, comic books and video games.|$|E

5|$|Whatever {{his sources}} may have been, the immense {{popularity}} of Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae cannot be denied. Well over 200 manuscript copies of Geoffrey's Latin work {{are known to}} have survived, and this does not include translations into other languages. Thus, for example, around 60 manuscripts are extant containing Welsh-language versions of the Historia, the earliest of which were created in the 13th century; the old notion that some of these Welsh versions actually underlie Geoffrey's Historia, advanced by antiquarians such as the 18th-century Lewis Morris, has long since been discounted in academic circles. As a result of this popularity, Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae <b>was</b> <b>enormously</b> influential on the later medieval development of the Arthurian legend. While it was {{by no means the only}} creative force behind Arthurian romance, many of its elements were borrowed and developed (e.g., Merlin and the final fate of Arthur), and it provided the historical framework into which the romancers' tales of magical and wonderful adventures were inserted.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s André Masson's work <b>was</b> <b>enormously</b> {{influential}} {{in helping the}} young artist Joan Miró find his roots in the new Surrealist painting.

25|$|Serialism, {{along with}} John Cage's {{indeterminate}} music (music composed {{with the use}} of chance operations), and Werner Meyer-Eppler's aleatoricism, <b>was</b> <b>enormously</b> influential in post-war music. Theorists such as George Perle codified serial systems, and his 1962 text Serial Composition and Atonality became a standard work on the origins of serial composition in the work of Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern.|$|E
25|$|With {{literary}} movements propelling {{the artistic}} explosion {{which was to}} become Brazilian modernism, Malfatti was painting {{in a time of}} political and social need for a fresh and creative artistic license. The synthesis between Andrade and other painters such as Tarsila do Amaral {{and the rest of the}} Group of Five <b>was</b> <b>enormously</b> important in replacing the older more conservative views of art and culture.|$|E
25|$|Lee <b>was</b> <b>enormously</b> {{relieved}} {{to receive a}} long-awaited promotion as second-in-command of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Texas in 1855. It meant leaving the Engineering Corps and its sequence of staff jobs for the combat command he truly wanted. He served under Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston at Camp Cooper, Texas; their mission was to protect settlers from attacks by the Apache and the Comanche.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, Le Bel Indifférent, Cocteau's play {{written for}} and {{starring}} Édith Piaf, <b>was</b> <b>enormously</b> successful. He {{also worked with}} Pablo Picasso on several projects and {{was a friend of}} most of the European art community. Cocteau's films, most of which he both wrote and directed, were particularly important in introducing the avant-garde into French cinema and influenced to a certain degree the upcoming French New Wave genre.|$|E
25|$|Two tunnels {{also had}} to be built, at Braunston and Blisworth. The Blisworth Tunnel caused great problems, and was {{unfinished}} {{when the rest of}} the canal was ready. In fact Jessop considered abandoning it and using locks to carry the canal over the ridge. Jessop's temporary solution was a railway line laid over the ridge to carry traffic until the tunnel was completed. The Grand Junction Canal <b>was</b> <b>enormously</b> important in encouraging trade between London and the Midlands.|$|E

However, {{according}} to Schäfer, his cruelty <b>was</b> <b>enormously</b> exaggerated. Besides the two brothers Cortés, who were sent to Spain, only 64 people were tried. Eight of these were condemned to death (but only seven were executed), and nine were acquitted. The majority of the others were sentenced only to exile or monetary fines.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, he {{directed}} Lest We Forget, which showed {{the world the}} image of a heroic and wounded France. The postwar propaganda was released in 1918 and <b>was</b> <b>enormously</b> successful in France. Its release shortly preceded the signing of the armistice that ended World War I. This film and other film successes during that year supplied Perret with enough money to start his own production company: Perret Pictures, Inc., which was affiliated with the distributor Pathé Exchange.|$|E
