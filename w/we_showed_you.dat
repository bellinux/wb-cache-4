We next stated some of the most monstrous instances of that bribery; and though we were of opinion that in none of them any satisfactory defence worth mentioning had been made, yet we have thought that this should not hinder us from recalling to your Lordships' recollection the peculiar nature and circumstances of one of those proceedings.|$|E

5000|$|Then, {{addressing}} Muhammad, Allah says:"O My dear Prophet, {{what has}} caused you the anxiety and distress that your Lord has forsaken you, and that We are displeased with you? Whereas {{the fact is}} that We have been good to you with kindness after kindness ever since the day of your birth. You were born an orphan, We made the best arrangement for your upbringing and care: you were unaware of the Way, <b>We</b> <b>showed</b> <b>you</b> the Way; you were indigent, We made you rich. All this shows that you have been favored by Us from the very beginning and Our grace and bounty has been constantly focused on you."Here, one should also keep in view vv. 37-42 of Sura Ta Ha, where Allah, while sending the Prophet Moses to confront a tyrant like Pharaoh, encouraged and consoled him, saying: [...] "We have been looking after you with kindness ever since your birth; therefore, you should be satisfied that you will not be left alone in this dreadful mission. Our bounty will constantly be with you." ...|$|E

The band still managed to maintain the top 10 position for the next week, at the ninth world's best selling album. The album also charted at 1st in the Gaon Album Chart for the week of July 23. In an interview with the band, the band was asked why they wanted to pursue rock genre again, in which Hong-gi answered, [...] "We threw away what is popular. <b>We</b> <b>showed</b> <b>you</b> popular rock for the past 8 years. In our 9th year, we started to slowly show you the music that we want to do. Lately, it’s hard to find band music on music charts. We wanted to show how we changed based on the fame we earned through popular music." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{tutorial}} {{gives you}} {{an introduction to the}} R programming language for statistical analysis and modeling. Examples are taken from our research into hurricane climate. It was developed with support from the Florida State University, the U. S. National Science Foundation, and the Risk Prediction Initiative of the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences. You should follow along with an open R session. The key strokes are given in red font. If you're not a fast typer, they can be copied from the pdf (not from DVD) and pasted into your R session. Output from an R command is given in blue Courier New font. Questions for which answers are sought and practice problems are given in green font. The tutorial is divided into 7 sections. We begin with some motivations for giving R a try and some information on how to download and install R on your computer. <b>We</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how to use R as a calculator. In section 2 <b>we</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how to enter data into R, how to query your data, and how to obtain some statistical information about your data. In section 3 we provide some examples of using R for making inferences from correlations and differences in sample means. In section 4 we provide an introduction to using R for graphing your data. In section 5 <b>we</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how R can be used to simulate various probability models and how to do bootstrap analysis. In section 6 we provide more advanced material on using R for statistical modeling. We consider linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression, quantile regression and regression trees. In section 7 we list additional resource material. 1...|$|R
