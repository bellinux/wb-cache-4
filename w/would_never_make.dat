5|$|Stephen III died on 4 March 1172, and Béla {{decided to}} return to Hungary. Before his departure, he pledged that he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>make</b> war against the Byzantine Empire. Although the Hungarian prelates and lords {{unanimously}} proclaimed Béla king, Lucas, Archbishop of Esztergom opposed his coronation because of Béla's alleged simony. Finally, the Archbishop of Kalocsa crowned him king on 18 January 1173, with Pope Alexander III's approval. Béla fought with his younger brother, Géza, whom he held in captivity for more than a decade. Taking advantage of the internal conflicts in the Byzantine Empire after Emperor Manuel's death, Béla reoccupied Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium between 1180 and 1181. He occupied the Principality of Halych in 1188, but it was lost within two years.|$|E
5|$|The divorce proved {{difficult}} for Jackson, who spent several weeks lamenting his loss. Presley {{was the first}} person with whom he had connected on such a high level. She had supported him as he faced allegations and became dependent on pain medication. It was also {{the first time that the}} pop singer had had a sexual chemistry with another. Presley was able to make him open up and express himself through their physically intimate moments together. At the time, Jackson was afraid there would never be another who made him feel the way his ex-wife had. He eventually realized he had to move on; he had a world tour coming up and music to work on. Jackson also knew that Presley <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>make</b> him a father, which he longed to be.|$|E
5|$|After a {{continued}} lack of confirmation of a North American release, including it not being included in Nintendo's 2011 release schedule, a fan-based movement called Operation Rainfall started {{a campaign to}} raise awareness for The Last Story, Xenoblade Chronicles, and another Wii RPG titled Pandora's Tower. This campaign included letter writing to Nintendo and petitions for its overseas release. Despite acknowledging the effort, Nintendo stated {{that there were no}} plans for a North American release. Matsumoto was severely disappointed by this decision and thought The Last Story <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>make</b> it to North America. At this point, Xseed Games, who had developed a reputation for publishing niche Japanese games, took an interest in publishing the title. Initially approaching Nintendo in 2011, Nintendo confirmed that they had no plans to publish the title themselves. After playing through a Japanese copy of the game, and the staff were favorably impressed and decided to pitch to Nintendo for the game's North American publishing rights. They were helped by the connections between parent company AQ Interactive and Mistwalker. Xseed Games were the first publisher to ask Nintendo about The Last Story, and after being favorably impressed by their proposal, Nintendo granted Xseed Games publishing rights. While a new localization for North America was considered, it was decided to use Nintendo of Europe's localization as it better fitted the game's atmosphere and aesthetic. It officially released in North America on August 14, but problems with stock caused Amazon and GameStop to put orders on hold and push their release dates forward.|$|E

25|$|Regarding electricity, {{which he}} pointed out was not an energy source but a means of energy distribution, Jevons noted that {{hydroelectric}} power was feasible but that reservoirs would face the problem of silt build-up.

500|$|It {{was during}} this Australian season, during a match in Brisbane, that Jackson was {{introduced}} to Phyllis Thomas, a trained ballet dancer, who later became his fiancée. In March 1931, Jackson felt his health had recovered sufficiently to join an exhibition tour of Far North Queensland, led by Alan Kippax. He found the tour exhausting, with arduous travel and damp weather, but played well enough to top the aggregate with over 1,100 runs {{at an average of}} 93.00. In a letter to his childhood friend and New South Wales team-mate, Bill Hunt, he wrote, [...] "Our tour of North Queensland has now concluded and thank goodness! ... I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>make</b> this trip again unless I was guaranteed ₤100, and that's not enough!" ...|$|E
500|$|Tora! Tora! Tora!, finally {{released}} to unenthusiastic reviews in September 1970, was, as Donald Richie put it, an [...] "almost unmitigated tragedy" [...] in Kurosawa's career. He had spent {{years of his}} life on a logistically nightmarish project to which he ultimately did not contribute a foot of film shot by himself. (He had his name removed from the credits, though the script used for the Japanese half was still his and his co-writers'.) He became estranged from his longtime collaborator, writer Ryuzo Kikushima, and never worked with him again. The project had inadvertently exposed corruption in his own production company (a situation reminiscent of his own movie, The Bad Sleep Well). His very sanity had been called into question. Worst of all, the Japanese film industry—and perhaps the man himself—began to suspect that he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>make</b> another film.|$|E

500|$|Disraeli toured Belgium and the Rhine Valley {{with his}} father {{in the summer of}} 1824; he later wrote that it was while {{travelling}} on the Rhine that he decided to abandon his position: [...] "I determined when descending those magical waters that I would not be a lawyer." [...] On their return to England he left the solicitors, at the suggestion of Maples, with the aim of qualifying as a barrister. He enrolled as a student at Lincoln's Inn and joined the chambers of his uncle, Nathaniel Basevy, and then those of Benjamin Austen, who persuaded Isaac that Disraeli <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>make</b> a barrister and should be allowed to pursue a literary career. He had made a tentative start: in May 1824 he submitted a manuscript to his father's friend, the publisher John Murray, but withdrew it before Murray could decide whether to publish it. Released from the law, Disraeli did some work for Murray, but turned most of his attention not to literature but to speculative dealing on the stock exchange.|$|E
500|$|In May 1948, {{eccentric}} aviation tycoon {{and occasional}} movie producer Howard Hughes {{gained control of}} the company, beating out British film magnate J. Arthur Rank as the buyer of Odlum's interest. During Hughes's tenure, RKO suffered its worst years since the early 1930s, as his capricious management style took a heavy toll. Production chief Schary quit almost immediately due to his new boss's interference and Rathvon soon followed. Within weeks of taking over, Hughes had dismissed three-fourths of the work force; production was virtually shut down for six months as the conservative Hughes shelved or canceled several of the [...] "message pictures" [...] that Schary had backed. Once shooting picked up again, Hughes quickly became notorious for meddling in minute production matters, particularly the presentation of actresses he favored. All of the Big Five saw their profits dwindle in 1948—from Fox, down 11%, to Loew's/MGM, down 62%—but at RKO they virtually vanished: from $5.1 million in 1947 to $0.5 million, a drop of 90%. The production-distribution end of the RKO business, now deep in the red, <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>make</b> a profit again.|$|E
500|$|Four {{years later}} Frederick was in action again, this {{time during the}} Franco-Prussian War of 1870, {{in which he was}} once more paired with Blumenthal and {{commanded}} the III Army, consisting of troops from the southern German states. He was praised for his leadership after defeating the French at the battles of Wissembourg and Wörth, and met with further successes at the Battle of Sedan and during the Siege of Paris. Frederick's humane treatment of his country's foes earned him their respect and the plaudits of neutral observers. After the Battle of Wörth, a London journalist witnessed the Crown Prince's many visits to wounded Prussian soldiers and lauded his deeds, extolling the love and respect the soldiers held for Frederick. Following his victory, Frederick had remarked to two Paris journalists, [...] "I do not like war gentlemen. If I should reign I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>make</b> it." [...] One French journalist remarked that [...] "the Crown Prince has left countless traits of kindness and humanity in the land that he fought against." [...] For his behaviour and accomplishments, The Times wrote a tribute to Frederick in July 1871, stating that [...] "the Prince has won as much honour for his gentleness as for his prowess in the war".|$|E
5000|$|Such {{mountings}} are {{not intended}} for actual combat, as {{the lack of a}} tsuba (guard) and proper handle wrappings were deleterious; as such they <b>would</b> likely <b>never</b> <b>make</b> their way onto a battlefield. However, there have been loosely similar [...] "hidden" [...] mountings, such as the shikomizue. Also, many blades dating back to earlier Japanese history are today sold in such a format, along with modern-day reproductions; while most are purely decorative replicas, a few have functional blades.|$|R

500|$|The {{character}} of [...] "Pee-wee Herman" [...] originated during a 1978 improvisation exercise with The Groundlings, where Reubens {{came up with}} the idea of a man who wanted to be a comic but was so inept at telling jokes that it was obvious to the audience that he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>make</b> it. Fellow Groundling Phil Hartman would afterwards help Reubens develop the character while another Groundling, John Paragon, would help write the show. Despite having been compared to other famous characters, such as Hergé's Tintin and Collodi's Pinocchio, Reubens says that there is no specific source for [...] "Pee-wee" [...] but rather a collection of ideas. Pee-wee's voice originated in 1970 when Reubens appeared in a production of Life with Father, where he was cast as one of the most obnoxious characters in the play, for which Reubens adopted a cartoon-like way of speaking that would become Pee-wee's. Pee-wee's name resulted from a one-inch Pee Wee brand harmonica Reubens had as a child, and Herman was the surname of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth. The first small gray suit Pee-wee ever wore had been handmade for director and founder of the Groundlings Gary Austin, who passed it on to Reubens, while [...] "someone" [...] handed him the [...] "little kid bow tie" [...] before a show.|$|E
500|$|In July 1996, Björk {{published}} a poem titled [...] "Techno Prayer" [...] in Details magazine which {{would later be}} used {{as part of the}} lyrics of [...] "All Neon Like". It featured thematic ideas such as cocooning and thread-weaving that she would later explore on Vespertine. Björk had released her previous studio album, Homogenic, in 1997. The album was highly acclaimed on its initial release and stylistically differed from her previous two releases, described by her as [...] "very emotionally confrontational and [...] very dramatic". The singer also described [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] — Homogenics closing track — as the first song on Vespertine, as it opposed the rest of the album's [...] "aggressive, macho" [...] aesthetic. In 2000, she starred in Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, and composed its soundtrack, [...] The filming process was conflictive. Von Trier believes the problem was two-fold: they were both used to being the [...] "dictator" [...] over their products, and Björk was unable to separate herself from her character while acting. Björk wrote [...] "he has to destroy [...] during the filming" [...] and declared that she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>make</b> another movie. Her performance was praised: the film was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and she received the Best Actress award. On 25 March 2001, Björk attended the 73rd Academy Awards — as [...] "I've Seen It All" [...] was nominated for Best Original Song — wearing a swan dress designed by Marjan Pejoski that caused a media frenzy and was widely criticized.|$|E
500|$|The College Dropout was {{eventually}} issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number {{two on the}} Billboard 200 as his debut single, [...] "Through the Wire" [...] peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks. [...] "Slow Jamz", his second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became an even bigger success: it became the three musicians' first number one hit. The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top {{album of the year}} by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. [...] "Jesus Walks", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>make</b> it to radio. The College Dropout would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received). During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, partly because of the acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had become too dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound. During this time, he also produced singles for Brandy, Common, John Legend, and Slum Village.|$|E
50|$|After {{his arrest}} in 1976 for tax evasion, Bergman swore he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again <b>make</b> films in Sweden. He shut down his film studio {{on the island}} of Fårö and went into self-imposed exile. He briefly {{considered}} the possibility of working in America; his next film, The Serpent’s Egg (1977) was a German-U.S. production and his second English-language film (the first being 1971’s The Touch). This was followed by a British-Norwegian co-production, Autumn Sonata (Höstsonaten, 1978) starring Ingrid Bergman, and From the Life of the Marionettes (Aus dem Leben der Marionetten, 1980) which was a British-German co-production.|$|R
