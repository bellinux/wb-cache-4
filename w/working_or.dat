When <b>working</b> <b>or</b> running free they {{are also likely to}} pick up parasites such as fleas, ticks, harvest mites, and tapeworms, and irritants such as grass seeds can become trapped in their eyes, soft ears, or paws.|$|E

In Burma Beebe succumbed temporarily to a bout of depression, and it was several days before {{he was able to}} resume <b>working</b> <b>or</b> continue the expedition. He attributed his recovery to the pile of penny dreadful novels he discovered in his bungalow at Pungatong, which he then read constantly for the next few days.|$|E

When not <b>working</b> <b>or</b> finishing his last semester of high school, Rashad {{spends most of his time}} with his friends Brooklyn (Albert Daniels), Teddy (Jason Weaver), and Esquire (Jackie Long). Rashad is a talented artist but does not see much of a future in that field as he has become accustomed to working the family business. Esquire, Rashad's best friend, goes to a prep school on the opposite side of town from where they live, and is trying to attend an Ivy League college after senior year. However, he finds out that he will need a letter of recommendation from someone of high stature to better his chances of acceptance at the school he wants to attend.|$|E

25|$|Two {{weeks before}} he planned to {{complete}} the symphony-requiem, Shostakovich played what he had finished to date for Sollertinsky, who was being evacuated with the Leningrad Philharmonic. While playing the music, Shostakovich realized that what he had written was not a complete work in itself but actually the beginning of something much larger, since the tensions {{brought up in the}} symphony-requiem had not been resolved. The question now became whether to stay in the city to continue <b>working</b> <b>or</b> to evacuate and resume the work after a long hiatus. By the time he decided to evacuate, it was too late—the Germans had cut off the rail link to the city. He and his family were trapped.|$|E
25|$|The eternal {{problem with}} {{compounds}} is starting: for all cylinders {{to take their}} weight, it is advisable to have some way of short-circuiting the HP cylinders and getting steam at a reduced pressure directly to the LP cylinder(s); hence many of the patented compound systems are associated with particular starting arrangements. The de Glehn 4-cylinder system is probably still the most sophisticated of all with independent HP & LP cut-off and a rotary valve, called a lanterne allowing independent <b>working</b> <b>or</b> combinations of HP and LP groups. Most other systems employ starting valves of various kinds. Another criterion is whether the valve gears {{of the two groups}} are wholly independent or linked together in some way.|$|E
