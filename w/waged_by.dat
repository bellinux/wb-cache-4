5|$|The war was one {{of several}} near {{simultaneous}} wars <b>waged</b> <b>by</b> the Mongol Empire and the Yuan dynasty in the late 13th century. Though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the Mongols, the war set off a series of enduring developments in Burma. The invasions ushered in a period of political fragmentation, and the rise of Tai-Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|In Linz, Kepler's primary {{responsibilities}} (beyond {{completing the}} Rudolphine Tables) were {{teaching at the}} district school and providing astrological and astronomical services. In his first years there, he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague—though he was excluded from Eucharist by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples. It was also during his time in Linz that Kepler {{had to deal with}} the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother Katharina in the Protestant town of Leonberg. That blow happening only a few years after Keplers excommunication is not seen as a coincidence but as a symptom of the full-fledged assault <b>waged</b> <b>by</b> the Lutherans against Kepler.|$|E
5|$|San Martín and Belgrano {{met at the}} Yatasto relay. The {{army was}} in poor condition, and San Martín {{initially}} refused to remove Belgrano from the army, as it would hurt the soldiers' morale. However, the supreme director Gervasio Posadas (who replaced the triumvirate in government) insisted, and San Martín acted as instructed. San Martín stayed {{only a few weeks}} in Tucumán, reorganizing the army and studying the terrain. He also had a positive impression of the guerrilla war <b>waged</b> <b>by</b> Martín Miguel de Güemes against the royalists, similar to the Peninsular War. It was a defensive war, and San Martín trusted that they could prevent a royalist advance in Jujuy.|$|E
5|$|The {{two works}} are bound {{together}} in one surviving manuscript, the earliest surviving cartulary from medieval England. A major theme is the losses suffered by Worcester {{at the hands of}} royal officials and local landowners. Included amongst the despoilers are kings such as Cnut and William the Conqueror, and nobles such as Eadric Streona and Urse d'Abetot. Also included are accounts of lawsuits <b>waged</b> <b>by</b> the Worcester monks in an effort to regain their lost lands. The two sections of the cartulary were first printed in 1723. The original manuscript was slightly damaged by fire in 1733, and required rebinding. A new printed edition is in production as of 2010.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} machinations of Yelü Yixin, {{the only other}} event of note from Emperor Daozong's rule was a war fought between 1092 and 1102 between the Liao and a Mongolian, {{possibly}} Tatar tribe, group known as the Zubu. The Zubu were located at the northwest border of Liao territory and had fought several wars with the Liao when the Liao tried to expand in that direction. In 1092 the Liao attacked several other tribes in the northwest, and by 1093 the Zubu attacked the Liao, striking deep into Khitan territory. It took until 1100 for the Liao to capture and kill the Zubu chieftain, and another two years to fight off the remaining Zubu forces. The war against the Zubu was the last successful military campaign <b>waged</b> <b>by</b> the Liao dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Born in Sydney, New South Wales to {{a middle-class}} family of English descent, Childe studied Classics at the University of Sydney {{before moving to}} England to study Classical {{archaeology}} at the University of Oxford. Here, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict <b>waged</b> <b>by</b> competing imperialists {{to the detriment of}} Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Australian Labor Party as the private secretary of politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he authored an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and continued his research into European prehistory through various journeys across the continent, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture to the British archaeological community.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{entry into}} the war {{prompted}} French communists to join the French Resistance, augmenting its presence in Brittany significantly. The majority of Breton nationalists adopted a neutral stance, refusing to join French collaborationist units such as Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism, while sharing their hatred of what they perceived as a worldwide Judeo-Bolshevist conspiracy. In the meantime, Breton nationalists became targets of a guerilla campaign <b>waged</b> <b>by</b> Francs-Tireurs et Partisans, who continued to view them as traitors. The first such killing took place on 4 September 1943, with the shooting of Yann Bricler, a relative of Breton nationalist Olier Mordrel. Lainé decided to directly aid the Germans in their anti partisan operations, hoping {{for a change in}} policy regarding the question of Breton independence. He believed that the mere presence of a purely Breton force would inspire others to join his cause.|$|E

5|$|The {{fight at}} Phou Pha Thi, which {{was part of}} a larger {{military}} campaign <b>waged</b> <b>by</b> the North Vietnamese and their Pathet Lao allies, marked the beginning of the Communist dry-season offensive against Laotian Government forces in northeastern Laos. By September 1968, the strength of North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces in the Sam Neua area were estimated to have numbered more than 20 battalions. Against such heavy odds, General Vang Pao insisted on recapturing Phou Pha Thi, which the U.S. Embassy believed unnecessary. On 1November1968, Pao launched Operation Pig Fat in attempt to retake Phou Pha Thi, but the operation quickly turned into a rout of the Royal Laos Army and the Hmong guerrillas and Phou Pha Thi was never retaken.|$|E
5|$|The two {{met at the}} {{outskirts}} of Wola {{in the early hours}} of 7 September. Paskevich proclaimed a cease-fire and invited Krukowiecki to meet him at 9:00. The meeting was held in the village tavern of Wola. Paskevich demanded that Warsaw and Praga be surrendered unconditionally and that the Polish Army be evacuated and disarmed in Płock, where it was to await the decision of the tsar either to pardon the Polish soldiers or imprison them as rebels. Krukowiecki declined and insisted that the uprising was not a rebellion but a war <b>waged</b> <b>by</b> two independent states. He wanted Paskevich and Grand Duke Michael to promise the return of Poland's independence and a general amnesty in exchange for revoking the act of deposition of Nicholas from the Polish throne. The negotiations were stormy and around noon the Polish commander departed for Warsaw to consult the Sejm about further actions. Paskevich agreed to extend the cease-fire to 13:00, and to continue negotiations even if warfare was resumed.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{strongly}} influenced many early civilizations. Greeks {{believed that they}} were battles <b>waged</b> <b>by</b> Zeus, who hurled lightning bolts forged by Hephaestus. Some American Indian tribes associated thunderstorms with the Thunderbird, who they believed was a servant of the Great Spirit. The Norse considered thunderstorms to occur when Thor went to fight Jötnar, with the thunder and lightning being the effect of his strikes with the hammer Mjölnir. Hinduism recognizes Indra as the god of rain and thunderstorms. Christian doctrine accepted the ideas of Aristotle's original work, called Meteorologica, that winds were caused by exhalations from the Earth and that fierce storms were the work of God. These ideas were still within the mainstream as late as the 18th century.|$|E
40|$|Several {{developing}} countries that underwent trade liberalization experienced {{an increase in}} the share of informal workers in manufacturing industries. This phenomenon deserves careful examination because informal jobs are not only generally viewed as low-quality and low-paying jobs, but they also account for more than 30 % of the workforce in some countries. In this paper, I examine the effects of the Brazilian trade liberalization episode (1989 - 2001) on the industry-level share of informal workers and on the average formal and informal wages. I find that a percentage point decrease in import tariffs increases the informality share by 0. 09 percentage points and the average informal <b>wage</b> <b>by</b> 0. 06 %, and decreases the average formal <b>wage</b> <b>by</b> 0. 05 %. A similar change in foreign import tariffs decreases the informality share by 0. 17 percentage points and the average informal <b>wage</b> <b>by</b> 0. 34 %, and increases the average formal <b>wage</b> <b>by</b> 0. 32 %. The results are found to be robust to endogeneity and self-selection concerns, which are addressed using instrumental variables and a switching regressions approach. ...|$|R

5|$|Kazamatsuri is {{the setting}} for a secret war being <b>waged</b> <b>by</b> two main groups: Gaia and Guardian. Gaia, an {{organization}} {{under the auspices of}} the environmental conservation group Martel, is populated by nihilistic and misanthropic people able to contract with familiars, which manifest as constructs fueled by the summoner's life force. Martel itself used to be a church and contains within it a holy maiden group of girls with developmental disabilities. Guardian is dedicated to the destruction of familiars and is composed almost entirely of humans who possess special powers. Gaia and Guardian came to Kazamatsuri in the pursuit of the Earth's familiar named Kagari, who manifests as a young, high school age-looking girl. Kagari, the main heroine of Rewrite, has the power to initiate a period of re-evolution, which restarts the process of evolving another means of intelligent life. However, this is done with the use of the Earth's energy, and by the time the events of Rewrite occur, there is no more energy left to do another re-evolution. Gaia wants to capture Kagari to ensure the destruction of humanity, but Guardian wishes to seek out Kagari to kill her, ensuring that human life continues.|$|E
5|$|Two {{conflicting}} views {{exist as}} to whether the war was a civil or an international war. The prevailing view in Serbia is that there were two civil wars in the area: one between Croats and Serbs living in Croatia, and another between SFR Yugoslavia and Croatia, a part of the federation. The prevailing view in Croatia and of most international law experts, including both international courts ICTY and ICJ, is that the war was an international conflict, a war of aggression <b>waged</b> <b>by</b> the rump Yugoslavia and Serbia against Croatia, supported by Serbs in Croatia.The armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia started shortly after the date on which Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence on June 25, 1991 between the military forces of the SFRY and Slovenia and Croatia. Such armed conflict should of course be characterized as internal because the declarations of independence were suspended in consequence of the proposal of the EC for three months. After the expiration of the three months' period, on October 7, 1991, Slovenia proclaimed its independence with effect from that date, and Croatia with effect from October 8, 1991. So the armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia should be considered international as from October 8, 1991 because the independence of these two States was definite on that date}} Neither Croatia nor Yugoslavia ever formally declared war on each other. Unlike the Serbian position that the conflict need not be declared as it was a civil war, the Croatian motivation for not declaring war was that Tuđman believed that Croatia could not confront the JNA directly and did everything to avoid an all-out war.|$|E

5|$|Iceland, {{not part}} of the EU, is {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It defaulted on its debt and drastically devalued its currency, which has effectively reduced <b>wages</b> <b>by</b> 50% making exports more competitive. Lee Harris argues that floating exchange rates allows <b>wage</b> reductions <b>by</b> currency devaluations, a politically easier option than the economically equivalent but politically impossible method of lowering <b>wages</b> <b>by</b> political enactment. Sweden's floating rate currency gives it a short-term advantage, structural reforms and constraints account for longer-term prosperity. Labour concessions, a minimal reliance on public debt, and tax reform helped to further a pro-growth policy.|$|R
