5|$|Eddie {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of Mulder and visits Nelligan, showing her a photo of Eddie. Nelligan tells him that she <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> him in high school, but views him as rather a loser lacking in any drive or ambition. The disappointed Eddie leaves, just as the real Mulder shows up. Realizing that Eddie just visited Nelligan in his guise, Mulder searches for him down the hospital corridors. He finds the fertility doctor and a security guard nearby and handcuffs them to each other, believing {{one of them to}} be Eddie. The real Eddie, however, is hiding in a vent above. He gets the jump on Mulder and locks him up in the hospital basement. Eddie takes Mulder's form and tells Scully that he feels the case {{is a waste of time}} and they should return to Washington.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} in August, the battalion remained on Tarakan to undertake garrison duties. During this time it undertook patrol operations {{to bring in the}} various pockets of Japanese troops who had not learned of the surrender; these were dangerous operations and in an effort to reduce casualties, the patrols <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> several Japanese prisoners to help talk their former comrades into surrendering. As the demobilisation process began, its numbers dwindled as long-serving men were repatriated back to Australia, while others with only limited service were transferred to other units for further service. Finally, on 25 October 1945, while still on Tarakan, the battalion was disbanded. The occasion was marked by a small ceremony at Tarakan involving the unit's remaining members. During {{the course of the war}} a total of 2,838 men served with the 2/48th Battalion, of whom 343 men were killed in action or died on active service, 675 were wounded, and 20 captured.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the terrain}} around the ridge, the Australians had to {{allocate}} {{a significant amount}} of resources to bring in supplies to the forces later stationed around Pearl Ridge. The rate of effort required to bring stores forward was of significant concern to the Australian corps commander, Lieutenant General Stanley Savige, to the extent that his orders to the commander of the 11th Brigade stipulated no further advances in the sector, with the exception of patrolling to prevent the movement of Japanese reinforcements towards the south, and for information gathering purposes. These patrols subsequently <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> native police guides, exploiting quite deep into the jungle over several days over long distances—one was even pushed to the eastern coast around the Numa Numa Plantation—and proved quite successful for the Australians in harassing the Japanese in the area. Over the course of 14 weeks at least 236 Japanese were killed by these patrols, while the Australians lost four killed and 19 wounded. Four Japanese were also captured. In mid-April, the 23rd Brigade, under Brigadier Arnold Potts, took control of the central sector and in June a new offensive was opened in the area. This lasted through {{until the end of the}} war in August.|$|E

5|$|The legendary saga Yngvars saga víðförla {{describes}} the last expedition of the Vikings into the Caspian, dated to 1041 and possibly {{connected with the}} Georgian-Byzantine Battle of Sasireti in which a Varangian force participated around the same time; in the saga much legend is conflated with the historical facts. This expedition was launched from Sweden by Ingvar the Far-Travelled, who went down the Volga into {{the land of the}} Saracens (Serkland in Norse). There are no less than twenty-six Ingvar Runestones, twenty-three of them being in the Lake Mälaren region of Uppland in Sweden, referring to Swedish warriors who <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Ingvar on his expedition to the Saracen lands, an expedition whose purpose was probably to reopen old trade routes, now that the Bulgars and the Khazars no longer proved obstacles. A stone to Ingvar's brother indicates that he went east for gold but that he died in the Saracen land. Afterwards, no attempts were made by the Norsemen to reopen the route between the Baltic and Caspian seas.|$|E
25|$|Larsson also {{featured}} at the 2006 World Cup in Germany.

In Sweden's last 16 game against hosts Germany, Larsson missed a penalty and Sweden <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the score at 2–0 to Germany.|$|E

He was promoted to captain of Cumberland on 9 October 1718, remaining with her until 9 February 1720, when he took command of , still with Norris's fleet in the Baltic between 1720 and 1721. He afterwards went to American waters to combat piracy.|$|E

25|$|Carnegie was {{reportedly}} highly sought after by many MLB and minor league teams {{during his time}} in the Allegheny County league. It was said that he refused to leave the Pittsburgh area. The Pittsburgh Press said that Carnegie did play in the Middle Atlantic League after the Johnstown Johnnies' requested an emergency outfielder after their regular player <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> an illness. They also reported that Carnegie had a chance to stay in the Middle Atlantic League, but returned home instead.|$|E
25|$|Heroine was {{a former}} 32-gun fifth rate frigate, but {{had been reduced to}} 16 guns and {{converted}} to carry troops. He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> her to the Mediterranean and supported the Egyptian campaign between 1800 and 6 March 1802, when he relinquished command. Hill did not receive any commands during the drawdown of the navy during the Peace of Amiens, but returned to service after the resumption of the wars, with an appointment to the hired 16-gun sloop Humber, in the Channel between 31 March 1804 and 27 October 1808.|$|E
25|$|At the front, Berger passed Senna and set {{off after}} Patrese only for his engine to fail on lap 38. Two laps later, Prost from third <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the same problem. This put the order as: Patrese, Senna, Alesi, Martini, Capelli and Piquet. On lap 49, Mansell who had charged through the field took sixth from his former arch-rival Piquet and was only 15 seconds from third place. Then, on lap 51, he was shown the black {{disqualification}} flag for the pit-lane infringement. Capelli spun off on lap 65 from fifth. Patrese won from Senna, Alesi, Martini, Piquet and Schumacher.|$|E

25|$|The Olaf was {{attacked}} and damaged by German aircraft several times, {{but it always}} managed {{to get back to}} Shetland. The worst damage occurred on 12 May 1942. Three crew from the wrecked Frøya, along with some others, <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the Olaf to search for a raft with four of the Frøya crew. They were attacked five times by a German Dornier bomber. The vessel was severely damaged, and some of the crew wounded. One of the three men from the Frøya, Hans Johansen, later died of his wounds. The Olaf made no more journeys and after the war it was returned to the owners who sold it in 1948.|$|E
25|$|On October 29, 867, the Turkish soldiers, {{together}} with the Ushrusaniyya and Faraghina regiments, rioted, demanding four months of their allotments. Bugha, Wasif and Sima al-Sharabi <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a hundred of their followers and attempted to defuse the situation. Wasif told the rioters {{that there was no}} money to pay them, at which point Bugha and Sima decided to depart. The rioters then attacked Wasif, slashing and stabbing him. He was then taken to a nearby residence, but the soldiers dragged him out and struck him with axes until they broke both his arms and decapitated him, and his head was placed on top of a stick.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{garrison}} in {{the city}} were {{in the hope that}} there would be relief relied on from nearby Venlo under Francisco Mendoza who had arrived with a force in late July. Mendoza <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the aim of relieving Grave but soon discovered the significant size of the Dutch and English besieging force when the leading part of the Spanish column ran into strong positions and were repelled with loss. The city garrison on hearing the news of Mendoza close by at the same time made several unsuccessful sallies on the besieging army wasting men and supplies. This abruptly stopped when they heard news that the Mendoza's troops were forced to turn back to Venlo in late August; mutinies also played their part in the Spanish retreat.|$|E

25|$|Hotaru is Yuma's {{best friend}} {{since they were}} children. It is shown that early on Yuma would always protect her from things such as bullies at school, but over time she surpassed her in being bold. She {{eventually}} <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> many different boyfriends, but from Yuma's point of view she would never pay attention to any of them. She is shown to be aggressive with her feelings towards Yuma, making the first moves {{on more than one}} occasion. Yuma senses though that there might be trouble between her and Fujiwara despite Hotaru's strong attitude. She later takes a job at a shady cat maid café which alarms Yuma which makes her join as well. Hotaru eventually gets surprised by Yuma's bolder moves which makes her happy yet for some reason also in pain.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Britain in 1806, Bligh <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> {{the fleet}} to the Baltic and {{was present at}} the Battle of Copenhagen. He then sailed to the Portuguese coast, where he was active landing troops and {{supporting}} the army's operations there. He was involved in the Battle of the Basque Roads in 1809, directing efforts to destroy several grounded French ships. While cruising off Belle Île in 1810 he {{had the good fortune to}} intercept a French vessel carrying the wealth of the merchants of Île de France back to France. Suddenly wealthy from the prize money and in weakening health after his long service in the tropics, Bligh retired ashore. He settled on the south coast, receiving an appointment as a Companion of the Bath, and a promotion to rear-admiral before his death in 1831.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1880s {{the hunt}} for Geronimo was on and Bigelow was {{involved}} with the search, patrolling out of Fort Grant. Many patrols were carried out and the public's attention {{was drawn to the}} hunt. Harper's Weekly sent a young Frederic Remington out to document the historic events. While Remington <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> various cavalry troops of the 10th, he met a friend of an old friend in the dusty west. Bigelow's brother Poultney Bigelow was a former Yale classmate of Remington and had remained in contact with him. This started a friendship which would last for decades. Bigelow allowed Remington to read his journals and see his sketches. While Bigelow never became proficient in his sketches, his journals became the basis of serial articles on {{the hunt for}} Geronimo for his brother's Outing magazine. Remington added a series of freelance sketches for the magazine that included his new friend, John Bigelow.|$|E

25|$|Three Buccaneer {{starters}} <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> injuries, {{most significantly}} Doug Williams, {{who suffered a}} broken jaw on a Jack Youngblood blitz. Darryl Carlton separated a shoulder, and Dewey Selmon broke his wrist. Mike Rae played in relief of Williams, completing 9 of 17 passes for 123 yards and a touchdown. The Rams double-covered both Buccaneer receivers, leaving no coverage to prevent Rae from rushing for 95 yards on four carries. Ricky Bell had his first 100-yard rushing day, with 21 carries for 104 yards. The Buccaneers set several team records in this game: 209 yards was their highest rushing total yet, Bell's 555 yards were a Buccaneer single-season rushing record, and Neil O'Donoghue's 38 points were a new season scoring record. Although the Rams were not on McKay's list of 18 teams that he felt the Buccaneers were competitive with, Tampa Bay rallied to a 23–23 fourth-quarter tie before losing on a late Frank Corral field goal. It was the Buccaneers’ third fourth-quarter collapse in four weeks. The Buccaneers’ performance drew cheers from the Los Angeles crowd, among whom McKay was still a popular figure.|$|E
25|$|Through bribes and threats, he {{eventually}} {{managed to get}} a permission to go to Slovenia for himself and twenty close companions. From there the group moved through Austria and Germany before finally relocating to Liège, Belgium. Although Prazina settled himself and his followers in a neighborhood populated mostly by immigrants from Turkey and the Maghreb, {{he eventually}} established himself among the city's small Yugoslav emigrant community. There, Prazina was last seen the night of 3 December 1993. He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> his bodyguards after a game of cards and never came back. The next morning, German police found his Audi abandoned at the railroad station in Aachen. The car body had two bullet holes from a 9mm handgun; presumed to be a Beretta. Prazina's body was discovered in a canal alongside a highway near the German border by two Romanian hitch-hikers on New Year's Eve. The bullets found in Prazina's head corresponded to the holes in his car, and the ownership of a Beretta by one of his bodyguards sealed the case in the eyes of Belgian police. The four bodyguards were arrested, and three of them went on to be tried and sentenced to serve time in prison.|$|E
