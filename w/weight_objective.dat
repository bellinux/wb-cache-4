By using normalized mean squared error and residual error of intensity, the global similarity and local similarity can be optimized. Utilizing symmetry and periodicity properties of the fringe patterns, the desired fringe pattern is generated by tiling the best patch together. Simulation shows that the proposed fringes maintain high phase quality under different filter sizes. Experimental results also verify the feasibility and advantage of the proposed technique that the proposed method can generate high-quality binary fringes under different defocusing levels.|$|E

The rocket uses 90 percent pure LOX that is collected from the atmosphere, separated, and stored during operation of the turborocket from about Mach 2 to Mach 5 or 6.

40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on finding the optimal distribution for continuum structure {{such that the}} structural weight with stress constraints is minimized where the physical design domain is discretized by finite elements. A novel Independent-Continuous-Mapping (ICM) method is proposed to convert equivalently the binary design variables {{which is used to}} indicate material or void in the various elements to independent continuous design variables. Moreover, three smooth mappings about weight, stiffness, and stress of the structural elements are introduced to formulate the objective function based on the so-called concepts of polish function and weighting filter function. A new general continuous approach for topology optimization is given which can eliminate the stress singularity phenomena more efficiently than the traditional ε-relaxation method, and an alternative strain energy method for the stress constraints is proposed to overcome the difficulty in stress sensitivity analyses. Mathematically, by means of a generalized aggregation KS-like function defined as the parabolic aggregation function, a topology optimization model is formulated with the <b>weight</b> <b>objective</b> and single parabolic global strain energy constraints.

40|$|An {{efficient}} multi-objective design tailoring procedure {{seeking to}} improve the vibroacoustic performance of a fuselage panel while maintaining or reducing weight is presented. The structure considered is the pultruded rod stitched efficient unitized structure, a highly integrated composite structure concept designed for a noncylindrical, next-generation flight vehicle fuselage. Modifications to a baseline design are evaluated within a six-parameter design space including spacing, flange width, and web height for both frame and stringer substructure components. The change in sound power radiation attributed to a design change is predicted using finite-element models sized and meshed for analyses in the 500 Hz, 1 kHz, and 2 kHz octave bands. Three design studies are carried out in parallel while considering a diffuse acoustic field excitation and two types of turbulent boundary-layer excitation. Kriging surrogate models are used to reduce the computational costs of resolving the vibroacoustic and <b>weight</b> <b>objective</b> Pareto fronts. The resulting Pareto optimal designs are then evaluated under a static pressurization ultimate load to assess structural strength and stability. Results suggest that choosing alternative configurations within the considered design space can reduce weight and improve vibroacoustic performance without compromising strength and stability of the structure under the static load condition considered, but the tradeoffs are significantly influenced by the spatial characteristics of the assumed excitation field...|$|E

30|$|To {{ensure that}} the {{evaluation}} result {{will be affected by}} the weighting approaches, subjective <b>weighting</b> and <b>objective</b> <b>weighting</b> methods are both utilized in the comparison. The use of subjective weighting is based on the decision maker’s expertise and judgment; nevertheless, <b>objective</b> <b>weighting</b> is based on mathematical computation. The approach with <b>objective</b> <b>weighting</b> is particularly applicable for situations where reliable subjective weights cannot be obtained (Deng et al. 2000). In another point of view, weights determined by subjective approaches reflect the subjective judgment or intuition of the DM, but analytical results or rankings of alternatives based on the weights can be influenced by the DM due to his/her lack of knowledge or experience. Objective approaches often determine weights by making use of mathematical models, but they neglect the subjective judgment information of the DM. This integration overcomes the shortage which occurs in either a subjective approach or an objective approach. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it not only benefits from the decision maker’s expertise but also involves end users in the whole decision-making process.|$|R

Participants (n = 5255) completed self-report measures of eating-disordered behaviour, mental health functioning, height and weight and socio-demographic information. The most common eating-disorder features were extreme concerns about weight or shape (14. 6 %), subjective overeating (12. 7 %), objective overeating (10. 6 %) and extreme concerns about dietary intake (10. 4 %). In multivariable analysis, in which mental health functioning was regressed on eating-disorder features, while also controlling for age and body <b>weight,</b> <b>objective</b> overeating (? = - 0. 07), subjective overeating (? = - 0. 07), extreme dietary restriction (? = - 0. 06) and extreme concerns about eating (? = - 0. 04) showed small, but statistically significant associations with mental health impairment, whereas extreme weight or shape concerns showed a very strong association (? = - 0. 24).

Material and Methods. Subjects were n= 1, 279 pupils aged 13 - 15 years, attending secondary school.

The ultimate target is to link standard design tools (steel structure CAD, hull form, hydrostatic curves, floating stability, weight estimation, etc.) with a rational optimization design module and a minimum construction cost (or minimum <b>weight)</b> <b>objective</b> function. This paper is the first part of a series of two articles. It focuses on the ‘Module-Oriented Optimization ’ methodology and on the rational constraints.

The optimization module is composed of 3 basic modules (OPTI, CONSTRAINT and COST) and a group of sub-modules (in external databases).

Methods. The analysis was based on data from 112, 830 Canadians aged 18 years or more who participated in a national survey in 2007 – 2008. A questionnaire covered the information on prevalent asthma, smoking status, height, weight, and other factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between smoking and the prevalence of asthma stratified by sex and body mass index (BMI). Results. The crude prevalence of asthma was 6. 6 % for men and 9. 3 % for women. After adjustment for covariates, the odds ratios (ORs) for current smoking associated with asthma was 1. 20 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 01 – 1. 43] for men with normal weight, 0. 98 (95 % CI: 0. 81, 1. 18) for overweight men, and 1. 02 (95 % CI: 0. 80 – 1. 30) for obese men.

Materials and Methods. Under a supervision there were 57 patients. The patients of the first group (n = 38) received diet therapy and metformin. Patients of the second group (n = 19), additionally to the diet therapy and metformin, received orlistat (Xenical) in a dose on one capsule (120 mg) 2 – 3 times daily. Before and 6 months after treatment we conducted the anthropometric measuring, estimated the blood lipid spectrum, carbohydrate exchange, and also content of immunoreactive insulin, leptin, index of insulin resistance HOMA-IR. Results. In the most examined persons (84. 2 %) there was hyperinsulinemia that testifies to insulin resistance (index of ­НОМА-IR increased in all patients). Level of immunoreactive insulin is closely associated with the indexes of atherogenic profile of plasma. Hyperleptinemia was detected in 98. 2 % patients. Application of orlistat resulted in the decline of index of insulin resistance on 43 % from baseline, while in patients of the first group (diet therapy and metformin) this index on the average on a group rose on 2 %.
