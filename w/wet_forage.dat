Freshly chopped whole-plant corn was treated with nothing (untreated silage), urea (U) added at 15 lb/ton of <b>wet</b> <b>forage,</b> Silaferm added at 50 (A 1) or 100 (A 2) lb/ton, Silaferm and urea (60 % and 40 % of the added CP, respectively) added at 47 lbs/ton, and Lactobacillus buchneri and Pediococcus pentosaceus (400, 000 and 100, 000 cfu/g of <b>wet</b> <b>forage,</b> respectively). Addition of various N-based compounds had minimal effects on the fermentation end products of corn silage {{with the exception of}} predictable increases in the concentrations of ammonia-N and CP. Corn silage treated with L. buchneri had more acetic acid and 1, 2 propanediol and fewer yeasts than did untreated silage. Treatment with L. buchneri and AU improved the aerobic stability of silage when compared to untreated silage. Dry matter recovery was not different among treatments. Future research should focus on the ability of a high level of A plus U to improve aerobic stability. Treatment with AU has potential for improving the aerobic stability of corn silage...|$|E

40|$|Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea schreb.) {{is one of}} the {{important}} perennial grasses for creating and maintaining of pastures as well as harvesting wet matter forms. In order to evaluate of morphphysiological characteristics and selection of superior accessions in tall fescue on 36 accessions a lattice square design with three replications was carried out in agricultural and natural resources research centre of Zanjan province. Result analysis of variance showed that different types of tall fescue had significant differences in wet and dry forage yield, heading and flowering dates, panicle length, 1000 -grain weight and seed maturity. Accessions of 6000 - 71 (Borujen-Iran origin) and 1061 (Belgium origin) had the most wet matter. In contrast 6000 - 70 (Borujen-Iran origin) was the lowest value. Moreover, 078 (California origin) had the highest and 6000 - 71 (Borujen-Iran origin), VIII (Russia origin), Sabalan (Ardabil origin) had the lowest total dry matter. Phonotypical correlation coefficient showed significant positive correlation between flowering date with heading date, date of seed maturity (r= 0. 618 **), (r= 0. 456 *), respectively, and between wet and dry forage yield (r= 0. 437 *). <b>Wet</b> <b>forage</b> yield (0. 437) and panicle length (0. 217) had the most direct and positive effects on dry forage yield.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this trial was to evaluate the nutritional value, fermentation profile and dry matter losses of Palisadegrass silages ensiled with either dried citrus pulp, soybean hulls, chemical or microbial additives. The trial {{was carried out in}} a completely randomized experimental design and in a factorial arrangement (3 x 5), with three dry matter levels (<b>wet</b> <b>forage</b> or forage ensiled with pelleted citrus pulp or pelleted soybean hulls) and five additives (without or with the presence of bacterial inoculants or the addition of: sodium benzoate, formic acid in the concentration of 62 % or 44 %), totalizing 15 treatments and 60 experimental silos. The variables analyzed were: nutritional value, losses due to gases and effluents, and dry matter recovery. The use of dried citrus pulp or soybean hulls at the ensiling time increased the dry matter content (29. 4 and 28, 9 %) and decreased the effluent production (4. 1 and 3. 8 kg/t of fresh matter), also providing fermentable substrate to microorganisms, resulting in increased fermentation coefficient and digestibility of silages. The use of formic acid resulted in silages with higher digestibility and increased water-soluble carbohydrates and crude protein content. This additive was also effective in reducing the losses due to gases and, as a result, increased the total dry matter recovery. The treatment containing homolactic bacteria showed similar trend of increasing the digestibility and reducing the losses due to gases. The use of sodium benzoate was less effective in altering the fermentation pattern of tropical silages. The nutritional value and total dry matter losses of silages ensiled without additives can be considered satisfactory.

40|$|Key {{resource}} areas (KRAs), {{defined as}} dry season foraging zones for herbivores, were studied {{relative to the}} more extensive outlying rangeland areas (non-KRAs) in Kenya. Field surveys with pastoralists, ranchers, scientists and government officials delineated KRAs on the ground. Identified KRAs were mapped based on global positioning and local experts' information on KRAs accessibility and ecological attributes. Using the map of known KRAs and non-KRAs, we examined characteristics of soils, climate, topography, land use/cover attributes at KRAs relative to non-KRAs. How and why do some areas (KRAs) support herbivores during droughts when forage is scarce {{in other areas of}} the landscape? We hypothesized that KRAs have fundamental ecological and socially determined attributes that enable them to provide forage during critical times and we sought to characterize some of those attributes in this study. At the landscape level, KRAs took different forms based on forage availability during the dry season but generally occurred in locations of the landscape with aseasonal water availability and/or difficult to access areas during <b>wet</b> season <b>forage</b> abundance. Greenness trends for KRAs versus non-KRAs were evaluated with a 22 -year dataset of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Field surveys of KRAs provided qualitative information on KRAs as dry season foraging zones. At the scale of the study, soil attributes did not significantly differ for KRAs compared to non-KRAs. Slopes of KRA were generally steeper compared to non-KRAs and elevation was higher at KRAs. Field survey respondents indicated that animals and humans generally avoid difficult to access hilly areas using them only when all other easily accessible rangeland is depleted of forage during droughts. Understanding the nature of KRAs will support identification, protection and restoration of critical forage hotspots for herbivores by strengthening rangeland inventory, monitoring, policy formulation, and conservation efforts to improve habitats and human welfare.

40|$|Objetivou-se avaliar o valor nutritivo, o perfil fermentativo e as perdas de silagens de capim-marandu submetidas aos efeitos de absorventes de umidade e aditivos. Utilizou-se o delineamento inteiramente casualizado, em arranjo fatorial 3 × 5, com três teores de matéria seca (obtidos com adição de polpa cítrica (PCP) ou casca de soja (CSP), ambas peletizadas, em comparação à ausência de aditivos) e cinco aditivos (ausência ou presença de inoculante bacteriano, benzoato de sódio ou ácido fórmico 62 % ou 44 %). O arranjo resultou em 15 silagens, com 4 repetições, portanto 60 silos experimentais. Avaliaram-se o valor nutritivo, as perdas por gases e efluente e a recuperação de matéria seca (MS). A adição de polpa cítrica ou casca de soja peletizada elevou os teores de MS (29, 4 e 28, 9 %), o que reduziu a produção de efluente (4, 1 e 3, 8 kg/t MV) e disponibilizou substratos fermentescíveis aos microrganismos, fato confirmado pela maior capacidade fermentativa e pela digestibilidade das silagens. Os aditivos à base de ácido fórmico foram mais efetivos em preservar carboidratos solúveis e proteína, o que culminou em maior digestibilidade. Esses aditivos também reduziram as perdas por gases e elevaram a recuperação de MS. O inoculante contendo bactérias homoláticas não diferiu desses aditivos quanto à digestibilidade das silagens e ainda reduziu as perdas por gases. Entre os aditivos, o benzoato foi o menos efetivo em alterar o padrão fermentativo das silagens de capim-marandu. O valor nutritivo e as perdas da silagem com teor de umidade original, não aditivada, podem ser considerados satisfatórios, contudo, a polpa cítrica e principalmente a casca de soja peletizadas se mostraram opção interessante e devem ser mais estudadas. O uso de aditivos contendo ácido fórmico também deve ser mais explorado com gramíneas tropicais, pois promove benefícios ao longo de todo processo fermentativo.

40|$|The {{seasonal}} feeding behavior, forage {{preferences and}} body weight responses of goats were studied under three densities of woodland (called caatinga), and under three stocking rates. The experiment {{was located in}} the semi-arid tropics of northeastern Brazil at 3 422 ̆ 7 South latitude, and 40 212 ̆ 7 West longitude at an elevation of 75 meters. Mean annual precipitation of the area is 832 mm. Removing the shrubs and trees increased yields of herbaceous only on partially-cleared sites. Goats gained body weight (kg BW/ha) during the wet season, with the cleared treatment showing the best body weight response per unit of land. However during the dry season, animals lost weight probably due the low {{quality and quantity of}} available forage. The botanical composition of goats 2 ̆ 7 diets showed them to be mixed feeders, consuming grasses, forbs and browse in various combinations depending on the season and the array of forage species available.

30|$|The {{quantity}} of forage {{in the land}} covers of Karamoja documented {{in this study is}} generally within the range of those observed in other studies in tropical Africa such as over east and the Horn of Africa, (Angerer 2008), in Turkana, Kenya (Ooro-Olang 1984) and in the Sahelian rangelands of Senegal (Miehe et al. 2010. However, this study's results are considerably lower than those observed in commercially managed temperate climate grassland pastures such as in western Canada (Iwaasa et al. 2012). This study has also been able to document inherent variation in the {{quantity of}} forage that exists between different land covers, seasons and locations in Karamoja sub-region. The differences between wet and dry season forage quantity are attributable to variation in rainfall over the seasons. In semi-arid areas of Chad and Cameroon, Awa et al. (2002) noted that forage quantity is directly related to rainfall. This appears to be a similar situation in the Karamoja rangelands. However, this pattern reveals the major reason for mobile livestock grazing practices practised in the sub-region. In fact, the decline in <b>wet</b> weight <b>forage</b> quantity around the transitionary season (between August and November) provides a good rationale for pastoral mobility. Informal interviews with herders during the monitoring period revealed that these patterns in vegetation performance trigger scouting for grazing grounds and preparation for dry season movement. This study has also shown that grasslands have relatively lower yields compared to woodlands. However, because of their expansive nature in the region, they form the major grazing grounds. Secondly, grasslands in the region limited encumbrances to livestock during grazing because they have a relatively high grass cover compared to the tree cover (see Figure  2 a). Thirdly, grasslands have generally been observed to have more nutritious and palatable forage (Ooro-Olang 1984; Reid et al. 2005), though some tree species can provide browse for livestock, including nutritious pods (Gambiza et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} drainage {{of wetlands}} and grazing marshes {{has been one}} of the main drivers of severe reductions in the number and range of breeding waders across Europe. Wader chicks require <b>wet,</b> invertebrate-rich <b>foraging</b> habitats and most agricultural land is now too dry to support sustainable breeding populations. Recent efforts to re-create wet grasslands and improve wader breeding success have focussed on reinstating wet features, in order to provide foraging habitats for chicks. The success of wet feature installation will therefore depend on whether they provide sufficient invertebrate prey for chicks throughout the pre-fledging period. Techniques for re-creating lowland wet grasslands from arable and pastoral farmland are becoming increasingly well-established, and support from agri-environment initiatives is now available for wet feature installation on grasslands. Here we explore the effect of wet feature provision on invertebrate abundance and the growth rates and body condition of northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus chicks, on grazing marshes in eastern England. Wet features supported more than double the biomass of surface-active invertebrates and a greater abundance of aerial invertebrates than the vegetated grazing marsh. Chick foraging rates were also two to three times higher in wet features than in the grazing marsh, as was the estimated biomass intake per food item. At the start of the breeding season, chick condition was unrelated to wet feature provision but late in the season, when water levels were low, chick body condition was significantly higher in fields with footdrain densities of more than 150 m ha- 1. Chick condition declined with increasing rainfall, and low growth rates and longer pre-fledging periods in 2007 are likely to have resulted from unusually intense and prolonged summer rainfall. Synthesis and applications. The installation of wet features on grasslands provides valuable foraging locations for chicks, particularly later in the season when these features are likely to be the main source of water available. Predicted changes to the seasonality of precipitation at temperate latitudes means that provision of wet features is likely to be increasingly important for maintaining breeding wader populations...|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the role}} camels play in {{pastoral}} livelihoods, their dietary requirements cannot be ignored. The nutritional requirements of camels impact on their meat and milk production and their performance as resilient animals. Camels are, by preference, browsers of {{a broad spectrum of}} forage plants including trees, shrubs and hard-thorny, bitter and halophytic (salty) plants that grow naturally in the desert and other semi-arid areas (Dokata 2014). Further, camel diets also include herbs, forbs and grasses (Dorges and Heucke 2003; Iqbal and Khan 2001). More often than not, camels tend to be selective in their diet during the <b>wet</b> season when <b>forage</b> is plentiful (Amin et al. 2011) but become indiscriminate in their forage choices during the dry seasons (Amin et al. 2011; McLeod and Pople 2008) due to forage scarcity. Under natural conditions, camels take the largest percentage of their diet from forage trees than grasses (Abukashawa et al. 2016; Laudadio et al. 2009). These woody plants are mildly affected by seasonal variations, due to their extensive and deep root system and longer life spans (Abel at al. 1997) and are consequently available all year round. They often bear green foliage even in the dry season, and/or highly nutritious flowers and fruits are available (Schwartz et al. 2012).|$|R

The available evidence strongly suggests that changes in productivity as a consequence of agricultural intensification are the most likely driver of the decline in L. l. limosa, although the concentration of much of the population in just a few sites in winter and spring is likely to exacerbate their vulnerability to future habitat changes.

QTL analysis was conducted by Composite interval mapping (CIM) method separately for each trait in each location. The main effect of genotype was high significant for all the studied traits. Transgressive segregation in both directions (positive and negative) was observed for all the studied traits. There was a negative relationship between forage qualityrelated with quantity-related traits. Thirty-three QTLs controlling different studied traits were identified. Phenotypic variance explained by these QTLs varies from 7. 07 to 39. 04 %. Highest LOD scores were obtained for the leaf to stem ratio on chromosome 2 H. QTLs of forage quality (total digestible nutrient, dry organic matter digestibility, leaf to stem ratio, seed to forage ratio and number of tiller per plant) and quantity (plant height, <b>forage</b> <b>wet</b> and dry matter) indexes were found on chromosomes 1 H, 2 H, 3 H, 4 H, 5 H, 6 H and 7 H. Most of mapped QTLs appear to be fairly stable between locations and can become candidates for marker-assisted selection...|$|R
40|$|A {{participatory}} {{study was}} carried out in four villages of central Tanzania to appraise existing and potential scavengeable feed resources available for rural poultry. In addition, proximate analysis of selected scavengeable feed resources including chicken crop and gizzards contents {{was carried out}} to quantify their feeding value. Results indicate that the most important scavengeable feed resources in the dry season were cereal grains and their by-products, oil seeds and oil seed cakes and in the <b>wet</b> season were <b>forage</b> leaves, flowers, seeds, garden vegetables, insects and worms. Changes in seasonal conditions, farming activities, land size available for scavenging and the flock size had a major influence on the feed availability. The mean dry matter (DM) of the feed resources was 888 +/- 1. 8 g per kg. Gross energy ranged from 17. 1 to 29. 3 MJ kgDM(- 1) and crude protein (CP) from 64. 5 to 418 g kgDM(- 1). Crude fibre (CF) ranged from 33. 3 to 230 g kgDM(- 1) and ether extract (EE) ranged from 16. 0 to 488 g kgDM(- 1). The mineral composition ranged from 1. 5 to 18. 4 g kgDM(- 1) for calcium (Ca); 3. 6 to 17. 3 g kgDM(- 1) for phosphorus (P); 9. 5 to 34. 5 g kgDM(- 1) for potassium (K) and 0. 2 to 8. 5 g kgDM(- 1) for magnesium (Mg). Physical analysis of crop and gizzard contents indicated that the diets consumed by scavenging chickens consisted of cereals and cereal by-products (29. 0 %), vegetables and forage materials (1. 8 %), seeds and seed by-products (3. 4 %), insects and worms (0. 2 %), egg shells, feathers and bones (0. 3 %), unidentified feeds (41. 5 %), inert materials (0. 8 %) and sand/grit (23. 0 %). The diet consumed as determined from the crop/gizzard contents had DM of 479 +/- 9. 6 g per kg and metabolizable energy (ME) of 10. 1 +/- 0. 5 MJ kgDM(- 1). Nutrient composition in kgDM- 1 of the crop and gizzard contents was: 80. 4 g CP; 70. 7 g EE; 45. 7 g CF; 234 g Ash; 6. 6 g Ca; 6. 5 g P; 12. 1 g K and 2. 6 g Mg. The study showed that the nutrient concentrations of scavengeable feed resources consumed by rural poultry were below the recommended levels for optimum growth and egg production...|$|R
40|$|On file RONO: 2420 6606 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were {{to determine the effects of}} breed, season and pasture moisture gradient on the extent and location of grazing and ruminating behaviour in cattle kept on heterogeneous semi-natural grasslands. Two groups of heifers, 12 of the traditional Swedish breed Vtheneko and 12 of the commercial Continental breed Charolais, were allocated into three enclosures per breed. Each enclosure consisted of heterogeneous semi-natural grasslands dominated by Deschampsia cespitosa (tufted hairgrass) and each contained dry, mesic and wet areas. In spring, summer and autumn, behaviour was recorded using automatic behaviour recorders, and positioning and activity were recorded using GPS receivers for 24 h for every heifer. The Vtheneko heifers had a higher activity than the Charolais heifers (P = 0. 006), which supports the theories of resource allocation and contrafreeloading, but there were no differences between breeds in location of grazing, ruminating or idling. The heifers spent more time grazing in autumn (42. 5 % of the day) than in spring (38. 5 %; P = 0. 006) and summer (38. 9 %; P = 0. 014) and the efficiency of grazing (i. e. proportion of eating during grazing bouts) increased over the grazing period (P < 0. 001). The results indicate the heifers avoided grazing in darkness which is consistent with the theory that predation risk affects <b>foraging.</b> Herbage in <b>wet</b> areas had a lower concentration of crude protein (P = 0. 036) and a higher concentration of neutral detergent fibre (P = 0. 011) than herbage in dry areas. At the same time, on average over seasons, 28 % of the herbage mass was found in the wet areas, whereas only 8 % of the grazing occurred there. Furthermore, the proportion of eating during grazing bouts was lower (73. 9 %; P < 0. 001) in wet areas than in dry (80. 1 %) and mesic (79. 6 %) areas. The results indicate the heifers avoided grazing in <b>wet</b> areas where <b>forage</b> had a low nutritional value, supporting the theory of optimal foraging. In conclusion, both breed and season affects foraging behaviour of cattle on semi-natural grasslands, as the heifers of the traditional breed had a higher activity than the commercial breed and the grazing time was longer and more effective in late than in early grazing period. The cattle avoided <b>foraging</b> in <b>wet</b> areas, which may impact on the management of these areas. Peer reviewe...|$|R
