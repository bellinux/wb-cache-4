5|$|Although Watts {{received}} many offers {{to buy the}} painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.|$|E
5|$|The {{coronation}} {{usually takes}} place {{several months after}} the death of the previous monarch, as it is considered a joyous occasion that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> while mourning continues. This interval also gives the planners enough time to complete the elaborate arrangements required. For example, Queen ElizabethII was crowned on 2June 1953, having ascended the throne on 6February 1952; the date of her coronation was announced almost a year in advance, and preparations inside the abbey took five months.|$|E
5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt {{to see themselves as}} if they are outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate,</b> or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E
50|$|Typical of Victorian-era convict novels, Rufus Dawes, is a wrongfully convicted gentleman. Under the {{prevailing}} morality of the time, a murderer <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for {{a hero in}} popular fiction.|$|R

50|$|Bayonas {{also tried}} to sell Chances to US broadcasters. However, the only {{interested}} network was thePlayboy Channel, which made several offers for the show; Bayonas declined, statingthe channel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an <b>inappropriate</b> broadcaster for the show.|$|R
5|$|At 7:30am {{the next}} morning, the Duke of Wellington {{wrote to the}} Mayor of Liverpool from his lodgings in nearby Roby. He had been due to receive the Freedom of the City, but felt that under the {{circumstances}} any kind of celebration <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate,</b> {{and said that he}} would not be attending any of the planned events in the city that day. The planned parades and ceremonial dinner were cancelled, but in the absence of rapid transit or mass communication there was no way to notify most of the city's population. While some shops had heard the news and remained shuttered, the ships in Liverpool's docks remained festooned with brightly coloured streamers, and sounded their horns at the time the Duke was expected to be passing.|$|E
5|$|On a short trip, Chidambaram {{reveals his}} {{identity}} to Vishwanathan's daughters, who agree to play along. Viswanathan, believing Ashok {{is the only}} heir of a millionaire, asks Kanchana's consent to marry him. When Kanchana rejects the proposal, Viswanathan asks Nirmala, who happily accepts. Sachidanandam, who is buying a nearby estate, is referred to Viswanathan and arrives in Chinnamalai. They meet and discover that they are childhood friends. Thinking it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> to marry off his younger daughter while the elder one is still unmarried, Viswanathan arranges Kanchana's marriage to Vasu, who meets his father is unable to reveal his true identity to prevent getting caught. When Sachidanandam returns to Chennai to make the wedding preparations, he finds {{that there has been}} no word from his son, who left for Coimbatore weeks before. Sachidanandam almost cancels the marriage when Vasu makes a telephone call {{in the nick of time}} and approves the marriage.|$|E

60|$|The {{answer is}} {{somewhat}} indefinite, it is true, but its indefiniteness {{is the chief}} element {{in the value of}} it. A definite and precise answer, even if one of that character were ready at hand, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> utterly <b>inappropriate</b> to the occasion.|$|R
50|$|The British {{government}} disagreed on {{the grounds}} that it was honouring its own citizens who only happened to be Canadians as well. It held that it <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for the Prime Minister of Canada to advise the Queen of the United Kingdom, just as it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for the British Prime Minister to advise the Queen of Canada on Canadian domestic affairs.|$|R
25|$|There were {{concerns}} that the Thanom-appointed parliament <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for approving the draft. The king suggested a royally appointed 2,347-person group, who would appoint a 299-person committee, who would nominate a 100-person convention to scrutinize the draft.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the three}} other MBTA subway lines, the line uses {{standard}} gauge tracks. However, instead of heavy rail metro rolling stock, the Green Line uses modern streetcars (light rail vehicles) as heavy rail stock <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for the surface branches with their numerous grade crossings.|$|E
25|$|Even {{if there}} was a {{quantitative}} and incremental increase in guilt or mischief associated with trafficking in just over 15grams of diamorphine as opposed to just under 15grams, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> to respond to this with a qualitative and non-incremental increase in the prescribed penalty.|$|E
5000|$|... "For {{this purpose}} the new test {{proposed}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> entirely <b>inappropriate,</b> and no experimenter <b>would</b> <b>be</b> tempted to employ it.

50|$|The Finnish State Railways started {{ordering}} Diesel {{multiple units}} and railcars, as road transport began {{to compete with}} rail passenger services. To compete with car and bus services the state railway added a number of train services and intermediate halts to its network. The use of steam locomotives on quiet railway lines <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>inappropriate,</b> and the associated costs <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> too high.|$|R
2500|$|Ian McKellen {{was offered}} the role, but he turned it down, having played the similar {{character}} Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, as well as feeling it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>inappropriate</b> to take Harris's role, as Harris had called McKellen a [...] "dreadful" [...] actor. Harris's family had {{expressed an interest in}} seeing Peter O'Toole being chosen as his replacement.|$|R
25|$|Pointing devices {{can be used}} {{to enter}} text or {{characters}} in contexts where using a physical keyboard <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> or impossible.

But Karna is humiliated when Kripa asks him to ascertain his caste, as it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for unequals to compete.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} Can-Car's success in other markets, {{as early as}} 1981 the {{government}} had considered selling UTDC to the private sector. Their concern was that without a manufacturing business, UTDC would {{find it difficult to}} make enough income to justify its Kingston operations. If the company did start a manufacturing side, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for the company to remain government owned. The Can-Car deal put this on hold for a time.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the majority's findings, Swain's finding of {{not guilty by reason of}} {{insanity}} was overturned. While normally a new trial should be ordered, the specific circumstances in this case did not warrant it: Swain had been acquitted (by reason of insanity) and had been absolutely discharged. A new trial <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unfair to Swain, but entering a full acquittal <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate.</b> Therefore, the court entered a judicial stay of proceedings.|$|R

25|$|Ironically, in 2003 a {{controversy}} arose in Sudbury {{when the city}} government voted against flying the flag at Tom Davies Square for St-Jean-Baptiste Day, claiming that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for the city government to display on public property a symbol representative of {{only a portion of}} the city's population. In 2006, new mayor John Rodriguez reversed that decision, permitting the flag to be flown, but was again criticized by some voters for acting unilaterally.|$|E
25|$|Working {{with the}} ALARP principle, before {{a patient is}} exposed for a nuclear {{medicine}} examination, {{the benefit of the}} examination must be identified. This needs {{to take into account the}} particular circumstances of the patient in question, where appropriate. For instance, if a patient is unlikely to be able to tolerate a sufficient amount of the procedure to achieve a diagnosis, then it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> to proceed with injecting the patient with the radioactive tracer.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} termed Remix & Return would blend {{high-level waste}} with uranium mine and mill tailings {{down to the}} level of the original radioactivity of the uranium ore, then replace it in inactive uranium mines. This approach has the merits of providing jobs for miners who would double as disposal staff, and of facilitating a cradle-to-grave cycle for radioactive materials, but <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for spent reactor fuel in the absence of reprocessing, due to the presence in it of highly toxic radioactive elements such as plutonium.|$|E

Trump, while taking the remark in good spirits, pointed out that he is 26 years older than his wife Melania.|$|R

This episode was originally planned for broadcast on Saturday, 6 September but following live coverage of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, it was postponed until the following Saturday as ITV felt that Wendy Dawes' injury on Tightrope <b>would</b> <b>be</b> too <b>inappropriate</b> to show.|$|R
25|$|Bamber {{attended}} St Nicholas Primary, {{followed by}} Maldon Court, a private prep school, then from September 1970 Gresham's School, {{a boarding school}} in Norfolk. Claire Powell writes that Nevill felt it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> to send the boy to a local school for the village children, when he might one day have to employ them on the farm.

25|$|In 2008, Sainsbury's {{revealed}} {{that they had}} purchased a long lease to redevelop the Forest Court shopping centre and also owned part of the Station Approach Conservation Area which they intend to refurbish.

After some changes to the plans approval was given by Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council, and {{in the summer of}} 2013 Sainsbury's submitted an application to amend some details of the scheme.|$|E
25|$|This episode {{featured}} {{a number of}} firsts in the British version's history: {{the first time a}} candidate was fired outside of the final boardroom; and the first time a project manager did not have a choice on who to bring back to the final boardroom. In addition, after the world economy experienced a severe downturn following this series, Sir Alan admitted that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for the series to continue to be filmed in exotic locations. Production staff subsequently filmed later series within the UK, and within the European Union on rare occasions, up until filming began for the ninth series.|$|E
