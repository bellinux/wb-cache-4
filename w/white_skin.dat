The next scene features damaged–archive footage of a destroyed town, fenced in with barbed wires. A young boy, with pale <b>white</b> <b>skin,</b> blonde dreads, and angel wings, appears in the distance. Several scenes features the boy looking towards the camera, which then inter cuts to scenes with Hamasaki singing the song in the room. The young boy wonders through the destroyed town, observing damaged homes and objects. The boy places his hands upon a dying tree, where he envisions the events of how the town became destroyed and dismantled. These scenes include burning flowers, falling construction, and broken religious statues. The second chorus has Hamasaki singing, and the song break shows the boy observing a blossoming flower which hasn't died. Smiling, he walks towards it, unbeknown that there is sharp barbed wire surrounding it. Scenes features Hamasaki singing, and shows brief inter cut scenes of barbed wire wrapped around the young boy. Struggling to become free from the wire, the young boy dies and leaves behind a large pile of angel feathers. The final scene features Hamasaki wearing exactly the same outfit as the angel, trapped in a large bird cage, in the room the video started with. The video zooms out on the overall appearance of her.|$|E
5|$|Alucard {{appears in}} , {{a chapter of}} the Lords of Shadow reboot series. It is {{revealed}} that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, conceived before Gabriel {{was turned into a}} vampire and became the dark lord Dracula. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land. After infiltrating the castle, Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room, where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his son, or telling Dracula his name. Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort, in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later Alucard awakens, with pale <b>white</b> <b>skin,</b> white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.|$|E

Circassians were often thought of as being especially beautiful, having curly black hair, light eyes and pale <b>white</b> <b>skin</b> (generally somewhat close to their actual appearance), giving rise to the phenomenon of Circassian Beauties.|$|E

She then praises his black hair, again asking to touch it, but is rejected once more. She finally begs for a kiss from Jochanaan's lips, and Narraboth, who cannot bear to hear this, kills himself.

25|$|If the {{sequence}} of the nucleotides in a gene changes, {{the sequence}} of the amino acids in the protein it produces may also change—if part of a gene is deleted, the protein produced is shorter and may not work any more. This {{is the reason why}} different alleles of a gene can have different effects in an organism. As an example, hair color depends on how much of a dark substance called melanin is put into the hair as it grows. If a person has a normal set of the genes involved in making melanin, they make all the proteins needed and they grow dark hair. However, if the alleles for a particular protein have different sequences and produce proteins that can't do their jobs, no melanin is produced and the person has <b>white</b> <b>skin</b> and hair (albinism).|$|E
25|$|Three {{important}} aspects of Máté's life at this time were to affect her later life and work. Firstly, she discovered her aptitude for story-telling, and often used this skill at school. Secondly, Máté formed a close friendship with a beautiful Jewish girl, Maria, who, with her raven hair, <b>white</b> <b>skin</b> and red lips, became linked in Máté's vivid imagination, alternately with Snow White and the female heroines of the Bible. It was through her association with Maria, whose family disappeared in 1938, that Máté was personally confronted with Aryan racism. The families of the two girls shared a connection with the Viennese Opera. A passionate love of song and dance was to remain with Máté all her life and influence the rhythm of her poetry. The third important aspect of this time was {{the death of her}} beloved uncle, who she nursed through his last illness, doing her homework at his desk by his bedside. This event brought her to a sudden realisation of the reality of death, {{and the fact that she}} herself would die. This was later to become an aspect of her poetry.|$|E

25|$|When Percival {{is a young}} teenager, Captain Delmar reappears {{and offers}} him a {{position}} aboard his new navy ship, the H.M. Calliope. While preparing to enter service, Percival overhears gossip of his illegitimate birth, introducing the idea that Captain Delmar may be his father. He confronts his mother about his parentage, which she at first harshly denies but later tearfully explains the truth of her affair. Early in his service in the navy, Percival is captured during a pirate raid along with others. The pirate crew is entirely black, and the captain explains that they are primarily escaped slaves from the Americas. Percival is taken in as a cabin boy, and later dyes his skin tan in {{the appearance of a}} mulatto to please the captain who doesn't approve of <b>white</b> <b>skin.</b> The pirates often seek to take over slave trading vessels, killing every white person on board. During the taking of one such vessel, Percival is able is convince the captain to spare the lives of a wealthy Dutch merchant and his young daughter, Minnie. Eventually the H.M. Calliope takes the pirate ship, and Percival--unrecognizable with his dyed skin--is taken as a prisoner, later to convince his fellow shipman of his true identity.|$|E

[...] A story about the Joker's origin appeared in Detective Comics #168 (February 1951), nearly a decade after the character's debut.

500|$|At a Game Developers Conference project post-mortem, he {{emphasized}} {{the role of}} pragmatic design in shaping the game. While designing the main character, Quote, Amaya drew inspiration from Mario's iconic original appearance—a large, expressive face and a high contrast between his <b>white</b> <b>skin</b> and red shirt make him {{stand out from the}} dark cave backgrounds. Most other characters feature either light skin or white clothes for the same reason. To make levels memorable, Amaya designed them around a single theme, such as [...] "warmth" [...] for the Egg Corridor or [...] "arid and oppressive" [...] for the Sand Zone. Instead of a tutorial level, a concept Amaya dislikes, the first level of the game gives the player two paths, one of which is blocked off until retrieving an item from the other path. This setup, inspired by the opening of Metroid, [...] "lets players feel like they've solved problems on their own" [...] and persists throughout the game. In beta versions of the game, all the enemies were shaped like bars of soap, a concept that evolved into the Balrog character. There was also a [...] "frog prince" [...] character who could travel through water more easily. Elements of this beta were incorporated into the Nintendo 3DS version of the game.|$|E
