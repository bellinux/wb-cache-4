40|$|A laboratory-based test {{apparatus}} {{was employed to}} investigate the effects of power-plant placement, engine/nacelle mass installation, and <b>wing-to-fuselage</b> <b>attachment</b> methods on propeller-induced structure-borne noise (SBN) transmission levels and their effects on noise-control measures. Data are presented showing SBN transmission is insensitive to propeller spanwise placement, however some sensitivity is seen in propeller-to-wing spacing. Installation of an engine/nacelle mass and variation in wing-to-fuselage attachments have measurable influences on SBN transmission and control measures...|$|E
