The radar antenna is vertically polarized {{to enhance the}} sea-surface backscatter signal. Second, FutureWaves™ uses an innovative radar signal processing scheme that addresses the inherently noisy backscatter signals through a mathematical process termed Least Squares Inversion. This approach applies a highly over-determined filter to the radar data, and intelligently rejects radar scans that do not observe incoming waves. The result is an accurate representation of the propagating incident wave field that will force ship motions over a 2-3 minute window. The wave processing algorithms also enable real-time calculation of wave field two-dimensional power spectra and significant wave height similar to that provided by a wave buoy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEstimation and {{prediction}} {{of the real}} time information of the oceanographic parameters is of vital importance in India as more than 25 % of the population resides along the coastlines. Information of the significant wave heights is necessary to deal with many oceanographic activities as almost all ocean engineering applications depends on it. Presently Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) provides <b>wave</b> <b>forecasts</b> on regional and local level ranging from 3 hours to 7 days ahead using numerical models (www. incois. res. in). It is evident from real time observations that the predicted SWHs by a physics based model vary randomly and have non-linear relationship with observed values due to many reasons. Consequently predicted and actual values deviate significantly from each other with an ‘error’ which has to be removed to cater the needs of safe and secure lives residing along Indian coastline. Present work aims in reducing this error in numerical <b>wave</b> <b>forecast</b> made by INCOIS at Ratnagiri station on the south-west coast of India.

Sea and shipping safety is {{of paramount importance}} since it is affecting a serious number of passengers as well as commercial transportation. In addition, shipping safety is inextricably linked with marine pollution which is an indirect threat to the health, safety and quality of life of world citizens, and thus its minimization is of utmost importance.

As a result univariate <b>wave</b> <b>forecasting</b> may be employed where in previous values of waves are used to forecast wave up to few hours to few days in advance. However such models suffer the vital issue of ‘removal of phase lag’ which has been recognized by many researchers and attributed to high autocorrelation between last two observed values in univariate time series modelling.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 This thesis {{contains}} a manuscript describing {{the implementation of}} a high resolution <b>wave</b> <b>forecasting</b> model for the coasts of Washington and Oregon. The purpose of this project was to advance the wave predictive capabilities of the states of Oregon and the southwest part of Washington by including the effects of local bathymetric features in the operational forecasts. A 30 arc-second resolution <b>wave</b> <b>forecasting</b> model was implemented making use of the WAVEWATCH III numerical code covering the coastal region from Klamath, CA to Taholah, WA. The wave forecasts extend to the continental shelf at this resolution. To assess the performance of the model, its output was compared against in situ data, with normalized root-mean-squared errors in significant wave height in the vicinity of 0. 20 and linear correlation coefficients greater than 0. 80. Making use of the resulting validated regional scale <b>wave</b> <b>forecasting</b> system, an evaluation of the model sensitivity to the inclusion of bottom friction and wind input at the shelf level was performed. Results suggest that neither dissipation due to bottom friction or wind generation are significant for long term forecasting/hindcasting in the region.

To evaluate it, a shelf scale SWAN model was implemented and a series of numerical experiments performed.

However, due to the complex hydrological and meteorological interaction and uncertainties arising from different modeling systems, quantifying the uncertainties and improving the forecasting accuracy of modeled typhoon-induced waves remain challenging. This paper presents a practical approach to optimizing model-ensemble wave heights in an attempt to improve the accuracy of real-time typhoon <b>wave</b> <b>forecasting.</b> A locally weighted learning algorithm is used to obtain the weights for the wave heights computed by the WAVEWATCH III wave model driven by winds from four different weather models (model-ensembles). The optimized weights are subsequently used to calculate the resulting wave heights from the model-ensembles. The results show that the optimization is capable of capturing the different behavioral effects of the different weather models on wave generation. Comparison with the measurements at the selected wave buoy locations shows that the optimized weights, obtained through a training process, can significantly improve the accuracy of the forecasted wave heights over the standard mean values, particularly for typhoon-induced peak waves. The results also indicate that the algorithm is easy to implement and practical for real-time <b>wave</b> <b>forecasting...</b>|$|E
