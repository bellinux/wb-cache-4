5|$|Adi Da wrote {{many books}} about his spiritual {{philosophy}} and related matters, founding a publishing house to print them. He gained praise from authorities in spirituality and philosophy, {{but was also}} criticized for <b>what</b> <b>were</b> perceived as his isolation, controversial behavior, claims toward exclusive realization, and cult-like community.|$|E
5|$|Gens was a Zionist, {{and was a}} {{follower}} of the Revisionist Zionism school, which called for most European Jews to immediately emigrate to create the State of Israel in <b>what</b> <b>were</b> then the League of Nations mandates of Palestine and Trans-Jordan. He belonged to Brith ha-Hayal, a Jewish organization for military reservists.|$|E

50|$|Boritzer gained {{national}} {{critical acclaim}} after <b>What</b> <b>is</b> God? {{was published in}} 1989 although the book has caused controversy from religious fundamentalists for its universalist views. The other current books in the <b>What</b> <b>is?</b> series include <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Love?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Death?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Beautiful?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Funny?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Right?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Peace?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Money?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Dreaming?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> a Friend?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> True?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> a Family?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> a Feeling? The series is now also translated into 15 languages. Boritzer {{was first published in}} 1963 at the age of 13 when he wrote an essay in his English class at Wade Junior High School in the Bronx, New York on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. His essay was included in a special anthology by New York City public school children compiled and published by the New York City Department of Education.|$|R

5|$|There were {{significant}} {{weaknesses in the}} KJRM prior to the invasion. One was the failure to subordinate the Naval Surveillance Command to respective sectors of Naval Coastal Command, and another was giving responsibility for two sectors of Naval Coastal Command to <b>what</b> <b>were</b> essentially training establishments.|$|E

50|$|In its {{exposition}} of progressive meditation for Self-knowledge, the Chandogya Upanishad starts {{by referring to}} the outer worldly knowledges as name. Deeper than this name, is speech asserts verse 7.2.1, because speech <b>is</b> <b>what</b> communicates all outer worldly knowledge as well as <b>what</b> <b>is</b> right and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> wrong, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> true and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> false, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> good and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> bad, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> pleasant and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> unpleasant. Without speech, men can't share this knowledge, and one must adore and revere speech as manifestation of Brahman.|$|R
5|$|Aalborg traces {{its history}} back over a {{thousand}} years. It was originally settled as a trading post because of its position on the Limfjord. The sites of <b>what</b> <b>were</b> two settlements and a burial ground {{can be seen on}} Lindholm Høje, a hill overlooking the city. These large settlements, one from the 6th-century Germanic Iron Age, the other from the Viking Age in the 9th to 11th centuries, evolved at the narrowest point on Limfjord {{as a result of the}} traffic between Himmerland to the south and Vendsyssel to the north.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton Hall Park is {{a public}} park by the River Irk {{in the north of}} Chadderton, {{spanning}} an area of over , in <b>what</b> <b>were</b> once the gardens of the manorial Chadderton Hall. At the end of the 19th century they were leased to Joseph Ball, who transformed the hall and grounds into a pleasure garden, complete with a boating lake and a menagerie. The hall was demolished in 1939. The park is now owned by Oldham Council, the local authority, and was opened to the public in 1956. It was awarded Green Flag status in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Henry was {{particularly}} {{supportive of the}} mendicant orders; his confessors were drawn from the Dominican Friars, and he built mendicant houses in Canterbury, Norwich, Oxford, Reading and York, helping to find valuable space for new buildings in <b>what</b> <b>were</b> already crowded towns and cities. He supported the military crusading orders, and became a patron of the Teutonic Order in 1235. The emerging universities of Oxford and Cambridge also received royal attention: Henry reinforced and regulated their powers, and encouraged scholars to migrate from Paris to teach at them. A rival institution at Northampton was declared by the King to be a mere school and not a true university.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 Kujau {{visited his}} family in East Germany and {{discovered}} {{that many of the}} locals held Nazi memorabilia, contrary to the laws of the communist government. He saw an opportunity to buy the material cheaply on the black market, and make a profit in the West, where the increasing demand among Stuttgart collectors was raising memorabilia prices up to ten times the amount he would pay. The trade was illegal in East Germany, and the export of <b>what</b> <b>were</b> deemed items of cultural heritage was banned. Among the items smuggled out of East Germany were weapons.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, in the lead-up to {{the release}} of the first Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone; Warner Bros., the film's distributor, sent a series of letters to owners of Harry Potter fansites, {{demanding}} that, to protect their copyright, they hand over their domain names. The action resulted in negative publicity for the company when Claire Field, the then 15-year-old webmaster of the British fansite harrypotterguide.co.uk, was reduced to tears by <b>what</b> <b>were</b> described by her father as unnecessary bully tactics. Eventually the corporation backed down in the face of media opposition and declared that, as the site was non-commercial, it did not violate the trademark.|$|E

5|$|In a {{surprise}} move, the Argentine naval commission then threw {{out all of}} the opening tenders and called for another round of bidding; they simultaneously updated the specifications to include <b>what</b> <b>were</b> judged to be the best aspects of all the plans. The competitors were given three weeks to come up with new designs and cost estimates. After diplomatic protests, this was modified slightly; the original bids were kept, but alterations to attempt to conform to the new desired characteristics were allowed.|$|E
5|$|In early 1919, Churchill was {{appointed}} Secretary of State for War and Secretary of State for Air. While Churchill was preoccupied with implementing post-War defence cuts and the demobilization of the Army, the Chief of the Air Staff, Major-General Frederick Sykes, submitted a paper with <b>what</b> <b>were</b> {{at the time}} unrealistic proposals for a large air force of the future. Being dissatisfied with Sykes, Churchill began to consider reinstating Trenchard whose recent performance at Southampton had once more brought him into favour with Churchill.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{the absence of}} an active high yield market {{prompted}} KKR to change its tactics, avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through <b>what</b> <b>were</b> described as leveraged buildups or rollups. One of KKR's largest investments in the 1990s was the leveraged buildup of Primedia in partnership with former executives of Macmillan Publishing, which KKR had failed to acquire in 1988. KKR created Primedia's predecessor, K-III Communications, a platform to buy media properties, initially completing the $310 million divisional buyout of the book club division of Macmillan along with the assets of Intertec Publishing Corporation in May 1989.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of public {{concerns}} following the cholera epidemics and {{the findings of a}} Royal Commission, the Act to Amend the Laws Concerning the Burial of the Dead in the Metropolis (Burials Act) was passed in 1851.

5|$|On 16 October, Kennedy was {{informed}} that U-2 flights over Cuba had discovered <b>what</b> <b>were</b> most likely medium-range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching Khrushchev through diplomatic channels, {{could come up with}} no way of doing this that would not appear weak. On 22 October, Kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles' presence and announcing a blockade of Cuba. Informed in advance of the speech but not (until one hour before) the content, Khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion of Cuba. Even before Kennedy's speech, they ordered Soviet commanders in Cuba that they could use all weapons against an attack—except atomic weapons.|$|E
