5|$|The broad {{heading of}} {{illegality}} may {{be divided into}} two sub-headings. In the first case, the High Court inquires into whether the public authority was empowered to take a particular course of action or make a decision, and, in the other, whether it exercised its discretion <b>wrongly</b> even though it was empowered to act. Where the Court finds that the public authority had exceeded its jurisdiction or had exercised its discretion <b>wrongly,</b> it may invalidate the act or decision.|$|E
5|$|The broad {{heading of}} {{judicial}} review of illegality may {{be divided into two}} sub-headings. In the first case, the High Court inquires into whether the public authority was empowered to take a particular course of action or make a decision, and, in the other, whether it exercised its discretion <b>wrongly</b> even though it was empowered to act. Where the Court finds that the public authority had exceeded its jurisdiction or had exercised its discretion <b>wrongly,</b> it may strike down the decision on the basis of illegality.|$|E
5|$|Because he had <b>wrongly</b> {{described}} significant evidence (including {{the car and}} DeSimone's clothes), {{police had}} dismissed his statement, filing it along with six other confessions to the crime. Hodgson's legal team was never made aware of its existence.|$|E
5|$|Chetan Pandit as Master Deenanath Chauhan, Vijay's father. A morally upright man, he is <b>wrongly</b> framed for {{the rape}} and murder of a young girl and is {{subsequently}} killed by Kancha.|$|E
5|$|G Sergeant H.V.Turner, Subedar Netrabahadur Thapa, Naik Agansing Rai and Rifleman Ganju Lama {{won their}} VCs in combat {{in the state}} of Manipur in India but the {{citations}} <b>wrongly</b> referred to the locations as being in Burma. These errors have been rectified in the list above.|$|E
5|$|New Formulation {{reviewer}} Michael Glavin cited Newman's {{ignorance of}} the initiative of anarchists to decentralize power and of anarchist forms of organisation such as trade unions, federations and affinity groups as evidence that he failed to understand power and <b>wrongly</b> conflated it with domination.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of notable {{people who}} have, or had, the medical {{condition}} epilepsy. Following from that, there is a short list of people who have received a speculative, retrospective diagnosis of epilepsy. Finally there is a substantial list of people who are often <b>wrongly</b> believed to have had epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|After Bardulf's death, a {{legal case}} was brought against Bardulf's {{chaplain}} and constable, alleging that Bardulf had allowed his two servants {{to hear a}} case that should have been heard by the justice. The litigants charged that the two servants had <b>wrongly</b> decided the case, and after hearing the allegations, the royal justices at Westminster agreed and restored the disputed property to the litigants.|$|E
5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but the victim is aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if the victim <b>wrongly</b> believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E
5|$|Co-writer Sabra Chartrand {{graduated}} from the University of Washington, and reported for Reuters and Israel Radio in Tel Aviv, Israel. She later joined The New York Times as a journalist with their Jerusalem bureau. After Flying Blind, Flying Safe, she co-wrote Black And White on Wall Street, The Untold Story of the Man <b>Wrongly</b> Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody with former Kidder, Peabody & Co. bond trader Joseph Jett.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{attended}} the University of Nottingham, where he qualified {{as a civil}} engineer, aged 22. Johnson became a surveyor at Melton Mowbray Urban District Council before progressing to assistant engineer with Chigwell Urban District Council at Loughton. In 1938, Johnson broke his collarbone playing rugby for Chingford Rugby Club; the injury was <b>wrongly</b> set and did not heal properly, which later caused him difficulty {{at the start of}} his flying career.|$|E
5|$|Leo Max Frank (April 17, 1884August 17, 1915) was an American factory {{superintendent}} who {{was convicted}} in 1913 {{of the murder of}} a 13-year-old employee, Mary Phagan, in Atlanta, Georgia. His trial, and lynching two years later, attracted national attention and became the focus of social, regional, political, and racial concerns, particularly regarding antisemitism. Today, the consensus of researchers on the subject holds that Frank was <b>wrongly</b> convicted.|$|E
5|$|Scotland Yard {{released}} the e-fits in 2013 for a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction. After it had aired, The Sunday Times published that the McCanns {{had had the}} e-fits since 2008. In response the couple sued the newspaper for having implied (<b>wrongly)</b> {{that they had not}} only failed to publish them but had withheld them from the police. The newspaper apologized and paid £55,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|The Estoire de Eracles <b>wrongly</b> {{claimed that}} Saladin's sister was {{also among the}} prisoners taken by Raynald when he seized the caravan. Actually, she {{returned}} from Mecca to Damascus in a subsequent pilgrim-caravan in March 1187. To protect her against an attack by Raynald, Saladin escorted the pilgrims while they were travelling near Oultrejordain. Saladin stormed into Oultrejordain on 26April and pillaged Raynald's domains for a month. Thereafter, Saladin marched to Ashtara, where the troops coming {{from all parts of}} his realm assembled.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{offensive}} was to completely destroy the Allied beachhead, with the Japanese <b>wrongly</b> believing that their forces were approximately {{as large as the}} combat units deployed to defend the Allied positions. The Allies detected the Japanese preparations for the attack shortly after they began in early 1944, and strengthened the perimeter's defenses. None of the three Japanese forces which conducted the attack was able to penetrate far into the Allied perimeter, though there was intense fighting for several positions.|$|E
5|$|Yorktown {{stood out}} of Callao on 4 March 1892, steamed northward via San Diego and San Francisco, and {{eventually}} arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California. The gunboat subsequently underwent repairs there {{until late in the}} following month. Having weathered one diplomatic storm and international incident, Evans and his command soon set sail on another mission that, if handled <b>wrongly,</b> could have caused ill-feeling with the British.|$|E
5|$|A {{company board}} member, Victor Coen, was {{convinced}} that the company had been treated <b>wrongly</b> and insisted in bringing it before the courts. In May 1929, he convinced the rest of the board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen percent.|$|E
5|$|Before year 2000 some survivalists <b>wrongly</b> {{believed}} this process {{would be set}} in motion by the predicted Y2K problem causing societal collapse. Since many left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists believe that the September 11 attacks were a false flag operation carried out by the United States intelligence community, as part of a strategy of tension to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad, they have become convinced that a more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering Executive Directive 51 in order to complete the transition to a police state.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale {{also began}} work on the fragmentary writing Soborul țațelor ("The Council of Busibodies", 1929) and the detective story Sub pecetea tainei ("Under the Seal of Secrecy", 1930), but they would remain unfinished. In its first draft, Sub pecetea tainei was {{published}} by Gândirea in April 1930-April 1933, while Soborul țațelor was kept in three different variants. In a 1985 essay later published as a preface for Sub pecetea tainei, literary critic Nicolae Manolescu proposed that, while the story was not given a finishing touch, its plot was meant to seem ambiguous, and thus had led other commentators to <b>wrongly</b> assume that the text ended abruptly.|$|E
5|$|Cicero {{stated the}} twins {{objection}} (that with close birth times, personal outcomes {{can be very}} different), later developed by Saint Augustine. He argued that since the other planets are much more distant from the earth than the moon, they could have only very tiny influence compared to the moon's. He also argued that if astrology explains everything about a person's fate, then it <b>wrongly</b> ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or {{the effects of the}} weather on people.|$|E
5|$|Countershading is {{less often}} used for {{military}} camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English zoologist Hugh Cott encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often <b>wrongly</b> viewed camouflage netting {{as a kind of}} invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught to look at camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of view. At the same time in Australia, zoologist William John Dakin advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Hrithik Roshan {{plays the}} lead role of Vijay Deenanath Chauhan and Sanjay Dutt {{plays the role of}} the {{antagonist}} Kancha, originally played by Amitabh Bachchan and Danny Denzongpa respectively, with Rishi Kapoor portraying the newly introduced character of Rauf Lala. The supporting cast include Om Puri as Commissioner Gaitonde, Priyanka Chopra as Kaali Gawde and Zarina Wahab as Suhasini Chauhan, with Katrina Kaif featuring in an item number. The film follows the struggle of a common man, Vijay Chauhan, as he seeks revenge from Kancha, for <b>wrongly</b> framing and murdering his father in the island village of Mandwa. In the process he befriends an underworld drug lord Rauf Lala and {{falls in love with a}} loquacious girl, Kaali Gawde.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{the cause of the}} disease until 1903 when Adelchi Negri (1876–1912) first saw {{microscopic}} lesions– now called Negri bodies– in the brains of rabid animals. He <b>wrongly</b> thought they were protozoan parasites. Paul Remlinger (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres long, now known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– the virus that causes rabies.|$|E
5|$|Makkhi beats {{up one of}} {{the workers}} in his factory due to a small mishap. The worker goes to the police station with his mother to file a complaint. Chulbul beats up Makkhi in public to disgrace him. Chedi takes {{advantage}} of the situation, and takes Makkhi along with his father to the police station. Makkhi's father resolves the situation by accepting an apology from Chulbul. Chulbul meets Dayal Babu (Anupam Kher), a local political leader, who also dislikes Chedi. With his help, Chulbul adulterates the breweries of Chedi, and <b>wrongly</b> frames him for it.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 2007 it was {{announced}} that the faulty transactions could be traced back to 2000, and that a total of 3.7 million Hong Kong dollars had been <b>wrongly</b> deducted in 15,270 cases. The company reported that there might be cases dating to before 2000, but that only transactions from the past seven years were kept. The company stated that it would co-operate with EPS Company Limited, operator of Electronic Payment Services, and banks, to contact customers involved and arrange a refund within ten weeks' time.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1945, Soviet-controlled Hungarian radio {{announced}} that Wallenberg and his driver {{had been murdered}} {{on their way to}} Debrecen, suggesting that they had been killed by the Arrow Cross Party or the Gestapo. Sweden's foreign minister, Östen Undén, and its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Staffan Söderblom, <b>wrongly</b> assumed that they were dead. In April 1945, W. Averell Harriman, then of the U.S. State Department, offered the Swedish government help in inquiring about Wallenberg's fate, but the offer was declined. Söderblom met with Vyacheslav Molotov and Stalin in Moscow on 15 June 1946. Söderblom, still believing Wallenberg to be dead, ignored talk of an exchange for Russian defectors in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Quinn {{returns to}} Lima {{with a new}} boyfriend, Biff, for the special 100th episode. Puck is jealous of their {{relationship}}, because he still loves her. Quinn is lying to him because {{she does not want}} him to know about her past yet. Puck convinces her to tell Biff the truth, which she does. Biff reacts <b>wrongly</b> and insults her, which causes a fight between Puck and Biff. They later break-up. Puck and Quinn talk about Finn and their relationship, and she realizes that she still loves him. They later start a relationship again, which is later confirmed in the next episode.|$|E
5|$|Rupert {{continued}} to impress militarily. By 1644, now the Duke of Cumberland and Earl of Holderness, {{he led the}} relief of Newark and York and its castle. Having marched north, taking Bolton and Liverpool along the way in two bloody assaults, Rupert then intervened in Yorkshire in two highly effective manoeuvres, in the first outwitting the enemy forces at Newark with speed; in the second, striking across country and approaching York from the north. Rupert then commanded much of the royalist army at its defeat at Marston Moor, {{with much of the}} blame falling on the poor working relationship between Rupert and the Marquess of Newcastle, and orders from the King that <b>wrongly</b> conveyed a desperate need for a speedy success in the north.|$|E
5|$|Sanger appealed her 1917 {{conviction}} {{and won a}} mixed victory in 1918 in a unanimous decision by the New York Court of Appeals written by Judge Frederick E. Crane. The court's opinion upheld her conviction, but indicated that the courts {{would be willing to}} permit contraception if prescribed by doctors.Engelman, pp. 101–103. This decision was only applicable within New York, where it opened the door for birth control clinics, under physician supervision, to be established. Sanger herself did not immediately take advantage of the opportunity, <b>wrongly</b> expecting that the medical profession would lead the way; instead she focused on writing and lecturing.|$|E
5|$|The English chemist Charles Hatchett {{reported}} a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium. In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston <b>wrongly</b> concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, {{a series of}} scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a century both names were used interchangeably. Niobium was officially adopted as {{the name of the}} element in 1949, but the name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Independent {{newspaper}} apologised on 21 August 2006, {{writing that}} on 14 June 2006, the paper had <b>wrongly</b> reported Mardas' involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier piece by writing that Mardas {{had not been}} a company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, and was not sacked, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later. The paper accepted that Mardas “did not claim to have invented electric paint, a flying saucer or a recording studio with a ‘sonic force field’ or cause his employers to waste money on such ideas. We apologise to Mr. Mardas for these errors".|$|E
5|$|The {{disagreement}} between Jackson and Raw during the Battle of Long Tan had long-term {{effects on the}} structure of the Australian Defence Force. Raw's initial refusal to commit helicopters contributed {{to the development of a}} long-lasting perception among some Army officers that the RAAF was reluctant to support their service in battle. Some members of the Army also <b>wrongly</b> believed that RAAF pilots had refused to conduct the supply mission, and only did so after the squadron was threatened with being withdrawn from South Vietnam and they were spoken to forcefully by Raw. Influenced by this perception, the Army subsequently advocated for the RAAF's battlefield helicopters to be transferred to its control, and this finally occurred in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Usually {{reports were}} issued on any {{incident}} with every aircraft. On the date McCudden died, 29 such returns exist for S.E.5s {{but the report}} pertaining to his accident is not among them leaving the official cause of the crash unexplained. It is possible the engine failed due to a <b>wrongly</b> installed carburettor. However, there is some doubt as to whether a mechanical defect was the culprit. The witnesses reported the pilot was attempting low-level stunts, manifesting in several turns and rolls. Many years later other witnesses disputed the aircraft performed a roll, but all agreed the trouble began when the machine entered an attitude resembling a near-vertical turn.|$|E
5|$|When the WWF {{was renamed}} World Wrestling Entertainment and {{divided into two}} Raw and SmackDown brands, Holly was {{assigned}} to the Raw roster, where he had little success. He jumped ship to SmackDown! on the September 2, 2002 episode of Raw during a match with Jeff Hardy. Earlier, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff was informed that a Raw wrestler would leave to reunite with a relative on SmackDown!, and ordered a beatdown on Hardy, who he <b>wrongly</b> suspected of planning to join his brother, Matt Hardy.|$|E
5|$|Yusef is <b>wrongly</b> {{accused of}} {{having an affair with}} Zainab, due to his {{sister-in-law}} overhearing them speaking. A source said that the whole day turns into a disaster. When Shameem sees Yusef and Zainab together she automatically thinks they're having an affair and everyone struggles {{to come to terms with}} what they have heard. Bhatti has admitted that he is surprised by his status as a heartthrob. Interviewed by Will Payne of the Sunday Mirror, he said that it's a great compliment however, it was a complete surprise. Bhatti hinted that perhaps women love the character, but he prefer trainers and jeans to smart suits.|$|E
