Mimi phoned the Oxford Street Maternity Hospital that evening {{and was told that}} Julia had given birth to a boy. According to Mimi, she went {{straight}} to the hospital during the middle of an air raid, and was forced to hide in doorways to avoid the shrapnel. She ran, as she later recalled, [...] "as fast as my legs could carry me". When a parachute-borne landmine fell outside the hospital, she later said, [...] "My sister [...] stayed in bed, and they put the baby [...] under the bed. They <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the basement, but I wouldn't. I ran {{all the way back to}} Newcastle Road to tell father [...] the news. 'Get under the shelter,' the wardens were shouting. 'Oh, be quiet,' I told them." [...] The story about the air-raid has since been repudiated, as there was no attack that night. The previous raid had been on 21–22 September, and the next was on 16 October, when the areas of Walton and Everton were badly hit.|$|E

You might be better than both of them.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|G. W. Hoover, the {{passenger}} who said Elwood had run down two passengers in the water, swore out an {{affidavit in support}} of a warrant for the arrest of Captain Lee, claiming that Lee had threatened to kill him. [...] According to Hoover, [...] "Captain Lee called at my place of business and demanded to see me, but was so excited that they would not permit him to do so. [...] He threatened to kill me, and kept his hand on his hip pocket. [...] He <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> aboard his boat, where he said he had twenty-five men to testify that he had not run down any men in the water." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily {{influenced}} by his father. He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. He later said, [...] "I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start {{going to the gym}} and start Olympic lifting." [...] However, his official website biography claims that [...] "at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career". During a speech in 2001, he said, [...] "My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to trade school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact is, {{the idea}} came into my head last fall when I went up to Superior. My partner <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in with him on some land, and I did. We speculated on {{the growth of the}} town toward the south. We made a strike; then he <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in on a copper mine. Of course I expected-" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There's {{no reason}} why I should go home, then?" [...] Cassandra said, pausing. [...] "Unless you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> Katharine? What DO you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Joe <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Aldershot as a light-weight," [...] {{explained}} Sheen, [...] "and I {{was just}} saying that I couldn't, because of Stanning." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And smoke our pipes there,--quite comfortable. And then he <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and fling {{ourselves}} into the river. That was uncommon civil, wasn't it? And then he well nigh choked me." ...|$|E
