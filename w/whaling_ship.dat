5|$|Arthur Gordon Pym {{was born}} {{on the island of}} Nantucket, famous for its fishing harbor and whaling. His best friend, Augustus Barnard, is the son of the captain of a <b>whaling</b> <b>ship.</b> One night, the two boys become drunk and decide, on Augustus's whim, to take {{advantage}} of the breeze and sail out on Pym's sailboat, the Ariel. The breeze, however, turns out to be the beginnings of a violent storm. The situation gets critical when Augustus passes out drunk, and the inexperienced Pym must take control of the dinghy. The Ariel is overtaken by the Penguin, a returning <b>whaling</b> <b>ship.</b> Against the captain's wishes, the crew of the Penguin turns back to search for and rescue both Augustus and Pym. After they are safely back on land, they decide to keep this episode a secret from their parents.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{appointed}} Thomas Robertson as Scotias captain. Robertson was {{an experienced}} Antarctic and Arctic sailor who had commanded the <b>whaling</b> <b>ship</b> Active on the Dundee Whaling Expedition. The {{rest of the}} 25officers and men, who signed for three-year engagements, were all Scotsmen, many used to sailing in icy waters on whaling voyages.|$|E
5|$|From 1865 to 1867, British {{authorities}} {{rounded up}} {{supporters of the}} Irish Republican Brotherhood, or Fenians, an Irish independence movement, and transported sixty-two of them to Western Australia. In 1869, John Boyle O'Reilly escaped on the American <b>whaling</b> <b>ship</b> Gazelle and settled in Boston. Later that year, pardons were issued {{to many of the}} imprisoned Fenians, after which only eight militant Fenians remained in Western Australia's penal system.|$|E
50|$|The sturdy, wide beamed <b>whaling</b> <b>ships</b> {{were well}} suited to serve as convict transports. For this reason, many American whalers {{migrated}} to London and served on British <b>whaling</b> <b>ships</b> transporting convicts to New South Wales. Among these was Captain Eber Bunker.|$|R
50|$|Oka also leased and {{purchased}} modern <b>whaling</b> <b>ships</b> from Norwegian companies, {{starting with the}} Olga, the Rex and the Regina. When the Olga was later sold, its gunner was sent to Oslo to contract {{the construction of a}} new catcher, the Togo, which was delivered in 1906 as the first of many <b>whaling</b> <b>ships</b> built in Norwegian shipyards for Japan. Some of the Norwegian built <b>whaling</b> <b>ships</b> from businesses that failed in Newfoundland were also bought by Japanese companies.|$|R

5|$|Whitby grew in {{size and}} wealth, {{extending}} its activities to include shipbuilding using local oak timber. In 1790–91 Whitby built 11,754tons of shipping, making it the third largest shipbuilder in England, after London and Newcastle. Taxes on imports entering the port raised money to improve and extend the town's twin piers, improving the harbour and permitting further increases in trade. In 1753 the first <b>whaling</b> <b>ship</b> set sail to Greenland and by 1795 Whitby had become a major whaling port. The most successful year was 1814 when eight ships caught 172 whales, and the whaler, the Resolutions catch produced 230tons of oil. The carcases yielded 42tons of whale bone used for 'stays' which {{were used in the}} corsetry trade until changes in fashion made them redundant. Blubber was boiled to produce oil for use in lamps in four oil houses on the harbourside. Oil was used for street lighting until the spread of gas lighting reduced demand and the Whitby Whale Oil and Gas Company changed into the Whitby Coal and Gas Company. As the market for whale products fell, catches became too small to be economic and by 1831 only one <b>whaling</b> <b>ship,</b> the Phoenix, remained.|$|E
5|$|The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838) is {{the only}} {{complete}} novel written by American writer Edgar Allan Poe. The work relates {{the tale of the}} young Arthur Gordon Pym, who stows away aboard a <b>whaling</b> <b>ship</b> called the Grampus. Various adventures and misadventures befall Pym, including shipwreck, mutiny, and cannibalism, before he is saved by the crew of the Jane Guy. Aboard this vessel, Pym and a sailor named Dirk Peters continue their adventures farther south. Docking on land, they encounter hostile black-skinned natives before escaping back to the ocean. The novel ends abruptly as Pym and Peters continue toward the South Pole.|$|E
5|$|John Hinton, {{known as}} Jack, {{was born in}} Colac Bay in Southland, New Zealand, on 17 September 1909, one of seven {{children}} of Harry Hinton, a railway man, and Elizabeth Mary. He was educated at local schools and on most days, before starting lessons, would milk a herd of 40 cows. When he was 12, he {{ran away from home}} after an argument with his father. He found a job at a grocer's in a nearby town but after a year signed on as a galleyhand aboard a Norwegian <b>whaling</b> <b>ship,</b> which spent the 1921/1922 whaling season in the Southern Ocean. On his return, and after reconciling with his parents, he started working as a shepherd. He soon tired of this and began the life of a swagman, working from town to town as he travelled around the South Island.|$|E

5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} banjo, as did Julia, though neither pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} the banjo). They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming of what they would do in the future — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He kept in touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a <b>whaling</b> <b>ship</b> for two years—which could have earned him enough money to buy a house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese whaling fleet {{had several}} clashes with anti-whaling protesters and activists from various groups, {{including}} the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, endeavoring to follow, document and disrupt the whaling fleet since the 2005–2006 season. On January 15, 2008 two crew members traveling on the MV Steve Irwin boarded the <b>whaling</b> <b>ship</b> Yushin Maru 2 without permission and were subsequently detained {{on board the}} ship {{for a number of}} days.

5000|$|On whalers try pots {{would be}} built into the deck, {{a part of the}} ship known as the tryworks. In the 18th- and 19th-century New England whaling industry, the use of try-works (two large try pots in a brick furnace) on <b>whaling</b> <b>ships</b> allowed them to stay at sea longer and boil out their oil. The slices of blubber were kept as thin as {{possible}} for the process, and on New England <b>whaling</b> <b>ships,</b> these slices were called [...] "bible leaves" [...] by the sailors.|$|R
25|$|In 1835, the French whaleship Gange ventured {{north of}} 50°N {{and became the}} first pelagic <b>whaling</b> <b>ship</b> to catch a North Pacific right whale. News of this find spread quickly. Whaleships north of 50° {{increased}} from 2 in 1839 to 108 in 1843 and to 292 in 1846. Approximately 90% of the whaleships were American, the remainder primarily French.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese trawler, Shunyo-maru, {{later became}} a {{combined}} catcher/factory <b>whaling</b> <b>ship,</b> MV Tonna, and was owned by Andrew M. Behr who also owned the <b>whaling</b> <b>ship,</b> Sierra. The Tonna {{is famous for its}} demise. In 1978 with full holds the Tonna landed another 50 ton fin whale. As the whale was being winched aboard for processing the ship listed over, took on water and quickly sank. Behr and the Sierra were also linked to Japan's Taiyo Fisheries Co. through a Canadian subsidiary (Taiyo Canada Ltd.) and with whale product for Japanese markets. In July, 1979, the Sierra was severely damaged after being rammed by activist Paul Watson aboard his ship, the Sea Shepherd. The Sierra was later (February, 1980) sunk in port by unknown saboteurs with limpet mines. Taiyo and other Japanese fisheries have also been linked to whaling through subsidiary companies in Taiwan, the Philippines, Spain, South Korea, Chile and Peru.|$|E

50|$|Born in Sydney, Jones was {{the third}} son of Thomas Jones, {{one of the early}} {{settlers}} in New South Wales.

John Richard Jones was his eldest son.|$|R
