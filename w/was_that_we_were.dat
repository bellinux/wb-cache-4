500|$|On December 21, 1970, Presley {{engineered}} {{a meeting}} with President Richard Nixon at the White House, where he expressed his patriotism and his contempt for the hippies, the growing drug culture, and the counterculture in general. He asked Nixon for a Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs badge, to add to similar items he had begun collecting and to signify official sanction of his patriotic efforts. Nixon, who apparently found the encounter awkward, expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people {{and that it was}} therefore important he [...] "retain his credibility". Presley told Nixon that the Beatles, whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era, exemplified what he saw as a trend of anti-Americanism and drug abuse in popular culture. On hearing reports of the meeting, Paul McCartney later said he [...] "felt a bit betrayed" [...] and commented: [...] "The great joke <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> taking [...] drugs, and look what happened to him", a reference to Presley's death, hastened by prescription drug abuse.|$|E
500|$|In September 2012, Tomlinson {{signed a}} four-month {{contract}} with Burton Albion, having previously been on trial at Preston North End. He joined the [...] "Brewers" [...] after manager Gary Rowett was {{dissatisfied with the}} performances of Ross Atkins and Dean Lyness. After keeping a clean sheet on his debut, in a 1–0 win over Rochdale at Spotland on 8 September, assistant manager Kevin Summerfield said that [...] "the biggest difference for me <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> playing the game in their half and they were defending corners because he [...] can kick the ball so far up the pitch". He was aiming for a longer stay at the Pirelli Stadium, but a knee injury sustained in a home draw with former club Port Vale left him sidelined {{for up to six}} months. He recovered to full fitness in half that time, and signed a new contract in February to extend his stay at Burton until summer 2014. Burton reached the play-offs {{at the end of the}} 2012–13 season, but were defeated 5–4 by Bradford City at the semi-final stage. Tomlinson retired in July 2013 after surgeons advised him that scar tissue damage and a tear in his anterior cruciate ligament meant that his left knee was in poor shape and was vulnerable to further damage.|$|E
500|$|In July 1996, Radiohead started rehearsing and {{recording}} OK Computer in their Canned Applause studio, a converted shed near Didcot, Oxfordshire. Even without the deadline {{that contributed to}} the stress of The Bends, the band still had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: [...] "We're jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song... The stupid thing <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> nearly finished when we'd move on, because so much work had gone into them." [...] The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly [...] "the loudest voice" [...] according to O'Brien. Selway said [...] "we give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts, {{but at the same time}} we are all very critical about what the other person is doing." [...] Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead [...] "need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well... I take up slack when people aren't taking responsibility—the term producing a record means taking responsibility for the record... It's my job to ensure that they get the ideas across." [...] Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's [...] "sixth member", an allusion to George Martin's nickname as the [...] "fifth Beatle".|$|E

And at some level, I can’t blame them. Certainly, 9 percent unemployment and very slow growth is not a good situation." [...] On November 2, he again expressed sympathy with frustrations about the economy but also said many of the complaints levied at the Fed, including those made against the steps it took during the financial crisis, are misguided. “The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions,” he said. “A very simplistic interpretation of that [...] <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing that because we wanted to preserve banker salaries.

2500|$|Mullen, who had mostly been {{absent from}} the {{sessions}} {{to start a family}} and nurse a worsening back injury, had major surgery on his back in November 1995. Mullen was unable to drum properly during this period, forcing U2 to abandon their usual methods of songwriting as a group but also allowing them to pursue different musical influences. Mullen admits that he was upset that the band entered the studio without him, cognizant that key decisions would be made in the early months of recording. Eno attempted to convince the other band members to wait for Mullen, but as the Edge explains, [...] "The thinking <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to further experiment with the notion of what a band was all about and find new ways to write songs, accepting the influence, and aesthetics of dance music... we thought, 'Let's just start with Howie mixing drum beats and see where that gets us.'" [...] Mullen was back in the studio three weeks after his surgery, but his back prevented him from fully dedicating himself to recording. As he described, [...] "I needed a little more time to recover. But we were struggling with some of the material and for the project to move ahead, I had {{to put a lot of}} time in." [...] Sessions ceased temporarily in January 1996 to allow Mullen to rehabilitate.|$|E
2500|$|The President of the Massachusetts Senate {{controls}} the calling {{of a constitutional}} convention and its agenda. Senate President Tom Birmingham, an opponent of the amendment, called a joint meeting of the legislature as a constitutional convention for June 19, 2002, and immediately adjourned it for a month saying legislators needed for time to consider the agenda items. When the constitutional convention met again on July 17, the amendment's opponents knew that proponents had the 50 votes needed for passage. Birmingham, who was presiding, moved for adjournment without considering the amendment, and his motion passed 137 to 53. He called the amendment [...] "wrong-hearted and wrong-headed" [...] and defended the procedure: [...] "Everybody recognizes a vote to adjourn was a vote up or down" [...] on the amendment. [...] "I did gavel the last constitutional convention to a recess because I felt the members needed more time to assess.... Today we saw democracy in action. They may not like it, but they lost two to one." [...] A representative of the Catholic Action League, which supported the amendment, said: [...] "Everything that is wrong with Massachusetts state government was apparent today {{for all the world}} to see". One legislator who voted to adjourn said: [...] "For those of us who believe in an open democratic process, this was not a comfortable vote". State Senator Cheryl A. Jacques, an opponent of the amendment and a lesbian, said: [...] "I'm proud to have done anything possible to defeat this hate-filled, discriminatory measure. I'll take a victory on this any way I can get it." [...] Arlene Isaacson of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus later explained it was a critical moment because same-sex marriage had no chance of winning a popular vote at the time: [...] "Not that we would lose by a little, because that wasn't an issue.
