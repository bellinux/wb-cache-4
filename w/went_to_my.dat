Andrew Nigels described E.T.'s story as [...] "crucifixion by military science" [...] and [...] "resurrection by love and faith". According to Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride, Universal Pictures appealed {{directly to the}} Christian market, with a poster reminiscent of Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam and a logo reading [...] "Peace". Spielberg answered {{that he did not}} intend the film to be a religious parable, joking, [...] "If I ever <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mother and said, 'Mom, I've made this movie that's a Christian parable,' what do you think she'd say?

Originally the script had called for more overt religious imagery, though censors at Fox objected to depictions of faith healer Samuel being beaten to death whilst in a cruciform pose, leading to scenes being cut.|$|E

500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around.

500|$|In 2008, Popular Mechanics named The Truman Show {{as one of}} the 10 most prophetic {{science fiction}} films. Journalist Erik Sofge argued that the story {{reflects}} the falseness of reality television. [...] "Truman simply lives, and the show's popularity is its straightforward voyeurism. And, like Big Brother, Survivor, and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real." [...] He deemed it an eerie coincidence that Big Brother made its debut a year after the film's release, and he also compared the film to the 2003 program The Joe Schmo Show: [...] "Unlike Truman, Matt Gould could see the cameras, but all of the other contestants were paid actors, playing the part of various reality-show stereotypes. While Matt eventually got all of the prizes in the rigged contest, the show's central running joke was in the same existential ballpark as The Truman Show." [...] Weir declared, [...] "There has always been this question: Is the audience getting dumber? Or are we filmmakers patronizing them? Is this what they want? Or is this what we're giving them? But the public <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> film in large numbers. And that has to be encouraging." ...|$|E
500|$|DeHavilland {{turned to}} Warner's wife Anne for help. Warner later recalled, [...] "Olivia, {{who had a}} brain like a {{computer}} concealed behind those fawn-like eyes, simply <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> wife and they joined forces to change my mind." [...] Warner relented, and deHavilland was signed to the project {{a few weeks before}} the start of principal photography on January 26, 1939. Set in the American South during the 19th century, the film is about the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner in love with the husband of her sister-in-law, Melanie, whose kindness stands in sharp contrast to those around her. According to film historian Tony Thomas, deHavilland's skillful and subtle performance effectively presents this character of selfless love and quiet strength in a way that keeps her vital and interesting throughout the film. Gone with the Wind had its world premiere in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 15, 1939, and was well received. Frank S. Nugent of The Times wrote that deHavilland's Melanie [...] "is a gracious, dignified, tender gem of characterization", and John C. Flinn, Sr., in Variety called her [...] "a standout". The film won 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and deHavilland received her first nomination for Best Supporting Actress.|$|E

500|$|According to Anderson's account, {{the first}} of the stories that became Winesburg, Ohio ({{probably}} [...] "The Book of the Grotesque") was composed, {{on the spur of the}} moment, in the middle of the night, probably while he was staying on the third floor of a rooming house at [...] in Chicago: [...] "...it was a late fall night and raining...I was there naked in the bed and I sprang up. I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> typewriter and began to write. It was there, under those circumstances, myself sitting near an open window, the rain occasionally blowing in and wetting my bare back, that I did my first writing...I wrote it, as I wrote them all, complete in the one sitting...The rest of the stories in the book came out of me on succeeding evenings, and sometimes during the day while I worked in the advertising office..." [...] Study of his manuscripts shows that, though it is probably true that most of the stories were written within a relatively short span of time in late 1915, like a number of facts in Anderson's retelling of his writing process (for instance, his claim that he had written the Winesburg, Ohio stories after his earlier books were already published), it is inaccurate to say that the final versions of the stories published in 1919 were exactly the same as the ones written whole four years earlier.|$|E

Her father is Christian and her mother is Jewish; she was raised with [...] "a little bit of both" [...] religions. Tisdale's elder sister Jennifer is an actress and producer. She is also related to businessman Ron Popeil through her maternal grandfather Arnold Morris who was best known for being a pitchman for the Ginsu knife. At the age of three, Tisdale met her manager, Bill Perlman, at a New Jersey mall. He sent her to various auditions for commercials, and she was placed {{in more than one}} hundred national network TV advertisements as a child. She began her theatrical career by appearing in [...] and The Sound of Music at Monmouth County's Jewish Community Center. Tisdale was eight years old when she was cast to play the part of Cosette in the musical Les Misérables, and only recalled taking a single singing lesson before landing the role. In 2007, Tisdale told Newsday, [...] "When I was little, I saw the play Les Misérables on Broadway.

May, described by Every as one of the [...] "true cocks of the game, and old sportsmen," [...] was zealously supportive of the mutiny, and Creagh testified of their bone-chilling exchange:I met with W.

For the first and only time in my life I spoke harshly to him, and characterized his abuse of himself and of the confidence of his friends as shameful. He replied depreciatingly, and turning down the gas-light came around and crept into bed beside me. We both lay a moment in silence, and feeling reproved for my harshness, I said: “Think, Fitz, of your warnings on the subject, and of your effort, in behalf of other victims.” In a tone and with a pathos I can never forget, he answered — “He saved others, himself he could not save.” ...|$|E

And no matter what people might think, there will be some 13 year old kid out there who'll read an interview and think 'Imagine? I've never heard that song' and he might go and buy the album, you know what I mean?"
