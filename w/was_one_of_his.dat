Soon after, on 31 October, Hauptmann (Captain) Specht was promoted to Kommandeur of III./NJS 1. Located at Ingolstadt-Manching, Specht instructed pilots in conversion to night fighting. Paul Zorner, a future night fighter expert, <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> students. Leading the Gruppe for exactly one year, {{this was the last}} time Specht flew a twin engine aircraft, whereupon he returned to combat duties.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle Onassis's second {{marriage}} exacerbated the tensions already inherent in {{his relationship with}} his son. He also disapproved of Alexander's secret relationship with Fiona Thyssen (née Campbell Walter), a British fashion model some 16 years his senior and the former wife of industrialist Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza. Onassis had first met Fiona Thyssen when he was 12, and as an 18-year-old had surprised his mother by inviting her to a dinner party, as she <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother's friends.|$|E
5|$|Australia scored slowly, as Yardley {{employed}} leg {{theory to}} slow the scoring. Brown came in at No. 5, but he had played {{most of his career}} as an opening batsman and appeared uncomfortable before falling for 24. Hassett came in and Australia reached stumps at 293/4, a lead of 128. Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes, with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes. It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs.|$|E
5|$|Despite his superb playing results, chess was not Lasker's only interest. His parents {{recognized}} his intellectual talents, especially for mathematics, {{and sent the}} adolescent Emanuel to study in Berlin (where he found {{he also had a}} talent for chess). Lasker gained his abitur (high school graduation certificate) at Landsberg an der Warthe, now a Polish town named Gorzów Wielkopolski but then part of Prussia. He then studied mathematics and philosophy at the universities in Berlin, Göttingen (where David Hilbert <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> doctoral advisors) and Heidelberg.|$|E

5|$|Deusdedit (died c. 664) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury, the first {{native-born}} holder of the see of Canterbury. By birth an Anglo-Saxon, he became archbishop in 655 {{and held the}} office for more than nine years until his death, probably from plague. Deusdedit's successor as archbishop <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> priests at Canterbury. There is some controversy over the exact date of Deusdedit's death, owing to discrepancies in the medieval written work that records his life. Little is known about his episcopate, but he {{was considered to be}} a saint after his demise. A saint's life was written after his relics were moved from their original burial place in 1091.|$|E
5|$|Donald Petrie was {{originally}} signed {{to direct the}} episode, but dropped out to direct the film Mystic Pizza. Executive producer Robert Justman brought in Rob Bowman to direct his first Star Trek episode. Justman later said that this <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most-significant achievements on The Next Generation. Bowman worked on storyboards and set blocking for twenty days before shooting the episode. He was initially nervous about working on the show, and {{felt he had to}} prove himself because of his relative inexperience as a director. Bowman said that after the second day of filming it became easier, and credited the crew with making him feel welcome. He went on to direct twelve more episodes of The Next Generation.|$|E

5|$|Franz Ferdinand was an {{advocate}} of increased federalism and widely believed to favor trialism, under which Austria-Hungary would be reorganized by combining the Slavic lands within the Austro-Hungarian empire into a third crown. A Slavic kingdom {{could have been a}} bulwark against Serb irredentism, and Franz Ferdinand was therefore perceived as a threat by those same irredentists. Princip later stated to the court that preventing Franz Ferdinand's planned reforms <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> motivations.|$|E

5|$|Ichigo is {{voiced by}} Masakazu Morita in the Japanese anime, while {{as a child}} he is voiced by Yuki Matsuoka. Morita said that Ichigo <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{favorite}} characters he ever played alongside Tidus from Final Fantasy X. Johnny Yong Bosch voices him in the English dub as a teenager, and Mona Marshall as a kid. While describing Ichigo {{as one of his}} best roles, Morita notes that voicing him can be at times difficult. Bosch has enjoyed voicing Ichigo's character due to his personal interest in the character's morals. However, he experienced difficulty voicing him in some scenes where Ichigo shouts for a long time.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{upon the}} {{conclusion}} of the sketch, writer Michael O'Donoghue knew it was an instant success. He had been watching the Saturday Night Live performance from beside the set, off-camera. He felt that Belushi had performed his role as Captain Kirk perfectly. As soon as Belushi left the set, O'Donoghue went over to him and gave the actor a congratulatory hug. On reflection, after the live performance, O'Donoghue stated that Belushi had performed a perfect parody of Shatner as Kirk. Belushi felt it <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most satisfying performances.|$|E
5|$|Rivera's 2008 season <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> best {{individual}} years. Along with a 1.40ERA and 39saves in 40opportunities, he set career bests {{in multiple}} statistical categories, including WHIP (0.67), on-base plus slugging (OPS)-against (.422), batting average against (.165), save percentage (97.5%), walks (6), earned runs (11), and blown saves (1). He averaged 9.81strikeouts per 9 innings pitched, his best mark as a closer. He pitched with such control that his 12.83strikeout-to-walk ratio {{made him the}} second MLB pitcher ever to record a figure that high in a season (minimum 50innings pitched). He placed fifth in the AL Cy Young Award voting.|$|E
5|$|Stephen survived his doctor, {{who died}} in Moldavia in late 1503. Another Moldavian {{delegation}} was sent to Venice {{to ask for a}} replacement, but also to propose a new alliance against the Ottomans. This <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> last acts of international diplomacy. When Stephen was dying, various boyars, who opposed Bogdan, rebelled, but they were suppressed. On his deathbed, he had urged Bogdan to continue to pay the tribute to the Sultan. He died on 2 July 1504 and was buried in the Monastery of Putna.|$|E

5|$|The art {{of glass}} making {{is thought to}} have {{developed}} during Ahmose's reign. The oldest samples of glass appear to have been defective pieces of faience, but intentional crafting of glass did not occur until the beginning of the 18th dynasty. One of the earliest glass beads found contains the names of both Ahmose and Amenhotep I, written in a style dated to about the time of their reigns. If glassmaking was developed no earlier than Ahmose's reign and the first objects are dated to no later than his successor's reign, it is quite likely that it <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> subjects who developed the craft.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} figure {{behind these}} accounts, Toghrul, {{was in fact}} a Nestorian Christian monarch defeated by Genghis. He had fostered the future Khan {{after the death of his}} father Yesugei and <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> early allies, but the two had a falling-out. After Toghrul rejected a proposal to wed his son and daughter to Genghis' children, the rift between them grew until war broke out in 1203. Genghis captured Sorghaghtani Beki, daughter of Toghrul's brother Jaqa Gambu, and married her to his son Tolui; they had several children, including Möngke, Kublai, Hulagu, and Ariq Böke.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1880s {{marked a}} turning point in Shaw's life, both {{personally}} and professionally: he lost his virginity, had two novels published, and began a career as a critic. He had been celibate until his twenty-ninth birthday, when his shyness was overcome by Jane (Jenny) Patterson, a widow some years his senior. Their affair continued, not always smoothly, for eight years. Shaw's sex life has caused much speculation and debate among his biographers, but there is a consensus that the relationship with Patterson <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> few non-platonic romantic liaisons.|$|E
