5|$|Reviewers {{complained of}} the game's high price, which was {{nearly double the}} average. Crash <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> cost might lead to more piracy. Critics also noted a bug in two-player mode, repeat screens from {{elsewhere}} in the maze, and the frustratingly narrow window in which sabre swings register as enemy hits. CVG recommended drawing {{a map of the}} maze, without which it was easy to get lost. While Sabre Wulf had some flicker issues, said Sinclair User, the game altogether met Ultimate's high quality benchmarks.|$|E
5|$|Enthusiasm {{for game}} {{distribution}} ebbed, and CD Projekt's founders <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> company should continue as a distributor or a game developer after Dark Alliances cancellation. With the game cancelled and its code owned by CD Projekt, the company {{planned to use}} them to develop their first original game. They intended to develop a game series based on Andrzej Sapkowski's Wiedźmin books (which were popular in Poland) and the author accepted the company's development proposal. The franchise rights had been sold to a Polish mobile game studio, but the studio had not worked on anything related to the franchise and CD Projekt acquired the rights to the Wiedźmin franchise. According to Iwiński, he and Kiciński {{had no idea how to}} develop a video game at that time.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} {{not as good as}} the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland {{to spend the rest of}} her life in a convent; she <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.|$|E

5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E

County Executive Isiah Leggett, who supported the bill, said the fees would have helped close the budget gap and help fund improvements to the county's emergency services. Opponents of the bill were skeptical that insurance companies would pay the fees and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> fees would reduce emergency service calls.|$|E

25|$|Abercrombie {{played a}} second time against France, at Parc des Princes on 1 January 1913. Ahead of the game, the French press <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> victory two years earlier at Colombes was to be repeated. The French scored the first try {{in the first five}} minutes, but the Scots scored twice in {{response}} and finished the first half leading 3–8. After another Scottish try {{at the start of the}} second half, Abercrombie twice attempted to kick a drop goal but was unsuccessful. Then, from a scrum, Abercrombie intercepted the ball from a French attack inside the Scottish half. Unable to run the length of the field, he passed the ball to Gordon, who passed it on to Steward, and he scored the fourth Scottish try. A final try sealed the victory for Scotland, 3–21.|$|E
25|$|A legend arose that James {{had been}} warned against invading England by supernatural powers. While he was praying in St Michael's Kirk at Linlithgow, a man strangely dressed in blue had {{approached}} his desk saying his mother {{had told him to}} say James should not to go to war or take the advice of women. Then before the King could reply, the man vanished. David Lindsay of the Mount and John Inglis could find no trace of him. The historian R. L. Mackie <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> incident really happened as a masquerade orchestrated by an anti-war party: Norman Macdougall doubts if there was a significant anti-war faction. Three other portents of disaster were described by Paolo Giovio in 1549 and repeated in John Polemon's 1578 account of the battle. When James was in council at the camp at Flodden Edge a hare ran out of his tent and escaped the weapons of his knights; it was found that mice had gnawed away the strings and buckle of the King's helmet; and in the morning his tent was spreckled with a bloody dew.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, Hirtzler again cooked a dish {{which had}} {{political}} consequences. The Crocker family were fervent Republicans, and they hosted a {{dinner at the}} hotel for Charles Evans Hughes, the Republican candidate for President of the United States, who was locked in a close race with incumbent Woodrow Wilson. Twenty minutes before the banquet began, the waiters, {{who were members of}} the culinary workers union, went on strike. Hughes <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> banquet should be canceled, but Hirtzler insisted upon it going ahead, and served the meal himself. When the Union learned that Hughes had crossed a picket line and eaten the dinner, they distributed thousands of leaflets denouncing him as anti-union. On election night, Hughes went to bed believing he had won the election. The next morning he awoke and learned that he had lost California by only 3,673 votes, and by losing California had lost the election to Wilson. The margin of his defeat was less than the turnout of union voters in San Francisco. By saving the dinner, Hirtzler had lost the election for Hughes.|$|E

25|$|The {{motion picture}} mounted a {{challenge}} to the stage. At first, films were silent and presented only limited competition. By the end of the 1920s, films like The Jazz Singer were presented with synchronized sound, and critics <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> cinema would replace live theatre altogether. While live vaudeville could not compete with these inexpensive films that featured vaudeville stars and major comedians of the day, other theatre survived. The musicals of the Roaring Twenties, borrowing from vaudeville, music hall and other light entertainments, tended to ignore plot in favor of emphasizing star actors and actresses, big dance routines, and popular songs. Florenz Ziegfeld produced annual spectacular song-and-dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets and elaborate costumes, but there was little to tie the various numbers together. Typical of the 1920s were lighthearted productions such as Sally; Lady Be Good; Sunny; No, No, Nanette; Harlem; Oh, Kay!; and Funny Face. Their books may have been forgettable, but they produced enduring standards from George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Vincent Youmans, and Rodgers and Hart, among others, and Noël Coward, Sigmund Romberg, and Rudolf Friml continued in the vein of Victor Herbert. Clearly, the live theatre survived the invention of cinema.|$|E
25|$|With {{only one}} game before the First Test Brown's men had {{to improve their}} form {{dramatically}} {{if they wanted to}} stand a chance against the powerful Australian team. Instead they conceded another first innings deficit to a weak Sheffield Shield team. the wicket-keeper-captain Don Tallon won the toss and batted and the MCC bowlers did quite well in the circumstances, Alec Bedser (3/40) and John Warr (3/70) having Queensland 23/2, but whatever good work they did was undone by slack fielding, poor catching and some new batsman making runs. Ken Archer (63), who would make his Test debut in the series added 120 with Aubrey Carrigan (100) and Ernest Toovey (58 not out) added 81 for the ninth wicket with Lawrence Chapman (38). The second day was rained off as they batted into the third day for 305. The local swing bowler Len Johnson took 6/66 in an innings of 291 that relied almost entirely on Cyril Washbrook (82) and John Dewes (117), both fighting their way back into form and jeered by the crowd as they ground out their unsightly innings. With Denis Compton making a dull 28 in 100 minutes and nobody else making 15 by the time they had finished only three overs could be bowled before stumps, but Warr picked up a wicket for no runs. The press were unsympathetic and with rumours that Hutton (damaged finger), Denis Compton (swollen knee) and Alec Bedser (influenza) were all ill or injured some <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Test was worth playing. There were also the usual stories of dissension in the ranks whenever a team performs badly, which Brown hotly denied, thus providing a new story. In truth Brown ran a happy ship and allowed the team more socialising than previous captains. He also saw no reason why he should force amateur undergraduates to mix awkwardly with working class professionals, or that veterans should accompany their younger team-mates.|$|E

Akahori noted that up to the creation of Kashimashi, the works that he created were far apart from the concept of true love, and much of his previous work involved a lot of ecchi content which Akahori was attempting to avoid in Kashimashi.
