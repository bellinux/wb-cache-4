40|$|Daytime F 2 -layer {{positive}} storm effects {{at middle}} and lower latitudes in the <b>winter</b> <b>thermosphere</b> are analyzed using AE-C, ESRO- 4 neutral gas composition data, ground-based ionosonde observations and model calculations. Different longitudinal sectors {{marked by the}} storm onset as 'night-time' and 'daytime' demonstrate different F 2 -layer positive storm mechanisms. Neutral composition changes in the 'night-time' sector with increased [O] and [N 2 ] absolute concentrations, while (N 2 /O) storm/(N 2 /O) quietapprox 1 at F 2 -layer heights, are shown to contribute largely to the background NmF 2 increase at lower latitudes lasting during daytime hours. Storm-induced surges of the equatorward wind give rise to an additional NmF 2 increase above this background level. The mid-latitude F 2 -layer positive storm effect in the 'daytime' sector {{is due to the}} vertical plasma drift increase, resulting from the interaction of background (poleward) and storm-induced (equatorward) thermospheric winds, but not to changes of [O] and [N 2 ] concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The global {{distribution}} of thermospheric nitric oxide has been measured under different geophysical conditions by the Atmosphere Explorer (AE) and Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME) satellites. These observations show a great {{variability in the}} NO concentration but {{the existence of a}} latitudinal gradient is clearly evidenced by statistical maps of the NO meridional distribution. A two dimensional zonally averaged chemical-dynamical model was used to investigate the importance of nitric oxide 5. 3 micrometer cooling and its role on thermospheric temperature, dynamics and major gas composition. For this purpose, a 2 -D background atmosphere code and an odd nitrogen code were coupled and run to steady state. The NO distribution obtained is in good agreement with the AE-D global picture calculated at solstice for solar minimum activity. The importance of each term in the thermodynamic equation was studied spatially. It is found that the NO I. R. cooling term competes with conduction in the upper thermosphere and reaches its maximum value near 200 km at high summer latitudes. The primary effect of including the NO cooling term is to increase the temperature in the upper <b>winter</b> <b>thermosphere</b> and decrease it in the other hemisphere, if the global average temperature is fixed. In general, the strength of the circulation is decreased and the thermal gradient is smoother. As a consequence of these changes in the wind and temperature fields, the O 2, N 2 and O densities also react to the effect of the NO cooling. The importance of this process depends on the level of solar activity which controls the NO distribution...|$|E
40|$|Mass {{spectrometer}} {{satellite observations}} {{show that a}} narrow region with steep latitudinal gradients of neutral composition is formed in the subauroral <b>winter</b> <b>thermosphere</b> during magnetic storms. In order to analyze {{the relative importance of}} individual terms in the continuity equation for atomic oxygen, a two-dimensional model was used to simulate the thermospheric disturbance formation in response to intense Joule heating imposed in the auroral oval. Such an approach allowed three characteristic zones to be distinguished in the high-latitude thermosphere at heights of about 250 km. It was shown that vertical transport is of greatest importance within the local heating region. Horizontal transport dominates at subauroral latitudes near the mid-night edge of the auroral oval. Propagation of the disturbances to middle latitudes is prohibited near the noon edge of the oval by a strong counteraction of a poleward meridional wind. Here is a "relaxation zone" defined as the region which is spread to the equator from the boundary between the local heating area and the subauroral zone in the noon sector LT. It is at this boundary that composition distributions with steep latitudinal gradient are formed within the first few hours of Joule heating source action. Perturbations transported to middle latitudes during the periods when the meridional wind is directed equatorward begin to relax in this zone with a characteristic time scale of about 7 h, independent of season. However, in winter, composition at subauroral latitudes recovers to unperturbed N 2 /O values before the wind again turns equatorward, giving rise to a distribution with steep latitudinal gradient recovering. In summer, a complete relaxation cannot be reached due to a shorter time interval with poleward wind and a larger disturbance amplitude. These two factors result in an effective smoothing of the initial steep gradient and a more regular latitudinal distribution of composition is observed in the summer thermosphere...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{coupling}} of neutral atmospheric motions with solar wind induced effects, the neutral wind and ion flow velocities were simultaneously measured {{at an altitude of}} 225 km in the polar cap F-region by releasing barium and strontium tracers from sounding rockets launched on 22 and 24 August 1971, and 10 December 1972. Ion and neutral cloud trajectories for 22 and 24 August experiments were plotted, and in both cases an anti-solar flow was deduced from the ion tracks. During the December experiment a southern and northern cloud were observed, and the magnitude of the pressure force deduced from the southern cloud motion was found in agreement with OGO- 6 measurements. This confirmed that a local temperature maximum is located in the <b>winter</b> polar <b>thermosphere...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} high {{latitude}} auroral processes {{has been developed}} {{for use in the}} NCAR TGCM. The ion drift pattern associated with magnetospheric convection is specified by the empirical model of Heelis et al. (1982) considering offset geographic and geomagnetic poles. An analytic prescription of particle precipitation in the auroral oval is developed that enables rapid numerical evaluation of auroral ionization rates and global aurora power input. An analytic expression has been derived for the total ionization rate and an ion chemical scheme is used to calculate the electron density enhancements and ion density distributions caused by auroral particle precipitation. The results of TGCM runs with and without auroral particle precipitation show the importance of auroral ionization in determining the dynamic structure of the <b>winter</b> hemisphere lower <b>thermosphere...</b>|$|R
