5|$|At the {{sentencing}} hearing for a Chicago attorney, a federal agent {{testified that the}} attorney said that his job with Burke's Finance Committee only required four hours of work a week, although he was paid a full-time salary. On January 8, 1998, federal prosecutors in Operation Haunted Hall indicted another Chicago attorney for collecting $9,223 in <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> from the Finance Committee in 1991 and 1992 despite doing little or no work.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 2015, the Culinary Craft Association (CCA), a union at the school, {{protested the}} CIA's {{outsourcing}} of jobs. Previously in 2015, {{the school had}} terminated 40 jobs in its dishwashing, stewarding, and cleaning departments, forcing them to reapply for jobs with cut <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits.</b> Later that year, CCA joined the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 200United, members of which also protested in September 2015. The school was also demanding CCA cut ties with SEIU {{in order for the}} union workers to keep their jobs. On September 22, 2017, CCA held another protest; 17 of the 45 workers represented in the union are scheduled to be laid off and replaced by workers of LCS Facility Group. The workers are in grounds-keeping, recycling and painting at the school, where most of them have been employed for at least 20 years.|$|E
25|$|The Harris {{government}} also passed The Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act in 1996, publishing so-called Sunshine lists annually to disclose <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> of public employees earning over $100 000 per year, {{in order to}} increase accountability.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{collective}} bargaining agreements contain [...] "catch-up" [...] provisions which allow newer hires to advance more rapidly on the wage scale than existing workers {{so that they}} reach <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> parity after a specified number of years, or they provide <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> increases to new hires to bring them up to party with existing workers if the company meets specified financial goals.|$|R
25|$|In 2003, 80,000 {{members of}} the UFCW across the country went on strike to protect their <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> packages.|$|R
25|$|FLOC {{continued}} {{to address issues}} related to its collective bargaining agreement in the late 1980s. Midwestern tomato farmers began complaining that the Campbell's Soup pact was not adequate. Campbell's purchased {{only a portion of}} their product, but the higher costs of <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> affected their entire crop. Thus, Midwestern growers argued that they could no longer compete with cheap Mexican-grown products. Velasquez contacted Mexican farm worker unions, then in the midst of their own collective bargaining negotiations. Velasquez pressured the Mexican unions to demand significantly higher wages. The strategy was successful: The higher Mexican <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> closed the price differential, and Midwestern growers no longer threatened to break their pact with FLOC.|$|E
25|$|Concerned {{that the}} union {{did not have the}} {{economic}} strength to win good <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> for its members and worried that further membership declines might threaten the viability of the union, the ITU leadership sought a merger with another printing union.|$|E
25|$|Late {{in the day}} on June 30, 2006, the {{two sides}} reached a {{tentative}} agreement for a 16% increase in <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> over a five-year contract.

25|$|Three {{months after}} taking office, Sweeney led the 45,000 members of SEIU {{out on a}} {{surprise}} strike against the New York Realty Advisory Board a day before the union's contract was due to expire.

25|$|The United States takes a more laissez-faire approach, setting some minimum {{standards}} but leaving most workers' <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> to collective bargaining and market forces. Thus, it comes {{closest to the}} above Anglo-Saxon model. Also, the Eastern European countries that have recently entered into the EU come closest to the Anglo-Saxon model.|$|E
25|$|Velásquez soon signed {{agreements}} with Aunt Jane Foods, Dean Foods, Green Bay Foods, H. J. Heinz Company, and Vlasic Pickles.

25|$|Meanwhile, Truman {{had changed}} his views on the recommendations. The White House staff had {{analyzed}} the WSB's report {{and concluded that the}} <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> package did not violate stabilization guidelines.

25|$|Meanwhile, in {{adopting}} the Godesberg Program in 1959, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) largely abandoned Marxism ideas and embraced {{the concept of}} the market economy and the welfare state. Instead it now sought to move beyond its old working class base to appeal the full spectrum of potential voters, including the middle class and professionals. Labor unions cooperated increasingly with industry, achieving labor representation on corporate boards and increases in <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|E
25|$|Feldman {{was known}} for being a quiet but very {{effective}} leader of the UFT. She fought school system chancellors and mayors both, winning significantly higher <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> as well as improved working conditions for her members. She lobbied so fiercely for Bernard Gifford as New York City schools chancellor that Robert F. Wagner, Jr., President of the New York City Board of Education, threatened to resign unless Feldman backed off and {{he was given a}} free hand.|$|E
25|$|With {{a booming}} economy short of unskilled workers, {{especially}} after the Berlin Wall cut off the steady flow of East Germans, the FRG negotiated migration agreements with Italy (1955), Spain (1960), Greece (1960), and Turkey (1961) that brought in {{hundreds of thousands of}} temporary guest workers, called Gastarbeiter. In 1968 the FRG signed a guest worker agreement with Yugoslavia that employed additional guest workers. Gastarbeiter were young men who were paid full-scale <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits,</b> but were expected to return home in a few years.|$|E

50|$|As in the Marxian {{theory of}} unemployment, special {{interests}} may also benefit: some employers may expect that employees with {{no fear of}} losing their jobs will not work as hard, or will demand increased <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit.</b> According to this theory, unemployment may promote general labour productivity and profitability by increasing employers' rationale for their monopsony-like power (and profits).|$|R

25|$|The 1960s {{began with}} a five-month strike by workers over either <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> (according to local newspapers), or {{unilateral}} work rules (according to the Industrial Union of Marine and Ship-building Workers). In {{the midst of the}} strike, the Navy towed , which was under conversion at the time, to the nearby Boston Navy Yard for completion, an action which prompted both laborers and management to negotiate a three-year contract and helped to nullify unpopular work rules. Later that year, the Long Beach was launched, which was a major achievement for the yard.|$|E
25|$|McDonald reluctantly {{ordered his}} members back to work, but {{productivity}} slowed due to extremely poor relationships between workers and managers. The Taft-Hartley Act required management {{to make a}} last offer and for union members to vote on this proposal. Management proposed minimal improvements in <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> {{and the elimination of}} Section 2(b). McDonald turned management of the union over to Goldberg, to concentrate the legal and bargaining work in one set of hands. Goldberg convinced the leadership of the union to reject the proposal, and members followed suit.|$|E
25|$|The Social Democratic Party pursues {{environmentalist}} {{and feminist}} policies which promote healthful and humane conditions. Feminist policies formed and {{implemented by the}} Social Democratic Party and the Left Party and the Greens (which made an arrangement with the Social Democrats to support the government, while not forming a coalition), include paid maternity and paternity leave, high employment {{for women in the}} public sector, combining flexible work with living <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits,</b> providing public support for women in their traditional responsibilities for care giving, and policies to stimulate women's political participation and leadership.

40|$|Over {{the past}} thirty years the Detroit Three auto {{companies}} have waged a concerted campaign to retract <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> concessions workers extracted in the postwar period. In a period marked by the globalisation of production, the companies have been driven to increase competitiveness as their market dominance has been whittled away by competition from imports and the entry and expansion of foreign companies or “transplants” with lower cost structures. This paper traces historic reversals for workers including: a two-tier <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> system that has halved the wage rate of new employees, a wage freeze for other workers, and increased flexibility including reductions in work breaks and overtime pay. The paper analyses the role of the employers, the Obama Administration and the United Auto Workers in transforming the U. S. auto industry into a low cost producer capable of attracting work from low wage countries...|$|R
25|$|Spain {{entered the}} crisis period with a {{relatively}} modest public debt of 36.2% of GDP. This was largely due to ballooning tax revenue from the housing bubble, which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation. In response to the crisis, Spain initiated an austerity program consisting primarily of tax increases. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced on 11 July 2012 €65 billion of austerity, including cuts in <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> and a VAT increase from 18% to 21%. The government eventually succeeded to reduce its budget deficit from 11.2% of GDP in 2009 to 8.5% in 2011 and {{it is expected to}} fall further to 5.4% in 2012.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, Hensley {{founded the}} beer distributorship {{that would have}} his name, {{borrowing}} $10,000 against everything he had to buy a small existing distributorship.

[...] At the start it had 15 workers, sold 73,000 cases of beer a year, and had a 6 percent market share. [...] Hensley soon switched to exclusively distributing Anheuser-Busch beer. [...] Under the early names Hensley & Company Distributors and Hensley & Company Wholesale, the company saw decades of steady growth. It was aided by the Phoenix area {{becoming one of the}} fastest-growing regions of the country while the company maintained its position as Anheuser-Busch's only distributor there. [...] Jim Hensley's tireless sales efforts and the generous <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> he gave employees were also key success factors. [...] By 1980 the business had become quite successful and Jim Hensley was a multi-millionaire.
