25|$|Cash for gold– With {{the rise}} in the value of gold due to the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–2010, there has been a surge in companies that <b>will</b> <b>buy</b> personal gold in exchange for cash, or sell investments in gold bullion and coins. Several of these have prolific marketing plans and high value spokesmen, such as prior vice presidents. Many of these companies are under investigation for a variety of securities fraud claims, as well as laundering money for terrorist organizations. Also, given that ownership is often not verified, many companies are considered to be receiving stolen property, and multiple laws are under consideration as methods to curtail this.|$|E

When an auction's time expires, the highest bidder wins the item and must pay a final bid price.

500|$|Roger Ebert praised 2012, {{giving it}} [...] stars out of 4 {{and saying that}} it [...] "delivers what it promises, and since no sentient being <b>will</b> <b>buy</b> a ticket expecting {{anything}} else, it will be, for its audiences, {{one of the most}} satisfactory films of the year". Ebert and Claudia Puig of USA Today called the film the [...] "mother of all disaster movies". But Peter Travers of Rolling Stone compared it to : [...] "Beware 2012, which works the dubious miracle of almost matching Transformers 2 for sheer, cynical, mind-numbing, time-wasting, money-draining, soul-sucking stupidity." ...|$|E

In the last role-playing scene, Sophie's father offers her a secret bubble bath; afterwards, he tells her not to tell anyone because he would go to jail and it would be her fault.|$|E
