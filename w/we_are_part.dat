5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>part</b> of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E
25|$|According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Spinoza's God is an “infinite intellect” (Ethics 2p11c) — all knowing (2p3), {{and capable}} of loving both himself—and us, insofar as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>part</b> of his {{perfection}} (5p35c). And if {{the mark of a}} personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends amor intellectualis dei (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1 appendix), and Spinoza insists that “neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God” (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God is really not the kind of being who could ever love us back. “He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return,” says Spinoza (5p19).|$|E

Spoken For is filled with songs that I pray the church will use." [...] He added that this album leaned more toward rock than Almost There. Millard said [...] of the origin of the album title: [...] "Over the last year I’ve been consumed with the idea that God is so crazy in love with us—just knowing that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>part</b> of something bigger and we worship a God who’s in complete control no matter how good or bad things get. The phrase [...] "spoken for" [...] really stuck with me." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{governments of}} the United Kingdom and of Wales almost {{invariably}} define Wales as a country.: [...] "I agree that, in relation to Wales, Principality is a misnomer and that Wales should properly {{be referred to as}} a country.}} The Welsh Government says: [...] "Wales is not a Principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>part</b> of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right." [...] The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince Charles. However the Prince of Wales has no constitutional role in modern Wales. According to the Welsh Government: [...] "Our Prince of Wales at the moment is Prince Charles, who is the present heir to the throne. But he does not have a role in the governance of Wales, even though his title might suggest that he does." ...|$|E
500|$|August Strindberg was {{familiar}} with Either/Or and this book made him [...] "forever a champion of the ethical as juxtaposed to the aesthetic life conception and he always remained faithful {{to the idea that}} art and knowledge must be [...] to life, and that life itself must be lived as we know best, chiefly because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>part</b> of it and cannot escape from its promptings." [...] Strindberg was obviously attracted to Either/Or Part II where Kierkegaard developed his categorical imperative. He wrote the following in Growth of a Soul published posthumously in 1913 about Kierkegaard’s Either—Or: [...] "it was valid only for the priests who called themselves Christians and the seducer and Don Juan were the author himself, who satisfied his desires in imagination". Part II was his [...] "Discourse on Life as a Duty, and when he {{reached the end of the}} work he found the moral philosopher in despair, and that all this teaching about duty had only produced a Philistine." [...] He then states that Kierkegaard's discourses might have led him closer to Christianity but he didn't know if he could come back to something [...] "which had been torn out, and joyfully thrown into the fire". However, after reading the book he [...] "felt sinful". Then another writer began to influence his life. This is how he described Either/Or: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1997 BP {{became the}} first {{multinational}} outside the reinsurance industry to publicly support the scientific consensus on climate change, which Eileen Caussen, President of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change described as a transformative moment on the issue. Prior to 1997, BP {{was a member of}} the Global Climate Coalition an industry organisation established to promote global warming scepticism but withdrew in 1997, saying [...] "the time to consider the policy dimensions of climate change is not when the link between greenhouse gases and climate change is conclusively proven, but when the possibility cannot be discounted and is taken seriously by the society of which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>part.</b> We in BP have reached that point.".

2500|$|Bruce Gyngell, {{the former}} {{chairman}} of breakfast station TV-am, [...] became YTT's managing director on 15 May 1995. On 16 March 1996, the presentation department in Newcastle was closed, and continuity was centralised in Leeds. (Transmission for the station had already been handled by Yorkshire since 1993). To halting [...] "a slide in viewing figures and reflecting confidence in the region", in September that year, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc rebranded its stations as Channel 3. The Broadcasting Act 1990 had made Channel 3 the 'official' name for ITV, and [...] "3" [...] was the preset used by most television sets and videocassette recorders (VCRs) for ITV. However, the attempt in 1989 to create a generic identity across the ITV network [...] was decommissioned within three years. Promoting the new brand, Gygnell said, [...] "Everyone refers to this region as 'the North-East' and {{we want it to be}} known that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>part</b> of this great region and moving with it." [...] Tyne Tees acquired the brand [...] "Channel 3 North East", with 'Tyne Tees Television' still being retained as the company name.|$|E
2500|$|Spinoza {{argued that}} God exists and is {{abstract}} and impersonal. Spinoza's view of God is what Charles Hartshorne describes as Classical Pantheism. Spinoza {{has also been}} described as an [...] "Epicurean materialist," [...] specifically in reference to his opposition to Cartesian mind-body dualism. This view was held by Epicureans before him, as they believed that atoms with their probabilistic paths were the only substance that existed fundamentally. Spinoza, however, deviated significantly from Epicureans by adhering to strict determinism, much like the Stoics before him, {{in contrast to the}} Epicurean belief in the probabilistic path of atoms, which is more in line with contemporary thought on quantum mechanics. Spinoza's system imparted order and unity to the tradition of radical thought, offering powerful weapons for prevailing against [...] "received authority." [...] He contended that everything that exists in Nature (i.e., everything in the Universe) is one Reality (substance) and there is only one set of rules governing the whole of the reality which surrounds us and of which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>part.</b> Spinoza viewed God and Nature as two names for the same reality, namely a single, fundamental substance (meaning [...] "that which stands beneath" [...] rather than [...] "matter") that is the basis of the universe and of which all lesser [...] "entities" [...] are actually modes or modifications, that all things are determined by Nature to exist and cause effects, and that the complex chain of cause and effect is understood only in part. His identification of God with nature was more fully explained in his posthumously published Ethics. Spinoza's main contention with Cartesian mind–body dualism was that, if mind and body were truly distinct, then {{it is not clear how}} they can coordinate in any manner. Humans presume themselves to have free will, he argues, which is a result of their awareness of appetites that affect their minds, while being unable to understand the reasons why they want and act as they do.|$|E
