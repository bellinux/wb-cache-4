She always knows the right <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to make someone feel comfortable, albeit {{sometimes}} {{at the expense}} of the truth. Her art is the core of her being, which, at times, conflicts with her second important characteristic. She loves John Christow more than life itself yet abets his killer because she thinks he would have wanted her to do so, under the circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Palmerston {{was a great}} orator. His {{language}} was relatively unstudied and his delivery somewhat embarrassed, but he generally found <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the right thing {{at the right time}} and to address the House of Commons in the language best adapted to the capacity and the temper of his audience. An attempt was made by the Duke of Wellington in September 1830 to induce Palmerston to re-enter the cabinet, but he refused to do so without Lord Lansdowne and Lord Grey, two notable Whigs. This can be said to be the point in 1830, when his party allegiance changed.|$|E
500|$|Many Conservapedia {{articles}} criticise {{values that}} its editors associate with [...] "liberal ideology". The article [...] "Liberal" [...] once began with text originating from Schlafly personally: [...] "A liberal (also leftist) {{is someone who}} rejects logical and biblical standards, often for self-centered reasons. There are no coherent liberal standards; often a liberal is merely someone who craves attention, and who uses many <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> nothing." [...] Leonard Pitts quoted it in a critical comment saying [...] "You may judge Conservapedia's own bias by reading its definition of liberal".|$|E

He was supportive even during the military defeats {{of the first year}} of the war. Late in 1861, he proposed to Lincoln through an intermediary that the president provide him with advance information as to its policies, in exchange for friendly coverage in the Tribune. [...] Lincoln eagerly accepted, [...] "having him firmly behind me will be as helpful to me as an army of one hundred thousand men." ...|$|E
500|$|He then played Tarrasch in the World Chess Championship 1908, {{first at}} Düsseldorf then at Munich. Tarrasch firmly {{believed}} {{the game of}} chess was governed by a precise set of principles. For him {{the strength of a}} chess move was in its logic, not in its efficiency. Because of his stubborn principles he considered Lasker as a [...] who won his games only thanks to dubious tricks, while Lasker mocked the arrogance of Tarrasch who, in his opinion, shone more in salons than at the chessboard. At the opening ceremony, Tarrasch refused to talk to Lasker, only saying: [...] "Mr. Lasker, I have only three <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to you: check and mate!" ...|$|E
500|$|... {{was about}} how when my grandma was {{standing}} over my grandfather {{while he was}} dying. There was this moment where I felt like he had sort of {{looked at her and}} reckoned that he had won in life. Like, 'I'm a champion. We won. Our love made us a winner.' They were married 60 years. I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> more business, more mountains to climb. You're on the cliff, you tip your hat to yourself and you go. That’s what it was for me in that moment when I witnessed it." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for musicOMH, Tom Woods {{felt the}} album would [...] "attract swarms of {{internet}} love, but this unstable foundation, built upon the fleeting dreams of thirteen year-olds" [...] would restrict the band's lifetime. Woods compared the band to Panic! at the Disco [...] "without the bounce or the creativity" [...] saying the album [...] "takes the bastardisation of honest musical forms to new heights." [...] Dan MacIntosh of PopMatters felt the songs as [...] "sound like high school gossip." [...] He {{went on to}} note the album has: [...] "Over-the-top drama" [...] combined with [...] "stripped-down, pop-rock hooks," [...] which {{for the most part}} [...] "prevent overbearing emotional mood swings." [...] He concluded by mentioning the band has [...] "much to say, but lacks the right <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it all." [...] The Skinny reviewer Billy Hamilton noted the album was [...] "Brimming with slickly produced pre-pubescent punk-pop" [...] that made [...] "Blink 182 seem like nihilists." [...] He considered the sound as being [...] "faux-guitar music for a generation yet to move on from the tweeny-rock of Busted." [...] In an artist spotlight for Spin, writer Alyssa Rashbaum described the album as [...] "energetic, youthful power-pop about high school cliques, drama-loving girls, and fake IDs." ...|$|E

5000|$|There {{was some}} {{criticism}} {{with regards to}} Pavarotti, a classically-trained opera singer, performing pop songs with pop stars at his charity concerts. Pavarotti responded to the critics saying: [...] "Some say the word pop is a derogatory <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'not important' - I do not accept that. If the word classic is the <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'boring,' I do not accept. There is good and bad music." ...|$|R
2500|$|However, even Bill Drummond - the A man who {{had signed}} them - had harsh <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the project: [...] "I signed a band called Brilliant, who I worked with, we worked together, and it was {{complete}} failure. Artistically bankrupt project. And financially deaf. We spent £300,000 on making an album that was useless. Useless artistically, useless... commercially." ...|$|E
2500|$|The polypersonalism of Georgian verb allows {{to express}} the {{involvement}} of action participants in very compact way.

2500|$|He {{accuses the}} governmental, medical and press establishments of foot-dragging in combating the disease—especially {{in the early}} days of its outbreak, when much of the play is set—and he is even tougher on {{homosexual}} leaders who, in his view, were either too cowardly or too mesmerized by the ideology of sexual liberation to get the story out. [...] "There's not a good word to be said about anyone's behavior in this whole mess", claims one character—and certainly Mr. Kramer has few good <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about Mayor Koch, various prominent medical organizations, The New York Times or, for that matter, most of the leadership of an unnamed organization apparently patterned after the Gay Men's Health Crisis.|$|E

2500|$|Health Realization ("HR"), like Sydney Banks's philosophy, is {{deliberately}} not taught {{as a set}} of [...] "techniques" [...] but as an experiential [...] "understanding" [...] that goes beyond a simple transfer of information. There are no steps, no uniformly appropriate internal attitudes, and no techniques within it. The [...] "health of the helper" [...] is considered crucial; that is, trainers or counselors ideally will [...] "live in the understanding that allows them to enjoy life," [...] and thereby continuously model their understanding of HR by staying calm and relaxed, not taking things personally, assuming the potential in others, displaying common sense, and listening respectfully to all. Facilitators ideally teach in the moment, from [...] "what they know" [...] (e.g. their own experience), trusting that they will find the right <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and the right approach to use in the immediate situation to stimulate the students' understanding of the [...] "Three Principles". Rapport with students and a positive mood in the session or class are more important than the specific content of the facilitator's presentation.|$|E
2500|$|Derek Elley of Variety {{wrote that}} though {{the film was}} [...] "star-heavy", it felt like [...] "the movie {{equivalent}} of an Off Broadway play," [...] and [...] "uses a lot of <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> nothing new." [...] The New York Times also mentioned the amount of dialogue in the film, writing: [...] "It’s a long conversation, more soporific than Socratic, and brimming with parental chiding, generational conflict and invocations of Vietnam," [...] and the Los Angeles Times described the lecturing in the film as [...] "dull and self-satisfied." [...] The subtitle of the review in the Los Angeles Times was: [...] "As a matter of policy, 'Lions for Lambs' doesn't play." [...] In a review entitled [...] "Political drama feels more like a lecture" [...] in The Boston Globe, Wesley Morris wrote: [...] "It does not feel good to report that a movie with Robert Redford, Meryl Streep, and Tom Cruise makes the eyelids droop. But that's what 'Lions for Lambs' does." [...] Writing in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, reviewer William Arnold wrote positively of the segments of the film involving Robert Redford's character: [...] "His character, who hopes to save America one slacker at a time, rings true; and his real-life conviction and his fears for democracy come through." [...] Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle highlighted Redford's direction of the film, commenting {{that it was not}} his best film, but it was [...] "his bravest." [...] Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described Lions for Lambs as [...] "...a well-made movie that offers no answers but raises many important questions." ...|$|E
