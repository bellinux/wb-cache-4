You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} historian Thomas Boghardt {{suggests that}} the Storz family did not approve of the match, and may have pressured the couple to separate. Lody said later that his former father-in-law gave him $10,000, possibly as compensation. The failed marriage had a lasting effect on Lody. He wrote in 1914: [...] "My feelings run riot <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> permit myself to review the dramatic {{events of the last}} three years and what is to be the probable climax of it all." ...|$|E
500|$|Lucan left Brandt's {{in about}} 1960, {{shortly after he}} had won £26,000 playing chemin de fer. A {{colleague}} had been promoted before him, and he protested and then gave up his job, saying [...] "why should I work in a bank, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> earn a year's money in one single night at the tables?" [...] He travelled to the United States, where he played golf, raced powerboats, and drove his Aston Martin around the West Coast. He also visited his elder sister Jane, and his former guardian, Marcia Tucker. On his return to England he moved out of his parents' home in StJohn's Wood and into a flat in Park Crescent.|$|E

500|$|Youth {{development}} and scouring for talent abroad {{is central to}} Wenger's recruitment policy. He relies on a network of scouts and personal contacts to find and attract talented footballers to play under him. Wenger's strategy is aided by data; for instance, the decision to sign Flamini in 2004 came about as {{he was looking at}} statistics to find an understudy to Vieira. To examine the mental state of a young footballer, he uses psychometric tests conducted by psychologist Jacques Crevoisier once every two years. Wenger prides himself on nurturing talent, saying in an interview: [...] "I believe {{one of the best things}} about managing people is that we can influence lives in a positive way. That's basically what a manager is about. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do that, I am very happy".|$|E
500|$|Pilou Asbæk, who {{was cast}} to play Euron Greyjoy, spoke in an {{interview}} about the filming of the Kingsmoot saying [...] "We spent two days on the Kingsmoot itself, and then two days on the montage. We shot it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. We shot the drowning many, many times. I remember looking down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> because then I can feel it with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1917 Grainger {{received}} {{news of his}} father's {{death in}} Perth. [...] On 9 June 1917, after America's entry into the war, he enlisted as a bandsman in the U.S. Army with the 15th Coastal Artillery Corps Band in New York City. He had joined as a saxophonist, though he records learning the oboe: [...] "I long for the time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> blow my oboe well enough {{to play in the}} band". [...] In his 18 months' service, Grainger [...] made frequent appearances as a pianist at Red Cross and Liberty bond concerts. As a regular encore [...] he began to play a piano setting of the tune [...] "Country Gardens". The piece became instantly popular; [...] sheet music sales quickly broke many publishing records. The work was to become synonymous with Grainger's name through the rest of his life, though he came in time to detest it. [...] On 3 June 1918 he became a naturalised American citizen.|$|E

500|$|Barker's drum {{track was}} labeled by Drummerworld as [...] "one {{of the most}} {{creative}} beats of his career," [...] and mainly consists of the same basic beat repeated in sections throughout the verses. The first measure begins with the kick drum and splash cymbal playing on the downbeat, followed by a hit on the bell of the ride cymbal on beat two, preceding an open hi-hat that rings out for a full count on beat three. [...] "The kick, snare, and floor tom are all hit simultaneously on beat four, followed by floor tom hits on the last two sixteenth-note triplets of beat four." [...] The snare is hit on beats two and four, respectively. The song [...] "gradually builds to a powerful, piano-laden crescendo," [...] and the song's final chorus and conclusion take a more uplifting view of the world: [...] "Tomorrow holds such better days / Days <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still feel alive/ When I can't wait to get outside." [...] DeLonge noted that over six guitar parts were recorded for the [...] "gigantic, sad" [...] choruses, but upon mixing, only four were used. [...] "The extra ones didn't really do anything besides {{make it a little}} more unclear what was going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Rollason began feeling unwell in 1996 {{during an}} eight-week {{assignment}} to the US, {{where she was}} covering that year's Olympic and Paralympic Games. She {{was diagnosed with cancer}} of the colon in August 1997, which she was told had also spread to her liver. She was initially given three months to live, but confounded medical opinion by fighting the disease long after that. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy, but also used a combination of holistic therapies and diet to treat her condition. The cancer later metastasised to her lungs. Rollason continued to work throughout her illness, despite sessions of chemotherapy that left her feeling weak, and cited her work as the thing that had kept her going throughout her treatment. [...] "I stay working because I love it, and because I feel best on the days when I'm busy. I'd far rather work than hang around the house – even though there are days <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly get out of bed." [...] She presented sports bulletins for BBC News, wrote a weekly column about her illness for the Sunday Mirror Magazine and worked on a book about her experience that she hoped would help others diagnosed with the disease. She cited the determination of the many disabled athletes she had got to know through her work as having given her the strength of mind to fight her illness. In October 1998, the BBC aired a special edition of its QED documentary series titled Hope for Helen, which followed her as she underwent a course of treatment. The film earned her much support from the public for her courage. in December 1998, colleagues paid tribute to an emotional-looking Rollason during the BBC's Sports Review of the Year, a compliment that produced mixed feelings for the presenter. She later wrote of the incident, [...] "I felt a mixture of horror, embarrassment and incredible warmth towards my colleagues that they should think of doing this".|$|E
2500|$|A Democrat, Lee ran for {{governor}} in 1995 but dropped out before the primary. He famously said, [...] "why would I want to be governor <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be king?" [...] Lee endorsed Mike Foster, a Republican who came from behind in the polls to win the governorship and to serve two terms. He also endorsed Bobby Jindal for Governor in 2003, his bid for Congress in 2004, 2006 reelection and again {{for governor}} in 2007.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, {{there was}} a famine, so the {{residents}} in Luo Tong's hometown and other travellers taking shelter there suffered from hunger. Luo Tong was very worried about this and his appetite decreased. His elder sister, who was widowed and had no children, was known for being very kind. She saw that her brother looked very upset, so she asked him why. Luo Tong said, [...] "I feel bad <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> fill my own stomach while those people don't have enough to eat." [...] His sister replied, [...] "You're right. Why do you suffer in silence and not tell me about this?" [...] She then took grain from her personal stores {{and gave it to}} Luo Tong, and also informed their mother about it. Luo Tong's mother agreed with what they were doing, and she distributed grain to the people. Luo Tong became famous after this incident.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, O'Neal {{said that}} Bryant {{should have won}} the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, which was awarded to Dirk Nowitzki. During the offseason, Bryant was [...] "beyond furious" [...] at reports from a Laker insider that Bryant had insisted O'Neal be traded from the Lakers. [...] Bryant {{reported}} that Buss said, [...] "I {{am not going to}} re-sign Shaq. I am not about to pay him $30 million a year or $80 million over three years ... His body is breaking down, and I don't want to pay that money to him <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get value for him right now rather than wait ... It doesn't matter to me what you do in free agency because I do not want to pay , period." [...] O'Neal agreed with Bryant: [...] "There's {{no doubt in my mind}} Kobe is telling the truth. I believe him a thousand percent ... I would have respected Dr. Buss more as a man if he would have told me that himself, because I know he said it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Qasimov's daughter, Ferghana Qasimova, {{had been}} informally practising {{with her father}} {{since the age of}} sixteen and was an avid student of mugham. By the age of twenty she had become a {{fully-fledged}} singer in her own right and Qasimov chose to introduce his daughter into his ensemble. Ferghana first appeared on 1997's The Legendary Art of Mugham on which the two shared the vocal tasks on the song Getme Getme. Their next album included a track, Bagishlamani, dedicated to his forebear; Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. The release marked a high point for Qasimov as it was his first widely available release to western audiences and it proved a critical success. His aim to reconnect younger generations with mugham began to pay dividends; not only was he appealing to traditional Islamic sections of the Azerbaijani population, but also to more Americanised and modern audiences. The break through amongst the younger generations spurred him on: [...] "Sometimes young people come up after a concert to thank me. That's like giving me wings. I feel so elated <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> awaken such feelings in people while they are still young; mugham is not an easy genre for young people to understand".|$|E
