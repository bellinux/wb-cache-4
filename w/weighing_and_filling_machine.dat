Ninety grammes of sawdust of each species and particle size was <b>weighed</b> <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> into the mould. The average moisture content of the sawdust was 11.46 %. A manual hydraulic press with a gauge and a piston was used to compress the raw material without a binder against {{the other end of}} the mould to form the briquettes. A clearance of about 0.1 mm was provided between the piston and the inner wall of the mould to allow for air escape. The samples were pressed using the following predetermined compacting pressure levels: 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 MPa. The dwelling time for each press was maintained at 10 s for all the pressing made.

However, {{there was one}} area of rather complex thickened epithelium with mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism and frequent mitoses. There were also buddings of the same atypical epithelium towards the adjacent stroma.

50|$|The Royal Engineers' Air Battalion had pioneered {{experiments}} with wireless telegraphy in airships and aircraft before the RFC was created. Unfortunately the early transmitters <b>weighed</b> 75 pounds <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> {{a seat in}} the cockpit. This meant that the pilot had to fly the aircraft, navigate, observe the fall of the shells and transmit the results by morse code by himself. Also, the wireless in the aircraft could not receive. Originally only a special Wireless Flight attached to No. 4 Squadron RFC had the wireless equipment. Eventually this flight was expanded into No. 9 Squadron under Major Hugh Dowding. However, in early 1915 the Sterling lightweight wireless became available and was widely used. In 1915 each corps in the BEF was assigned a RFC squadron solely for artillery observation and reconnaissance duties. The transmitter filled the cockpit normally used by the observer and a trailing wire antenna was used which had to be reeled in prior to landing.|$|R

The basic method of the research is decrypting method and implementation by case study method. This research is done in PT Air Mancur. This location research is selected on purpose because PT Air Mancur is a factory that processing plant medicine becomes an herb product more than 40 years, this company doesn’t pay attention for feasibility analysis if economic age of machines finished, and data that needed for this research is available. Based on infestations criteria Pay Back Period (PBP), Net Present Value (NPV), Profitability Index (PI), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) are know that all of investation alternatives and feasible to do. But then, the infestation alternative for buy for new <b>Filling</b> <b>and</b> Packaging Sachet <b>Machine,</b> Honey Liquid Filler Machine, Auto strip Packaging Machine, Coding Machine Daichi DH- 7, Ribbon Mixer Material Sus 304 <b>Machine,</b> <b>Filling</b> Sachet <b>Machine,</b> Honey Stick Machine, Coding Machine, Tank and Mixer Machine, Conveyor Machine, and Gear and Pump Brand Machine is the best alternative. This decision is taken based on value of infestation criteria NPV and PI for buying new machine alternative is more than value infestation criteria NPV and PI for repairing machine alternative. In expectation, this alternative give more benefit than repairing the old machine. The result of this research show that the reasonable alternative is buy for new <b>machine</b> of <b>Filling</b> <b>and</b> Packaging Sachet <b>Machine,</b> Honey Liquid Filler Machine, Auto strip Packaging Machine, Coding Machine Daichi DH- 7, Ribbon Mixer Material Sus 304 <b>Machine,</b> <b>Filling</b> Sachet <b>Machine,</b> Honey Stick Machine, Coding Machine, Tank and Mixer Machine, Conveyor Machine, and Gear and Pump Brand Machine. From the research result suggested that PT Air Mancur should choose buying infestation alternative for new <b>machine</b> prioritized for <b>Filling</b> <b>and</b> Packaging <b>Machine,</b> Honey Liquid Filler Machine, and Auto strip Packaging Machine because these machines are the oldest (17 years old).

Samples of raw and pasteurised milk from different sampling sites along the line were collected. After incubation at 7 °C until the total aerobic plate count reached 106 to 107 cfu/ml, {{or the number of}} GPS exceeded 104 cfu/ml isolates were picked randomly and identified. All GNP present in the raw milk were properly killed during pasteurisation. A recontamination by GNP was observed in 40 % of the consumer packages. This recontamination was focused to the <b>filling</b> procedure, <b>and</b> Pseudomonas was the dominating GNP in all packages. Environmental samples, as water from different water sources in the dairy plant, air collected by a RCS-sampler on water-agar strips, and empty, formed and sealed packages taken from the <b>filling</b> <b>machines,</b> were inoculated with sterile milk. GNP isolates were randomly picked and identified after incubation at 7 °C. Samples of water and air collected in the immediate surroundings of the <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> contained large numbers of GNP causing growth in refrigerated milk. GNP isolates from the milk samples and from the environmental samples were genomically typed by the PCR-based method Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The RAPD-typing showed that there are many different RAPD-types involved in the recontamination of pasteurised milk. Several of the milk contaminating RAPD-types were found in condensed water on the filling nozzles, in waste-water {{at the bottom of the}} <b>filling</b> <b>machine,</b> <b>and</b> in air surrounding the <b>filling</b> <b>machine.</b> Some contaminating RAPD-types were present inside the <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> over long periods, especially at the bottom of the <b>filling</b> <b>machine.</b> The effect on post-pasteurisation contamination by reducing the usage of water around the <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> was studied. A clear link between the usage of water inside the machine and the frequency of consumer packages contaminated by GNP was found. B. cereus were involved in, and sometimes solely responsible for, the spoilage of pasteurised milk. The B. cereus infection can originate from heat-resistant spores present in the raw milk, but B. cereus can also enter the milk at the dairy plant. By using traditional microbiological methods and RAPD-typing, the pasteurised milk was once found to be contaminated by B. cereus while passing through one pasteuriser, and commonly found to be contaminated during the filling procedure...|$|R
