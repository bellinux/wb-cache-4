25|$|Calvert is the {{original}} author of the E-Verify law, the only employment verification program available to employers to check the <b>work</b> <b>authorization</b> status of newly hired employees. In 1995, he introduced H.R. 502, which was later included in the immigration reform bill, H.R. 2202. The immigration reforms were later wrapped into the FY1997 Omnibus Appropriations Act. The original program, known as the Basic Pilot Program, was only available to five states and employers used a call in system. In the 12 years since its implementation, the Basic Pilot Program, now known as E-Verify, has expanded nationwide and has over 100,000 employers using the system. Two states, Arizona and Mississippi, have made use of E-Verify mandatory. In the 111th Congress Calvert again introduced legislation {{to make use of}} E-Verify mandatory.|$|E
25|$|The {{recruitment}} {{process of}} a migrant domestic worker into Lebanon is conducted by sponsorship. The worker has {{to receive an}} invitation before being granted a working permit to enter the country. The invitation comes through a recruiting agency either by use of the services of {{their counterparts in the}} worker’s country of origin or directly from the agency itself and sometimes at the request of an individual employer. First, the Ministry of Labour issues preliminary <b>work</b> <b>authorization</b> to migrant domestic workers. In 2010, the Ministry of Labour issued and approximate 118,000 work permits to migrant domestic Workers. Next, the Ministry of Interior issues entry visas through the General Directorate for General Security. Then the General Directorate of General Security authorizes the legal entry of migrant domestic workers and arranges work permission and residence when they arrived in the country. Lastly, the sponsor’s name is located on the migrant domestic worker's entry visa, residence and work permit. The visa is for a three-month period {{and the name of the}} sponsor is included in the passport. When the migrant domestic worker arrives at the airport they are subjected to an immigration routine which includes the handing over of their passports to the Lebanese General Security in order to process the papers, while the migrant domestic worker waits to be collected by their sponsor. After this, the sponsor brings the migrant domestic worker to a local agency for a basic medical checkup.|$|E

The landowner was concerned that looting had undermined massive oak trees enough that they might fall directly onto the roadway below. The looting was occurring within Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) right-of-way and east of the existing fence line. In June 2004, archeologists from the Planning, Permitting and Licensing Practice of TRC Environmental Corporation (TRC) Austin office conducted a site specific recording, geoarcheological investigation, and archeological testing for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) eligibility assessment at prehistoric site 41 MS 69, the Slippery Slope site.

Prosthodontic educators have been concerned with this interaction and communication. Fixed prosthodontics laboratories revealed that the technicians are often dissatisfied with the information provided in <b>work</b> <b>authorizations.</b> Objective: To evaluate the quality of communication between dentists and laboratory technicians via <b>work</b> <b>authorizations</b> for fixed prosthodontics in both governmental and private dental laboratories in Riyadh area from the technician’s perspective. Methods: A sample of 66 dental laboratories, including all government dental laboratories and a selected number of randomly chosen private dental laboratories from each district of Riyadh (40 %), participated in the survey. A questionnaire was developed to include questions related to the following areas of work authorization: clarity and accuracy of instructions, patient information, type of prosthesis, choice of materials, design and shade of the prosthesis and type of porcelain glaze. The questionnaire was answered in a face-to-face interview by technicians who were qualified in fixed prosthetic work. Data were analyzed through parametric tests (T-test and one-way ANOVA) to identify significant values (P <  0. 05). Results: This survey showed a lack of communication between dentists and dental laboratories regarding the following: marginal design, pontic design, staining diagram, type of porcelain and glaze needed for the prosthesis. Significant differences were observed {{between the government and}} private dental laboratories. There was a greater lack of communication between the dentists and government laboratory technicians in Riyadh. There was no statistically significant difference between private laboratories of different areas in Riyadh city (P <  0. 05).

40|$|Abstract — With the {{increase}} in web based enterprise services, there is an increasing trend among business enterprises to migrate to web services platform. Web services paradigm poses {{a number of new}} security challenges, which can only be realized by developing effective access control models. The fact that the enterprises allow access to the resources through web services requires development of access control models that can capture relevant information about a service requester at the time of access request and incorporate this information for making effective access control decisions. Researchers have addressed many issues related to authentication and authorization of web services requests for accessing resources, but the issues related to <b>authorization</b> <b>work</b> and identity based access are still poorly addressed. Authors of this paper focus on providing an extended approach to capture relevant information about a service requester and establish a certain level of trust so that amount of <b>authorization</b> <b>work</b> required for accessing any resource is reduced and service requests are served in an efficient manner. Compared with existing access control mechanisms, the proposed mechanism has reduced the amount of <b>authorization</b> <b>work</b> required for accessing resources across varied domains...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} need {{to manage}} California?s electricity grid {{in real time}} {{is a result of}} the ongoing transition from a system operated by vertically-integrated utilities serving native loads to one operated by an independent system operator supporting competitive energy markets. During this transition period, the traditional approach to reliability management [...] construction of new transmission lines [...] has not been pursued due to unresolved issues related to the financing and recovery of transmission project costs. In the absence of investments in new transmission infrastructure, the best strategy for managing reliability is to equip system operators with better real-time information about actual operating margins so that they can better understand and manage the risk of operating closer to the edge. A companion strategy is to address known deficiencies in offline modeling tools that are needed to ground the use of improved real-time tools. This project: (1) developed and conducted first-ever demonstrations of two prototype real-time software tools for voltage security assessment and phasor monitoring; and (2) prepared a scoping study on improving load and generator response models.
