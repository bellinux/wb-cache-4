60|$|She {{remembered a}} very brown face, a tall slim figure, and {{something}} gallant {{about the whole}} of him. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like</b> after ten years? Grizzled, married, with a large family? An odious thing--Time! And Cousin Edward's little yellow letter.|$|E

6000|$|... "Man {{with a flat}} face," [...] said Dirk anxiously, as he slit away at the {{stitches}} of {{the saddle}} to find the letter; [...] "tell me about him. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like,</b> and {{what makes you think}} he wished to take the paper from you?" ...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not think}} we shall escape it, if we stop short at the text. We must go on from the Old Testament and let the New explain it. We must believe what Moses tells us: but we must ask St. John to show us more than Moses saw. Moses tells us that God created the heavens and the earth; St. John goes further, and tells us what that God is like; how he saw Christ, the Word of God, by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made that is made. And <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like?</b> He was the {{brightness}} of his Father's glory, and the express image of his person. And what was that like? was there any darkness in him--meanness, grudging, cruelty, changeableness, deceit? No. He was full of grace and truth. Grace and truth: that is what Christ is; and therefore that is what God is.|$|E

6000|$|Well, and <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like?</b> {{and what}} were my {{impressions}} concerning him? He {{was a man of}} about forty years of age, of middle size, and rather emaciated figure; his face was pale, his cheeks were sunk, and his eyes hollow; his features were pleasing and regular, they had a French turn (for M. Pelet was no Fleming, but a Frenchman both by birth and parentage), yet the degree of harshness inseparable from Gallic lineaments was, in his case, softened by a mild blue eye, and a melancholy, almost suffering, expression of countenance; his physiognomy was [...] "fine et spirituelle." [...] I use two French words because they define better than any English terms the species of intelligence with which his features were imbued. He was altogether an interesting and prepossessing personage. I wondered only at the utter absence of all the ordinary characteristics of his profession, and almost feared he could not be stern and resolute enough for a schoolmaster. Externally at least M. Pelet presented an absolute contrast to my late master, Edward Crimsworth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} either, son, so cannot say. But <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like?</b> Oh, I cannot say that either, {{although}} still I {{see him in}} my heart. My mortal lips will not tell the likeness of that man, perhaps because {{he seemed to be}} like all men, and yet different from all. He had an iron brow, beneath which shone deep, cold eyes. He was clean-shaven, or perchance his face grew no hair. His lips were thick and still and his features did not change like those of other men. He looked as though he could not change; as though he had been thus for infinite ages, and yet remained neither young nor old. As for his dress, he wore a cloak of flaming red, such a cloak as your Eve loves to wear, and white sandals on his feet. There was no covering on his shaven head, which gleamed like a skull. His breast was naked, but across it hung one row of black jewels. From the sheen of them I think they must have been pearls, which are sometimes found of that colour in the East. He had no weapon nor staff, and his hands hung down {{on either side of the}} chair.|$|E
6000|$|When Lise {{had gone}} out Janet {{sat down in the}} rocking-chair and began to rock agitatedly. What had really made her angry, she began to perceive, was the {{realization}} of a certain amount of truth in her sister's intimation concerning Ditmar. Why should she have, in Lise, continually before her eyes a degraded caricature of her own aspirations and ideals? or was Lise a mirror--somewhat tarnished, indeed--in which she read the truth about herself? For some time Janet had more than suspected that her sister possessed a new lover--a lover whom she refrained from discussing; an ominous sign, since it had been her habit to dangle her conquests before Janet's eyes, to discuss their merits and demerits with an engaging though cynical freedom. Although the existence of this gentleman was based on evidence purely circumstantial, Janet was inclined to believe him of a type wholly different from his predecessors; and the fact that his attentions were curiously intermittent and irregular inclined her to the theory that he was not a resident of Hampton. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like?</b> It revolted her to reflect that he might in some ways possibly resemble Ditmar. Thus he became the object of a morbid speculation, especially at such times as this, when Lise attired herself in her new winter finery and went forth to meet him. Janet, also, had recently been self-convicted of sharing with Lise the same questionable tendency toward self-adornment to please the eye of man. The very next Saturday night after she had indulged in that mad extravagance of the blue suit, Lise had brought home from the window of The Paris in Faber Street a hat that had excited the cupidity and admiration of Miss Schuler and herself, and in front of which they had stood languishing on three successive evenings. In its acquisition Lise had expended almost the whole of a week's salary. Its colour was purple, on three sides were massed drooping lilac feathers, but over the left ear the wide brim was caught up and held by a crescent of brilliant paste stones. Shortly after this purchase--the next week, in fact,--The Paris had alluringly and craftily displayed, for the tempting sum of $6.29, the very cloak ordained by providence to [...] "go" [...] with the hat. Miss Schuler declared it would be a crime to fail to take advantage of such an opportunity but the trouble was that Lise had had to wait for two more pay-days and endure the suspense arising from the possibility that some young lady of taste and means might meanwhile become its happy proprietor. Had not the saleslady been obdurate, Lise would have had it on credit; but she did succeed, by an initial payment the ensuing Saturday, in having it withdrawn from public gaze. The second Saturday Lise triumphantly brought the cloak home; a velvet cloak,--if the eyes could be believed,--velvet bordering on plush, with a dark purple ground delicately and artistically spotted with a lilac to match the hat feathers, and edged with a material which--if not too impudently examined and no questions asked--might be mistaken, by the uninitiated male, for the fur of a white fox. Both investments had been made, needless to say, on the strength of Janet's increased salary; and Lise, when Janet had surprised her before the bureau rapturously surveying the combination, justified herself with a defiant apology.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, I haven't {{the least}} idea," [...] she declared. [...] "I {{do not even}} know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> has <b>been</b> there for two months, and we haven't seen him yet.

6000|$|For it is a {{very serious}} moment, my friends, when large masses have had enough to eat and drink, and have been saying, 'Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die;' and then, suddenly, by not having enough to eat and drink, and yet finding {{themselves}} still alive, are awakened to the sense that there is more in them than the mere capacity for eating and drinking. Then begin once more the world- old questions, Why are we thus? Who put us here? Who made us? God? Is there a God? and if there <b>be,</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>like?</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> his will toward us, good or evil? Is it hate or love? ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>liked</b> best of all, {{said the}} youth, {{and that was}} no lie, as {{everybody}} can guess.|$|R
5000|$|The {{characters}} {{and some of}} the events described are fiction, but the story may have some basis in fact. A cargo of gold bullion worth $9,000,000 arrived by the freighter Bomma in Baltimore on 28 June 1940, with the ships captain reporting that the gold was smuggled past the Germans by Norwegian children on their sleds. The book is often described as being [...] "based on a true story." [...] McSwigan stated in an authors note [...] "that she had tried to be as accurate as possible in describing how the children carried the gold on sleds" [...] while admitting that some details were changed. A journalist by trade, she wrote in 1960: [...] "Some of my childrens books are based on actual happenings. Over and over, an Associated Press dispatch or one from United-International has set me to wondering: What kind of patriots were those Norwegians who saved their gold by having their children sled it down a mountain past the occupation forces, as I subsequently made my characters do in Snow Treasure? Or <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like,</b> the real sixteen-year-old who, on a homemade portable radio transmitter, broadcast resistance against the Japanese as did my Juan of Manila? Or, what about those Czechs who stole a railway train and drove it into West Germany, as mine would do in All Aboard for Freedom? These stories came out of the newspapers." [...] In the books foreword McSwigan also asserted: [...] "This story is based on an actual happening. On June 28, 1940, the Norwegian freighter Bomma reached Baltimore with a cargo of gold bullion worth $9,000,000... Two changes were made in the scant account given in the news dispatches that accompanied the disclosure of the cargo of gold. The Bomma, a coasting motorship, became the Cleng Peerson, a fishing smack. Also, the distance the gold was sledded was not twelve miles but actually thirty-five miles. Otherwise, how the Norse children set about eluding the German forces of occupation is here reconstructed as well as possible from what brief facts were permitted." ...|$|E
60|$|MARTHA--Yes--but I didn't mean <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a rough scene. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> very mild even {{in those}} days. Do tell me <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> at Cornell.|$|R
60|$|She {{reflected}} {{that she had}} done all {{that it was necessary}} to do in practical matters. She had written a great many letters, and had obtained Willoughby's consent. She had dwelt so often upon Mr. Hewet's prospects, his profession, his birth, appearance, and temperament, that she had almost forgotten <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> really <b>like.</b> When she refreshed herself by a look at him, she used to wonder again <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> and then, concluding that they were happy at any rate, thought no more about it.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Gallilee humbly {{admitted}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in fault. Carmina asked who Donald <b>was,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> Zo unconsciously tested her memory {{for the second}} time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, dame," [...] {{said the}} hostler, more respectfully, [...] "as for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> I cannot tell, nor no man else, for why I never saw un." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>he</b> <b>is</b> as {{wonderful}} as you say, Lady Windermere, I couldn't well miss him. Tell me <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>like,</b> and I'll {{bring him}} to you at once.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> must <b>be</b> unconscious. It {{is one of}} the {{qualifications}} for his magistracy. Other qualifications <b>are</b> equally easy. <b>He</b> must have done nothing, expressed nothing, imagined nothing. <b>He</b> must <b>be</b> obscure, insignificant and mediocre--in thought, act, speech and sympathy. He must know nothing of art, of life--and of himself. For if he did he would not dare to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> <b>Like</b> that much questioned and mysterious bird, the phoenix, he sits amongst the cold ashes of his predecessor upon the altar of morality, alone of his kind in the sight of wondering generations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you ever}} see this John of Gamala? Do you know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> personally? Was <b>he</b> another giant, <b>like</b> this Simon who was {{executed}} at the triumph, the other day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{like that}} will come in his way. I heard Mr. Flick {{say that it was}} equal to half a million of money. And then it would have been at once.

60|$|And {{therefore}} to prepare us for Lent and Passion week, and Easter day, {{we begin this}} Sunday to read who the first man <b>was,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> when <b>he</b> came into the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{but you are}} intimate!" [...] Mrs. Plimpton protested. [...] "Everybody says so--that Mr. Parr sends for you all the time. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>like</b> when <b>he's</b> alone, and relaxed? Is he ever relaxed?" [...] The {{lady had}} a habit of not waiting for answers to her questions. [...] "Do you know, it stirs my {{imagination}} tremendously when I think of all the power that man has. I suppose you know he has become one of a very small group of men who control this country, and naturally <b>he</b> has <b>been</b> cruelly maligned. All {{he has to do is}} to say a word to his secretary, and he can make men or ruin them. It isn't that he does ruin them--I don't mean that. He uses his wealth, Wallis says, to maintain the prosperity of the nation! He feels his trusteeship. And <b>he</b> <b>is</b> so generous! <b>He</b> has given a great deal to the church, and now," [...] she added, [...] "I <b>am</b> sure <b>he</b> will give more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{once said}} a man could <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> if <b>he</b> tried hard enough, so why shouldn't you be a poet?" [...] asked Rose, liking to trip him up with his own words, as he often did her.|$|R
60|$|To know {{good and}} evil, right and wrong--to have a conscience, a moral sense--that is the {{likeness}} of God of which I wish to preach to-day. Because it is through THAT knowledge of good and evil, and through it alone, that we can know God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent. It is through our moral sense that God speaks to us; through our {{sense of right and}} wrong; through that I say, God speaks to us, whether in reproof or encouragement, in wrath or in love; to teach us <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>like,</b> and to teach us <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not <b>like.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know Ryder {{would be}} too honourable {{consciously}} to meddle with a boy's faith; but {{the worst of it}} <b>is,</b> <b>he</b> does not know <b>what</b> <b>is</b> meddling, and <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> Edgar, and talks eagerly to him. And the boy enjoys it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] She {{stood at}} the door. Now that she had carried out her preposterous impulse to see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> she was cold, she was as ready to detect familiarities as the virtuous Miss Ella Stowbody.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{thought he}} only spoke of driving it away because it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> able to do. But things do not prey on people {{of his age}} as they do on younger ones.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All night I waited!" [...] he cried. [...] "I {{could not}} sit still. I could {{scarcely}} breathe. Tell me <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>like,</b> Julia? Tell me what <b>he</b> looks <b>like?</b> Is <b>he</b> strong? Does he look strong {{enough for the}} work?" ...|$|R
60|$|It had {{suddenly}} come over {{her that the}} man {{she was going to}} meet she scarcely knew! Shyness seized her, a shyness that bordered on panic. And <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> really <b>like,</b> that she should put her whole trust in him? She glanced behind her: that way was closed: she had a mad desire to get away, to hide, to think. It must have been an obsession that had possessed her all these months. The porter was looking again, and he voiced her predicament.|$|R
