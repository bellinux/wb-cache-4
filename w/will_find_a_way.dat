25|$|I do feel strongly, {{after my}} {{subcommittee}} has carefully and objectively reviewed this case from both sides, that injustice rather than justice has been served. The Moon case sends a strong signal that if one's views are unpopular enough, this country <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> not to tolerate, but to convict. I don't {{believe that you}} or I or anyone else, no matter how innocent, could realistically prevail against the combined forces of our Justice Department and judicial branch in a case such as Reverend Moon's.|$|E
25|$|Connie and Edward argue and, out {{of anger}} and frustration, Edward says {{that he wanted to}} kill her instead of Paul. In the days that follow, while looking at the {{underside}} of the snow globe, Connie discovers a hidden compartment containing a photograph of her, Edward, and an infant Charlie, with a loving anniversary message instructing her not to read the message until their 25th wedding anniversary. As Connie is burning the photographs of her and Paul in the fireplace, Edward says he will turn himself in. Connie objects, saying they <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to move on. The two then appear to go about living a normal life. One night, while driving, with Charlie sleeping in the backseat, Edward stops the car at an intersection. Connie whispers to Edward that they could leave the country and assume new identities, and Edward agrees to the idea. Connie then starts crying, and Edward consoles her. It is revealed that Edward has stopped his car near a police station, implying he is about to leave their car and turn himself in.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Hook arrives to the mansion to warn Emma, but Gold thwarts his efforts, erases his {{phone calls to}} Emma, and ties him to the fence. Inside the mansion, Elsa finds Emma and tells her that she sees her {{doing the same thing}} that she once did, blaming herself {{for not being able to}} control her powers because her family was harmed, and that she should be blessed to have this gift. Elsa then asks Emma for her hand and she takes it, {{resulting}} in Emma's powers returning to normal. Outside, Gold, upset over what he just saw, becomes furious over his failed attempt to take Emma's power, which pleased Hook. However, Gold says that despite the setback, he <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to acquire the power to free him of the Dagger of Kris. But Gold also needs another item: the heart of someone who knew Gold before he became the Dark One. Since Killian is the only one left alive, Gold takes his heart. By doing so, Gold makes Killian his puppet and vows to use him to find another way to get Emma's powers, before he will kill him. As Hook reunites with Emma and kisses her, Emma wondered what got into him, and after she and Elsa walk away, he grabs the Sorcerer's box and hides it inside the jacket. Regina arrives at the library, where Robin shows her a page that featured the two together at the pub back in the Enchanted Forest, leading to indications that whoever wrote the story wanted them to be together. Back at the Snow Queen's lair, Ingrid, now free of the force field, follows through with her plan to bring her three sisters together by sending out her ribbons to Emma and Elsa. As Emma and Elsa are reunited with David, Mary Margaret, and Henry, she unleashed her magic into the sky, which creates colorful auroras and then fireworks. Unfortunately, Emma and Elsa notice the yellow ribbons on their left wrists too late, and that they can't remove their ribbons, even while the ribbons are siphoning away their power.|$|E

Lance Zierlein of NFL.com said that [...] "Based on Mancz's tape and history, {{one would have to}} expect that he <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to succeed in the league."

2500|$|Ebell of Los Angeles {{was formed}} as a women's club in 1894, based on the {{principles}} and teachings of Adrian Ebell, a pioneer in women's education and organizing women's societies in the late 19th century. Harriet Williams Russell Strong was {{a founder of the}} club, serving as its president for three consecutive terms. The minutes of the first meeting of Ebell of Los Angeles identify its purpose [...] "to interest women in the study of all branches of literature, art and science and the advancement of women in every branch of culture." [...] The club adopted as its motto, [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> or make one -- I serve." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{also argued}} that a {{proposed}} £26,000-a-year benefits cap, would {{not lead to a}} rise in homelessness or child poverty [...] "The reality is that with £26,000 a year, it’s very difficult to believe that families will be plunged into poverty – children or adults," [...] he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. [...] "Capping at average earnings of £35,000 before tax and £26,000 after, actually means {{that we are going to}} work with families make sure that they <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> out."

Duncan Smith led the governments legislation in the House of Commons in January 2013 to cap most benefit increases at 1%, a real terms cut.|$|E
2500|$|Sanctions {{tightened}} further when major supertanker {{companies said}} they would stop loading Iranian cargo. Prior attempts to reduce Iran's oil income failed because many vessels are often managed by companies outside the United States and the EU; however, EU actions in January extended the ban to ship insurance. This insurance ban will affect 95 percent of the tanker fleet because their insurance falls under rules governed by European law. [...] "It's the insurance that's completed the ban on trading with Iran," [...] commented one veteran ship broker. This completion of the trading ban left Iran struggling to find a buyer for {{nearly a quarter of}} its annual oil exports. Iran has sought to manage the impact of international sanctions and limit capital outflows by promoting a [...] "resistance economy," [...] replacing imports with domestic goods and banning luxury imports such as computers and mobile phones. [...] This is predicted to lead to an increase in smuggling, as [...] "people <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to smuggle in what the Iranian consumer wants." [...] To sustain oil imports, Iran has also provided domestic insurance for tankers shipping Iranian oil. Iran had hoped to sell more to Chinese and Indian refiners, though such attempts seem unlikely to succeed, particularly since China—the single-largest buyer of Iranian crude—has been curtailing its oil imports from Iran down to half their former level.|$|E

2500|$|Other secular writers {{questioned}} Yoakum's faith healing practices. [...] As {{early as}} 1903, Yoakum claimed his movement had performed some 800 healings, and the Los Angeles Times described Yoakum as the [...] "leading apostle of the 'faith-healing' movement in this city." [...] However, the Times noted discrepancies in the dates and {{circumstances of the}} [...] "healings" [...] under the headline [...] "Pouring Oil on the Sick ... Stories Don't Jibe." [...] In 1909, the Los Angeles Times published a lengthy article criticizing Yoakum's tactics. [...] The article, titled [...] "No Miracles Without Cash: Services Halt While Money Is Collected," [...] described events {{at one of the}} healing services held at Pisgah Home.

[...] It then described a [...] "Healing and Testimony of the Healed" [...] service:"Collection boxes were placed on the grounds about the home and in the tabernacle, and an extra large one was on the platform, where Dr. Yoakum and his assistants perform their miracles. [...] A large audience was present, but the sight alone of the collection boxes did not draw the dollars quite fast enough for the doctor, so the testimony service was stopped long enough for him to tell how necessary it is for one to give away all his money before entering the kingdom of heaven. [...] Dr. Yoakum said that he performs such miracles as mentioned in the Bible, but that the one-tenth of a person's income {{for the purposes of the}} Lord was entirely too small, and that every one should give all their money to God's servants, or rather servant. [...] After his talk the large box was placed on the front of the platform with the simple statement that there were several more at hand should one not prove large enough to hold all. [...] This admonition opened the persons of many and soon the space around the platform was crowded with cheerful givers, many of whom looked as though they needed the money at home. ... Dr. Yoakum said: 'If you have a debt to pay, do not hoard your money in trying to pay it and be a tight-wad, but give it for God's work and he <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for you to get along.'" ...|$|E
