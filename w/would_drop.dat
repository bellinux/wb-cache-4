5|$|After the {{original}} advertised octopus mouth (where riders <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> through) {{that was to}} be placed {{at the bottom of the}} first drop was never built, the public began to question why the park didn't follow through with what they advertised. In response, the mouth was constructed during the following off-season.|$|E
5|$|PNC Park had {{an average}} {{attendance}} of 30,742people per game throughout its inaugural season, though it <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> approximately 27% the following season to 22,594spectators per game. Throughout the 2001 season, businesses in downtown and on the Northside of Pittsburgh showed a 20–25% increase in business on Pirate game days.|$|E

5|$|Defeated enemies <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> {{two types}} of items: cards, which either {{unlocked}} new characters or allowed the player to boost their characters' stats when increasing their level; and bullets, {{which could be used}} on cards that had been increased to their maximum level, to transform them into higher-ranking cards. The player could also find other power-up items scattered in the arenas, which could be used to increase the speed or strength of their characters, recover health points, or make aiming easier.|$|E
5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish {{girl would}} make a good ballet story. His first idea was to present an empty ballroom {{glittering}} with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart and the girl <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> dead.|$|E
5|$|In October {{with the}} World Series {{approaching}} and Tancredo's team the Colorado Rockies representing the National League, {{he decided to}} offer a bet with fellow candidate Mitt Romney whose team the Boston Red Sox were representing the American League. Tancredo proposed that he <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> {{out of the race}} if Boston won but only if Romney agreed to drop out if Colorado won. Luckily for Tancredo, the Romney campaign turned down the bet and Boston won the world series.|$|E

50|$|Most barns were {{equipped}} with several chutes {{along the sides}} {{and in the center}} of the loft floor. This permitted bales to be dropped into the area where they were to be used. Hay bales <b>would</b> be <b>dropped</b> through side chutes, to be broken up and fed to the cattle. Straw bales <b>would</b> be <b>dropped</b> down the center chute, to be distributed as bedding in the livestock standing/resting areas.|$|R
5|$|Along {{with the}} World Cup, the IRB enlisted some of rugby’s biggest names {{to assist in}} the bid. In March 2009, Jonah Lomu and Lawrence Dallaglio were {{announced}} as ambassadors for the bid and in April 2009 Waisale Serevi was unveiled as an ambassador to coincide with the Oceania National Olympic Committees' general assembly. May 2009 saw the IRB announce that they <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> the Rugby World Cup Sevens in order to improve the chances of the sport being included. The benefit of this move would be to make the Olympics the premier event in international rugby sevens.|$|E
5|$|Augustus' brother, Otto, {{devised the}} scheme to corner United Copper, {{believing that the}} Heinze family already {{controlled}} {{a majority of the}} company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price <b>would</b> <b>drop,</b> and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.|$|E
5|$|Federer's {{first and}} only title of 2013 came at the Gerry Weber Open (def. Mikhail Youzhny), where he also played doubles with good friend Tommy Haas. With the victory in Halle, he tied John McEnroe for the third-most number of ATP titles won by a male player in the Open Era. Federer, however, was unable to {{maintain}} his form into Wimbledon, suffering his worst Grand Slam tournament defeat since 2003 {{in the second round}} against Sergiy Stakhovsky. Not only did the loss end Federer's record streak of 36 consecutive quarterfinals at Grand Slam tournaments, it meant he <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> out of the top 4 for first time since July 2003, exactly 10 years after he won his first Wimbledon title.|$|E

5|$|Knowles {{teamed with}} America's Second Harvest and Pastor Rudy Rasmus of St. John United Methodist Church for a pre-concert food {{donation}} drive which {{was part of}} The Beyoncé Experience at every stop. Food was collected for people who fought with famine. Knowles' organization The Survivor Foundation was also involved in the campaign. The first 1,000 fans who <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> off a minimum of three non-perishable food items would receive an autographed photo of Knowles and a raffle ticket for a chance to have an upgraded seat. For the food drive in Ethiopia, India and Turkey, Houston Chronicle collaborated with Knowles, creating a Virtual Aid Drive and asking people to send money to them. The funds were donated to the Global FoodBanking Network.|$|E
5|$|Magna Carta Holy Grail debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200 and sold 528,000 copies in its first week, which {{bypassed}} its predicted debut in the range of 350,000 to 400,000. The album also debuted at {{number one on}} the Canadian Albums Chart. It is Jay-Z's third straight number one album in Canada. The album debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Album Chart, Jay-Z's first UK number one album. In its second week the album sold 129,000 more copies in the United States. Despite the 76% drop in sales, Magna Carta Holy Grail retained its number one position on the Billboard 200, becoming the first rap album to spend two consecutive weeks on top since Lil Wayne's Tha Carter IV (2011). In its third week the album <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> down to number two, selling 77,000 copies. In its fourth week the album <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> down to number three, selling 62,000 copies. It sold 1,099,000 copies in 2013 in the United States, making it the tenth best-selling album of the year. By February 26, 2014, the album had sold 1,130,000 copies in the United States. As of September 2, 2013, It was announced by Billboard that Magna Carta Holy Grail was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of two million copies in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Speaking on the {{evolving}} relationship of Clark and Chloe, Mack {{believes that the}} season six introduction of Jimmy Olsen into Chloe's life increased her value to Clark. Before, Chloe <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> anything for Clark, but now that Chloe has other priorities, it makes Clark realize how valuable she is to him. The introduction of Jimmy Olsen also provides Chloe with someone she can finally have a romantic relationship with. The relationship is strained when Chloe has to lie to cover up Clark's secret, as well as keeping {{the fact that she}} is meteor-infected hidden. Writer Holly Harold questions whether or not Jimmy has taken over the place in Chloe's heart that Clark occupied for so long.|$|E

5|$|The delay {{caused by}} these rearguards may have seriously {{compromised}} the British Empire advance {{as there was}} not much time to conclude military engagements in southern Palestine. The winter rains were expected to start {{in the middle of the}} month and the black soil plain which was currently firm, facilitating the movements of large military units would with the rains become a giant boggy quagmire, impassable for wheeled vehicles and very heavy marching for infantry. With the rains the temperatures which were currently hot during the day and pleasant at night <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> rapidly to become piercingly cold. In 1917 the rains began on 19 November just as the infantry began their advance into the Judean Hills.|$|E
5|$|While having name recognition, McGovern {{had little}} funding or staff, {{although}} he did garner critical funding from some celebrities and statesmen. He won a surprise third-place showing in the Iowa caucuses amidst a crowded field of candidates, but finished fifth in the New Hampshire primary. He announced he <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> out unless he finished first or second in the Massachusetts primary, {{and when he came}} in third behind his former campaign manager Gary Hart and former Vice President Walter Mondale, he made good on his promise. He later endorsed Mondale, the eventual Democratic nominee. McGovern hosted Saturday Night Live on April 14, 1984.|$|E
5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with his sleeves rolled up, a tea towel in his hand and an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E

5|$|In September 1944, Cole handed NWA over to Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth. At {{this stage}} of the war, the Allies were {{advancing}} north and the tempo of operations in the Darwin area had decreased. Charlesworth raised concerns regarding No.80 Wing, warning higher command that its morale <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> if it was not either given {{a more active role in}} the war or transferred to southern Australia for rest. By October, the wing had received orders to depart NWA for Morotai to join the First Tactical Air Force; this left NWA with twelve squadrons at its disposal, including one Liberator unit and three other Spitfire squadrons. In the meantime, NWA supported the assault on Leyte with attacks on enemy ports, oil facilities, and shipping in the Dutch East Indies using Beaufighters, Mitchells, and Liberators. These operations continued through November and December. By then, NWA headquarters staff numbered 651, including 156 officers.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> hot sealing wax {{on her back and}} arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E
5|$|On 8 April 1940 eight {{aircraft}} of 1./ZG76, {{under the}} command of Staffelkapitän Werner Hansen, deployed northward from Jever to Westerland on Sylt in preparation for operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway. The German plan for the attack called for an amphibious assault on the Norwegian capital, Oslo, and six major ports from Kristiansand in the south to Narvik in the north. Simultaneously, Junkers 52 (Ju52) transport aircraft <b>would</b> <b>drop</b> parachute troops to secure Oslo's Fornebu airport. Additional Ju52s were scheduled to arrive at Fornebu twenty minutes after the parachute drop, by which time the airfield had to be in German hands. 1./ZG76 was to provide air cover and ground-attack support for both waves. Eight Bf110 Zerstörer of 1./ZG76 took off at 7:00 in the morning, planning to synchronize their arrival at Fornebu with the parachute drop at 8:45. The distance from Westerland to Fornebu meant that this was a one-way operation; the Bf110s could not hold enough fuel for the return trip. Their fuel was calculated to provide them 20 minutes flying time over Fornebu, and the pilots would have to land at Fornebu once the airfield had been seized.|$|E
5000|$|Players first {{drop their}} pieces onto the board. Stewart Culin, H.J.R. Murray, and R.C. Bell {{unfortunately}} did not describe in detail {{how they are}} dropped onto the board. In some other hunt games, an oxen piece <b>would</b> first be <b>dropped</b> onto any vacant point on the board followed by a tiger piece onto any vacant point on the board, and players would continue in this fashion. Tiger pieces may not be moved or perform captures until all three tigers have been dropped onto the board which takes three turns. Likewise, oxen pieces may not be moved until all twelve oxen pieces have been dropped onto the board which takes twelve turns. Another method that could be employed is the one used in the Myanmar game of Tiger and Buffaloes. Four oxen pieces <b>would</b> be <b>dropped</b> first, followed by a tiger piece. Then four more oxen pieces <b>would</b> be <b>dropped,</b> followed by another tiger piece. Then the remaining four oxen pieces <b>would</b> be <b>dropped,</b> followed by the last tiger piece.|$|R
