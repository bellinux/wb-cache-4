5|$|A {{new game}} was also {{introduced}} {{on the roof}} of BBC Television Centre called Sacrifice Your Family which Cawood hosted that put two families against each other in various games. This was later renamed Sacrifice Your Friends in 2001. Other features included Talk To The Hand where a celebrity had to answer questions from viewers with the option to only be able to pass one of the questions <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand and L Most Wanted where viewers could win prizes if they could spot a three digit number clue placed somewhere throughout the show which was the code to the cage containing the prizes. The winner was the one who guessed the correct order out of a possible six combinations.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian vulture {{populations have}} {{declined}} {{in most parts}} of its range. In Europe and most of the Middle East, populations in 2001 were half of those from 1980. In India, the decline has been rapid with a 35% decrease each year since 1999. In 1967–70, the area around Delhi was estimated to have 12,000–15,000 of these vultures, with an average density of about 5 pairs per 10km2. The exact cause of the decline is not known, but has been linked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NSAID Diclofenac, which has been known to cause death in Gyps vultures.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player campaign, Perfect Dark features a multiplayer mode. With {{the help of a}} Game Link Cable, two players can link together and compete in four different types of deathmatch modes, ranging from the standard kill-the-other-person on a pre-set time to the Counter Force mode, where the first player must rescue two hostages while the second player has to guard them. Various multiplayer maps are unlocked as the player progresses through the single player mode. Additionally, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optional Transfer Pak, players can use the game's cartridge to alternatively unlock some cheats in its Nintendo 64 counterpart. Players may also use the Game Boy Printer to print out character profiles.|$|E

5|$|Maclean (1972) further {{suggests}} that the Dutch simply made a cartographical error, and confused Hirta with Skildar, the old name for Haskeir island much nearer the main Outer Hebrides archipelago. Quine (2000) hypothesises that the name is derived {{from a series of}} cartographical errors, starting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Icelandic Skildir ("shields") and appearing as Skildar on a map by Nicholas de Nicolay (1583). This, so the hypothesis goes, was transcribed in error by Lucas J. Waghenaer in his 1592 charts without the trailing r and with a full stop after the S, creating S.Kilda. This was in turn assumed to stand for a saint by others, creating the form that has been used for several centuries, St Kilda.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the brain}} became more {{sophisticated}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microscope {{and the development of}} a silver staining method by Camillo Golgi during the 1870s. This was able to show the intricate structures of single neurons. This was used by Santiago Ramón y Cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine, the then revolutionary hypothesis that the neuron is the functional unit {{of the brain}}. He used microscopy to uncover many cell types, and proposed functions for the cells he saw. For this, Golgi and Cajal are considered the founders of twentieth century neuroscience, both sharing the Nobel prize in 1906 for their studies and discoveries in this field.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{original}} Mass Effect, where weapons overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods, {{the weapons of}} Mass Effect 2 have a finite magazine and must be reloaded after {{a certain number of}} shots. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a damage-absorbing shield. When the shield is fully depleted, further damage reduces the hit points of a secondary health meter. Both the shield bar and health meter automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. The player can revive fallen squad members <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unity power. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{for human}} {{occupation}} of the Zagros reaches back into the Lower Palaeolithic, {{as evidenced by the}} discovery of many cave-sites dating to that period in the Iranian part of the mountain range. Middle Palaeolithic stone tool assemblages are known from Barda Balka, a cave-site south of the Little Zab; and from the Iranian Zagros. A Mousterian stone tool assemblage – produced by either Neanderthals or anatomically modern humans – was recently excavated in Arbil. Neanderthals also occupied the site of Shanidar. This cave-site, located in the Sapna Valley, has yielded a settlement sequence stretching from the Middle Palaeolithic up to the Epipalaeolithic period. The site is particularly well known for its Neanderthal burials. The Epipalaeolithic occupation of Shanidar, contemporary <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kebaran stone tool assemblage, is the oldest evidence for anatomically modern human {{occupation of the}} Great Zab basin. The following Protoneolithic, or Natufian, occupation is contemporary with the oldest occupation of the nearby open-air site Zawi Chemi Shanidar. M'lefaat on the Khazir River (a tributary to the Great Zab) was a small village of hunter-gatherers dating to the 10th millennium BCE that was contemporary with the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A in the Levant. An archaeological survey of the Citadel of Arbil, in the plain south of the lower course of the Great Zab, has shown that this site was continuously occupied at least from the 6th millennium BCE upward.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the {{movement}} began <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hashtag #BlackLivesMatter {{on social media}} after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in {{the shooting death of}} African-American teen Trayvon Martin. Black Lives Matter became nationally recognized for its street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two African Americans: Michael Brown, resulting in protests and unrest in Ferguson, and Eric Garner in New York City. Since the Ferguson protests, participants in {{the movement}} have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the 2016 United States presidential election. The originators of the hashtag and call to action, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, expanded their project into a national network of over 30 local chapters between 2014 and 2016. The overall Black Lives Matter movement, however, is a decentralized network and has no formal hierarchy.|$|E
40|$|Background: One of {{the major}} factors that causing {{injuries}} on construction site workers is lack of workers’ com- pliance on Basic Construction Safety Rules, particularly in <b>the</b> regulatory compliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). An individual perception of workplace safety management, which includes policy, procedure and practice that can potentially inﬂuence the individual safety behavior at the workplace is called safety climate. This study aimed {{to examine the relationship}} between safety climate and construction workers’ and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> personal protective equipment (PPE). Method: Participants of this research were 185 construc- tion workers at Taman Sari Hive Ofﬁce Park, Jakarta. Data were obtained using purposive sampling technique. We used Safety Climate Scale and Compliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> PPE Scale to collect the data. Results: Simple regression analysis showed that safety climate was positively associated <b>with</b> compliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> PPE (r = 63; p < 001).

5|$|Kazamatsuri is {{the setting}} for a secret war being waged by two main groups: Gaia and Guardian. Gaia, an {{organization}} {{under the auspices of}} the environmental conservation group Martel, is populated by nihilistic and misanthropic people able to contract with familiars, which manifest as constructs fueled by the summoner's life force. Martel itself used to be a church and contains within it a holy maiden group of girls with developmental disabilities. Guardian is dedicated to the destruction of familiars and is composed almost entirely of humans who possess special powers. Gaia and Guardian came to Kazamatsuri in the pursuit of the Earth's familiar named Kagari, who manifests as a young, high school age-looking girl. Kagari, the main heroine of Rewrite, has the power to initiate a period of re-evolution, which restarts the process of evolving another means of intelligent life. However, this is done <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth's energy, and by the time the events of Rewrite occur, there is no more energy left to do another re-evolution. Gaia wants to capture Kagari to ensure the destruction of humanity, but Guardian wishes to seek out Kagari to kill her, ensuring that human life continues.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 2001, Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to the ISS, {{bringing}} the five American crew members of STS-98 temporarily to the station. The mission was originally planned for mid-January, but was delayed due to NASA's concerns about some cables on the shuttles. This mission brought the U.S. built Destiny laboratory, {{which has a}} mass of 16 short tons. It was installed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shuttle's robotic Canadarm, controlled by Marsha Ivins. Astronauts Thomas D. Jones and Robert L. Curbeam helped with the installation during a spacewalk. The Destiny module had a cost of US$1.4billion, and would be used primarily for scientific research. During the spacewalk an ammonia coolant leak created a contamination scare, which happened when Curbeam was hooking up coolant lines to Destiny. The other two spacewalks went ahead without any problems. While the Shuttle was docked, {{the control of the}} station's orientation was switched from propellants to electrically powered gyroscopes, which had been installed in September 2000. The gyroscopes had not been used earlier {{due to the lack of}} key navigational electronics.|$|E
5|$|Uxbridge Football Club was {{provided}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station stadium from 1923 and played evening matches there. Ten barrack blocks designed by A. Gilpin were {{built around the}} parade ground in 1925, as was the RAF officers' hospital and the original Operations Room, controlled by the Fighting Area of Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB). The Air Ministry chose RAF Uxbridge as the new base for ADGB on 14 January 1926 owing to its proximity to Whitehall. The site had the added advantage of lying {{on the fringes of}} London and therefore difficult for an enemy to locate and bomb. Having also housed a gymnasium, the lecture hall building became the station cinema in 1927, initially for the use of station personnel only but soon opened to the general public. On 1 March 1929, the headquarters of the Observer Corps was established at Hillingdon House; Air Commodore Edward Masterman was appointed its first commandant. The Observer Corps remained at RAF Uxbridge until 1 March 1936, when it transferred to RAF Bentley Priory.|$|E

40|$|Previous research, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{cross-sectional}} data, generally found {{support for}} the uncertainty theory. To {{assess the impact of}} uncertainty on religiosity more precisely, this study examined this theory <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> longitudinal panel data. We investigated to what extent increasing individual economic and existential uncertainty enhances someone‟s religiosity. Additionally, we examined to what extent these personal uncertainties affect the different dimensions of religiosity, in this study operationalized as religious participation and religious beliefs. A fixed-effect panel model of Dutch data retrieved from the LISS panel (2007 – 2014), showed that changes in uncertain personal conditions, both economic and existential, do not influence a person‟s religious participation or religious beliefs. Thus, although we also found some evidence for <b>the</b> uncertainty theory <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a cross-sectional design, investigating this theory <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a longitudinal design did not provide us with any {{support for the}} uncertainty theory...|$|R

5|$|Weapons {{range from}} pistols to shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. Although {{all of them}} have {{unlimited}} ammunition, they overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. In addition, the player can use grenades which latch onto targets or flat surfaces to be remotely detonated. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a health bar and damage-absorbing shields. The health bar only takes damage once the shields have been destroyed, but environmental hazards like heat or toxic agents may directly affect the health bar if they are not negated entirely by wearing appropriate armor. The health bar can be restored with the use of items called Medi-gels, while shields automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. Some talents and equipment items can improve the healing rate or shield regeneration. The player can revive fallen squad members <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unity talent. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.|$|E
