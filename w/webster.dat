5|$|Samuel <b>Webster</b> (1813–1872) {{was born}} in Ovenden, a small village about 2 miles from Halifax town centre. He was the eldest of seven {{brothers}} born into a Congregationalist family of the 10acre-owning farmer James <b>Webster.</b> <b>Webster</b> acquired the small Fountain Head Brewery in Ovenden Wood in 1838 when he was 25 and opened an office in Union Cross Yard, Halifax. The company bought its first public house in 1845. In 1860 he was joined in partnership by his three sons Isaac, George Henry and Samuel Green, and the firm began trading as Samuel <b>Webster</b> & Sons. Samuel <b>Webster</b> died in 1872, leaving his sons to continue the business. The firm also imported and sold wines and cigars, {{in addition to its}} brewing concerns.|$|E
5|$|<b>Webster</b> {{was born}} on 27 December 1987 in Melbourne, Victoria. Her {{grandfather}} was Warwick Wathen, who competed in the Davis Cup as a junior.

5|$|A {{declaration}} is only {{as effective}} as the willingness of a public body to abide by the court's statement of the law in it, as it is not a contempt of court to ignore a declaration. In <b>Webster</b> v. Southwark London Borough Council (1982), <b>Webster</b> was a parliamentary candidate for the National Front, a far right racial nationalist political party, who wanted to hold an election meeting in a hall owned by Southwark London Borough Council. Despite being required by provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1949 to permit <b>Webster</b> to use the hall, the local council refused to do so as it did not agree with Webster's political views. The court made a declaration that <b>Webster</b> was legally entitled to use the hall at a certain time for the purpose of his election campaign, {{on the assumption that the}} local council would obey it. Nonetheless, the local council still refused to allow <b>Webster</b> use of the hall. It was held that a declaration is not a coercive order of the court and, accordingly, refusal to comply with it is not contempt.|$|E
5|$|Another {{cause of}} revulsion against <b>Webster</b> was her attempt to {{impersonate}} Thomas. She {{had managed to}} perpetrate the impersonation for two weeks, implying that middle-class identity amounted {{to little more than}} cultivating the right demeanour and having the appropriate clothes and possessions, whether or not they had been earned. John Church, the publican whom <b>Webster</b> had attempted to implicate, was himself a former servant who had risen to lower middle-class status and earned a measure of prosperity and effective management of his pub. His commitment to bettering himself through hard work was in keeping with the ethic of the time. <b>Webster,</b> in contrast, had simply stolen her briefly-held middle-class identity.|$|E

50|$|Following {{legal action}} by Merriam, {{successive}} US courts ruled by 1908 that <b>Webster's</b> entered {{the public domain}} when the Unabridged did, in 1889. In 1917, a US court ruled that <b>Webster's</b> entered the public domain in 1834 when Noah <b>Webster's</b> 1806 dictionary's copyright lapsed. Thus, <b>Webster's</b> became a genericized trademark and others were free to use the name on their own works.|$|R
5|$|By 1880 {{the company}} had 100 tied houses. In March 1890 Samuel <b>Webster</b> & Sons became a {{registered}} company with £175,000 (£17.5million in 2010) of capital and Isaac <b>Webster,</b> Samuel's eldest son, its first chairman. In 1892 net profit was £20,000 (£2million in 2010). In 1896 the company took over H & T T Ormerod of Brighouse, West Yorkshire which could trace its origins back to 1760. Isaac <b>Webster</b> died in 1899, leaving an estate of £87,454 (£9million). By 1900 the company's office had moved to 57 Northgate, Halifax.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of September3, 2007, a malicious fire was set {{in the base of}} the <b>Webster</b> Sycamore's trunk. The fire burned up through the hollow center of the tree's hollow bole. The <b>Webster</b> Springs Fire Department, <b>Webster</b> County Sheriff's Department, and the West Virginia Division of Forestry provided a joint response to the fire, and remained on the scene for several hours until the flames were out. The tree survived the blaze but suffered irreparable damage.|$|E
5|$|Once it {{appeared}} certain that Ryan would run, and win {{an overwhelming majority}} of the caucus's votes, Boehner rescheduled the Republican caucus vote for October 28. Ryan won the nomination, defeating <b>Webster</b> 200 to 43 in the secret ballot voting. Blackburn and McCarthy each received one vote. The next day, <b>Webster</b> reportedly urged Republicans to vote for Ryan instead of him.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the late}} 19th century, {{dictionaries}} bearing the name <b>Webster's</b> {{have been published}} by companies other than Merriam-Webster. Some of these were unauthorized reprints of Noah <b>Webster's</b> work; some were revisions of his work. One such revision was <b>Webster's</b> Imperial Dictionary, based on John Ogilvie's The Imperial Dictionary of the English Language, itself an expansion of Noah <b>Webster's</b> American Dictionary.|$|R

McHenry transferred in 1975 to G. & C. Merriam Co.

5|$|The <b>Webster</b> Sycamore {{had long}} been a local {{landmark}} on account of its age and size, and was known locally as being the world's largest American sycamore.

5000|$|Worcester's first edited {{dictionary}} was an abridgment of Samuel Johnson's English Dictionary, as Improved by Todd, and Abridged by Chalmers; with Walker's Pronouncing Dictionary Combined, {{published in}} the United States in 1827, the year before Noah <b>Webster's</b> American Dictionary appeared. Having worked as an assistant on the production of <b>Webster's</b> dictionary, he produced an abridgment of <b>Webster's</b> work in 1829. Worcester believed that <b>Webster's</b> dictionary sacrificed tradition and elegance. Worcester's version added new words, excluded etymology, and focused on pronunciation.|$|R

50|$|Critics {{generally}} {{agree that}} Dekker's hand is dominant in Westward Ho, while <b>Webster's</b> is the minority contribution; {{but they have}} disagreed on particulars. Peter Murray estimated <b>Webster's</b> share at roughly 40% of the whole. Scholars have tended to see <b>Webster's</b> hand most clearly in Act I (especially scene i) and Act III (especially scene iii).|$|R
5|$|A {{month after}} Letcher signed the treaty, Clayton was {{replaced}} as Secretary of State by Daniel <b>Webster.</b> In response to concerns raised {{by one of}} the Americans hoping to construct the line of transit, <b>Webster</b> asked that Letcher attempt to obtain certain modifications to the treaty. Letcher brought these modifications to the Mexican diplomats, but they steadfastly refused to accept them. Letcher, speaking with the blessing of the administration, intimated that the United States would take the region by force if the requested concessions were not made. The Mexican government conceded {{that they would not be}} able to resist such action, but still refused to accept the modifications to the treaty.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} damning {{piece of}} evidence came from a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden who told the court that <b>Webster</b> had visited her {{a week before the}} murder and had said {{that she was going to}} Birmingham to sell some property, jewellery and a house that her aunt had left her. The jury interpreted this as a sign that <b>Webster</b> had premeditated the murder and convicted her after deliberating for about an hour and a quarter.|$|E

50|$|Lepore (2008) {{demonstrates}} <b>Webster's</b> innovative {{ideas about}} language and politics and shows why <b>Webster's</b> endeavours were at first so poorly received. Culturally conservative Federalists denounced {{the work as}} radical—too inclusive in its lexicon and even bordering on vulgar. Meanwhile, <b>Webster's</b> old foes, the Jeffersonian Republicans, attacked the man, labelling him mad for such an undertaking.|$|R

5|$|By 1978, the {{frontage}} roads between Five Mile Line Road and NY250 in <b>Webster</b> were completed.

5000|$|<b>Webster's</b> {{dictionaries}} were a {{redefinition of}} Americanism {{within the context}} of an emergent and unstable American socio-political and cultural identity. <b>Webster's</b> identification of his project as a [...] "federal language" [...] shows his competing impulses towards regularity and innovation in historical terms. Perhaps the contradictions of <b>Webster's</b> project represented a part of a larger dialectical play between liberty and order within Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary political debates.|$|R
