In a word, if thou {{live and}} die under that covenant, Jesus Christ will neither pray for thee, neither let thee have one drop of His blood to wash away thy sins, neither shalt thou be so much {{as one of the}} least in the Kingdom of Heaven; for all these {{privileges}} come to souls under another covenant, as the Apostle saith--"For such are not under the law, but under grace"--that is, such as have a share in the benefits of Jesus Christ, or such as are brought from under the first covenant into the second; or from under the law into the grace of Christ's Gospel, without which Covenant of Grace, and being found in that, there is no soul can have the least hope of eternal life, no joy in the Holy Ghost, no share in the privileges of saints, because they are tied up from them by the limits and bonds of the Covenant of <b>Works.</b> <b>For</b> <b>you</b> must understand that these two covenants have their several bounds and limitations, for the ruling and keeping in subjection, or giving of freedom, to the parties under the said covenants. Now they that are under the law are within the compass and the jurisdiction of that, and are bound to be in subjection to that; and living and dying under that, they must stand and fall to that, as Paul saith, [...] "To his own master he standeth or falleth." [...] The Covenant of Grace doth admit to those that are under it also liberty and freedom, together with commanding of subjection to the things contained in it, which I shall speak to further hereafter.

Unlike the original film, however, her character is in an interracial relationship with a caucasian man. Long was revealed to have pursuing an interracial relationship in the film and explained: [...] "We're living in a modern world where it happens and it's OK and it's no disrespect to any black man. I love black men, {{but the reality is}} the sistahs are marrying white men and the brothas are marrying white women and that's the world that we live in and it's not to be judged, and if it <b>works</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> then embrace it". Director Malcolm D. Lee also supported the interracial relationship being portrayed in the film. [...] "African-American women who are extremely successful can't always find black male counterparts on that level so it's {{a little bit of a}} reflection of reality that black women are starting to date outside their race — and why not?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Myers {{asks how}} DeLillo's theme of [...] "Life in Consumerland" [...] {{can still be}} {{considered}} edgy {{after it has been}} explored in literature for fifty years. He points out that much of DeLillo's writing consists of long [...] "shopping lists" [...] of brand name consumer items. Myers also criticizes DeLillo's development of characters who [...] "routinely talk and act like visitors from another planet." [...] Myers asserts that DeLillo's characters serve primarily as vessels for DeLillo's thoughts, rather than as discrete characters. DeLillo, according to Myers, attempts to persuade his readers that if something does not make sense it is [...] "over their heads," [...] or that [...] "something as inadequate as language can never do justice to the complexity of what they're trying to say." [...] But Myers also points out that DeLillo uses a slippery sense of irony in his writing: [...] "As so often with DeLillo's musings, the 'conclusion' is phrased as a rhetorical question. 'If this <b>works</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> take it,' he is saying, 'but if you think it's silly, hey - maybe I do too.'" ...|$|E
