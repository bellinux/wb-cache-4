40|$|Loading of bulk {{materials}} like iron ore, coal, fertilizers, grains into ships for transportation by sea {{is done by}} ship loaders. Ship loaders are a very common sight in ports and jetties from where {{bulk materials}} are exported. It mainly consists of an extendable boom, a belt conveyor and a mobile structure to support the boom. It is usually mounted on rails and sometimes on tires and can move {{in order to be}} able to reach the whole length of the ship. The boom also can move front and back (boom telescoping), up and down (luffing) by separate drives so that it can fill all the corners of the ship hatches. Ship loaders are built in capacities from 1000 to 15000 TPH (tones per hour). The height of a ship loader can be in excess of 20 meters and the boom can extend to a length of more than 60 meters. Arc type of ship loaders are usually mounted on a pair of rails that are parallel to the berth and the ship. This type of ship loader can perform operations like long travel, luffing and slewing movement of the boom to reach maximum portions the ship hatch area. This type of ship loaders are less common in present day ports as it cannot load material to all portions of the ship hatches, requires huge berth construction work and more number of conveyors A Linear ship loader is usually mounted on a pair of rails that are parallel to the berth and the ship. This type of ship loader can perform operations like long travel, luffing and telescopic movement of the boom to reach all portions of the ship hatch. We propose a machine called radial ship loader which is capable of loading 1000 ’s of tons of bulk material in to ships and can considerably reduce civil <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>berth,</b> power consumption and number of conveyors required for operatio...|$|R
