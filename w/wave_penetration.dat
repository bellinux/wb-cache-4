These boundary conditions are needed during a storm with return period 1000 yrs and during the super storms which were defined in the risk analysis study. The modelling of the extreme wave climate is decoupled to the <b>wave</b> <b>penetration</b> and the lacal generation of waves by the extreme wind speed. The <b>wave</b> <b>penetration</b> is modelled with Mike 21 BW as was done for Oostende and Zeebrugge. MILDwave is not used this time because non-linear effects (e. g. long wave generation, wave setup) are too important in this case. Instead another nonlinear model SWASH is applied. The modelling of local generation of waves by wind is still done with the spectral model SWAN. First the bathymetry files are created based on the dredging plan of Blankenberge marina, and all the suitable settings used for the Mike 21 BW and the SWASH are investigated. Since SWASH model does not have so much application examples, Wenduine physical model is used to validate the model. Consequently, a sensitivity analysis is conducted for both models to study which parameter {{is important for the}} wave climate inside the marina.

40|$|Wave climates in ports can {{determine}} the efficiency of port operations to a large extent, so good predictions of them are important. This thesis therefore focusses on the modelling of <b>wave</b> <b>penetration</b> in ports, using several numerical models {{as well as a}} physical model. The goal is to compare numerical wave models for the use of <b>wave</b> <b>penetration</b> in ports and to determine application boundaries. An overview of existing classes of numerical wave models and their potential for modelling <b>wave</b> <b>penetration</b> in ports is made first. This leads to the conclusion that mild-slope models, Boussinesq-type models and non-hydrostatic models are probably the most appropriate. From each of these model classes an operational model is chosen (i. e. PHAROS, TRITON and SWASH) for further study. It is demonstrated that these models are all capable of accurately reproducing analytical solutions for linear shoaling and diffraction. These two wave processes are, together with reflection, identified as crucial for wave propagation in harbours. Differences between these models are pointed out as well. Most notable are the differences in underlying equations, schematisations of boundaries and computational efficiency. To be able to study the performance of operational numerical models for <b>wave</b> <b>penetration</b> in ports, in scenarios that are more realistic than analytical benchmark test cases, measurements from a physical model are used. The physical model represents a typical seaport, is schematised to facilitate numerical modelling, uses three layouts with increasing complexity, and is subjected to a large variety of wave conditions. The physical modelling is carried out at Deltares in the framework of one of their projects and the produced dataset will become freely available. A selection of the 57 scale model tests are analysed in detail and numerically simulated using PHAROS, TRITON and SWASH. A comparison between the simulation results and the corresponding physical model measurements shows that TRITON and SWASH are capable of modelling the penetration of primary waves in ports. PHAROS simulations are less accurate and appear to overestimate wave heights in areas sheltered from direct wave attack, which is ascribed to its specific use of reflection boundaries. Wave conditions with very large wave height over depth ratios (up to 0. 5), where wave breaking is significant, can still be simulated accurately with both PHAROS and SWASH. TRITON could not be used to simulate these wave conditions due to numerical instabilities. The total amount of low frequency wave energy modelled by TRITON and SWASH corresponds well with measurements from the physical model (for PHAROS this comparison is not made). Specific harbour oscillations are however only reproduced qualitatively by all three numerical models. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
