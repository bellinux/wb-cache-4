25|$|Examples of {{surgical}} procedures for cancer include mastectomy for breast cancer, prostatectomy for prostate cancer, and lung cancer surgery for non-small cell lung cancer. The {{goal of the}} surgery can be either the removal of only the tumor, or the entire organ. A single cancer cell is invisible {{to the naked eye}} but can regrow into a new tumor, a process called recurrence. For this reason, the pathologist <b>will</b> <b>examine</b> the surgical specimen to determine if a margin of healthy tissue is present, thus decreasing the chance that microscopic cancer cells are left in the patient.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic {{programming}} algorithms {{are often}} used for optimization. A dynamic programming algorithm <b>will</b> <b>examine</b> the previously solved subproblems and will combine their solutions to give the best solution for the given problem. In comparison, a greedy algorithm treats the solution as some sequence of steps and picks the locally optimal choice at each step. Using a greedy algorithm does not guarantee an optimal solution, because picking locally optimal choices {{may result in a}} bad global solution, but it is often faster to calculate. Some greedy algorithms (such as Kruskal's or Prim's for minimum spanning trees) are however proven to lead to the optimal solution.|$|E

25|$|If {{heart failure}} ensues after a {{myocardial}} infarction due to scarring and aneurysm formation, reconstructive surgery {{may be an}} option. These aneurysms bulge with every contraction, making it inefficient. Cooley and coworkers reported the first surgical treatment of a left ventricular aneurysm in 1958. They used a linear closure after their excision. In the 1980s, Vincent Dor developed a method using a circular patch stitched {{to the inside of}} the ventricle (the endoventricular circular patch plasty or Dor procedure) to close the defect after excision. Dor's approach has been modified by others and is today the preferred method for surgical treatment of incorrectly contracting (dyskinetic) left ventricle tissue, although a linear closure technique combined with septoplasty might be equally effective. The multicenter RESTORE trial of 1198 participants demonstrated an increase in ejection fraction from about 30% to 40% with a concomitant shift in NYHA classes, with an early mortality of 5% and a 5-year survival of 70%. It remains unknown if surgery is superior to optimal medical therapy. The STICH trial (Surgical Treatment for IschemiC Heart Failure) <b>will</b> <b>examine</b> the role of medical treatment, coronary artery bypass surgery and left ventricle remodeling surgery in heart failure patients. Results are expected to be published in 2009 and 2011.|$|E
500|$|It {{is unknown}} if the Astronomica is a {{finished}} work, and {{this issue is}} further complicated {{by the presence of}} a large lacuna between lines 5.709 and 5.710. According to Housman, it is impossible to cast a full horoscope based on the information provided in the Astronomica, as necessary informationsuch as an in-depth treatment of the planets, as well as the effects that constellations (both inside and outside the zodiac) produce upon their settingis missing. The lack of a lengthy consideration of the planets is rather puzzling, as Manilius claims several times that he <b>will</b> <b>examine</b> their zodiacal nature. Goold, noting that [...] "a didactic poem is seldom an exhaustive treatise", argues that Manilius likely gave a [...] "perfunctory account of the planets' natures in the great lacuna [...] considered his obligations duly discharged".|$|E
