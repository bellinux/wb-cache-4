25|$|Unger sees four {{flaws in}} the human condition. They are, our {{mortality}} and the facing of imminent death; our groundlessness in that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> grasp {{the solution to the}} enigma of existence, see the beginning or end of time, nor put off the discovery of the meaning of life; our insatiability in that we always want more, and demand the infinite from the finite; and our susceptibility to belittlement which places us in a position to constantly confront petty routine forcing us to die many little deaths.|$|E
25|$|In one Native North American story, an evil serpent kills {{one of the}} gods' cousins, so the god {{kills the}} serpent in revenge, but the dying serpent unleashes a great flood. People first flee to the {{mountains}} and then, when the mountains are covered, they float on a raft until the flood subsides. The evil spirits that the serpent god controlled then hide out of fear. The Mound Builders associated great mystical value to the serpent, as the Serpent Mound demonstrates, though <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> unravel the particular associations.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit {{this world of}} the understanding. He also stresses that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> make interesting positive claims about it {{because we are not}} able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could {{have anything to say about}} practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have to be careful not to get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E

25|$|Beginning at latest {{with the}} Seljuq invasions of Anatolia and northwestern Persia, a {{distinct}} Turko-Persian tradition emerged. Fragments of woven carpets {{were found in}} the Alâeddin Mosque in the Turkish town of Konya and the Eşrefoğlu Mosque in Beyşehir, and were dated to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243–1302). More fragments were found in Fostat, today a suburb of the city of Cairo. These fragments at least give us an idea how Seluq carpets may have looked. The Egyptian findings also provide evidence for export trade. If, and how, these carpets influenced Persian carpet weaving, remains unknown, as no distinct Persian carpets are known to exist from this period, or <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> identify them. It was assumed by Western scholars that the Sejuqs may have introduced at least new design traditions, if not the craft of pile weaving itself, to Persia, where skilled artisans and craftsmen might have integrated new ideas into their old traditions.|$|E
25|$|Religion, Unger argues, is {{a vision}} of the world within which we anchor our {{orientation}} to life. It is within this orientation that we deal with our greatest terrors and highest hopes. Because we are doomed to die, we hope for eternal life; because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> grasp to totality of existence or of the universe, we try to dispel the mystery and provide a comprehensible explanation; because we have an insatiable desire, we cry for an object that is worthy of this desire, one that is infinite. Humans initially invested religious discourse in nature and the human susceptibility to nature. But as societies evolved and people developed ways to cope with the unpredictability of nature, the emphasis of religion shifted to social existence and its defects. A new moment in religion will begin, Unger argues, when we stop telling ourselves that all will be fine and we begin to face the incorrigible flaws in human existence. The future of religion lies in embracing our mortality and our groundlessness.|$|E

500|$|The novel {{revolves}} around a {{central theme of}} language—written and spoken, truth and myth—and the power inherent {{in all of its}} forms, a power that is often only present in the deconstruction of communication. González Echevarria argues that [...] "Dr. Francia's fear of the pasquinade, his abuse of [...] his constant worry about writing all stem from {{the fact that he has}} found and used the power implicit in language itself. The Supreme defines power as being able to do through others what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> do ourselves: language, being separate from what it designates, is the very embodiment of power, for things act and mean through it without ceasing to be themselves. Dr. Francia has also realized that he cannot control language, particularly written language, that it has a life of its own that threatens him." ...|$|E
500|$|José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, {{also known}} as [...] "Dr. Francia", Karaí-Guasú ("Great Lord" [...] in Guaraní), or [...] "the Supreme", is the book's titular {{character}} and also undoubtedly its main focus. Most {{of the book is}} dedicated to his dictates to his secretary, Patiño. The Supreme is a domineering man, frequently belittling his closest confidant. He is also an infirm man, as the book is set a short time before his death on September 20, 1840. Roa Bastos's portrayal of him walks the line between praise and condemnation. While other authors of dictator novels clearly present their dictators as villains, Roa Bastos makes it unclear as to whether he is defending him or not. As Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria writes, the Supreme is [...] "constant [...] about writing. [...] {{stems from the fact that}} he has found and used the power implicit in language itself. The Supreme defines power as being able to do through others what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> do ourselves: language, being separate from what it designates, is the very embodiment of power." ...|$|E
500|$|The brief [...] "Sea Song" [...] of 1907 was {{an early}} attempt by Grainger to write [...] "beatless" [...] music. This work, {{initially}} set over 14 irregular bars and occupying about 15 seconds of performing time, was a forerunner of Grainger's free-music experiments of the 1930s. Grainger wrote: [...] "It seems to me absurd {{to live in an}} age of flying, and yet not be able to execute tonal glides and curves". The idea of tonal freedom, he said, had been in his head since as a boy of eleven or twelve he had observed the wave-movements in the sea. [...] "Out in nature we hear all kinds of lovely and touching [...] "free" [...] (non-harmonic) combinations of tones; yet <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> take up these beauties... into the art of music because of our archaic notions of harmony." [...] In a 1941 letter to Scott, Grainger acknowledged that he had failed to produce any large-scale works {{in the manner of a}} Bach oratorio, a Wagner opera or a Brahms symphony, but excused this failure on the grounds that all his works before the mid-1930s had been mere preparations for his free music.|$|E

500|$|A {{predominant}} {{theme of}} the dictator novel is power, which according literary critic Michael Valdez Moses, in his 2002 review of Feast of the Goat, {{is linked to the}} theme of dictatorship: [...] "The enduring power of the Latin American dictator novel had {{everything to do with the}} enduring power of Latin American dictators". As novels such as El Señor Presidente became more well-known, they were read as ambitious political statements, denouncing the authority of dictators in Latin America. As political statements, dictator novel authors challenged dictatorial power, creating a link between power and writing through the force wielded by their pen. For example, in Roa Bastos's I, The Supreme, the novel revolves around a central theme of language and the power inherent in all of its forms, a power that is often only present in the deconstruction of communication. González Echevarría argues that: Dr. Francia's fear of the pasquinade, his abuse of Policarpo Patiño ..., [...] his constant worry about writing all stem from the fact that he has found and used the power implicit in language itself. The Supremo defines power as being able to do through others what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> do ourselves: language, being separate from what it designates, is the very embodiment of power, for things act and mean through it without ceasing to be themselves. Dr. Francia has also realized that he cannot control language, particularly written language, that it has a life of its own that threatens him.|$|E
500|$|A {{writer for}} Disney.com observed, [...] "The creepiness of this song {{lies in the}} fact that the very untrustworthy Mother Gothel is {{positioning}} herself as a helpful figure to Rapunzel." [...] Brian Galindo of BuzzFeed wrote that the song, its purpose having been summarized by Curt Holman of Creative Loafing as [...] "simply to manipulate Rapunzel into staying at home," [...] "perfectly disguises Mother Gothel's true motives." [...] According to Simon Miraudo of Quickflix, Gothel craftily uses the song to guilt trip Rapunzel [...] "into staying in the tower ... frightened into imagining the horrors that lay outside her door." [...] In her book How Fairy Tales Live Happily Ever After: (Analyzing) the Art of Adapting Fairy Tales, author Conny Eisfeld observed that [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] emphasizes Gothel's [...] "status of superiority", in spite of the fact that [...] "her existence solely depend on Rapunzel." [...] Bitch identified Gothel as an abusive mother, writing, [...] "she is manipulative, dishonest, and dedicated to undermining her daughter's independence. This is shown consistently through all her appearances in the film, but comes out clearly very early indeed, with the song 'Mother Knows Best'. Critics have often identified the sequence as one of the film's darkest and edgiest moments. Acknowledging the song's [...] "extremely dark undertone", Anthony Falco of Film Class Junkies wrote, [...] "This song rues in the fact that a child is impressionable; Rapunzel believes that Mother Gothel has the best intentions, but obviously, the evil witch is using the princess for her own gains. Falco continued, [...] "The audience knows what Gothel wants with Rapunzel, but the fact that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> protect the naïve princess results in further hatred for the witch." [...] Falco also concluded that Gothel's [...] "sinister reprise at the end of Tangled allows for these horrifying undertones to emerge, which makes 'Mother Knows Best' one of the most sinister villain songs in the Disney library." [...] Similarly, Elissa Smith of Paper Droids wrote that while the audience is fully aware of Gothel's evil intentions, Rapunzel is denied [...] "the outsider's point of view." [...] Glen Chapman of Den of Geek wrote that the scene [...] "strikes a balance between melodic and narrative sophistication, as well as being equal parts sweet and sinister." [...] Gothel later reprises the song [...] "in indelible fashion." ...|$|E
