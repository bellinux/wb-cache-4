40|$|Background: Vietnam has {{undergone}} a rapid transition in the past 20 years, moving towards a more equal situation for men and women. However, Confucian doctrine is still strong and {{little is known about}} men s violence against women within the Vietnamese family. Aim: To improve knowledge of intimate partner violence (IPV) in a Vietnamese context, by focusing on professionals and trusted community inhabitants explanations of the violence and their suggestions for preventive activities. Further, to present data on prevalence, risk factors and health effects and to suggest appropriate intervention and prevention activities. Method: Qualitative and quantitative data were collected in the rural district, Ba Vi in northern Vietnam in 2002. Five focus group discussions were held and face-to-face interviews following a questionnaire developed by WHO for violence research were performed. In the epidemiological part, 883 married/partnered women aged 17 60 were included. Bi- and multivariate analyses were undertaken, with effect modification analyses and calculation of attributable fractions and population attributable fractions. Main findings: In the explorative qualitative study, intimate partner violence was explained as interplay between individual and family-related factors and socio-cultural norms and practices where Confucian ideology exerted a strong influence (paper I). It further revealed that IPV was rarely discussed openly in the community and women subjected to violence kept silent. The epidemiological study revealed that out of the 883 married/partnered women, 30. 9 % had been subjected to physical violence in their lifetime, and 8. 3 % in the preceding year. For the combined exposure to physical and sexual violence, the corresponding figures were 32. 7 % and 9. 2 %. The most commonly occurring form was psychological abuse (lifetime 55. 4 %; past year 33. 7 %). Lifetime experience of sexual violence was reported by 6. 6 % of the women, and by 2. 2 % for previous year exposure. In the majority of cases, the violence was exerted as repeated acts (paper II). The risk factors found for lifetime and past year physical/sexual violence were women s low education, husbands low education, low household income and male polygamy. The pattern of factors associated with psychological abuse alone were husband s low professional status and women s intermediate level of education (paper II). Women who witnessed interparental violence during childhood {{were significantly more likely to}} report experience of physical and sexual intimate partner violence in their own relationship at adult age and they also displayed a more tolerant attitude towards violence (paper III). When health effects were investigated, itwas found that physical and sexual violence caused chronic pain, injuries and serious mental health problems such as sadness/depression and suicidal thoughts in exposed women (Paper IV). Conclusions: IPV is commonly occurring in rural Vietnam, more so among the low educated and in poorer households. Violence perpetration is a serious violation of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> that causes long-term suffering in exposed women. These findings call for legal and policy actions. Collaboration between the health sector and other bodies at all levels, and with community leaders as spokesmen would help to improve openness and reduce society s tolerance of violence against women...|$|E

In researching this topic I found a number of policy changes that the U.

Overall, I found that the changes in U. <b>S.</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> policy during the 'war on terror' have had a negative impact on U. S. alliances abroad as well as other members within the international arena. I looked at statistical evidence of the chasm between the U. S. and other countries. I examined polls, which demonstrates a shift in international opinion of the U. S. post 9 / 11. Furthermore, I examined specific instances of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> abuses as well as policy decisions that indicated a shift in U.

40|$|By {{the turn}} of the twenty-first century, sexual {{violence}} had become the primary framework for women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights.</b> In ways that would have been inconceivable fifty years earlier, the sexually violated woman had become the ultimate casualty of global patriarchy, and the predominant way in which women were seen as victims of armed and political conflict. On the one hand, women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> challenged the public-private divide and extended <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> protections to non-state actors in the private sphere. On the other hand, the movement brokered women 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to the state through the lens of violence, making them politically visible as victims in ways that ultimately curtailed their access to <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> aid. ^ Becoming Sexual Subjects explores the creation of America 2 ̆ 7 s global platform on women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights.</b> Specifically, it traces how women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> were made legally and politically meaningful within a globally focused United States. Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> gained political salience precisely as refugee, asylum, and other forms of state-based humanitarianism were in decline. The expansion of women 2 ̆ 7 s rights into the political realm of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> thus required new metrics for policing the boundaries of state responsibility, as the United States sought to expand its rhetorical but limit its material commitment to aid. ^ As this dissertation argues, the criteria for assessing the credibility of claimants emerged predominantly from within the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> movement itself. Rather than rejecting the validity of gender-based persecution or challenging the disintegration of the public-private divide, policy makers sought to embed the tenets of trauma, victimization and violence directly into the law itself, in ways that ultimately circumscribed women 2 ̆ 7 s access to aid. However, these inherently subjective criteria were also subject to both legal and cultural readings in the courtrooms, interview halls and chambers where women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> were practically negotiated. The multifaceted cultural framework that judges, asylum officers and other administrators brought to bear on gender based cases also, at times, critically shifted the definition of persecution, and expanded notions of the political to include culturally, if not legally legitimate claims. ...|$|R

Therefore, it is imperative that everyone involved has a clear idea of what a collaborative strategic model is and how to use it effectively.

An important manifestation of this is the growing engagement of groups in Ireland with women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> discourses in framing feminist claims in the domestic arena and the emergence of related transnational solidarity links. This article identifies six approaches to women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> advocacy in Ireland: <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> facilitating collective action, local-global solidarity and transformation; <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> as modes of (quasi) legal accountability; <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> as a framework for social, economic and gender justice; women 2 ̆ 7 s political participation as a <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> issue; <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> as a challenge to gendered racism; and women 2 ̆ 7 s bodily integrity as a <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> issue.

40|$|The {{realisation}} of second-wave feminist activists 2 ̆ 7 {{vision to}} progress women 2 ̆ 7 s rights through their framing as <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> {{has been limited}} in Ireland due to constitutive, systemic and movement factors. These factors include - the predominant legal hegemony within human rights; - the challenges of gendering UN <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> systems; - the tensions between quasi-legal-technocratic and community-developed approaches; and - the retreat from explicit feminism during the institutionalised turn of the Irish Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Movement. The <b>Women</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> Alliance (WHRA), an explicitly feminist entity, is the instrumental case study for this qualitative investigation, which deploys observation, interview and documentary data in order to answer the Central Research Question: "In what ways do and could feminist <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> activists in Ireland develop counter-hegemonies of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> rights?" The WHRA {{grew out of the}} framing of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> as <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> in Ireland as part of the global reorientation of the women 2 ̆ 7 s movement. Through two distinct phases (2001 - 2006, and from 2007), this nationally located alliance has endeavoured to use the resources of international <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> architecture and transnational activism in order to progressively realise women 2 ̆ 7 s rights within Ireland using shadow reporting - an institutionalised mode of activism. This time period locates the research within the Social Partnership era in Ireland, which was characterised by formalised engagement by movement organisations with the reconfiguring State, and the recession from 2008 onwards. Drawing on the resources of feminist socio-legal and social movement theories, this thesis explores two central tensions within women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> activism in Ireland: between 2 ̆ 7 top-down 2 ̆ 7, quasi-legal-technocratic and 2 ̆ 7 bottom-up 2 ̆ 7, community-developed <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> activism; and between explicit and implicit feminist discourses. Recognising the persistent draw of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> for feminist activists, this thesis proposes vernacularisation as one answer to the ongoing hegemonic formulation of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and practices such as legalism. It argues that vernacularisation is an emergent approach through which women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> could be progressively realised in Ireland. Vernacularisation is understood to involve localised meaning making and movement mobilisation practices, which create counter-hegemonies of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> in the everyday by building rights consciousness and confidence, and intersectional relationships of reflective solidarity, in order to engage fully with <b>human</b> <b>rights...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this study, I examine why U.

I specifically explore this puzzle {{in the context of}} public and Congressional deliberations over U. <b>S.</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> policy toward China from 1989 to 2009. Using qualitative discourse analysis of newspaper articles and Congressional hearings and historical analysis of the changes and continuities in U. <b>S.</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> policy toward China over the course of 20 years, I analyze how participants justified their policy stances, whether or not these justifications were considered socially acceptable or unacceptable, and how this shaped what policy options were possible. I argue that advocacy for the use of sanctions for <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> promotion persists, in large part, due to the conditions of public deliberation. The findings reveal that sanctions advocacy thrives in a specific type of meaning context that constrains democratic deliberation [...] a sacred, morally polarized context. This meaning context made absolutist reasoning and authority bias acceptable, therefore, nullifying criticisms that sanctions are ineffective and unethical. In this morally polarized setting, the force of the better argument did not necessarily prevail, as deliberative democratic theorists would hope. It was not until Congressional deliberation shifted to a depolarized setting that the conditions became ripe for deliberation about other potentially more effective and more ethical approaches to <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> promotion.

The Article calls into question this view, by examining cultural stereotypes of women used to oppose U. S. ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. My reading, therefore, is at odds with the conventional understanding that U. S. failure to ratify the Convention based on constitutionalism (rather than culture). A fresh look at the ways constitutionalism has masked cultural assumptions about women is particularly urgent given recent concerns over clashes between gender and culture in the evolving constitutional frameworks of Afghanistan and Iraq.

This paper focuses on the right to abortion and the inability of feminists to generate consensus regarding that right on the international level, despite widespread agreement as to its basic importance.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes how transnational feminist {{advocacy and}} ideas about gender shaped modern <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> doctrines that remain {{central to this}} day. After World War II, United Nations delegates drafted and adopted the Universal Declaration of <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> (UDHR). During this process, international feminist activists disagreed about how to incorporate women 2 ̆ 7 s long-standing rights claims into the emerging <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> framework. Fiery interwar debates about laws and standards that regulated female labor persisted, prompting influential U. S. feminists to oppose the inclusion of gender-specific rights. To challenge U. S. opposition, key delegates to the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) forged an unofficial coalition. Despite {{the fact that these}} CSW delegates held competing ideas about gender and represented distinct national governments, they collectively crafted a significant but little-known women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> agenda and lobbied UDHR drafters to adopt it. Their proposals not only included political and civil rights, but also promoted particular economic and social rights for women as a group. They maintained, for instance, that child care and maternity leave should be obligations of the state. Indeed, the CSW insisted that recognition of their women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> agenda was essential to building a socially-just postwar order. While Anglo-American women dominated interwar NGOs, the CSW showcased myriad international voices and won critical allies among liberal and conservative UN delegations by linking the advance of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> to notions of modernity and democracy. As a result, the CSW made substantial political and civil rights gains, such as the guarantee of equal rights in marriage and divorce. Yet feminist delegates had to juggle their internationally-minded agenda with the interests they were to serve as national representatives. This task was further complicated by nascent Cold War politics and a growing anti-feminist backlash at the UN. In this context, UDHR drafters ultimately rejected the CSW 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> call for <b>women</b> 2 ̆ 7 s economic and social rights [...] a 2 ̆ 2 social revolution 2 ̆ 2 for women [...] in favor of the perceived stability of the 2 ̆ 2 traditional 2 ̆ 2 family. By the early 1950 s, anti-communist pressures led the CSW to sever the pursuit of women 2 ̆ 7 s rights from the developing <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> framework at the UN. Feminists 2 ̆ 7 absence from the UN <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> debates over the next several decades removed a forceful challenge to U. S. -led efforts to privilege political and civil rights over economic and social rights, and fostered a tacit hierarchy of rights that persists to this day. This dissertation places the CSW 2 ̆ 7 s competing vision of universal <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> {{at the center of the}} postwar <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> project, and expands our understanding of the history of international women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> activism and <b>human</b> <b>rights.</b> By analyzing official UN records, delegates 2 ̆ 7 papers and memoirs, and the records of governmental and non-governmental organizations, it reveals that postwar <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> advocacy was critically shaped by women 2 ̆ 7 s activism of the interwar period. Furthermore, this dissertation demonstrates that the CSW 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> demands for <b>women</b> 2 ̆ 7 s rights shaped the context from which the universal <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> framework emerged. Indeed, feminist activism and debates about the rights of women influenced UDHR drafters 2 ̆ 7 views about <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> in ways that expanded, but also significantly curtailed postwar <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> standards. As a result, feminist activists continue to fight today for full recognition of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> as <b>human</b> <b>rights...</b>|$|R

This Essay also argues that national allegiance and globalization cannot stand together. Today, national allegiance is an anachronism and simply wrong. In the past, it was, in many cases, considered a virtue and resulted often in the highest individual self-sacrifice for the common good. <b>Human</b> <b>rights</b> to globalization, it is argued, entail at least the following rights: to international security; to trade across national borders; to non-partisan dispute settlement that is incorporated across borders; to free movement of persons across borders; and to hold dual or multiple nationality...|$|R
