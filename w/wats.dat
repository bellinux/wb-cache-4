25|$|Two monastic orders {{constituted}} the clergy in Cambodia. The larger group, to {{which more than}} 90 percent of the clergy belonged, was the Mohanikay. The Thommayut order was far smaller. The Thommayut was introduced into the ruling circles of Cambodia from Thailand in 1864; it gained prestige because of its adoption by royalty and by the aristocracy, but its adherents were confined geographically to the Phnom Penh area. Among the few {{differences between the two}} orders is stricter observance by the Thommayut bhikkhus (monks) of the rules governing the clergy. In 1961 the Mohanikay had more than 52,000 ordained monks in some 2,700 <b>wats,</b> whereas the Thommayut order had 1,460 monks in just over 100 <b>wats.</b> In 1967 more than 2,800 Mohanikay <b>wats</b> and 320 Thommayut <b>wats</b> were in existence in Cambodia. After Phnom Penh, the largest number of Thommayut <b>wats</b> were found in Batdambang, Stoeng Treng, Prey Veng, Kampot, and Kampong Thum provinces.|$|E

25|$|Buddhism {{is still}} strong {{among the various}} Cambodian refugee groups {{throughout}} the world, although some younger monks, faced with the distractions of a foreign culture, have chosen to leave the clergy and have become laicized. In the United States in 1984, there were twelve Cambodian <b>wats</b> with about twenty-one monks.

2500|$|According to Michael Vickery, who {{has written}} {{positively}} about the People's Republic of Kampuchea, public observance of Buddhism and of Islam was reestablished, and government policies allowed Cambodians freedom to believe or not to believe in Buddhism. Vickery cites some differences in this reestablished Buddhism: Religious affairs were overseen by the PRK's Kampuchean (or Khmer) United Front for National Construction and Defense (KUFNCD), the mass organization that supported the state by organizing women, youths, workers, and religious groups. In 1987 {{there was only a}} single Buddhist order because the Thommayut order had not been revived. The organization of the clergy also had been simplified. The sangharaja (primate of the Buddhist clergy) had been replaced by a prathean (chairman). Communities that wanted <b>wats</b> had to apply to a local front committee for permission. The wat were administered by a committee of the local laity. Private funds paid for the restoration of the <b>wats</b> damaged during the war and the Khmer Rouge era, and they supported the restored <b>wats.</b> Monks were ordained by a hierarchy that has been reconstituted since an initial ordination in September 1979 by a delegation from the Buddhist community in Vietnam. The validity of this ordination continued to be questioned. In general, there are only two to four monks per wat, which is fewer than before 1975. In 1981 about 4,930 monks served in 740 <b>wats</b> in Cambodia. The Buddhist General Assembly reported 7,000 monks in 1,821 active <b>wats</b> a year later. In 1969 by contrast, observers estimated that 53,400 monks and 40,000 novice monks served in more than 3,000 <b>wats.</b> Vickery sums up his observations on the subject by noting that, [...] "The government has kept its promise to allow freedom for traditional Buddhism, but does not actively encourage it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martin offers another, more pessimistic, {{view of the}} {{religious}} situation in the late 1980s. In a 1986 study, she asserts that the PRK showed outsiders only certain aspects of religious freedom; she also states that the few <b>wats</b> that were restored had {{only two or three}} old monks in residence and that public attendance was low. The monks were allowed to leave the <b>wats</b> only for an hour in the mornings, to collect their food, or during holy days. Lay people who practiced their faith were about the same ages as the monks, and they were allowed to visit the <b>wats</b> only in the evenings. A government circular had also instructed civil servants to stop celebrating the traditional New Year Festival. Some traditional Buddhist festivals still were tolerated, but the state collected a 50 percent tax on donations. Martin believes that Buddhism was threatened externally by state repression and by nonsupport and internally by invalid clergy. She noted that the two Buddhist superiors, Venerable Long Chhim and Venerable Tep Vong, were both believed to be from Vietnam. Venerable Tep Vong was concurrently the superior of the Buddhist clergy, vice president of the PRK's Khmer National Assembly, {{and vice president of the}} KUFNCD National Council. She quoted a refugee from Batdambang as having said, [...] "During the meetings, the Khmer administrative authorities, accompanied by the Vietnamese experts, tell you, `Religion is like poison, it's like opium; it's better to give the money to the military, so they can fight'." ...|$|E

50|$|Laotian-American {{populations have}} {{constructed}} numerous Buddhist temples, called vat or <b>wat.</b> Usually attendees adapt {{a house for}} religious worship. Over time, the congregation donates money to customize and add on to the facility, {{as well as to}} add fine artwork and craftsmanship, resulting in a Laotian Buddhist temple that has some traditional features. Examples include <b>Wat</b> Lao Buddhavong located outside Washington, D.C.; <b>Wat</b> Lao Buddharam of San Diego, California; <b>Wat</b> Lao of S.

Johnson says the intelligence network {{was made up of}} [...] "obnoxious devotees commandeering <b>WATS</b> lines and tricking bureaucrats into giving them information."

2500|$|In 1782, King Rama I succeeded to {{the throne}} and founded the Chakri Dynasty, {{and he decided to}} move the capital across the river to Bangkok as it would be better {{protected}} from attack.

[...] Wat Phra Kaew, which has its own compound within the precinct of the palace, was built to house the Emerald Buddha, which is considered a sacred object that provides protection for the kingdom.

2500|$|He {{was born}} Nguam Phanit ( [...] ; [...] ) in 1906 in Ban Phumriang, Chaiya District, {{southern}} Thailand. His father, Sieng Phānit, was a shopkeeper of second generation Thai Chinese (Hokkien) ancestry and his mother, Klaun, was Thai. He renounced civilian life in 1926. Typical of young monks during the time, {{he traveled to}} the capital, Bangkok, for doctrinal training but found the <b>wats</b> there dirty, crowded, and, most troubling to him, the sangha corrupt, [...] "preoccupied with prestige, position, and comfort with {{little interest in the}} highest ideals of Buddhism." [...] As a result, he returned to his native rural district and occupied a forest tract near to his village. He named it Suan Mokkh from Thai [...] suan [...] "garden" [...] and Pali moksha [...] "release, liberation". He strove for a simple, pristine practice in attempt to emulate Gautama Buddha's core teaching, [...] "Do good, avoid bad, and purify the mind." [...] He therefore avoided the customary ritualism and internal politics that dominated Siamese clerical life. His ability to explain complex philosophical and religious ideas in his native Southern Thai attracted many people to his wooded retreat.|$|E
2500|$|After {{independence}} from France, young Cambodian intellectuals changed {{their attitude toward}} the clergy. In describing a general shift away from Buddhism in the late 1950s and the early 1960s, Vickery cites the early work of anthropologist May Mayko Ebihara and his own observations. He suggests that the Khmer Rouge was able to instill antireligious feelings in younger males because the latter were losing interest in becoming monks even during their teenage years, the traditional temporary period of service. The monks themselves had abandoned some of their traditional restrictions and had become involved in politics. At intervals during the colonial period, some monks had demonstrated or had rebelled against French rule, and in the 1970s monks joined pro- government demonstrations against the communists. Anticlerical feelings reached their highest point among the Khmer Rouge, who at first attempted to indoctrinate monks and {{to force them to}} pass anticlerical ideas on to the laity. Under the Khmer Rouge regime, monks were expelled forcibly from the <b>wats</b> and were compelled to do manual labor. Article 20 of the 1976 Constitution of Democratic Kampuchea permitted freedom of religion but banned all reactionary religions, that were [...] "detrimental to the country." [...] The minister of culture stated that Buddhism was incompatible with the revolution and was an instrument of exploitation. Under this regime, to quote the Finnish Inquiry Commission, [...] "The practice of religion was forbidden and the pagodas were systematically destroyed." [...] Observers estimated that 50,000 monks died during the Khmer Rouge regime. The status of Buddhism and of religion in general after the Vietnamese invasion was at least partially similar to its status in pre-Khmer Rouge times.|$|E
