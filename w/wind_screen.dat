2500|$|A {{counter-example}} is {{the common}} technique for recording an automobile. [...] For recording [...] "Onboard" [...] car sounds (which include the car interiors), a three-microphone technique is common. [...] Two microphones record the engine directly: one is taped to {{the underside of the}} hood, near the engine block. [...] The second microphone is covered in a <b>wind</b> <b>screen</b> and tightly attached to the rear bumper, within an inch or so of the tail pipe. [...] The third microphone, which is often a stereo microphone, is stationed inside the car to get the car interior.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{researchers}} believe that the prince's kindhearted but petulant and vain rose was inspired by Saint-Exupéry's Salvadoran wife Consuelo de Saint Exupéry, with the small home planet being inspired by her small native country, El Salvador, also known as [...] "The Land of Volcanoes". Despite a raucous marriage, Saint-Exupéry kept Consuelo close to his heart and portrayed her as the prince's rose, whom he tenderly protects with a <b>wind</b> <b>screen</b> and places under a glass dome on his tiny planet. Saint-Exupéry's infidelity and the doubts of his marriage are symbolized by the vast field of roses the prince encounters {{during his visit to}} Earth.|$|E

60|$|The {{engine was}} beating, the {{propeller}} spinning, {{and for a}} second the stage and the buildings beyond were gliding swiftly and horizontally past Graham's eye; then these things seemed to tilt up abruptly. He gripped the little rods {{on either side of him}} instinctively. He felt himself moving upward, heard the air whistle over the top of the <b>wind</b> <b>screen.</b> The propeller screw moved round with powerful rhythmic impulses--one, two, three, pause; one, two, three--which the engineer controlled very delicately. The machine began a quivering vibration that continued throughout the flight, and the roof areas seemed running away to starboard very quickly and growing rapidly smaller. He looked from the face of the engineer through the ribs of the machine. Looking sideways, there was nothing very startling in what he saw--a rapid funicular railway might have given the same sensations. He recognised the Council House and the Highgate Ridge. And then he looked straight down between his feet.|$|E

5000|$|Some common but unrecommended {{practices}} can {{adversely affect}} the Svea’s performance and reliability. For example, when using a <b>wind</b> <b>screen</b> or shield {{other than the}} built-in <b>wind</b> <b>screen</b> (such as the flexible aluminum foil windscreens used with stoves made by Mountain Safety Research), care should be taken not to wrap the windscreen too tightly around the stove because {{this may cause the}} stove to overheat and the fuel tank to over-pressurize. [...] This in turn will cause the pressure-relief valve in the filler cap to open and the over-pressurized gas vapor to escape, which may catch fire and result in a dangerous [...] "flareup" [...] or large fireball. In addition, while the Svea is capable of burning unleaded automobile gasoline, only naphtha or [...] "Coleman fuel" [...] is recommended: Coleman fuel contains rust inhibitors and is specially refined for use in camping stoves, while automotive fuel contains additives that vaporize when burned and leave gumlike deposits behind that causes clogging. [...] The stove should also not be allowed to run dry because doing so will burn or char the cotton wick inside the fuel tank, which will inhibit the wick’s ability to draw fuel to the vaporizing tube.|$|E
2500|$|Power was {{provided}} by two radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) units containing plutonium-238 affixed to {{opposite sides of the}} lander base and covered by <b>wind</b> <b>screens.</b> Each generator was [...] tall, [...] in diameter, had a mass of [...] and provided 30 watts continuous power at 4.4 volts.

50|$|Marist motor {{mechanics}} {{students and}} their teachers have, over the years, created usable motor vehicles using scrap. The most notable of these were Moonshine, a large truck {{that was used to}} ferry goods from Dete to and around the school, and Sunshine, a small 'body' on 'wheels' runaround vehicle used around the school and farm area. Typically, these vehicles were deliberately never developed {{to the point of being}} roadworthy, and were made to lack things such as <b>wind</b> <b>screens,</b> batteries, etc.|$|R
