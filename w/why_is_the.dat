The garden, which contains plants from all over Australia as well as those indigenous to the area, has four main sections, the rainforest gully, the sandstone heath {{on the site of}} the quarry, the Federation Cascades built in 2001 to commemorate the centenary of the federation of Australia, and the primitive plant section, with examples of plant species that have survived for millions of years. The garden is open from 8am to 5pm every day except Christmas Day, and admission is free.|$|E

The Wan brothers, Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Art Institute of Suzhou and many other big name artists would all be concentrated in this studio for the first time. Among the talent is Japanese animator Tadahito Mochinaga who would spend time in Shanghai creating Thank You, Kitty. Three years later he would depart for Japan, becoming possibly the only artist to have worked in both Chinese and Japanese industry in the era. By 1956 the Wan brothers have created the first colored animation of notable length titled <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Crow Black-Coated, which became the first Chinese animation recognized internationally.|$|E

25|$|Different {{strains of}} Triticeae exist for {{different}} industrial applications; durum for pasta and food pastes, {{two types of}} barley for beer, bread wheats used in different areas with different growing conditions. Replacing these motifs is not a plausible task since a contamination of 0.02% wheat in a gluten-free diet {{is considered to be}} pathogenic and would require replacing the motifs in all known regional varieties—potentially thousands of genetic modifications. Class I and antibody responses are downstream of Class II recognition and are of little remedial value in change. The innate response peptide could be a silver bullet, assuming there is only one of these per protein and only a few genome loci with the protein. Unresolved questions relevant to a complete understanding of immune responses to gluten are: <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> rate of late onset gluten sensitivity rapidly rising? Is this truly a wheat problem, or something that is being done to wheat, or to those who are eating wheat (for example, communicable diseases a trigger? Some individuals are susceptible by genetics (early onset), but many late onset cases could have different triggers because there is nothing genetically separating the 30 to 40% of people that could have Triticeae sensitivity from the ~1% that, in their lifetime, will have some level of this disease.|$|E

500|$|Peter, {{who tries}} to shave Quagmire's cat in the episode, ends up killing it and cutting it six times because of the legend of cats having nine lives. As he is arresting Brian, one of the police {{officers}} states {{that he will not}} release him since he is a [...] "family guy". In their campaign, Brian and Stewie perform their musical number, '"A Bag o' Weed", to the tune of [...] "Me Ol' Bamboo" [...] as featured in the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. During the song, a picture of Woody Harrelson is shown. Harrelson also wanted marijuana legalized. Towards the end of the musical number Shaggy from the television show Scooby Doo can be seen among the crowd, referencing a number of jokes about his stoned-like demeanor. After cannabis is legalized, its effects include phenomenal ratings for Doctor Who. Peter then tries to remember something but ends up remembering the names of celebrities whom he does not like. While helping out with Carter's smear campaign, Peter comes up with an advertisement that involves Adolf Hitler claiming that the Holocaust was started by smoking cannabis. The campaign is then dropped after Carter informs Peter that Fox News holds Hitler's image rights and they cannot smear it. He later tries to film a new advertisement which informs that unlike the events of the film Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, he made it there earlier since he was not stoned. He then says Neil Patrick Harris was cast on How I Met Your Mother based on his work in that film, and brings up a point that confuses him: since Josh Radnor is already an adult, <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> narrator of the show voiced by Bob Saget? Carter later tells Brian that he will release his novel with an Oprah's Book Club induction.|$|E

2500|$|Natural {{languages}} such as English have {{words for}} several Boolean operations, in particular conjunction (and), disjunction (or), negation (not), and implication (implies). But not {{is synonymous with}} and not. When used to combine situational assertions such as [...] "the block is on the table" [...] and [...] "cats drink milk," [...] which naively are either true or false, the meanings of these logical connectives often have the meaning of their logical counterparts. However, with descriptions of behavior such as [...] "Jim walked through the door", one starts to notice differences such as failure of commutativity, for example the conjunction of [...] "Jim opened the door" [...] with [...] "Jim walked through the door" [...] in that order is not equivalent to their conjunction in the other order, since and usually means and then in such cases. Questions can be similar: the order [...] "Is the sky blue, and <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> sky blue?" [...] makes more sense than the reverse order. Conjunctive commands about behavior are like behavioral assertions, as in get dressed and go to school. Disjunctive commands such love me or leave me or fish or cut bait tend to be asymmetric via the implication that one alternative is less preferable. Conjoined nouns such as tea and milk generally describe aggregation as with set union while tea or milk is a choice. However context can reverse these senses, as in your choices are coffee and tea which usually means the same as your choices are coffee or tea (alternatives). Double negation as in [...] "I don't not like milk" [...] rarely means literally [...] "I do like milk" [...] but rather conveys some sort of hedging, as though to imply {{that there is a}} third possibility. [...] "Not not P" [...] can be loosely interpreted as [...] "surely P", and although P necessarily implies [...] "not not P" [...] the converse is suspect in English, much as with intuitionistic logic. In view of the highly idiosyncratic usage of conjunctions in natural languages, Boolean algebra cannot be considered a reliable framework for interpreting them.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Eliezer {{taught that}} during the seven days of Sukkot, one must eat 14 meals in a sukkah — one on each day and one on each night. The Sages of the Mishnah, however, taught that one is not {{required}} to eat a fixed number of meals a sukkah, except that one must eat a meal in a sukkah on the first night of Sukkot. Rabbi Eliezer said in addition that if one did not eat in a sukkah on the first night of Sukkot, one may make up for it on the last night of the Festival. The Sages of the Mishnah, however, taught that there is no making up for this, and of this [...] said: [...] "That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered." [...] The Gemara explained that Rabbi Eliezer said that one needs to eat 14 meals because the words of [...] "You shall dwell," [...] imply that one should dwell just as one normally dwells. And so, just as in a normal dwelling, one has one meal by day and one by night, so in the sukkah, one should have one meal by day and one by night. And the Gemara explained that the Sages taught that [...] "You shall dwell," [...] implies that just as in one's dwelling, one eats if one wishes, and does not eat if one does not wish, so also with a sukkah one eats only if one wishes. But if so, the Gemara asked, <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> meal on the first night mandatory? Rabbi Johanan answered in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Jehozadak that with regard to Sukkot, [...] says [...] "the fifteenth," [...] just as [...] says [...] "the fifteenth" [...] with regard to Passover (implying similarity in the laws for the two Festivals). And for Passover, [...] says, [...] "At evening you shall eat unleavened bread," [...] indicatiung that only the first night is obligatory (to eat unleavened bread). So also for Sukkot, the only first night is also obligatory (to eat in the sukkah). The Gemara then reported that Bira said in the name of Rabbi Ammi that Rabbi Eliezer recanted his statement that one is obliged to eat 14 meals in the sukkah, and changed his position to agree with the Sages. The Gemara taught that a desert later in the holiday may be regarded as a compensating meal to fulfill one's obligation to eat the first meal.|$|E
