5|$|In 1965, Cade was {{approached}} by Dewayne Douglas, an assistant coach for the Florida Gators football team, about the extreme dehydration faced by Gator football players practicing in the high temperatures and humidity of the Deep South in late summer and early fall. Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not urinate during practice and games. Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that football players <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> water through perspiration and failing to replace fluid during practice and games. Cade's research team discovered that football players <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) during the three hours of a college football game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss was water. A player's plasma volume could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in the sweat.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{complaints}} that the MSPB has gone far beyond protecting civil servants from unjustified disciplinary action.

Following structural alterations to give him a better view of the river, Etty moved into the house in June 1848, completing the move in September of that year, although he retained his London apartments.
