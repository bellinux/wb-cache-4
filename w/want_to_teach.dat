5|$|One of Morgan's stated {{interests}} was to lead {{a program}} of research into household practices; she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> traditional home economics principles if {{they could not be}} supported by science. This meant that her students were required to possess a science background that was more stringent than other U.S. home economics programs. Consequently, her graduates found themselves prepared for roles that had not usually been open to traditional home economics graduates, such as hospital nutrition management and teaching in the basic sciences.|$|E
2500|$|Dave Bayer, a {{professor}} of Mathematics at Barnard College, Columbia University, was consulted on the mathematical equations that appear in the film. Bayer later said that he approached his consulting role as an actor when preparing equations, such as when Nash is forced to teach a calculus class, and arbitrarily places a complicated problem on the blackboard. [...] Bayer focused on a character who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> ordinary details and was more concerned with what was interesting. Bayer received a cameo role in the film as {{a professor}} who lays his pen down for Nash in the pen ceremony {{near the end of}} the film.|$|E
2500|$|Most higher {{educational}} institutions offering programs in education. Such programs run four years, {{in addition to}} a half-year internship, with students receiving teaching credentials {{at the end of the}} program. They also have to take extra test for being a teacher in public school. While currently education programs are available in most institutes of tertiary education, prospective teachers typically go to a [...] "university of education" [...] if they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> primary school, and a [...] "normal university" [...] for secondary school. One exception is National Changhua University of Education, which, like normal universities, is renowned for its dedication to cultivating secondary school teachers.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard's {{early work}} was written under various pseudonyms {{that he used}} to present {{distinctive}} viewpoints and to interact with each other in complex dialogue. He explored particularly complex problems from different viewpoints, each under a different pseudonym. He wrote many Upbuilding Discourses under his own name and dedicated them to the [...] "single individual" [...] who might want to discover the meaning of his works. Notably, he wrote: [...] "Science and scholarship <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> that becoming objective is the way. Christianity teaches that the way is to become subjective, to become a subject." [...] While scientists can learn about the world by observation, Kierkegaard emphatically denied that observation could reveal {{the inner workings of the}} world of the spirit.|$|E
2500|$|People in the {{community}} seem to take pride in Teaneck's high rate of Aliyah to Israel. It's certainly something to be proud of. But we make {{no mention of the}} equally high rates (maybe even higher rates) of [...] "yerida" [...] from Israel to Teaneck. My feeling is these 'yordim' should not be accorded honors in our synagogues or schools. These people are the antithesis of what we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> our children, of how we want to live. For most religious Zionists, of which Teaneck has more than a few, the goal is to end up in Israel. Having [...] "yordim" [...] as community leaders here is bad public policy. Recently, one of the largest synagogues in town installed a [...] "yored" [...] as its president. Our schools honor [...] "yordim" [...] on a regular basis at their dinners. [...] "Yordim" [...] make up a large percentage of our school's Hebrew teachers.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{while he}} was the Vatican's chief astronomer, Fr. George Coyne, issued a {{statement}} on 18 November 2005 saying that [...] "Intelligent design isn't science even though it pretends to be. If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> it in schools, intelligent design should be taught when religion or cultural history is taught, not science." [...] Cardinal Paul Poupard added that [...] "the faithful have the obligation to listen to that which secular modern science has to offer, just as we ask that knowledge of the faith be taken in consideration as an expert voice in humanity." [...] He also warned of the permanent lesson we have learned from the Galileo affair, and that [...] "we also know the dangers of a religion that severs its links with reason and becomes prey to fundamentalism." [...] Fiorenzo Facchini, professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Bologna, called intelligent design unscientific, and wrote in the January 16–17, 2006 edition L'Osservatore Romano: [...] "But it is not correct from a methodological point of view to stray {{from the field of}} science while pretending to do science.... It only creates confusion between the scientific plane and those that are philosophical or religious." [...] Kenneth R. Miller is another prominent Catholic scientist widely known for opposing Young Earth Creationism and Intelligent Design. He writes, concerning Emeritus pope Benedict XVI, that [...] "The Holy Father's concerns are not with evolution per se, but with how evolution is to be understood in our modern world. Biological evolution fits neatly into a traditional Catholic understanding of how contingent natural processes can be seen as part of God's plan...a careful reading suggests that the new pope will give quarter neither to the enemies of spirituality nor the enemies of evolutionary science. And that's exactly as it should be." ...|$|E
