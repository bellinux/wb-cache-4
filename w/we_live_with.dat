500|$|Hazlitt's {{enthusiastic}} {{explanation of}} how Falstaff's fatness contributes to our amused sympathy with him was later especially admired by the critic John Dover Wilson. And John Kinnaird considered the [...] "sketch of Falstaff" [...] in this essay to be a [...] "masterpiece", [...] "a brilliant [...] portrait of comic exuberance incarnate", though perhaps in part a creation of his own imagination rather than being entirely faithful to the character as created by Shakespeare. More recently the critic Harold Bloom, in a book devoted entirely to Falstaff, approvingly noted Hazlitt's appreciative commentary on the character, quoting Hazlitt's observation that Falstaff [...] "lives in a perpetual holiday and open house, and <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> him in a round of invitations to a rump and dozen." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1932, after {{completing}} Devil and the Deep with Tallulah Bankhead {{to fulfill his}} old contract, Cooper appeared in A Farewell to Arms, the first film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel. Co-starring Helen Hayes, a leading New York theatre star and Academy Award winner, and Adolphe Menjou, the film presented Cooper {{with one of his}} most ambitious and challenging dramatic roles, playing an American ambulance driver wounded in Italy who falls in love with an English nurse during World War I. Critics praised his highly intense and emotional performance, and the film became one of the year's most commercially successful pictures. In 1933, after making Today <b>We</b> <b>Live</b> <b>with</b> Joan Crawford and One Sunday Afternoon with Fay Wray, Cooper appeared in the Ernst Lubitsch comedy film Design for Living, based on the successful Noël Coward play. Co-starring Miriam Hopkins and Fredric March, the film received mixed reviews and did not do well at the box office. Cooper's performance—playing an American artist in Europe competing with his playwright friend for the affections of a beautiful woman—was singled out for its versatility and revealed his genuine ability to do light comedy. Cooper changed his name legally to [...] "Gary Cooper" [...] in August 1933.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the fourth}} series, Miracle Day, Davies secured several popular US {{television}} writers, including Buffy the Vampire Slayer writer Jane Espenson; The X-Files, [...] and Supernatural writer John Shiban; and House writer Doris Egan. Additionally, both Davies and John Fay returned to write episodes. In continuing the series Davies chose to keep Torchwood {{more focused on}} the human condition than its science fiction backdrop. He drew inspiration from Buffy the Vampire Slayer noting that [...] "the best metaphors in Buffy came down to, [...] "What's {{it like to be}} in high school, as a kid?" [...] He felt the fourth series of Torchwood to be [...] "about us and our decisions and our lives, and how <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> each other and how we die with each other." [...] The depiction of human nature in the fourth series led to a sequence which many felt to be evocative of the Holocaust. Jane Espenson noted that as a series Torchwood [...] "is willing to go to horrible places". She stated that in storylining Miracle Day, the writers [...] "didn't want to flinch away from what mankind can do." ...|$|E

2500|$|In candid {{remarks to}} high-value donors at a {{secretly}} recorded May 2012 private fundraiser, Romney {{said of the}} Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [...] "I look [...] at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political [...] purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel, and [...] these thorny issues, and I say, 'There's just no way.' And so what you do [...] is you say, 'You move things along the best way you can.' You hope for some degree [...] of stability, but you recognize {{that this is going}} to remain an unsolved [...] problem. <b>We</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> that in China and Taiwan. All right, we have a [...] potentially volatile situation but we sort of live with it, and we kick [...] the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something [...] will happen and resolve it." [...] He also noted that he had recently received a call from a former U.S. Secretary of State who had suggested that there might be a prospect for accord after the Palestinian elections. Romney made clear in his remarks at the fundraiser that he was opposed to the U.S. exerting any pressure on Israel to help reach a compromise: [...] "The idea of pushing on the Israelis to give something up to [...] get the Palestinians to act is the worst idea in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} the target audience is extremely fluid: while some of his works are clearly published as children's literature (picture books, cassettes), the distinction between youth, young adult and adult literature is not easily made; traditional story-telling addresses the entire community at once. [...] The interplay of truth and fiction, always difficult concepts, is a recurring theme in Schami's writings. [...] Der ehrliche Lügner opens with the words: [...] "My name is Sadik, but not even that is certain." [...] Elsewhere we are told that the important thing is not whether stories are true, but rather how <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> them (A Handful of Stars). [...] Although elements from fairy-tale worlds may appear in these stories, they are always rooted in daily life. [...] Schami has made a distinction between Illusion and Phantasie (illusion and vision). [...] Illusion is an unachievable dream, distorting the world to something impossible, whereas vision is the imaginative construction of achievable goals; rooted in reality it indicates something which can be striven for, but this reality means also accepting the other possibility, that there may not be a happy ending. [...] Asked by a radio interviewer whether literature is an escape from reality, Schami answers, yes: but one which enables the reader to return to reality better equipped.|$|E

6000|$|LIVER, n. A {{large red}} organ thoughtfully {{provided}} by nature to be bilious with. The sentiments and emotions which every literary anatomist now knows to haunt the heart were anciently believed to infest the liver; and even Gascoygne, {{speaking of the}} emotional side of human nature, calls it [...] "our hepaticall parte."

6000|$|... "It is a {{most serious}} thing," [...] replied the minister; [...] "but perhaps we are apt to over-estimate the {{importance}} of death at any particular moment. If the question were whether to die or to live forever, then, indeed, scarcely anything should justify the putting a fellow-creature to death. But since it only shortens his earthly life, and brings a little forward a change which, since God permits it, is, we may conclude, as fit to take place then as at any other time, it alters the case. I often {{think that there are}} many things that occur to us in our daily life, many unknown crises, that are more important to us than this mysterious circumstance of death, which we deem the most important of all. All we understand of it is, that it takes the dead person away from our knowledge of him, which, while <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> him, is so very scanty." ...|$|E

You did not come near to me, nor touch me where I feel most deeply. If I had lived to be your wife, I cannot say but this {{distance}} in our spiritual nature might have widened. You know, what <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> we get used to; it grows an old story. Your love to me might have grown old and worn out. If we lived together in the commonplace toils of life, you would see only a poor threadbare wife. I might have lost what little charm I ever had for you; but I feel that if I die, this will not be. There is something sacred and beautiful in death; and I may have more power over you, when I seem to be gone, than I should have had living." ...|$|E
6000|$|Why should <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> such {{hurry and}} waste of life? We are {{determined}} to be starved before we are hungry. Men say that a stitch in time saves nine, and so they take a thousand stitches today to save nine tomorrow. As for work, we haven't any of any consequence. We have the Saint Vitus' dance, and cannot possibly keep our heads still. If I should only give a few pulls at the parish bell-rope, as for a fire, that is, without setting the bell, there is hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts of Concord, notwithstanding that press of engagements which was his excuse so many times this morning, nor a boy, nor a woman, I might almost say, but would forsake all and follow that sound, not mainly to save property from the flames, but, if we will confess the truth, much more to see it burn, since burn it must, and we, be it known, did not set it on fire--or to see it put out, and have a hand in it, if that is done as handsomely; yes, {{even if it were}} the parish church itself. Hardly a man takes a half-hour's nap after dinner, but when he wakes he holds up his head and asks, [...] "What's the news?" [...] as if the rest of mankind had stood his sentinels. Some give directions to be waked every half-hour, doubtless for no other purpose; and then, to pay for it, they tell what they have dreamed. After a night's sleep the news is as indispensable as the breakfast. [...] "Pray tell me anything new that has happened to a man anywhere on this globe"--and he reads it over his coffee and rolls, that a man has had his eyes gouged out this morning on the Wachito River; never dreaming the while that he lives in the dark unfathomed mammoth cave of this world, and has but the rudiment of an eye himself.|$|E
