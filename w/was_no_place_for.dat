5|$|According to musicologist Francis Maes, Rubinstein {{could not}} be accused of any lack of artistic integrity. He fought for change and {{progress}} in musical life in Russia. Only his musical tastes were conservative—from Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven to the early Romantics up to Chopin. Liszt and Wagner were not included. Neither did he welcome many ideas then new about music, including the role of nationalism in classical music. For Rubinstein, national music existed only in folk song and folk dance. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> national music in larger works, especially not in opera. Rubinstein's public reaction to the attacks was simply not to react. His classes and concerts were well attended, so he felt no reply was actually necessary. He even forbade his students to take sides.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the {{decommissioned}} battleships {{were removed}} from the Naval Vessel Register (NVR) after it was determined by ranking US Navy officials that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> a battleship in the modern navy. In response to the striking of the battleships from the Naval Vessel Register a movement began to reinstate the battleships, on the grounds that these vessels had superior firepower over the then-existing 5-inch guns found on the , , and s, and s. Citing concern over the lack of available gunfire to support amphibious operations, Congress demanded that the United States Navy reinstate two battleships to the naval vessel register and maintain them with the mothball fleet, until the Navy could certify it had gunfire support within the current fleet that would meet or exceed the battleship's capability.|$|E

25|$|The Russian Orthodox Church {{collaborated with}} the White Army in the Russian Civil War (see White movement) after the October Revolution.

25|$|His {{care in the}} {{institution}} of a pagan hierarchy in opposition {{to that of the}} Christians was due to his wish to create a society in which every aspect {{of the life of the}} citizens was to be connected, through layers of intermediate levels, to the consolidated figure of the Emperor— the final provider for all the needs of his people.

25|$|Another {{contributory}} {{factor was}} the lack of attention paid to Adolf Galland's basic rules of combat. In the tactical battle, he argued that the fighter must fight on the offensive, even when on defensive missions. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> a defensive posture. An example of this dictum being ignored was the instance of having Bf 109 groups escort vulnerable and heavily armed Focke-Wulf Fw 190s which had replaced the vulnerable Zerstörer twin-engined fighters, which reduced the power of interception formations. Combat cohesiveness was frequently disregarded, and the integrity of the formations became compromised and ignored (owing to a lack of experienced leaders). Fixed tactical scheme contributed to failures as well. Rigid tactics were allowed to take root, and technique suffered. Using surprise, cunning and manoeuvrability had to be combined with aggressiveness and improvisation depending on the situation. This sort of tactical advantage was lost over time.|$|E
25|$|The Nyasaland High Court in 1903 {{exempted}} {{the original}} inhabitants of estates from thangata {{and gave them}} some security. Legislation allowing other tenants to pay rent rather than thangata, and for cash payment if they performed more than the required thangata was enacted in 1908, but not implemented. The harshness of thangata {{was at least one}} of the reasons underlying the 1915 uprising led by John Chilembwe. Following this revolt, a new attempt to abolish thangata in favour of cash rent was made, but it failed because of the political influence of the estate owners. The thangata system was a bar to progress and impoverished people by limiting the amount of time they could work for themselves. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> crafts or skills in thangata: reduced all tenants to unskilled manual labour, and was likened to a form of serfdom. Even after Chilembwe’s revolt, the labour obligation on many estates was little modified, sometimes amounting to six months for thangata and rent. Although some abuses were curtailed, others such as equating a month of thangata to 30 days (or five weeks of six days’ work), and requiring the wives of absent migrant workers, widows and single women to work in breach of custom, persisted. However, by 1918 most cotton, and by 1925 most tobacco, was not grown on estates by direct labour, but by smallholders on Crown lands. As the demand for estate labour declined in the 1920s, the owners claimed that, as they had insufficient work for their tenants to meet their thangata obligations, they had become rent-free squatters.|$|E
500|$|The title story, [...] "The Ladies of Grace Adieu", is set {{in early}} 19th century Gloucestershire and {{concerns}} the friendship of three young women, Cassandra Parbringer, Miss Tobias, and Mrs. Fields. Though {{the events of the}} story do not actually appear in Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, they are referenced in a footnote in Chapter 43. Clarke has said, [...] "For a long time it was my hope that these three ladies should eventually find a place in...the novel...I decided there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> them...I deliberately kept women to the domestic sphere in the interests of authenticity...it was important that real and alternate history appeared to have converged. This meant that I needed to write the women and the servants, as far as possible, as they would have been written in a 19th-century novel." [...] Reviewers highlighted this tale, one calling it [...] "the most striking story" [...] of the collection and [...] "a staunchly feminist take on power relations". In her review of the volume in Strange Horizons, Victoria Hoyle writes that [...] "there is something incredibly precise, clean, and cold about Clarke's portrayal of 'women's magic' in this story (and throughout the collection)—it is urgent and desperate, but it is also natural {{and in the course of}} things." ...|$|E

500|$|In the First Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Russia, Prussia and Austria annexed large {{swaths of}} Polish–Lithuanian {{territory}} and gained {{influence over the}} internal politics of the reduced Polish and Lithuanian states. When Kościuszko finally returned home in 1774, he found that his brother Józef had squandered most of the family fortune, and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> him in the Army, as he {{could not afford to}} buy an officer's commission. [...] He took a position as tutor to the family of the magnate, province governor (voivode) and hetman Józef Sylwester Sosnowski {{and fell in love with}} the governor's daughter Ludwika. [...] Their elopement was thwarted by her father's retainers. Kościuszko received a thrashing at their hands, an event that may have led to his later antipathy to class distinctions. In the autumn of 1775, he decided to emigrate to avoid Sosnowski and his retainers. In late 1775, he attempted to join the Saxon army but was turned down and decided to return to Paris. There he learned of the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, in which the British colonies in North America had revolted against the crown and begun their struggle for independence. The first American successes were well-publicized in France, and the French people and government openly supported the revolutionaries' cause.|$|E
