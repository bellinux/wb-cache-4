5|$|As {{a popular}} physician, Sonnabend was renowned for {{protecting}} and promoting patients' rights. He did not {{shy away from}} criticising the scientific establishment <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> it was failing to put patients' interests first. He often disagreed with mainstream opinion on AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Jacob made {{no effort}} to solicit members for his commune other than through his {{newspapers}} and sometimes rejected applicants <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> they were not fit candidates. The commune attracted only about a dozen residents – mostly from outside the Ohio area.|$|E
5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E
60|$|So Reddy {{tried to}} forget the {{emptiness}} of his stomach and actually had a nap, for he was very, very tired. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> awoke <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> better.|$|R
60|$|He {{died the}} day arter. In the morning 'e was whimpering about 'is money ag'in, and angry with Bill <b>when</b> <b>'e</b> {{reminded}} 'im that 'e couldn't {{take it with}} 'im, and 'e made Bill promise that 'e should be buried just as 'e was. Bill tucked him up arter that, and <b>when</b> <b>'e</b> <b>felt</b> a canvas belt tied round the old man's waist 'e began to see wot 'e was driving at.|$|R
60|$|Stiff with {{wounds and}} bruises, Tom {{was a long}} time in {{accomplishing}} this movement; but, <b>when</b> done, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> a sensible relief from the cooling application to his wounds.|$|R
5|$|The boy's {{mother said}} that the video had helped him {{to deal with his}} depression. After {{watching}} Capaldi's message, Ross Goodall stated that his son's behaviour patterns changed markedly. This change included the ability to comfort his sister and step out of his day-to-day routine. Ross Goodall said that after watching the video, his son smiled {{for the first time since}} his grandmother's death. The family framed the letter from Capaldi that came before the video message, and Ross Goodall said that Thomas looked at it <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> distressed.|$|E
5|$|E.V. Ramasamy {{joined the}} Indian National Congress in 1919, but {{resigned}} in 1925 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{that the party}} was only serving {{the interests of the}} Brahmins. He questioned the subjugation of Dravidians as the Brahmins enjoyed gifts and donations from them but opposed and discriminated them in cultural and religious matters. In 1924, E.V. Ramasamy participated in a non-violent agitation (satyagraha) in Vaikam, Kerala. From 1929 to 1932 Ramasamy toured British Malaya, Europe, and Russia, which had an influence on him. In 1939, E.V. Ramasamy became the head of the Justice Party, and in 1944, he changed its name to Dravidar Kazhagam. The party later split and one group led by C. N. Annadurai formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1949. While continuing the Self-Respect Movement, he advocated for an independent Dravida Nadu (land of the Dravidians).|$|E
5|$|Bartlett's party now {{consisted}} of eight Karluk crew members (himself, engineers John Munro and Robert Williamson, seamen Hugh Williams and Fred Maurer, fireman George Breddy, cook Robert Templeman, and Chafe), three scientists (McKinlay, Mamen and geologist George Malloch), John Hadley, and five Inuit (the {{family of four}} and Kataktovik). Hadley, nearing 60 years of age, {{was one of the}} few, along with Bartlett and the Inuit, with experience of travelling for distances over ice. Bartlett sent his forces out, in groups, to blaze a trail and lay down supply depots on the route to Wrangel Island, thus preparing his inexperienced party for the hazards of ice travel. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> they were ready for the main journey he divided them into four teams and sent the first two away on 19 February. Bartlett himself led the last two groups from the camp on 24 February, leaving a note of the party's location in a copper drum in case the camp should drift into an inhabited area. The distance to Wrangel Island was estimated at , but the journey proved to be twice that in length.|$|E
60|$|The boys relapsed into silence, glad of the rest. Dave was {{thinking}} of his father, and of the folks who had gone into Yellowstone Park, <b>when</b> suddenly <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> his sleeve pulled by Roger.|$|R
5000|$|<b>When</b> {{asked if}} <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> guilty about {{carrying}} {{on with the}} lost episodes without Chappelle, Rawlings replied: ...|$|R
6000|$|L. Yes; I {{believed}} the Aiguille Verte would have held its own. But do you recollect {{what one of}} the climbers exclaimed, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>felt</b> sure of reaching the summit? ...|$|R
25|$|Yoo stated his {{resentment of}} the rich stemmed from early {{childhood}}, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> envy of a large house due to his childhood poverty. Yoo's resentment of women stemmed from a lover, {{who worked as a}} masseuse, leaving him after learning of his criminal past.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{days before}} the attack on Georgi Markov, Bulgarian defector, Vladimir Kostov survived an attack {{similar to the one}} against Markov. Kostov was {{standing}} on an escalator of the Paris metro <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> a sting in his lower back above the belt of his trousers. He developed a fever, but recovered. After Markov's death the wound on Kostov's back was examined and a ricin-laced pellet identical to the one used against Markov was removed.|$|E
25|$|Catherine became {{pregnant}} and miscarried {{at least three}} times, and during a severe illness in 1663, she imagined, for a time, that she had given birth. Charles comforted her by telling her she had indeed given birth to two sons and a daughter. Her position was a difficult one, and though Charles continued to have children by his many mistresses, he insisted she be treated with respect, and sided with her against his mistresses <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> she was not receiving the respect she was due.|$|E
60|$|Charlie was on {{the flank}} of the company as it advanced, and, after running through a Russian {{horseman}} with the short pike that was carried by officers, he received a tremendous blow on his steel cap, that stretched him insensible on the ground. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> recovered, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> was being carried, and soon awoke {{to the fact that}} he was a prisoner.|$|R
60|$|He said <b>he</b> {{had never}} <b>felt</b> so {{surprised}} {{in all his}} life, as <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>felt</b> himself going, {{without being able to}} conjecture in the slightest what had happened. He thought at first {{that the end of the}} world had come.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{admitted}} to hospital on 4 May 2006 after suffering a subarachnoid haemorrhage. He {{had just returned from}} jogging, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>felt</b> the effects of the haemorrhage, and said, [...] "It was frightening to feel the loss of control".|$|R
25|$|He met Edwin Rosario on June 13, 1986, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, a bout also {{broadcast}} on HBO. The fight was notable for the shifts of dominance between the men. Camacho dominated rounds one to four, {{but had to}} hang on in rounds five, six and seven, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> Rosario's power. He came back to take rounds eight and nine, but Rosario came back to take the last three rounds. It was a close fight, but Camacho retained the title by a split decision of the judges.|$|E
25|$|Urechia grew {{disillusioned with}} National Liberal {{politics}}, and voted against his party <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that their politics no longer coincided {{with his own}} views. By 1885, he also made his peace with Junimea, which was generally offering its support to the newly founded Conservative Party, and became a collaborator of its mouthpiece Convorbiri Literare, contributing essays and stories until 1892. Also in 1885, he published his novella Logof. Baptiste Veleli ("The Logofăt Baptiste Veleli"), set in the 17th century. His varied scientific interests led him to correspond with Iuliu Popper, the Romanian-born explorer of Patagonia, who notably described to Urechia the lawlessness of Punta Arenas, Chile.|$|E
25|$|David Coulthard {{took a good}} {{eleventh}} position; his team-mate, Webber, retired due to a full hydraulics failure. Adrian Sutil {{retired after}} a large engine failure going towards the Stowe corner. Toyota suffered the worst problems as both of their cars {{went out of the}} race, Ralf Schumacher retiring with a wheel fixation problem, and his team mate, Trulli retiring with handling problems. Anthony Davidson, after a good weekend of practice and an unlucky qualifying session, had to retire his Super Aguri car <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> vibrations from the underside of the car. Liuzzi retired his car with gearbox failure but was ultimately still classified in 16th place.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> Peck awoke <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> stronger, {{and readily}} partook {{of the meal}} brought to him, washing down the meat with some water from the brook.|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{he again}} lay down, and was speedily asleep. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> woke, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> sure that <b>he</b> had not {{exceeded}} {{the time he}} had given himself. He listened intently. He could hear a low, confused sound, which he knew was made by horses feeding, but he could hear no human voices. He drank the rest of the water in the mug, then he turned up the bucket, placed it under the opening, and mounted on it.|$|R
6000|$|Emily {{remained}} true to her resolution {{not to let}} {{her curiosity}} embarrass Alban again. But the unexpressed question was in her thoughts--"Of what guilt does he suspect Mrs. Rook? And, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>felt</b> his suspicions, was my father in his mind?" ...|$|R
25|$|Along with {{a number}} of other Soviet chess champions, he signed a {{petition}} condemning the actions of the defector Viktor Korchnoi in 1976. It was the continuation of a bitter feud between the two, dating back at least to their 1974 Candidates semifinal match in which Petrosian withdrew after five games while trailing 3½–1½ (+3−1=1). His match with Korchnoi in 1977 saw the two former colleagues refuse to shake hands or speak to each other. They even demanded separate eating and toilet facilities. Petrosian went on to lose the match and was subsequently fired as editor of Russia's largest chess magazine, 64. His detractors condemned his reluctance to attack and some put it down to a lack of courage. At this point however, Botvinnik spoke out on his behalf, stating that he only attacked <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> secure and his greatest strength was in defence.|$|E
25|$|In February, the Mahicans {{went into}} the woods to harvest maple syrup for their annual supply of sugar. Timothy took this {{opportunity}} to return to Springfield to visit friends and relatives, returning in early spring. Sergeant returned for a short time, and they took turns at the two Mahican settlements. When Sergeant returned to Yale again, he wrote Dr. Colman, one of the Commissioners of Indian Affairs at Boston, and requested that Timothy would be compensated {{so that he might}} continue there, being that there was enough work for two missionaries. Sergeant returned to stay in early July, and they resumed trading places on a weekly basis. In August, Timothy fell ill with a form of malaria. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> well enough to travel, he returned to Springfield, only to relapse, delaying his return until November. During the winter of 1736, Sergeant and Woodbridge decided to accompany the Mahicans on their maple syrup harvest, so that their education could continue, uninterrupted.|$|E
25|$|The young Clarence {{attended}} Allegheny College and the University of Michigan Law School, {{but did not}} {{graduate from}} either institution. He attended Allegheny College for only one year before the Panic of 1873 struck, and Darrow {{was determined not to}} be a financial burden to his father any longer. Over the next three years he taught in the winter at the district school in a country community. While teaching, Darrow started to study the law on his own, {{and by the end of}} his third year of teaching, his family urged him to enter the law department at Ann Arbor. Darrow only studied there a year when he decided that it would be much more cost-effective to work and study in an actual law office. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that he was ready, he took the Ohio bar exam and passed. He was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1878. The Clarence Darrow Octagon House, his childhood home in Kinsman, contains a memorial to him.|$|E
60|$|She {{lifted her}} eyes, glistening with tears, and it touched his {{peculiar}} {{sense of humor}} to find her offering him reparation, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>felt</b> himself so outrageously to blame; {{but he would not}} be outdone in magnanimity, if it came to that.|$|R
60|$|Meantime he had {{cautiously}} approached Heemskirk, who, {{bursting into}} incoherent imprecations, was stamping {{with both feet}} where he stood. The indignity of the blow, the rage of baffled purpose, the ridicule of the exposure, and the impossibility of revenge maddened him to a point <b>when</b> <b>he</b> simply <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> must howl with fury.|$|R
60|$|The day went by {{and also}} the next. Link Merwell kept to himself, only {{speaking}} <b>when</b> addressed. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> his position keenly, and would no doubt have given a great deal {{if he could have}} cleared himself. He was learning that the way of the transgressor is hard.|$|R
25|$|Constantius {{spent the}} next two years neutralising the threat of the Franks who were the allies of Allectus, as {{northern}} Gaul remained {{under the control of the}} British usurper until at least 295. He also battled against the Alamanni, achieving some victories at the mouth of the Rhine in 295. Administrative concerns meant he made at least one trip to Italy during this time as well. Only <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> ready (and only when Maximian finally came to relieve him at the Rhine frontier) did he assemble two invasion fleets with the intent of crossing the English Channel. The first was entrusted to Asclepiodotus, Constantius’ long-serving Praetorian prefect, who sailed from the mouth of the Seine, while the other, under the command of Constantius himself, was launched from his base at Bononia. The fleet under Asclepiodotus landed near the Isle of Wight, and his army encountered the forces of Allectus, resulting in the defeat and death of the usurper. Constantius in the meantime occupied London, saving the city from an attack by Frankish mercenaries who were now roaming the province without a paymaster. Constantius massacred all of them.|$|E
25|$|The {{next night}} on Raw Is War, after teasing a quick face turn, the heel turn {{continued}} {{and he also}} altered his character considerably {{over the next few}} months, in a deliberate turn from the rebellious and anti-establishment character beloved by the fans, Austin became a whiny, temperamental primadonna who would complain incessantly <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> he was not getting the respect from the fans and wrestlers that he deserved. He also developed an infatuation with McMahon, going to great lengths to impress him and even {{going so far as to}} hugging him and bringing him presents. McMahon, though visibly uncomfortable and wary by the attention, was still grateful to have Austin with him instead of against him. During a steel cage match with The Rock in a rematch for the title, Triple H came down to the ring with a sledgehammer and together with Austin viciously attacked The Rock and put him out of action. Austin further cemented his heel turn the following Thursday on SmackDown!, when during an interview with Jim Ross about his actions at WrestleMania thought Ross was denouncing their friendship and then proceeded to attack and brutally assault Ross. Austin and Triple H became a team and called themselves The Two-Man Power Trip.|$|E
25|$|Local traditions {{states that}} when the village was still called Benquerença, there was a {{beautiful}} orphan princess who lived in her uncle, {{the lord of the}} castle. The princess {{fell in love with a}} noble young knight who did not possess great wealth. For this reason, the young man left the village in search of fortune, promising to return <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> he had a worthy fortune to ask for her hand. For years, the princess refused all suitors, until her uncle promised her to a friend, forcing her to compromise. When she was presented to the uncle of her suitor, she confessed that her heart belonged to another man. This revelation infuriated her uncle, who thought of a ruse to coerce her to marry the one he chose. At night, he disguised as a ghost, and went through the ports of the Princess quarters, pretending to be the ghost of her lover, telling her to marr her suitor or otherwise be subject to damnation. As he was about to get an oath from her, the door to her bedroom opened with a bright ray of light, exposing her uncle's treachery. She went to live in the tower and the two windows became known as the Port of Treason and the Port of Light.|$|E
50|$|This second {{retirement}} saw Stephenson just {{as active}} {{as he had}} been previously. He was appointed Honorary Commodore of the Sea Cadet Corps in 1949, a post he held until the age of eighty in 1958, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> finally <b>felt</b> it necessary to step down.|$|R
60|$|With one blow of {{the tiller}} he unshipped for the purpose, he knocked the plug out, {{but did not}} take the trouble to lower the sail. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> the water welling up heavily about his legs before he leaped on to the taffrail. There, upright and motionless, in his shirt and {{trousers}} only, <b>he</b> stood waiting. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> had <b>felt</b> her settle <b>he</b> sprang far away with a mighty splash.|$|R
