5|$|The {{operation}} commenced {{during a}} NATO bombing {{campaign against the}} VRS, codenamed Operation Deliberate Force, which targeted Bosnian Serb air defences, artillery and storage facilities initially {{in the area of}} Sarajevo, but also elsewhere in the country. Operation Sana, alongside concurrent HV and HVO offensives, sparked debate among military analysts as to whether the ground assaults or NATO's airstrikes were more responsible for ending the Bosnian War. Also in question was to <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> the advances of the ARBiH, HVO and HV were assisted by the airstrikes, and conversely, to <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> they hampered the VRS.|$|E
5|$|Archaea show {{high levels}} of {{horizontal}} gene transfer between lineages. Some researchers suggest that individuals can be grouped into species-like populations given highly similar genomes and infrequent gene transfer to/from cells with less-related genomes, as in the genus Ferroplasma. On the other hand, studies in Halorubrum found significant genetic transfer to/from less-related populations, limiting the criterion's applicability. A second concern is to <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> such species designations have practical meaning.|$|E

5|$|In March and April 1991, Serbs in Croatia {{began to}} make moves to secede from that territory. It {{is a matter of}} debate to <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> this move was locally {{motivated}} and to what degree the Milošević-led Serbian government was involved. In any event, the SAO Krajina was declared, which consisted of any Croatian territory with a substantial Serb population. The Croatian government viewed this move as a rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Although war pigeons {{and mobile}} dovecotes were used {{extensively}} during the Second World War, {{it is unclear}} to <b>what</b> <b>extent,</b> if any, they were employed for aerial photography. According {{to a report in}} 1942, the Soviet army discovered abandoned German trucks with pigeon cameras that could take photos in five-minute intervals, as well as dogs trained to carry pigeons in baskets. On the allied side, as late as 1943 it was reported that the American Signal Corps was aware of the possibility of adopting the technique.|$|E

His date of death is not mentioned by ancient historians of the time, such as Tacitus or Suetonius, who were also some of the main recorders of the events around Claudius' death and the political trauma that followed. Whether Halotus was involved in the murder of Claudius and to <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> remains an unresolved point, as do many other aspects related to Claudius' passing.|$|E
5|$|In late 1938, another PanzerI {{was sent}} to the Armament Factory of Seville in order to mount a 45mm gun, {{captured}} from a Soviet tank (a T-26 or BT-5). A second was sent sometime later in order to exchange the original armament for a 37-millimeter Maklen anti-tank gun, which had been deployed to Asturias in late 1936 on the Soviet ship A. Andreiev. It remains unknown to <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> these trials and adaptations were completed, although it is safe to assume neither adaptation was successful beyond the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} to <b>what</b> <b>extent,</b> if any, the Hell Fire Club made use of the building. The author Michael Fewer has {{suggested}} that the remoteness of Mount Pelier's location is why there are almost no verifiable accounts of the activities that went on there. However, numerous (and very doubtful) stories surrounding the building have become part of local folklore, some of which have spread to a wider audience through publication in the nineteenth century in books such as Robert Chambers' Book of Days (1864) and in The Gentleman's Magazine (1731–1922).|$|E

5|$|Many {{surviving}} funerary busts reached Western museums {{during the}} 19th century. Palmyra provided {{the most convenient}} Eastern examples bolstering an art-history controversy {{at the turn of}} the 20th century: to <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> Eastern influence on Roman art replaced idealized classicism with frontal, hieratic and simplified figures (as believed by Josef Strzygowski and others). This transition is seen as a response to cultural changes in the Western Roman Empire, rather than artistic influence from the East. Palmyrene bust reliefs, unlike Roman sculptures, are rudimentary portraits; although many reflect high quality individuality, the majority vary little across figures of similar age and gender.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{operation}} by the chosen units meant {{that much of the}} preparation was not completed. Adolf Hitler ordered the reinforcement of Scandinavia in March and April 1942, before Hardboiled was shelved in May.

Despite its limited impact, the operation gave the LCS experience in planning deceptions, and laid the groundwork for future exploitation of Hitler's belief that Northern Europe was strategically important.|$|E
5|$|Several {{key issues}} are {{routinely}} raised by musicians and music scholars, when discussing {{the performance of}} Schubert's compositions for piano.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{financial}} and temporal investments in embedded systems business is the decision involved in selecting the right components, in particular, the microcontroller. Each microcontroller is made for a particular application. Since, with time, the applications get more complex, the lifespan of existing microcontrollers gets reduced. Currently industry chooses microcontrollers in an unsystematic manner, thus reducing the possibilities of employing a perfectly suited microcontroller, albeit originally meant for a different application. This paper solves this dilemma by using {{a modified version of}} Travelling Salesman Problem to grade microcontroller and find out to <b>what</b> <b>extents</b> it would be successful when used in other applications(except for the one it was designed for). This paper starts by mentioning a few common applications of embedded systems and what differentiates them. Then the proposed grading process is described and correlated with TSP, solvable by Genetic Algorithms. 1...|$|R

The {{accident}} described in Three Mile Island began on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, and ultimately {{resulted in a}} partial core meltdown in Unit 2 of the nuclear power plant. Unit 2's pressurized water reactor was of 900 MWe capacity.

5|$|The nearby hill forts of Figsbury Ring, Quarley Hill, and Bury Hill were {{probably}} established {{around the same}} time as Danebury. All of a similar size, the hillforts were generally equally spaced, commanding similar sized territories and resources. There is some debate whether hill forts were purely defensive structures, and to <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> they were occupied. Cunliffe interprets the ramparts as essentially defensive, although he concedes that they may have been a means of displaying wealth and power, as Danebury would have been visible for miles around.|$|E
5|$|The offensive, {{together}} with Operation Sana, caused controversy among military analysts regarding {{the issue of}} whether NATO airstrikes or the two ground offensives contributed more towards the resolution of the Bosnian War, and to <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> ARBiH, HVO and HV advances were helped by, or conversely the VRS hampered by, NATO bombing. In 2011, five former Croatian military personnel were convicted of war crimes for the summary execution of five Bosnian Serb soldiers and an unknown civilian during the offensive.|$|E

For this purpose, this paper aims to develop a framework for the process of diasporic Chinese community building (CCB) in general and for the local engagement of Chinese international students in the UK in particular. Research questions include: To <b>what</b> <b>extents</b> can Chinese students be viewed as part of diasporic Chinese communities? By what channels can they be interconnected with the wider society? Where are resources, interfaces and barriers against their participations and contribution to the CCB? Based upon a questionnaire survey in Nottingham, four types of social networking among Chinese students are identified, and the relationships with their behaviours in community engagement and implications for the CCB are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} measures {{the potential of}} mobile content in learning to increase users' tacit knowledge development. Concentration is given {{on the effectiveness of}} incorporating game-based learning into mobile technology as a new edutainment instructional model. A comparative study on selected mobile content platforms is carried out to examine to <b>what</b> <b>extents</b> the usage of game are being applied in learning from the users perspective. A survey is conducted on the users' reaction on the impacts of mobile technology and its content impact on the traditional and conventional learning method. A perceptual test is carried out to support the survey. This research proposes a framework on how mobile technology and its content could shape the learning in future. With the emergence of new tools and media, mobile content is suggested as a powerful means to increase tacit knowledge via the exploration of interactivity, multimedia and 3 d animation for creative edutainment and communication in the future...|$|R

5|$|Analysis of her visions is {{problematic}} since {{the main source}} of information on this topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness' oath and specifically refused to answer every question about her visions. She complained that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain confidentiality about meetings with her king. It remains unknown to <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> the surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials or her own possible fabrications to protect state secrets. Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.|$|E
5|$|As the Monbar {{case and}} similar cases came to light, the GAL issue became {{increasingly}} controversial in the 1990s, with questions over whether {{members of the}} Spanish government and state security service had known about the group's operations in places like Bayonne and, if so, to <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> they had supported and funded the attacks. This became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general election with Spanish Interior Minister, José Barrionuevo, and his security chief, Rafael Vera, implicated in the GAL case. In 1998, both were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and {{misappropriation of public funds}} to finance the GAL. Along with various corruption scandals and the poor state of the Spanish economy in the mid-1990s, the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the PSOE defeat.|$|E
