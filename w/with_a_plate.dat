5|$|The {{calutron}} {{is a type}} of sector mass spectrometer, {{an instrument}} in which a sample is ionized and then accelerated by electric fields and deflected by magnetic fields. The ions ultimately collide <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> and produce a measurable electric current. Since the ions of the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses, the heavier isotopes are deflected less by the magnetic field, causing the beam of particles to separate out into several beams by mass, striking the plate at different locations. The mass of the ions can be calculated according to the strength of the field and the charge of the ions. During World War II, calutrons were developed to use this principle to obtain substantial quantities of high-purity uranium-235, by taking advantage of the small mass difference between uranium isotopes.|$|E

25|$|Nero and Octavia {{were married}} on June 9, 53. Claudius later repented of marrying Agrippina and {{adopting}} Nero, began to favor Britannicus, and started preparing {{him for the}} throne. His actions allegedly gave Agrippina a motive to eliminate Claudius. The ancient sources say she poisoned Claudius on October 13, 54 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> of deadly mushrooms at a banquet, thus enabling Nero to quickly take the throne as emperor. Accounts vary wildly with regard to this private incident and according to more modern sources, it is possible (but exceedingly convenient) that Claudius died of natural causes; Claudius was 63 years old.|$|E
25|$|In {{the evening}} of 23 June, Clive {{received}} a letter from Mir Jafar asking for a meeting with him. Clive replied that he would meet Mir Jafar at Daudpur the next morning. When Mir Jafar arrived at the British camp at Daudpur in the morning, Clive embraced him and saluted him as the Nawab of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha. He then advised Mir Jafar to hasten to Murshidabad to prevent Siraj's escape and the plunder of his treasure. Mir Jafar reached Murshidabad with his troops on {{the evening of}} 24 June. Clive arrived at Murshidabad on 29 June with a guard of 200 European soldiers and 300 sepoys in the wake of rumours of a possible attempt on his life. Clive was taken to the Nawab's palace, where he was received by Mir Jafar and his officers.

500|$|Meteor Studios {{produced}} the roller-coaster and subway crashes, and Digital Dimension handled the individual post-premonition death scenes. The death of Ian McKinley, who is bisected by a cherry picker, was especially challenging. A clean plate of the bucket falling was originally shot <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> of Lemche acting crushed and {{falling to the}} ground, with his bottom half in a partial green-screen suit. After setting those plates, Wong said that [...] "he wanted more of a gruesome punch for the shot". A standard CGI body of Lemche's height was used; several animation simulations of crushing the body with a CGI object were filmed, and the director picked the version he liked the most. A new plate was then filmed, with Lemche imitating the chosen animation and positioning his body at the end. The scene in which Ashley and Ashlyn are killed in tanning beds was handled by Soho VFX instead of Digital Dimension. It consisted of about 35 shots of CG skin, glass, fire and smoke mixed with live fire and smoke. For the subway crash in the film's epilogue, a CG environment reproducing the main volumes of the set was generated. The film was edited by Chris G. Willingham, the Emmy-winning editor of 24 (2001–2010).|$|E

A similar system was used in 1831 by the American Charles Condert, who died in 1832 while testing his invention in the East River at only [...] deep. After having travelled to England and discovering William James' invention, the French physician Manuel Théodore Guillaumet, from Argentan in (Normandy), patented the oldest known regulator mechanism in 1838. Guillaumet's invention was air-supplied from the surface and was never mass-produced due to problems with safety.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} datable evidence, however, is a 1603 royal warrant entitling {{the governor}} of Derry to hold fairs and markets at which horse races could be staged. Horse racing was evidently popular in the 17th century: a 1622 poem tells of a jockey killed participating in a horse race in Carrickfergus, while other accounts mention a 1634 race between Lord Digby and the Earl of Ormond, and the establishment in 1682 of a race by Lord Kildare, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> of 40 pounds to the winner.

The brothers decided to try again following the success of indie video game Super Meat Boy, developed by Team Meat, in 2010.

The Moldenhauers emulated the animation because they found it strange, and [...] "right away it stuck".

The Duke's widow and their three other children survived the Russian revolution and emigrated to western Europe. Natalia died in Cannes France in 1921. The couple's youngest child and only son, George Alexander, was adopted by his uncle Karl-Michael, and then took the title of Duke of Mecklenburg, Count of Carlow. After the other lines of the house of Mecklenburg died out his descendants became their sole heirs. Georg Alexander's great-grandson, Duke Borwin, is the current head of the House of Mecklenburg.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Hiyya {{said that}} Abram's father Terah {{manufactured}} idols (as [...] implies), and once Terah went away and left Abram {{to mind the}} store. A man came and asked to buy an idol. Abram asked the man how old he was. The man replied that he was 50 years old. Abram exclaimed {{that it was a}} shame that a man of 50 would worship a day-old object. The man became embarrassed and left. On another occasion, a woman came <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> of flour and asked Abram to offer it to the idols. Abram took a stick, broke the idols, and put the stick in the largest idol's hand. When Terah returned, he demanded that Abram explain what he had done. Abram told Terah that the idols fought among themselves to be fed first, and the largest broke the others with the stick. Terah asked Abram why he made sport of him, for the idols had no consciousness. Abram replied by asking Terah to listen to what he had just said. Thereupon Terah seized Abram and delivered him to Nimrod, king of Shinar. Nimrod proposed that they worship the fire. Abram replied that they should rather worship water, which extinguishes fire. Nimrod agreed to worship water. Abram replied that they should rather worship clouds, which bear the water. Nimrod agreed to worship the clouds. Abram replied that they should rather worship the winds, which disperse the clouds. Nimrod agreed to worship the wind. Abram replied that they should rather worship human beings, who withstand the wind. Nimrod then accused Abram of just bandying words, and decreed that they would worship nothing but the fire. Nimrod cast Abram into the fire, challenging Abram's God to save him from it. Haran was standing there undecided. Haran thought to himself that if Abram survived, then Haran would say that he was of Abram's faith, but if Nimrod was victorious, then Haran would say that he was on Nimrod's side. When Abram descended into the fiery furnace, God saved him. Nimrod then asked Haran whose belief he shared. Haran replied that he shared Abram's faith. Thereupon Nimrod cast Haran into the fire, and he died in his father's presence, as [...] reports, [...] "And Haran died in the presence of ( [...] , al pene) his father Terah." ...|$|E
