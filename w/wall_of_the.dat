5|$|Another change {{inspired}} by the move was a return for the Football Echo man. The cartoon character had for years indicated the match results of Sunderland with a smile, a frown or a tear, while adorning the outside <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bridge Street building.

5|$|Some medieval rabbis {{claimed that}} today's Western Wall is a {{surviving}} <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest {{they enter the}} Temple precincts {{in a state of}} impurity. Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness. Most secular scholars believe however that these traditions originally pertained to a western <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temple itself, and since the 1500s, were gradually applied to the surviving retaining Western <b>Wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mount.|$|E

5|$|An {{earthquake}} in 1302 caused damage to al-Azhar {{and a number}} of other mosques throughout Mamluk territory. The responsibility for reconstruction was split among the amirs (princes) of the Sultanate and the head of the army, Amir Salar, who was tasked with repairing the damage. These repairs were the first done since the reign of Baibars. Seven years later a dedicated school, the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya, was built along the northwest <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mosque. Portions of the <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mosque were removed to accommodate the new building. Construction of another school, the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya began in 1332–1333. This building, which was completed in 1339-1340, would also impact the structure of the mosque as it was built over the site of the mida'a, the fountain for ablution. Both of the madrasas were built as complementary buildings to al-Azhar, with separate entrances and prayer halls.|$|E

5|$|Chōdō-in was a {{rectangular}} walled enclosure situated {{directly to the}} north of the Suzakumon gate in the centre of the southern <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greater Palace.

5|$|Cyathus olla has -shaped spores with {{dimensions}} of 10–146–8µm. In 1927, George Willard Martin examined the microscopic features of {{various members of}} the Nidulariaceae family, including Cyathus olla. He noted that in this species, the basidia—spore-bearing cells—are club-shaped or cylindrical and have long stems, and they sometimes have a clamp connection at the basal end of the structure. Basidia typically hold between two and four sessile spores that are directly attached to the basidium, rather than via a sterigma. Revealed only after the spore is separated, a temporary apiculus marks the point of attachment. The spores are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a gelatinization of cells lining the inside <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peridiole. After separating from the basidia the outer <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spores may thicken, although they generally do not increase in size.|$|E
