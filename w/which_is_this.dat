King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to be with an American woman, Wallis Simpson, and that's part of my story, so I've had to do an enormous amount of research and interview people.

He focused his early {{work on the}} Bermudian genus Poecilozonites, while his later work concentrated on the West Indian genus Cerion. According to Gould [...] "Cerion is the land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world. There are 600 described species of this single genus. In fact, they're not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> incredible morphological diversity.

And if we could solve this we'd learn something general about the evolution of form." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{publications}} and analysts predicted {{the failure of}} Apple Stores. It was thought {{that because of the}} stores' diminutive size and non-aggressive sales team, Apple would succeed in presenting the Mac but fail in making a significant number of sales. However, the Apple retail program established its merits, bypassing the sales-per-square-foot measurement of competing nearby stores, and in 2004 reached $1 billion in annual sales, the fastest of any retailer in history. Sales continued to grow, reaching $1 billion a quarter by 2006. Then-CEO Steve Jobs said that [...] "People haven't been willing to invest this much time and money or engineering in a store before", adding that [...] "It's not important if the customer knows that. They just feel it. They feel something's a little different." [...] In 2011, Apple Stores in the United States had an average revenue of $473,000 for each employee. According to the research firm RetailSails, the Apple Store chain ranked first among U.S. retailers in terms of sales per unit area in 2011, with sales of $3,085per square feet, almost doubling Tiffany & Co., the second retailer on the list.

"'Pretences, subterfuges, lies!' exclaimed the Austrian and Allied Public everywhere, or {{strove to}} exclaim; {{especially}} the English Public, {{which had no}} difficulty in so doing;--a Public comfortably blank as to German facts or non-facts; and finding with amazement only this a very certain fact, That hereby is their own Pragmatic thunder checked in mid-volley in a most surprising manner, and the triumphant Cause of Liberty brought to jeopardy again.

6000|$|Now {{a promise}} of {{remission}} of sins supposeth a righteousness going before; for there is no forgiveness of sins, nor promise of forgiveness, {{for the sake of}} righteousness that shall be by us, but that already found in Christ as head, and so imputed to the elect for their remission. [...] "God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you," [...] Eph. iv. 32; For Christ's sake; that this, {{for the sake of the}} righteousness of Christ. Imputed righteousness must be first; yea, it must be before forgiveness, and forgiveness is extended by God then when we lie in our blood, though to us it is manifested afterwards. Therefore it is OF faith; he saith not BY it, respecting the act of faith, but of, respecting the doctrine or word which presenteth me with this blessed imputed righteousness: they that are of faith are the children of faithful Abraham. They that are of the doctrine of faith, for all the elect are the sons of that doctrine in <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> righteousness of Christ contained; yea, they are begotten by it of God to this inheritance, to their comfortable enjoyment of the comfort of it by faith.|$|E
