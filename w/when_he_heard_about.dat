Howard's defensive line was not a particularly strong one in the north. He was soon outnumbered (his XI Corps, still suffering the effects of their defeat at the Battle of Chancellorsville, had only 8,700 effectives), and the terrain his men occupied in the north was poorly selected for defense. He held out some hope that reinforcements from Slocum's XII Corps would arrive up the Baltimore Pike in time to make a difference.|$|E

25|$|In early 1919, Harcourt was {{attending}} a staff {{course in the}} United Kingdom <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the deteriorating situation in North Russia. Hoping to secure {{a position on the}} Relief Force that was being sent, Harcourt went to the War Office where he offered his services. Due to his experience with the Machine Gun Corps, he was offered command of a machine gun unit with the acting rank of major. However, the unit had not been formed and Harcourt was told that it was up to him to carry out his own recruiting. Having met a number of Australian soldiers during the previous war, Harcourt decided to go to the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) headquarters at Horseferry Road, where he spoke to a number of officers and other ranks who were still waiting for repatriation to Australia. Finding that there was considerable enthusiasm, particularly amongst the other ranks, Harcourt eventually arranged for the recruitment of between 400 and 500 Australians into the British Army for service in Russia although in the end only about 150–300 Australians completed the process.|$|E

Apparently he was successfully enlisted. The next time he met his cousin Eugene Paul Baworowski in the streets of Warsaw in the first days of occupation he was about {{to get in touch with}} the Polish Resistance. As the 6 September 1939 decree issued by the Wehrmacht command pursued every Polish citizen who reached the military age to be sent to a POW camp the Gestapo soon arrested and sent him to a camp.

25|$|Upon {{receiving}} news of Liu Bei's attack, Zheng Du (鄭度), an Assistant Officer (從事) from Guanghan Commandery (廣漢郡) serving under Liu Zhang, {{pointed out}} to his lord that Liu Bei's army lacked supplies and was composed of newly recruited soldiers who might not be loyal to him. He suggested that Liu Zhang adopt a scorched earth policy against Liu Bei by forcing the residents of Baxi (巴西) and Zitong (梓潼) commanderies to relocate elsewhere and destroy all the granaries and supply depots in the commanderies, and then fortify their defences while avoiding direct conflict with Liu Bei. He claimed that if this strategy was implemented, Liu Bei would run out of supplies within 100 days and retreat, and then Liu Zhang could attack {{him while he was}} retreating. Liu Bei felt frustrated <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Zheng Du's plan and consulted Fa Zheng about it. Fa Zheng predicted that Liu Zhang would not heed Zheng Du's suggestion and was proven right: In response to Zheng Du's plan, Liu Zhang not only rejected it {{on the grounds that it}} would cause disturbance to the people, but also dismissed Zheng from office.|$|E
5000|$|Takeshi Obata, {{artist of}} Death Note, said that, since Ohba wanted to [...] "include a little L" [...] in Near and Mello, {{he tried to}} keep [...] "the weirdness and the panda eyes".

Obata said that, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Near and Mello, he assumed that Near and Mello would join as a team and work together, so he envisioned the two as twins <b>when</b> <b>he</b> created the character designs. Obata stated that he originally thought about creating Near as [...] "a bit more mature mentally". Obata said that he created a [...] "cooler looking version of L" [...] design and considered using a younger version of that design.

50|$|In {{his tale}} of the legend, Feijoo offers {{a great deal of}} details, dates and names. <b>He</b> claims that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the fish-man's story, he could not believe it, but after having confronted all the testimonies and {{documents}} on the case that had survived, as well as interviewing several people who had lived when the fish-man had purportedly appeared (Feijoo wrote around 1720, so many people living in 1674 could have told him the tale). He finally concluded that, as far as the facts were concerned, a fish-man had appeared in Cadiz, had been taken to Liérganes, and lived there for some time before disappearing again. He quoted several sources of which, being educated people, he seemed confident enough, including the Marquis of Valbuena (a finely educated nobleman from Santander), don Gaspar Melchor de la Riba Agüero (a knight from the Order of Santiago from Gajano, a town near Liérganes), and don Dionisio Rubalcava from Solares, who allegedly knew and met Francisco de la Vega.|$|R
50|$|Another tale is {{much like}} the one before: Some warriors did not want Popoca to be with Izta, since they liked her themselves, and sent a message to the emperor saying that Popoca died; Izta became very sad and died of grief. <b>When</b> Popoca returned, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Izta's death and became sad himself. He went out of town with Izta's body and ordered his {{soldiers}} to make a mound for him and Izta. He put Izta's body on one mound and got onto the other with a smoking torch. He remains there forever, looking after Izta, and, as time passed, dirt, snow, rocks, and Mother Nature covered them, turning them into great mountains. Popoca's torch is still smoking as a reminder of what happened.|$|R

He invited Xu Shu's mother to meet him {{and asked her to}} write a letter to her son, requesting that her son come to join him.

The furious Cao Cao ordered Xu Shu's mother to be executed but changed his mind when Cheng Yu reminded him that Xu Shu would be more determined to help Liu Bei oppose him if he killed his mother. Cao Cao then had Xu Shu's mother detained and asked Cheng Yu to pretend to be Xu Shu's sworn brother to win the trust of Xu's mother. After some time, Cheng Yu got close to Xu Shu's mother and learnt to mimic her handwriting. He wrote a letter to Xu Shu in the handwriting of Xu's mother, telling Xu that she was in trouble and urging him to come to the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) quickly. Xu Shu was a filial son so he immediately left for Xu after reading the letter.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to how}} the riots began. According to one source they were sparked by a {{physical}} altercation between a Japanese marine and a local ricksha puller, in which the latter was seriously injured. When a coolie attempted to come to the assistance of the ricksha puller, the marine stabbed him through the heart with his sword. Rather than disciplining the marine for his conduct, the Japanese naval commander ordered a detachment of troops to fire machine guns at a crowd of protestors who had gathered around the concession. The conflict between Japanese troops and Chinese protestors eventually led to dozens of fatalities. According to Japanese reports little after 3:00 PM on 3 April Chinese children threw stones at two sailors who were passing by Tsumazuru, a luxury restaurant on Xiechang Road in the Japanese concession in Hankou. In the ensuing verbal altercation, about 30 Chinese turned upon the sailors and then a group of rickshaw pullers surrounded them and started to beat them. The sailors knocked over one of the rickshaw men and took refuge in the nearby restaurant Yamayoshi. Immediately Chinese onlookers entered the fray and both Yamayoshi and a neighbouring restaurant, the Naniwa Buffet, were utterly destroyed. To make matters worse, false rumors were spread that Japanese sailors had killed Chinese and that a rickshaw man had been stabbed with a knife. Just then, near Pinghe Street on the northern side of the Japanese concession, a group of Chinese who were taking part in the celebratory procession of an organizational meeting of the farmers’ association instead stormed the Japanese concession, two thirds of which was engulfed by the mob. When they saw Japanese people, they surrounded them and beat them, and Japanese businesses were attacked one by one. The attacks of these rioters were undertaken in a thorough and precise manner. The vice-consul Tanaka rushed to the scene <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the disturbances but although he called out to the crowd that he was a consul, he was still assaulted. At the house of a certain Mr. Tamura near the barbershop at the corner of Nanxiao Road and Pinghe Street the mob found his wife, who was lying in a sickbed shortly after giving birth, and kicked her to death before abandoning her corpse where they killed her.|$|E
