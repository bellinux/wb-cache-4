They demoted Brother Justin to an ordinary Christian minister in a little town, but when Brother Justin's affiliation needed to be decided, Knauf contested plans to make him a Catholic priest; he rather settled on the Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less suspicious and controversial. Although Brother Justin shares traits <b>with</b> <b>Father</b> Coughlin, an Irish Catholic priest who broadcast his sermons over the radio in the 1930s, the writers never tried to retell that particular story.|$|E

5|$|Godwin's books {{begin to}} {{incorporate}} religious themes starting <b>with</b> <b>Father</b> Melancholy's Daughter (1991). The novel is told {{from the perspective}} of multiple characters, each of whom have a different perspective on religion. Father Melancholy's Daughter was followed by several books that centered on the Episcopal church and Christian practices. In these novels female and male characters have a more equal influence on the events and plot than in prior novels. Godwin's books neither evangelize nor mock the practices of the Episcopal Church, but rather treat it as a routine aspect of life, or as a subject of intellectual interest. During these years Godwin's books continued to show father figures who have died or are absent. By 1996 two of her books had fathers that died and five had stepfathers that are depicted as intruding on the mother-daughter relationship.|$|E

At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, the numbers of French Spaniels dropped so low that they nearly became extinct due to competition from foreign sporting dogs, in particular as French hunters chose to hunt particularly with English breeds of hunting dogs. A French priest named Father Fournier undertook the task of gathering the remaining French Spaniels in his Saint Hillaire kennels in order to preserve the breed. There he built the lineages that are representatives of those we now have. The French Spaniel Club was founded in 1921, <b>with</b> <b>Father</b> Fournier {{as the president of the}} association.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relation}} between parent-child conflicts and parental support during early adolescence and anxiety symptoms of adolescents during middle adolescence. This study also examined whether these associations differ for fathers and mothers. Methods: In this longitudinal design 497 Dutch adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (M age T 1 = 13, 03; 56, 7 % boys and 43, 3 % girls) participated. This study consisted of 6 waves and adolescents completed two questionnaires about the degree of parental support and conflict <b>with</b> <b>fathers</b> (M age T 1 = 46, 74) and mothers (M age T 1 = 44, 41) and their anxiety. The majority of the adolescents lived in medium or high social economic groups (87, 7 %). Results: The hierarchical regression analyses showed that conflict <b>with</b> <b>fathers</b> over time was significantly and positively related to anxiety symptoms in both adolescent boys and girls. A positive significant relation was found between conflict with mothers and anxiety symptoms of girls. Regarding parent-child conflicts, conflict <b>with</b> <b>fathers</b> was more important in the relation to anxiety symptoms contrary to conflict with mothers. Parental support of both fathers and mothers was not associated with anxiety symptoms of adolescents. Conclusion: Conflict <b>with</b> <b>fathers</b> during early adolescence can play an important role in the development of anxiety problems during middle adolescence in both boys and girls. Conflict with mothers during early adolescence predicted especially anxiety symptoms in girls during middle adolescence. This present study suggests that conflict <b>with</b> <b>fathers</b> during adolescence may not be underestimated...|$|R
