40|$|While {{political}} {{praise and}} condemnation of Disney is commonplace in the literature, my research will focus {{instead on the}} origination of Disney 2 ̆ 7 s design plan for Disneyland and the theoretical and physical connections between key historical figures and the finished product. I will not consider what Disneyland means to the world today [...] -that is a subject many others have covered, some even brilliantly; instead, I will consider what social concepts contributed to the initial design {{in an attempt to}} see the underlying values at work in this post-modern utopia. In this thesis, I intend to show that Walt Disney 2 ̆ 7 s initial design for Disneyland was influenced by Ebenezer Howard 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Garden</b> <b>City</b> concept. In addition to Howard 2 ̆ 7 s vision, Disney also incorporated concepts from Frank Lloyd Wright 2 ̆ 7 s architecture and Henry Ford 2 ̆ 7 s mass market manufacturing theories. I do not intend to claim that these are the only influences on Disney 2 ̆ 7 s initial plan for his amusement park, but I will show that the physical layout of the park reflects Howard 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Garden</b> <b>City</b> plan, the architecture considers some of Wright 2 ̆ 7 s designs, and the way the park is run incorporates some of the ideas of Henry Ford. I have purposely avoided any works that consider the corporate aspects of Disney and the current Disney Corporation. Instead, I have focused my research on the intentions surrounding Disney 2 ̆ 7 s initial design plan. My position is that Disney 2 ̆ 7 s parks are real, successful, and expanding internationally - not mere fantasy like earlier 19 th social reformers whose actual accomplishments are relatively small and have not been not sustainable locally or internationally. Disney realized the importance of a TEMPORARY place rather than a PERMANENT residence. Disney understood the literal definition of utopia to mean 2 ̆ 2 no where 2 ̆ 2 and therefore did not create a utopia that was a real place. Both Howard and Disney sought to offer a utopia. Howard had hopes of revitalizing the social order with his new cities, and Disney hoped to offer the average family a place where they could have fun and enjoy one another in a safe and entertaining environment...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the 1920 <b>s</b> <b>gardens.</b> By {{investigating}} and comparing two villa gardens, from the 1920 s, with the conformation of today and the literature written during the same period, have I tried to describe what characterizes a garden from the 1920 s. The 1920 s villa in classical style, is a very common type of house in almost every Swedish town. During the 1920 <b>s,</b> <b>garden</b> <b>cities</b> developed in the outskirts of the city. They were built in times of crisis, for the overcrowded workers and the middle class. The idea of the <b>garden</b> <b>city</b> was that the people would have the opportunity to live better and be able to own or rent their own land. It was also important to be able to grow and enjoy a private garden. In the garden literature written in the 1920 s, you were given clear directives of how to build and grow your garden. They should be practical as well as enjoyable, but above all, useful. It should be possible to grow your own vegetables, fruits and flowers. The fence was a must. A wooden fence or a hedge were most common. Facing the street, it was often trimmed ornamental trees in rows. A few beautiful shrubs were allowed to stand in the lawn, while bushes with raspberry or gooseberries were planted at the property line or nearby the kitchen garden. The flowerbeds should be placed along the house or follow the main aisle. The gravel paths was conveniently placed, often in straight lines and led to the kitchen garden, outbuildings or the more or less mandatory arbor.

40|$|Singapore {{successfully}} {{achieved the}} Global <b>City</b> in a <b>Garden,</b> because of good political will, careful planning and strict development control {{initiated by the}} former PM Lee Kuan Yew in 1960 - 1970 <b>s.</b> The <b>Garden</b> <b>City</b> Vision was originally proposed by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and it was later materialised by Parks and Recreation Department (or later named The National Parks Board/ NParks). The NParks vision was to join the national effort creating the best environment for Singaporean and residents to live work and play in, meanwhile its pillars of progress were to grow Singapore�’s Garden infrastructure, to cultivate Singapore as premier horticulture hub and to ignite the community passion for greenery. Park Connector Network (PCN) in Singapore was an integrated approach of Greening and Recreational Strategy. It generated the social and recreational activities in the neighbourhood as well as increased biodiversity within. For example, UluPandan Park Connector was found popularly used. Meanwhile, it also served as habitat for native species of birds. This showed that PCN also contributed to successful conservation and environmental sustainability of the City (Briffet, 2004). Further improvement of PCN was conducted with benchmarking research, infrastructure improvement. And this effort proved excellent initiatives from Singapore Government for sustainable recreational activities. It also could be transformed to other countries as one integrated sustainable greening and recreational strategy...|$|R
