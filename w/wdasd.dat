40|$|As the {{advanced}} information acquiring technology, {{wireless sensor networks}} are being applied {{in more and more}} areas. Data aggregation is the effective information processing to solve the energy saving problem of WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). Most existing data aggregation algorithm discuss fusion problem in the scene that the number of nodes is fixed. However, the amount of data transmitted is directly proportional to the number of nodes. Hence the appropriate strategy should be that the number of nodes is alterable under the satisfaction of performance. In this paper, sequential detection is applied in data aggregation for wireless sensor network. And the mathematical model is established. Considering the fading problem of wireless channel and the characters of physical layer, WSN data aggregation with sequential detection (<b>WDASD)</b> is proposed. The characters of <b>WDASD</b> are tested by simulations. In the end, a cross-layer scheme is proposed and simulation test is made to validate it...|$|E
50|$|In 1934, Miller {{sold the}} station, {{and the new}} owners, silk {{manufacturers}} Dannenbaum & Steppacher, adopted the <b>WDAS</b> call sign. <b>WDAS</b> broadcast various ethnic programming in languages such as Italian, Yiddish and Polish. In 1941, <b>WDAS</b> moved to 1400 AM, then about 15 years later to its current position of 1480 AM.|$|R
50|$|By 1989, WDAS-FM {{evolved into}} a successful, community-oriented Urban Adult Contemporary format after that, as <b>WDAS</b> (AM) had flipped to Urban Gospel. In 1994, Unity Broadcasting sold both <b>WDAS</b> {{stations}} to Beasley Broadcast Group. In 1995, when the Tom Joyner Morning Show went syndicated nationwide through ABC, WDAS-FM became a flagship affiliate. In May 1996, Beasley sold <b>WDAS</b> to Evergreen, which owned WUSL, making WDAS-AM and FM and WUSL sister stations. In 1997, Evergreen and Chancellor merged to form Chancellor Media and later restructured in 1999 as AMFM, Inc. In 2000, Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) acquired AMFM.|$|R

40|$|Estimation {{of solar}} energy {{potential}} of a region requires detailed solar radiation climatology, and {{it is necessary to}} collect extensive radiation data of high accuracy covering all climatic zones of the region. In this regard, a wireless data acquisition system (<b>WDAS)</b> would help to estimate solar energy potential considering the remote region's energy requirement. This article explains the design and implementation of <b>WDAS</b> for assessment of solar energy. The proposed system consists of a set of sensors for measuring meteorological parameters. The collected data are first conditioned using precision electronic circuits and then interfaced to a PC using RS 232 connection via wireless unit. The LabVIEW program is used to further process, display and store the collected data in the PC disk. The proposed architecture permits the rapid system development and has the advantage of flexibility and it can be easily extended for controlling the renewable energy systems like photovoltaic system. The <b>WDAS</b> with executive information systems and reporting tools helps to tap vast data resources and deliver information.

5000|$|Henderson {{began his}} {{broadcast}} career in 1952 at Baltimore station WSID, and in 1953 began broadcasting in Philadelphia on WHAT. He hosted {{a show called}} Jocko's Rocket Ship Show out of New York radio stations WOV and WADO and Philadelphia stations WHAT and <b>WDAS</b> from 1954 to 1964, which was an early conduit for rock & roll. He was known for a distinctive style of rhythmic patter in his radio voice, which he had learned from a Baltimore deejay, Maurice [...] "Hot Rod" [...] Hulbert. Henderson continued on the stations <b>WDAS</b> and WHAT until 1974, deejaying in Philadelphia and New York as well as hosting concerts in both cities and a TV music program in New York.

50|$|In 1951, Leon {{promoted}} his son-in-law, Bob Klein, {{to general}} manager. Klein {{saw an opportunity}} in the marketplace and quickly adopted programming geared toward the local African-American community. The music consisted of jazz and rhythm & blues. <b>WDAS</b> added a number of young personalities, including Georgie Woods, Jimmy Bishop, Carl Helm, Butterball Tamburro, Jocko Henderson and Hy Lit. The station also added black-oriented public affairs and news programs, and provided in-depth coverage of the unfolding civil rights movement, featuring award-winning and groundbreaking journalists Joe Rainey and Jim Klash,along with Walt Sanders, Carl Stubbs, Bill Adams, Dave Colman, Jimmy Carter and later, reporter Ed Bradley (later of TV's 60 Minutes). The station employed many blacks, in on-air, office and management positions. The station also took on an activist role in the movement. <b>WDAS</b> was commended {{by many in the}} industry and in the civil rights movement. Leon and Klein signed on a sister FM station, WDAS-FM, in 1959. By the early 1970s, the station would launch a groundbreaking and influential urban adult contemporary format still used today.|$|R
