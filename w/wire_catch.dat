50|$|Canadarm2 has two LEEs, one at each end. A LEE has 3 snare <b>wires</b> to <b>catch</b> the grapple fixture shaft.|$|R
5000|$|The Syrian {{commander}} of the northern part ordered his men not to fire until the Israelis reached the <b>wire</b> to <b>catch</b> them in a kill zone. Only minutes later, his deputy reported that [...] "the Jews are already inside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why the {{submarine}} {{must have been}} flying a kite, with a pendent <b>wire,</b> to <b>catch</b> messages from Blake and the wireless machine at Castle Skrae. How else could a kite--"a dragon," [...] the sailor said--have been flying above the empty sea?' ...|$|R
30|$|Physiotherapy for rehabilitating both joint ROM {{and muscle}} control is needed. A pin site care regime will help {{minimise}} problems; many different protocols exist but scientific evidence is sparse [21]. The potential for <b>wires</b> to <b>catch</b> synovial reflections at the tibial plateau should caution against very proximal wire placement; perforation of the synovium should be suspected if any wire site persistently drains serous fluid, and arrangements {{should be made}} to relocate the wire.|$|R
60|$|Farmer Brown's boy {{was almost}} there when Danny stopped gnawing. There {{was only a}} tiny bit of the stake left now, and Danny hurried to tell Peter Rabbit that there was nothing to stop him now from going to his most secret retreat in {{the very heart of the}} Old Briar-patch. While Peter slowly dragged his way along, Danny trotted behind to see that the <b>wire</b> did not <b>catch</b> on the bushes.|$|R
2500|$|Corvids (crows, [...] ravens and [...] rooks) {{are well}} known for their large brains (among birds) and {{subsequent}} tool use. They mainly manufacture probes out of twigs and wood (and sometimes metal <b>wire)</b> to <b>catch</b> or impale larvae. Crows are among the only animals that create their own toys. Tool use in other birds is best exemplified in nest intricacy. Warblers manufacture 'pouches' to make their nests in. Some birds, such as weaver birds build complex nests. Finches and woodpeckers may insert twigs into trees in order to catch or impale larvae. Parrots may use tools to wedge nuts {{so that they may}} crack it open (using a tool) without launching it away. Some birds take advantage of human activity, such as seagulls which drop shellfish in front of cars to crack them open.|$|R
50|$|A burglar {{breaks into}} a country house after scaling the garden wall. He is spotted by a boy who runs to alert the police. Two policemen arrive and climb the wall. After a {{struggle}} {{with one of the}} policemen, the burglar throws him off the roof. An ambulance arrives and takes away the injured policeman. Meanwhile, the burglar escapes and is chased by the other policeman across the countryside, but escapes on a train. The police <b>wire</b> ahead and <b>catch</b> him at the next station.|$|R
50|$|Claire {{was arrested}} {{when a large}} {{quantity}} of the drug Ice was found on her. The Drug Squad told Duncan that the charges against her would go away if she would wear a <b>wire</b> to help <b>catch</b> the Drug Dealers. Duncan said that Claire would not participate in this unless he was in on it. Senior Sergeant Stanley Wolfe refused to let Duncan be a part in this. Eventually the Claire wore a wire, the operation went belly up and she along with Jumbo Watson from the Drug Squad were killed.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that pilots are graded based on the <b>wire</b> their tailhook <b>catches</b> on the pass. LSOs don't look at where the plane landed, they look at how it got there. It is possible for a pilot to fly a safe pass and land on a 1 wire, {{it is also possible}} that a plane <b>catches</b> a 3 <b>wire</b> and the landing is unsafe. Under normal circumstances, on Nimitz class carriers the targeted hook touchdown point is halfway between the two wire and the three wire.|$|R
5000|$|On 3 May 1967, a Channel Airways Vickers Viscount 812 (registration G-AVJZ) {{was damaged}} beyond repair during a test flight to renew the aircraft's Certificate of Airworthiness {{as a result of}} {{propeller}} no. 4 being feathered shortly after takeoff from Southend Airport, causing the aircraft to enter an uncontrolled turn and scrape the ground with its right wingtip. This, in turn, caused the plane to crash into a <b>wire</b> fence compound, <b>catch</b> fire and kill two Aviation Traders workers on the ground. Although the aircraft was a complete write-off, none of the three crew members on board was hurt.|$|R
50|$|Pockets, usually rimmed at {{the back}} with leather or plastic, may have leather mesh or cloth bags or plastic cups, or {{elongated}} <b>wire</b> racks, to <b>catch</b> the balls, common in home billiard rooms and pool halls, or in the coin-operated tables found in bars/pubs may instead lead to ball-return troughs inside the table, which channel the balls into a collection chamber {{on one side of}} the table (or, in non-coin-op models, on the racking end of the table). A disadvantage to pockets with bags or cups is that if too many balls go into the same pocket, it will fill up the receptacle and prevent any more balls from going in that pocket, requiring that some be moved out of the pocket manually before shooting again.|$|R
40|$|Pelagic {{longline}} fisheries affect both {{market and}} vulnerable bycatch species and can have broad effects on community structure and processes. Observer {{data from the}} Palau longline fishery were analysed to identify opportunities to mitigate vulnerable species bycatch, determine temporal trends in local abundance, and assess changes following a ban on shark retention and <b>wire</b> leaders. <b>Catch</b> and haulback condition data for bigeye and yellowfin tunas, blue and silky sharks and pelagic stingrays were fitted to standardized catch and survival rate models. The fishery caught silky and blue sharks, olive ridley sea turtles and other species of conservation concern. Changing from shallow sets to deep daytime sets might reduce shark and sea turtle catch rates but increase turtle haulback mortality rates, maintain economically viable tuna catch rates, but increase catch rates of pelagic stingrays, a lower conservation concern than main caught species of sharks and turtles. Focusing fishing effort {{during the middle of}} the calendar year would maximize yellowfin tuna and minimize silky shark standardized catch rates, but maximize blue shark catch rates. A large decline in shark fishing mortality rate very likely occurred following a ban on shark retention and wire leaders. This was due to large reductions in the nominal shark catch rate and shark retention, partially offset by decreases in the shark haulback survival rate and pre-catch survival rate. Significantly higher blue shark and lower pelagic stingray nominal catch rates occurred on wire vs. monofilament leaders. Significantly higher blue shark and lower yellowfin tuna nominal catch rates occurred on sets using shallow ‘shark lines’. It is a research priority to compare the probability of shark pre-catch survival after escaping from monofilament leaders with an ingested hook and trailing line to the survival probability when captured on wire leaders...|$|R
50|$|The story {{takes place}} in East Berlin soon after the Berlin Wall is built, {{and is based on}} an actual escape on January 28, 1962. Kurt Schröder is a chauffeur to East German Major Eckhardt and his seductive wife Heidi, and lives within sight of the Wall. Kurt is having an affair with Heidi. One night he sees a friend, Günther Jurgens, who works at the garage where Kurt has the Major's car maintained, drive his truck into the wall, and get killed trying to escape to the west. Günther's sister, Erika, comes looking for Günther when he doesn't return, and is told that Kurt saw him last night. She then goes to Kurt's house, where he lives with his mother, Uncle Albrecht (a musician), sister Ingeborg and kid brother Helmut. Erika is intent on {{escaping}} to West Berlin, thinking that her brother made it. Kurt, reasonably satisfied with his life, has no intention of risking his life to attempt an escape. Erika then looks out beyond the barbed <b>wire,</b> but Kurt <b>catches</b> her as she tries to crawl under, and they pretend to be lovers to hide her intentions from suspicious guards. Kurt then hides her in his house. A piece of Erika's clothing is caught in the barbed wire, and the guards track her to the Schröder's house. She hides in a room without a floor, and narrowly escapes the guards after they conclude that she could not be in the room.|$|R
