With a deepening of research on <b>wetland</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> researchers have paid more and more attention to <b>wetland</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services such as flood mitigation, climate control, pollution prevention, soil-erosion prevention, biodiversity maintenance, and bio-productivity protection. This study focuses on a lakeside <b>wetland</b> <b>ecosystem</b> in Hefei, a city in central China, and estimates the value of ecosystem services such as material production, air purification, water conservation, biodiversity, recreation, species conservation, education and scientific research. We adopted the market value method, carbon tax method, afforestation cost method, shadow engineering method and contingent value method (CVM) using questionnaire survey data during the study period. The results show that the total value of the ecosystem services of Lakeside Wetland Park was 144 million CNY in 2015. Among these services, the value of society service is the maximum at 91. 73 million CNY, followed by ecological service and material production service (42. 23 million CNY and 10. 43 billion CNY in 2015 respectively).

40|$|The {{emergence}} of an epistemology of complexity is a contemporary phenomenon strongly based upon technology that has claimed new research needs and revitalize old studied themes. The study of wetlands can be considered in this interdisciplinary context. The ability to respond in an organized manner to disturbances caused by seasonal flooding, a characteristic of <b>wetlands</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> define them as complex systems. The spatio-temporal heterogeneity of floodplain river systems is responsible for a diverse array of dynamic aquatic habitats. Thus, natural disturbances, represented by flooding and responsible for intensifying ecosystem heterogeneity, are the main factor in maintaining the ecological integrity. This requires knowledge of long-term patterns of inundation to preserve geomorphic formations, in other words, habitat diversity. Nevertheless, the processes that control water, sediment and nutrients transfer through the floodplain are not well understood. The maintenance of river-floodplain connectivity has been recognized as a central strategy in ecosystem management. In this sense, remote sensing technology for a broad-scale systematic focus is particularly relevant. Research studies in this area provide new approaches for models useful in management on a regional scale. This chapter aims therefore to illustrate this wide research field involving current concepts and methodologies {{in order to improve}} the comprehension of the <b>wetlands</b> <b>ecosystems</b> as well as establish conservation criteria...|$|E
