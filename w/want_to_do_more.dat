500|$|In an {{interview}} by Neil Bennett from Digital Arts Magazine, Kricfalusi {{revealed that he}} would have taken a different approach to the animation if he were to animate the entire episode. Primarily, the animation would be slower paced {{than it was in the}} 35-second-long segment. The couch gag was done at a faster pace so he was able to include all of his ideas. Kricfalusi explains that [...] ", I would definitely keep on experimenting with the way they move and the acting. I'm sure I would do of my trademark long scenes of two characters interacting with each other without a cut. I would [...] <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> stuff with Marge. I loved animating her and was inspired by the way the Fleischers animated Olive Oyl. I couldn't animate a whole half hour myself, so I would hire other animators (and designers, painters, etc.) with strong styles and cast them according to which parts of the story would best take advantage of their individual talent." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in September 2008 and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. Lovato recalled the experience, [...] "It was like, O.K., you've done it. You're no longer just succeeding because you're in a movie with the Jonas Brothers. These people bought your music for you." [...] Later in February 2009, Lovato's first headlining sitcom, Sonny with a Chance, premiered on Disney Channel. Don't Forget was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and spawned two singles, [...] "Get Back" [...] and [...] "La La Land". In January 2009, Lovato announced to MTV News that she had already begun writing songs for her second studio album, as well as revealing its approach: [...] "It's {{going to take a}} different sound, so hopefully it goes over well. I sing a lot of rock, but this time I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> John Mayer-ish type of songs. Hopefully I can write with people like him. I love their music — it would be amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{features}} a musical score by Aaron Zigman, {{who was hired}} after Alison Krauss {{backed out of the}} job. Zigman mentioned that there are similarities between the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia and the film Flicka in that [...] "...at times there's a bit of a Celtic influence but not much", but he also {{went on to say that}} there was a more modern feel to the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia. He did so as Csupó requested him to do not compose [...] "your typical Hollywood Score"; he then mixed up orchestral melody with [...] "a bit of a modern flavor." [...] The score he composed for the film is described as [...] "very large" [...] compared to his other work, and Zigman commented that [...] "Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that I love to do, I also like big orchestral stuff, and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> of that, and this film enabled me to spread my wings out a bit." [...] The official soundtrack for the film was released as Music from and Inspired by Bridge to Terabithia by Hollywood Records on February 13, 2007.|$|E

2500|$|... "Christgau's blurbs", writes Slate {{music critic}} Jody Rosen, [...] "are {{like no one}} else's—dense with ideas and allusions, first-person confessions and invective, highbrow {{references}} and slang". Rosen describes Christgau's writing as [...] "often maddening, always thought-provoking... With Pauline Kael, Christgau is arguably {{one of the two}} most important American mass-culture critics of {{the second half of the}} 20th century.... All rock critics working today, at least the ones who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> than rewrite PR copy, are in some sense Christgauians." [...] Spin magazine wrote in 2015, [...] "You probably wouldn't be reading this publication if Robert Christgau didn’t largely invent rock criticism as we know it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Favreau had a {{clear vision}} of heavy metal music and guitars for the project, saying that Tony Stark {{was more of a}} rock star than a {{traditional}} superhero, and [...] "there’s Spider-man, Batman and all these superhero movies. This superhero movie’s different. I want to do something completely different, instead of going down the orchestral route. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> rock and roll." [...] Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra. Djawadi composed several themes for the character of Tony Stark, representing his different moods and attitudes, all inspired by Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance. Other themes for the film are [...] "not so much character based, but rather plot based that carry you through the movie". Musicians John O'Brien and Rick Boston, frequent collaborators with Favreau, provided a big band-style arrangement of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon The Marvel Super Heroes for a scene where Stark attends a casino.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 season, {{prior to}} the hiring of Gaston, the Blue Jays had a record of 35–39. Once Gaston and his coaches took over the Blue Jays went 51–37 to finish with an 86–76 record. The {{offensive}} improvements under Gaston {{were one of the}} reasons for the resurgence and as the hitting coach, Tenace was credited with rejuvenating a stagnant offense. Adam Lind commented: [...] "The thing is, a lot of people can teach you how to hit, but not a lot of people can teach you how to hit in the big leagues", referring to the major league experience of Gaston and Tenace.Blue Jays' former center fielder Vernon Wells has said he likes the approach to hitting that Tenace teaches: [...] "One thing Gene talks about is having that approach mentally when you go up there, in your mind you already guarantee yourself that one run on third, but you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> than that. Gene always says that first runner is a gimme, you should be able to come through in pretty much every situation like that. And then you try to do more damage than just that one run".|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} her life, she {{had become}} tired of the rape themes and school-girl roles which were common in her videos, but she enjoyed {{the fact that she was}} getting more {{dominant}} roles in her later AVs. [...] "Making men play along to me is something new so it's fun to do. I think that's the type of thing I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> of." [...] Nozomi's July, 2002 video release, Popular Actresses Fucking Virgin Boys, was in this genre. As the title implied, the video had Nozomi and two other AV actresses have sex with amateur virgin males, including a college student and a middle-aged man. Her video Home Delivery Call Girl, from August 2002, worked with a similar documentary-style concept. In this case, the actress appears at a male amateur's home to perform sex with him. A posthumously-released compilation DVD released by CineMagic from 2006, entitled La Vie En Nose, includes one of Nozomi's videos from 2002. This was the first in a series of DVDs focusing on a nose fetish, indicating that Nozomi had worked in that genre also.|$|E

They are as real to her as anything in this universe. I've proved their reality again and again. As I say, they have advised me in my investments and always right. In a sense--in a very real sense--I owe a part of my wealth to your mother, and the little that she has permitted me to do in return for her aid is trifling.

60|$|The Begging-Letter Writer {{often has}} an {{extensive}} circle of acquaintance. Whole {{pages of the}} 'Court Guide' are ready to be references for him. Noblemen and gentlemen write to say there never was such a man for probity and virtue. They have known him time out of mind, {{and there is nothing}} they wouldn't do for him. Somehow, they don't give him that one pound ten he stands in need of; but perhaps it is not enough - they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more,</b> and his modesty will not allow it. It is to be remarked of his trade that it is a very fascinating one. He never leaves it; and those who are near to him become smitten with a love of it, too, and sooner or later set up for themselves. He employs a messenger - man, woman, or child. That messenger is certain ultimately to become an independent Begging-Letter Writer. His sons and daughters succeed to his calling, and write begging-letters when he is no more. He throws off the infection of begging-letter writing, like the contagion of disease. What Sydney Smith so happily called 'the dangerous luxury of dishonesty' is more tempting, and more catching, it would seem, in this instance than in any other.|$|E
