5|$|At the time, Leigh was road manager, stage manager, chauffeur, {{and head}} of security. Vega, who contributed to the album's packaging, helped out with the road crew as much as possible. Tommy's friend Monte Melnick {{occasionally}} helped with the audio output, but this <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> done by Leigh.|$|E
5|$|Due to laxer laws about {{building}} housing on major roads, as London suburbs developed, properties {{were allowed to}} be built on the North Circular Road. The original purpose-built road had been designed with no speed limit, as <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> {{the case in the}} 1920s, but by 1951 a 30mph speed limit was enforced along the route.|$|E
5|$|Gunboat {{diplomacy}} <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> {{conducted by}} cruisers or smaller warships. A British squadron of three protected cruisers and two gunboats {{brought about the}} capitulation of Zanzibar in 1896; and while battleships participated in the combined fleet Western powers deployed during the Boxer rebellion, the naval part of the action was performed by gunboats, destroyers and sloops.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1980s, several sets of {{communication}} protocols emerged {{to fill the}} gaps between the data-link layer and the application layer of the OSI reference model. These included Appletalk, IPX, and NetBIOS with the dominant protocol set during the early 1990s being IPX due to its popularity with MS-DOS users. TCP/IP existed at this point, but it <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> only used by large government and research facilities.|$|E
5|$|M34 Prime Mover – M34 Prime Movers {{were simply}} M32B1 Recovery Vehicles without the towing cable and were just used for pulling towed {{artillery}} into place. It <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> reserved for pulling heavy artillery, {{such as the}} 240mm howitzer. It lacked any armament and had four seats for crew. The vehicle also had tail lights, electric outlets for stopping of towed loads, and multiple stowage ports. Production started in 1944 and ended in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The New Kingdom saw the Book of the Dead {{develop and}} spread further. The famous Spell 125, the 'Weighing of the Heart', is first {{known from the}} reign of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, c.1475 BCE. From this period onward the Book of the Dead <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> written on a papyrus scroll, and the text {{illustrated}} with vignettes. During the 19th dynasty in particular, the vignettes tended to be lavish, sometimes {{at the expense of}} the surrounding text.|$|E

5|$|The {{main belt}} armour would {{normally}} taper {{to a lesser}} thickness {{along the side of}} the hull towards bow and stern; it might also taper up from the central citadel towards the superstructure. The deck <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> lightly armoured with 2 to 4inches of steel. This lighter armour was to prevent high-explosive shells from wrecking the superstructure of the ship.|$|E
5|$|The small seated {{statue of}} Menkauhor wearing the robe of the Sed festival might suggest a longer reign, since this festival <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> celebrated {{only after a}} ruler had spent 30 years on the throne. However, Egyptologist Hartwig Altenmüller deems this {{hypothesis}} unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The text of a New Kingdom Book of the Dead <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> {{written in}} cursive hieroglyphs, most often {{from left to}} right, but also {{sometimes}} from right to left. The hieroglyphs were in columns, which were separated by black lines – a similar arrangement to that used when hieroglyphs were carved on tomb walls or monuments. Illustrations were put in frames above, below, or between the columns of text. The largest illustrations took up a full page of papyrus.|$|E

5|$|After work on UB-10 was {{complete}} at the Weser yard, she was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down {{into what was}} essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded onto eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, the sections of UB-10 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> a two- to three-week process. After UB-10 was assembled and launched on 20 February, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, more recent work has {{suggested}} that the regular army of the 2nd century was considerably larger than the c. 300,000 traditionally assumed. This is because the 2nd-century auxilia were not just equal in numbers to the legions as in the early 1st century, but some 50% larger. The army of the Principate probably reached a peak of nearly 450,000 (excluding fleets and foederati) {{at the end of the}} 2nd century. Furthermore, the evidence is that the actual strength of 2nd-century units <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> much closer to official (c. 85%) than 4th century units.|$|E
5|$|Early church {{buildings}} may originally {{have been}} wooden, like that excavated at Whithorn, but of those for which evidence survives from this era are basic masonry-built churches, beginning {{on the west}} coast and islands and spreading south and east. Early chapels tended to have square ended converging walls, similar to Irish chapels of this period. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings.|$|E

50|$|Polarization {{dependent}} isolators <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> used in {{free space}} optical systems. This {{is because the}} polarization of the source <b>is</b> <b>typically</b> maintained by the system. In optical fibre systems, the polarization direction <b>is</b> <b>typically</b> dispersed in non polarization maintaining systems. Hence the angle of polarization {{will lead to a}} loss.|$|R
50|$|The junk sail is a {{low tech}} {{approach}} to sailing and requires only inexpensive components. Spars <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> of wood. Lines for running rigging <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> 3-strand cordage rather than dual core braid. The sailcloth materials <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> light canvas or tarpaulin, used Dacron from discarded sails, or even PVC sheeting.|$|R
5|$|From a {{husbandry}} {{point of}} view, hyenas are easily kept, {{as they have}} few disease problems {{and it is not}} uncommon for captive hyenas to reach 15–20 years of age. Nevertheless, the spotted hyena was historically scantily represented in zoos, and <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> obtained in order to fill empty cages until a more prestigious species could be obtained. In subsequent years, animals considered to be more charismatic were allocated larger and better quality facilities, while hyenas were often relegated to inferior exhibits. In modern times, the species faces spatial competition from more popular animals, especially large canids. Also, many captive individuals have not been closely examined to confirm their sexes, thus resulting in non-breeding pairs often turning out to be same-sexed individuals. As a result, many captive hyena populations are facing extinction.|$|E
5|$|Roma {{was laid}} {{down at the}} La Spezia {{shipyard}} on 20 August 1903 and launched on 21 April 1907. After fitting-out work, the ship was completed on 17 December 1908. After her commissioning, Roma {{was assigned to the}} active duty squadron, where she remained through 1910, which included her three sisters and the two s. At the time, these six battleships represented Italy's front-line battle fleet. The active duty squadron <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> in service for seven months of the year for training; {{the rest of the year}} they were placed in reserve.|$|E
5|$|Some {{water from}} the Shamokin Creek {{watershed}} enters the Mahanoy Creek watershed via various mine tunnels, mainly the Doutyville, Helfenstein, the Locust Gap, and the Centralia Mine discharges. Water from Mahanoy Creek also flows through mine tunnels into Shamokin Creek. The discharge of the creek at various locations ranges from 0 to 320 cubic feet per second. The discharge of acid mine drainage in the creek ranges from 0 to 17.2 cubic feet per second. In 2001, the discharge <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> found to be higher in March than in August.|$|E

5|$|The Harrier <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> used as {{a ground}} attack aircraft, though its {{manoeuvrability}} also allows it to effectively engage other aircraft at short ranges. The Harrier {{is powered by a}} single Pegasus turbofan engine mounted in the fuselage. The engine is fitted with two air intakes and four vectoring nozzles for directing the thrust generated: two for the bypass flow and two for the jet exhaust. Several small reaction nozzles are also fitted, in the nose, tail and wingtips, for the purpose of balancing during vertical flight. It has two landing gear units on the fuselage and two outrigger landing gear units, one near each wing tip. The Harrier is equipped with four wing and three fuselage pylons for carrying a variety of weapons and external fuel tanks.|$|E
5|$|The Pegasus {{turbofan}} jet engine, {{developed in}} tandem with the P.1127 then the Harrier, was designed specifically for V/STOL manoeuvring. Bristol Siddeley developed it from their earlier conventional Orpheus turbofan engine as the core with Olympus compressor blades for the fan. The engine's thrust is directed through the four rotatable nozzles. The engine is equipped for water injection to increase thrust and takeoff performance in hot and high altitude conditions; in normal V/STOL operations the system would be used in landing vertically with a heavy weapons load. The water injection function had originally been added following the input of US Air Force Colonel Bill Chapman, who worked for the Mutual Weapons Development Team. Water injection was necessary in order to generate maximum thrust, if only for a limited time, and <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> used during landing, especially in high ambient temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{government}} {{agreed to}} pay compensation for the damaged property {{but not for the}} actual victims of the massacre, although Bayard was inclined to resist the requests for payments. In a letter to the minister of China's Washington legation dated February 18, 1886, he expressed a personal view that the violence against Chinese immigrants was precipitated by their resistance to cultural assimilation, and that racism against Chinese <b>was</b> <b>typically</b> found among other immigrants rather than the majority of the populace: Denby's predictions caused Bayard to seek a Congressionally appropriated indemnity. At Bayard's urging, the U.S. Congress provided US$147,748.74 as an indemnity. The compensation was made as a monetary gift and not as a legal decree of responsibility for the massacre and the outcome amounted to a minor diplomatic victory for China.|$|E
