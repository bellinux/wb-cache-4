Bacteria in the lag phase were exposed to gentamicin concentration-time profiles modelling either bolus or infusion dosing (AUC constant, Cmax changing) with 30 -min postdose peak concentrations (Cpeak 30) of 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg/liter or bolus dosing with normal and double drug clearance (Cmax constant, AUC changing) corresponding to <b>normal</b> <b>clearance</b> profiles with Cpeak 30 of 6 and 8 mg/liter. Exposure to gentamicin caused early bactericidal effects apparent by 2 h, followed by variable bacteriostatic and recovery phases. Exposure to bolus profiles resulted in greater bactericidal activity than the corresponding infusion profile up to a Cpeak 30 of 8 mg/liter. At a Cpeak 30 of 10 mg/liter, {{there were no differences}} in bactericidal effect. Double clearance profiles had a reduced bactericidal effect at 6 mg/liter compared to the corresponding <b>normal</b> <b>clearance</b> profile, but no differences in bactericidal effect were observed for 8 -mg/liter double and <b>normal</b> <b>clearance</b> profiles. These results suggest that the initial exposure (i. e., 0 to 30 min) is a more important determinant for bacterial killing than the AUC or trough concentration for this bacterium. Subject to confirmation of these findings with other gram-negative bacteria, to optimize aminoglycoside efficacy the initial exposure (Cmax) should be maximized by giving higher doses or bolus administration at intervals which may not produce detectable trough concentrations. Clinical trials with a broad range of patients, especially those with higher clearance, would confirm these in vitro observations and define optimal dosing recommendations...|$|R

In a large portion of persons with sleep disorders, perhaps as high as 30 %, GERD is a major causal or contributing factor. It has been proposed that the use of hypnotics for the treatment of sleep disorders may exacerbate the damaging effects of refluxate on the esophageal epithelium by reducing the frequency and effectiveness of <b>normal</b> <b>clearance</b> mechanisms (figure 1) ...|$|R

40|$|Poliovirus has a {{single-stranded}} RNA genome {{of positive}} polarity that serves two essential functions {{at the start}} of the viral replication cycle in infected cells. First, it is translated to synthesize viral proteins and, second, it is copied by the viral polymerase to synthesize negative-strand RNA. We investigated these two reactions by using HeLa S 10 in vitro translation-RNA replication reactions. Preinitiation RNA replication complexes were isolated from these reactions and then used to measure the sequential synthesis of negative- and positive-strand RNAs in the presence of different protein synthesis inhibitors. Puromycin was found to stimulate RNA replication overall. In contrast, RNA replication was inhibited by diphtheria toxin, cycloheximide, anisomycin, and ricin A chain. Dose-response experiments showed that precisely the same concentration of a specific drug was required to inhibit protein synthesis and to either stimulate or inhibit RNA replication. This suggested that the ability of these drugs to affect RNA replication was linked to their ability to alter the <b>normal</b> <b>clearance</b> of translating ribosomes from the input viral RNA. Consistent with this idea was the finding that the protein synthesis inhibitors had no measurable effect on positive-strand synthesis in normal RNA replication complexes. In marked contrast, negative-strand synthesis was stimulated by puromycin and was inhibited by cycloheximide. Puromycin causes polypeptide chain termination and induces the dissociation of polyribosomes from mRNA. Cycloheximide and other inhibitors of polypeptide chain elongation “freeze” ribosomes on mRNA and prevent the <b>normal</b> <b>clearance</b> of ribosomes from viral RNA templates. Therefore, it appears that the poliovirus polymerase was not able to dislodge translating ribosomes from viral RNA templates and mediate the switch from translation to negative-strand synthesis. Instead, the initiation of negative-strand synthesis appears to be coordinately regulated with the natural clearance of translating ribosomes to avoid the dilemma of ribosome-polymerase collisions...|$|R

The mechanism responsible for this heterogeneity of elimination was investigated. <b>Normal</b> <b>clearance</b> of colloidal carbon and a second dose of 14 C-SIII excluded reticuloendothelial blockade. The application of parabiosis followed by separation excluded the presence of a phagocytosis-resistant fraction of 14 C-SIII.

Intratracheal injection of catalase and superoxide dismutase resulted in prolonged intraalveolar residence of the enzymes, but caused no decrease in rates of clearance of either Staphylococcus aureus 502 A or Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1. In contrast, dimethylsulfoxide and dimethylthiourea caused significant depression of clearance of P. aeruginosa without altering clearance of S. aureus. These results provide further differentiation between clearance processes affecting gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and suggest that murine clearance of gram-negative organisms may be in part mediated by reactions which generate hydroxyl anion.

30|$|Once in the alveoli, {{the water}} is absorbed from the alveoli toward the {{interstitium}} by active transepithelial ionic migration, which creates an osmotic gradient leading to water reabsorption toward the interstitium [20].

During ARDS, active transport of ions and fluid by the epithelium is altered due to rupture of the alveolocapillary barrier and epithelial cell dysfunction. Water reabsorption requires that the fluid leak first be reduced not only by reduction of endothelial permeability but also possibly by modifications in epithelial cell form, making the epithelium more solidly impermeable.
