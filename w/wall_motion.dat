2500|$|Chen and Wang, {{researchers}} at disk-drive manufacturer Seagate Technology described three examples of possible magnetic memristors. In one device resistance {{occurs when the}} spin of electrons in {{one section of the}} device points in a different direction from those in another section, creating a [...] "domain wall", a boundary between the two sections. Electrons flowing into the device have a certain spin, which alters the device's magnetization state. Changing the magnetization, in turn, moves the domain wall and changes the resistance. The work's significance led to an interview by IEEE Spectrum.

Uniaxial compressive stress was applied during fatigue process of soft {{lead zirconate titanate}} piezoelectric ceramics and their fatigue resistance was improved when the stress was larger than 20 MPa.

40|$|The {{parameter}} Δλ/ΔM is {{a useful}} tool for investigating the magnetization process in magnetostrictive materials. This work extends the use of this parameter from that previously explored in the and easy regimes to the easy regime. Theoretical values of Δλ/ΔM are presented for all possible domain <b>wall</b> <b>motions</b> that produce an increase in magnetization. In the easy regime, Δλ/ΔM has contributions from both λ 100 and λ 111, but for practical purposes it is only necessary to consider the latter for the C 15 phase giant magnetostrictive materials, because λ 111 ≫λ 100. Under such conditions there are 61 different <b>wall</b> <b>motions</b> but only four (nonzero) values for Δλ/ΔM. We have obtained the theoretically generated magnetostrain versus magnetization curve, derived from a model of distinct domain <b>wall</b> <b>motions</b> with successively higher values of Δλ/ΔM. It is shown that this curve is a good fit to the experimental magnetostrain versus magnetization curve obtained for Tb 0. 1 Ho 0. 9 Fe 1. 9, measured at intervals over the temperature range 213 - 373 K. Since it is known that equivalent theoretical curves in the and easy regimes model the magnetization process well, and that TbxHo 1 -xFe 1. 9 (0 ≪x≪ 0. 2) undergoes a spin reorientation from to at approximately 260 K, and then to as the temperature is reduced further, we conclude that Δλ/ΔM may be used in the easy regime.

50|$|In Sm2Co17 magnets, the {{coercivity}} {{mechanism is}} based on domain wall pinning. Impurities inside the magnets impede the domain <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> and thereby resist the magnetization reversal process. To increase the coercivity, impurities are intentionally added during the fabrication process.|$|E
50|$|At the coercive field, {{the vector}} {{component}} of the magnetization of a ferromagnet measured along the applied field direction is zero. There are two primary modes of magnetization reversal: single-domain rotation and domain <b>wall</b> <b>motion.</b> When the magnetization of a material reverses by rotation, the magnetization component along the applied field is zero because the vector points in a direction orthogonal to the applied field. When the magnetization reverses by domain <b>wall</b> <b>motion,</b> the net magnetization is small in every vector direction because the moments of all the individual domains sum to zero. Magnetization curves dominated by rotation and magnetocrystalline anisotropy are found in relatively perfect magnetic materials used in fundamental research. Domain <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> is a more important reversal mechanism in real engineering materials since defects like grain boundaries and impurities serve as nucleation sites for reversed-magnetization domains. The role of domain walls in determining coercivity is complicated since defects may pin domain walls in addition to nucleating them. The dynamics of domain walls in ferromagnets {{is similar to that}} of grain boundaries and plasticity in metallurgy since both domain walls and grain boundaries are planar defects.|$|E

No "jump" effect was observed during the magnetization process and the magnetostrictive hysteresis was large when H≪ 2. 5 kOe. Observations by the Bitter colloid technique at room temperature revealed curved domain walls which became straight at higher and lower temperatures in { 100 } and { 111 }, respectively, indicating the transition to different 180 ° walls for H≪ 1 kOe.
