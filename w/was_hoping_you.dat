40|$|Most grammars {{emphasize}} the aspectual {{function of the}} progressive, as in I am running. But the progressive is also used in examples such as Mary is being ironical; John is being an angel; I <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>you</b> could come to join us for dinner tomorrow; I was wondering whether you could help me. In other words, it does not fulfil an aspectual function, but a function involving a specific interpretation of a situation by the speaker. In this paper, the interpretative function of the progressive will be examined through {{a particular set of}} examples illustrating a `polite' use of the progressive. 1 Introduction Most of the time, the function of the progressive form is analysed in aspectuo-temporal terms. Namely it does not consider the end of an event, i. e. a situation indicating change. This can be illustrated in the following examples: (1) I am running (activity verb). (2) I am writing a letter (accomplishment verb). (3) I am reaching the summit (achievement verb). But there exist exam [...] ...|$|E
