50|$|In {{linguistic}} morphology {{and information}} retrieval, stemming {{is the process}} of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root form—generally a written word form. The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root. Algorithms for stemming have been studied in computer science since the 1960s. Many search engines treat words <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>stem</b> as synonyms as a kind of query expansion, a process called conflation.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are only}} three {{irregular}} verbs in the imperfect: ir, ser, and ver.

And the imperfect of ver (veía etc.) was regular in Old Spanish, where the infinitive veer provided the stem ve-. In formal language, pronouns [...] "tú" [...] and [...] "vosotros" [...] are replaced by [...] "usted" [...] and [...] "ustedes" [...] (sometimes abbreviated as Ud./Vd. and Uds./Vds.), with the verb conjugated in third person. American Spanish always replaces [...] "vosotros" [...] with [...] "ustedes", switching the verb accordingly. The countries that show the kind of voseo in which [...] "tú" [...] is replaced by [...] "vos" [...] use the same forms as for [...] "tú" [...] in this tense.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} proposes to compare {{document}} retrieval precision performances based on language modeling techniques, particularly stemming and lemmatization. Stemming is a procedure to reduce all words <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>stem</b> {{to a common}} form whereas lemmatization removes inflectional endings and returns the base or dictionary form of a word. Comparisons were also made between these two techniques with a baseline ranking algorithm (i. e. with no language processing). A search engine was developed and the algorithms were tested based on a test collection. Both mean average precisions and histograms indicate stemming and lemmatization to outperform the baseline algorithm. As for the language modeling techniques, lemmatization produced better precision compared to stemming, however the differences are insignificant. Overall {{the findings suggest that}} language modeling techniques improves document retrieval, with lemmatization technique producing the best result...|$|E
40|$|A {{characteristic}} of natural-language text databases {{is that a}} user {{must be able to}} specify all of the variant forms of each query word if high recall is to be achieved. The most common type of word variants are those arising from morphology and thus most retrieval systems provide facilities for user-controlled right-hand (and occasionally left-hand) truncation to allow the retrieval of all words <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> root. A <b>stemming</b> algorithm, or stemmer, is a computational procedure that reduces all words <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> root to a single form by stripping the root of its derivational and inflectional affixes. In most cases, only suffixes are stripped so that a stemmer provides an automatic equivalent of manual, right-hand truncation. Thus far, most work on stemmers has focused on present-day languages, but the increasing user of computers in the humanities has resulted in a need for comparable tools to facilitate searching in historical text databases.

The study shows that multiple tree handling harvesters are more efficient in thinnings stands with mean stock volumes less than 0, 12 m 3 fub per stock. The increased efficiency is different for different mean stem classes. In stands with a mean stem volume of 0, 04 m 3 fub per stock, the increase can be as high as 40 percent while it is about 10 percent in stands with a mean stem volume of 0, 12 m 3 fub. Comparisons have been done between stands that are felled with partly limbed stands and stands without partly limbed assortments. The difference in performance is clear and shows that the partly limbed assortments strengthen the multiple tree handling harvesters positive effects in low dimension thinnings.

60|$|The {{advantage}} {{gained by}} climbing {{is to reach}} the light and free air with as little expenditure of organic matter as possible; now, <b>with</b> twining plants, <b>the</b> stem is much longer than is absolutely necessary; for instance, I measured the stem of a kidney-bean, which had ascended exactly two feet in height, and it was three feet in length: the stem of a pea, on the other hand, which had ascended to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> height by <b>the</b> aid of its tendrils, was but little longer than the height reached. That this saving of the stem is really an advantage to climbing plants, I infer from the species that still twine but are aided by clasping petioles or tendrils, generally making more open spires than those made by simple twiners. Moreover, the plants thus aided, after taking one or two turns in one direction, generally ascend for a space straight, and then reverse the direction of their spire. By this means they ascend to a considerably greater height, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> length of <b>stem,</b> than {{would otherwise have been}} possible; and they do this with safety, as they secure themselves at intervals by their clasping petioles or tendrils.|$|R

40|$|Summary Leaf {{specific}} conductivity (LSC; {{the ratio of}} stem conductivity (KP) to leaf area (AL)), {{a measure of the}} hydraulic capacity of the stem to supply leaves with water, varies with soil water content. Empirical evidence for LSC responses to drought is ambiguous, because previously published results were subject to many confounding factors. We tested howLSC of similar-sized trees of the same population, under similar climatic conditions, responds to persistently wet or dry soil. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and pubescent oak (Quercus pubescensWilld.) trees were compared between a dry site and a wet site in theValais, an inner alpine valley in Switzerland. Soilwater strongly influenced AL and KP and the plant components affecting KP, such as conduit radius, conduit density and functional sapwood area. Trees at the dry site had lower LSC than trees <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>stem</b> diameter at the wet site. Low LSC in trees at the dry site was associated with a smaller functional sapwood area and narrower conduits, resulting in a stronger reduction in KP than in AL. These observations support the hypothesis that trees maintain a homeostatic water pressure gradient. An alternative hypothesis is that relatively high investments in leaves compared with sapwood contribute to carbon gain over an entire season by enabling rapid whole-plant photosynthesis during periods of high water availability (e. g., in spring, after rain events and during morning hours when leafto- air vapor pressure deficit is small). Dynamic data and a hydraulic plant growth model are needed to test how investments in leaves versus sapwood and roots contribute to transpiration and to maximizing carbon gain throughout entire growth seasons.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} — Stability and {{survival}} of cemented total hip prostheses {{is dependent on}} a multitude of factors, including the type of cement that is used. Bone cements vary in viscosity, from low to medium and high. There have been few clinical RSA studies comparing the performance of low- and high-viscosity bone cements. We compared the migration behavior of the Stanmore hip stem cemented using novel low-viscosity Palamed bone cement <b>with</b> that of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>stem</b> cemented <b>with</b> conventional high-viscosity Palacos bone cement. Patients and methods — We performed a randomized controlled study involving 39 patients (40 hips) undergoing primary total hip replacement for primary or secondary osteoarthritis. 22 patients (22 hips) were randomized to Palacos and 17 patients (18 hips) were randomized to Palamed. Migration was determined by RSA. Results — None of these 40 hips had been revised at the 10 -year follow-up mark. To our knowledge, the patients who died before they reached the 10 -year endpoint still had the implant in situ. No statistically significant or clinically {{significant differences were found}} between the 2 groups for mean translations, rotations, and maximum total-point motion (MTPM). Interpretation — We found similar migration of the Stanmore stem in the high-viscosity Palacos cement group and the low-viscosity Palamed cement group. We therefore expect that the risk of aseptic loosening <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new Palamed cement would be comparable to that <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conventional Palacos cement. The choice of which type of bone cement to use is therefore up to the surgeon’s preference. </p...|$|R

Wilkins (1972) asserted that ⿿without grammar very little can be conveyed, without vocabulary nothing can be conveyed⿿. Since the pioneering research of Michael West (1953), many academic or general wordlists {{have been published in}} English or in other languages. On the other hand, the lack of an Academic Turkish Wordlist which meets the academic criteria such as being collected from a valid corpus has made this research necessary in the field of teaching Turkish as a foreign language. This study aims to investigate the academic vocabulary that any Turkish language learner should have before starting to study at undergraduate programs offering Turkish medium instruction. An academic corpus derived from fifty-seven textbooks was formed so as to discover the Academic Turkish Wordlist. There were 4032442 tokens in the academic corpus and various computer software programs some of which were written for the current study were used in order to acquire the academic wordlist. Lemmas, or the groups of lexical forms <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>stem</b> that belong to the same word class, (Francis & Kucera, 1982) were used for the creation of the Academic Turkish Wordlist. Moreover, the most frequent 11000 words from Turkish National Corpus were used to make a list of words to be excluded from the academic corpus and {{the final version of the}} Academic Turkish Wordlist contained 1010 lemmas. The Academic Turkish Wordlist covered 32 % of the academic corpus and it is evident that knowing the words in the academic wordlist will help undergraduate foreign students studying Turkish improve their academic language skills, especially reading comprehension. The Academic Turkish Wordlist could be utilized in various ways: 1) to check out language learning materials in order to find out how many low/high frequency words they contain 2) to compare students⿿ writings in terms of how many academic words they are able to use 3) to prepare proficiency exams 4) to revise their language program in order to include more academic words to prepare their students for undergraduate programs...|$|E
