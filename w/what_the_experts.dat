40|$|People {{often make}} {{predictions}} about the future based on trends they have observed in the past. Revised probabilistic forecasts can be perceived by the public as indicative of such a trend. In five studies, we describe experts who make probabilistic forecasts of various natural events (effects of climate changes, landslide and earthquake risks) at two points in time. Prognoses that have been upgraded or downgraded from $T_ 1 $ to $T_ 2 $ were in all studies expected to be updated further, in the same direction, later on (at $T_ 3 $). Thus, two prognoses were in these studies enough to define a trend, forming the basis for future projections. This ``trend effect'' implies that non-experts interpret recent forecast in light of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> said in <b>the</b> past, and think, for instance, that a ``moderate'' landslide risk will cause more worry if it has previously been low than if it has been high.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a conceptual framework}} {{for the development of}} Knowledge Management (KM) systems to support experts in complex design activities. Designing a complex object is not a simple task, since it is concerned not only with problem solving issues, but also with the growing needs for capturing and managing the core knowledge involved in it. A complex object is typically made of a huge number of parts that are put together according to a first set of constraints (i. e. the procedural knowledge), dependable on the functional properties it must satisfy, and a second set of rules, dependable on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> thinks abut <b>the</b> problem and how he/she would represent it (i. e. the declarative knowledge). The paper illustrates a way to unify both types of knowledge, exploiting the SA-Nets formalism to capture the procedural knowledge and a mereological approach to represent declarative knowledge. ...|$|R

The pseudocode logopedic programs comprise the succession of stages of the therapeutic program from a speech therapy perspective, and based on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> system can achieve. The LOGOMON system is conceived in order to assist the physical therapist and the child during the entire therapeutic period, recording the main data related to the child, which proved to be useful in diagnosis and treatment.

40|$|Many {{important}} services {{share the}} feature that the seller is also <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> who determines who {{much of the}} service is needed. Even when the outcomes of such service are observable, it might {{be difficult for the}} customer to determine <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> actually did and whether it was needed. This paper presents a simple model of a market of this type and investigates how the information asymmetries characteristic of such markets might affect their organization. The main insights of this paper are as follows. The asymmetry of information special to these markets may induce vertical specialization. When experts are liable to make diagnosis errors, there is a negative search externality present in such markets which tends to raise prices. The search-cum-diagnosis costs and the accuracy of diagnoses play a clear role in the determination of the market's form of organization: when the former are low and the latter is high, the market {{is more likely to be}} organized in a way whereby experts provide binding estimates in advance and consumers search; otherwise the more likely organization is that customers are billed after the service was performed and experts are disciplined by reputation. ...|$|R
5000|$|Weisbrot's {{latest book}} is Failed: <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Experts</b> Got Wrong About the Global Economy (Oxford University Press, 2015). In an interview, Weisbrot {{described}} the book as critiquing the bad macroeconomic policies often imposed by European authorities, who are ultimately unaccountable {{to the citizens of}} the sovereign states that they represent. These policies, he says, prolonged the economic crises {{in the aftermath of the}} Great Recession in Europe, which had a much higher unemployment rate than in the U.S., and forced unpopular economic policies of more vulnerable European countries. Weisbrot has made these arguments in various contexts over the years, for example on Greece, [...] on Spain, and most recently, in The New York Times on the French presidential election in April 2017. In an otherwise positive review, Weisbrot was criticized for advocating that Greece would have been better off had it had left the eurozone during its economic crisis. Noam Chomsky called Failed [...] "careful and well-documented" [...] and said it [...] "makes a persuasive case that one goal of the imposed by European authorities has been to dismantle the social democratic policies that were one of Europe’s contributions to civilized life in the post-World War II period but were unwelcome to major centers of traditional power." ...|$|E

The Red Team are given use of a chainsaw as a reward for their victory in the previous challenge, while the remaining teams have to make do with two-person crosscut saws. The Pink Team are slowed down severely when Tyler has major difficulty cutting a maple leaf from the cross-section, with Helder commenting that the result looks more like a fan than a maple leaf. This results in them being {{the only one of the}} four teams who fail to finish, and adding insult to injury, the experts point out that they misspelled their team motto on the sign. The Green Team also get slowed down, in their case through trouble using the crosscut saws; they do finish however, and the experts compliment them on their clearly heartfelt design, though have issues with the quality of workmanship. The Red Team make full use of their chainsaw and finish well ahead of the other teams, but their sign, while otherwise well-made, receives some criticism for its unambitious design. The Blue Team are therefore victorious, as Holly's creative design (which showcases nearly all the skills that the teams have learned until now) and her strong working dynamic with Jesse results in <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>experts</b> judge the best sign.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "one-sex/two-sex" [...] theory {{claims that}} the switch from the one-sex model to the two-sex model created the {{foundations}} of gender {{as we know them}} today. The explanations for this shift are both epistemological and political. In terms of the epistemological, {{in the beginning of the}} eighteenth century, experts with authority were determining what was natural and what was not. Michel de Montaigne, a writer during the French Renaissance, writes in his Travel Journal, about a group of young girls who dressed up like males and led their lives as males. For him, this was seen as perfectly normal and that [...] "there is no ontological sex, only organs assigned legal and social status". In the two-sex model though, these experts wanted to create a link between biological sex and theoretical gender and anything transgressing these boundaries was seen as being abnormal. Although it was thought in the one-sex model that feminine men may lactate and that [...] "almost all the men have a great quantity of milk in their breasts", the notion of interconvertibility of fluids among men and women was thrown out the window in the two-sex model. Sex became related to physical facts and the uterus became a justification for the status of women. Gender roles became institutionalized and what was meant to be male or female was based on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>experts</b> thought was natural. Philosophers like Rousseau supported this view and he saw women as being relegated to the private sphere as wives and mothers while men dominated the public sphere.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the value of using Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) as a grammar to map actions in context. The grammar approach aims to develop a richer picture of user actions in a task accommodating aspects of the socio-organizational context. This paper reflects on user tasks as emerged from interviews with real users in supply chain industries where Forecasting Support Systems (FSS) are used to predict future product sales. In this paper, we use HTA to describe <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> literature has identified as the stages in producing sales forecasts. In order to evaluate this against reported scenarios and observations of actual use, we apply an approach that uses a parallel to the grammar of everyday language to represent user activities. In addition to specifying the particular socio-organizational aspects of FSS use, we show how the grammar approach contributes to effective analysis of unstructured, qualitative data. The methodology we adopt also eases our attempt to understand user tasks and validate the constructed HTA model in a given context. The methodological implications and future research directions for task analysis models are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{virtually}} any other business, expert witnesses are not typically held accountable in either tort or contract law for their commercial activities. This means that many {{are inclined to}} deliver <b>what</b> <b>the</b> market demands - partisan, biased, or plainly dishonest testimony - without concern for the costs this testimony may impose on others. This immunity from the internalization of the social cost of their testimony is hard to reconcile with any moral or economic standard. Harsh judicial reactions to some experts and {{a slight increase in}} expert witness liability may signal that a change in the privileged status of <b>experts</b> is in <b>the</b> offing. This Article examines the social costs of the current system and surveys the ways in which courts and adversely affected parties have attempted to bring expert witness excesses under control. The efforts range from judicial attempts to embarrass experts to actions by the parties retaining <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> and by those adverse to <b>the</b> <b>expert.</b> In <b>the</b> end, none of these measures seem to have had much effect. Two general proposals are made. The first is to decrease appeals to judges and jurors based on institutional authority. Institutional authority - the reliance on credentials - can be misleading in two ways. First it may suggest more about the competency of the witness than is warranted. Second, it may be taken to mean that <b>the</b> highly credentialed <b>expert</b> {{is more likely to be}} objective. This is also an unwarranted inference. The second proposal is to make experts more accountable to both friendly and adverse witnesses. This liability would be based on deviations in testimony from <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> knows or should know would be acceptable by peers in his or her area of expertise...|$|R

5000|$|Wall-mounted Shelves: While the {{remaining}} four teams are still in shock from Steve's abrupt meltdown, the experts tell them immediately after eliminating the Purple Team {{that they will be}} proceeding onto the next challenge regardless. This requires them to build a set of shelves from supplied lumber, based on a model that Hillary shows them; furthermore, she informs them that the shelves must be precisely 2.5x the size of the model. She also gives the teams a lesson in using routers, which must be used to cut dadoes to fit the wood together. The teams each have 90 minutes in which to make their shelves (the Purple Team would have gotten a headstart, but due to their elimination every team gets the same amount of time). Calculating the required size trips up most of the teams, with Fabian mistakenly thinking it's supposed to be 3x the model size, Tyler incorrectly working out the required width as 29" [...] instead of 32.5" [...] (though he corrects it before he and Danielle begin cutting the wood), and Jake insisting over Nicole's objections that they don't need to replicate the expert's model in exact detail. The Green Team's shelves end up bearing next to no resemblance to what they were asked to build, but are nonetheless quite well-made, and Jake and Nicole were noted to have worked together better than usual. The Red Team, despite finishing well in advance of any of the other teams and having very solid workmanship, is ultimately undermined by Fabian's measuring errors. While the Blue Team’s shelves are a little too far away from the reference model for the experts' liking, their overall build quality is judged to be the best in the challenge. The Pink Team overcome a very stormy build and frequent arguments between Danielle and Tyler to build shelves that are a near-perfect match for <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>experts</b> requested.|$|E

40|$|What {{do people}} want from leaders? That {{question}} has been asked for generations. In recent history, a huge growth in leadership studies has produced {{a wealth of information}} on this topic, but because of the multitude of publications, there are now many competing schools of thought about what qualities make a great leader. This paper seeks to understand the qualities that people look for in leaders and to understand if any consistent patterns emerge from these desired traits. This is done through two avenues. Firstly, a survey of the existing leadership publications in several different established leadership genres provides an understanding of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>experts</b> seek from leaders. Several military publications show how the modern U. S. military is trying to develop quality leaders. A look at values based leadership publications shows what many leading consultants and professional leadership development experts are looking for.

Secondly, a survey conducted among various individuals from different fields helps to determine what qualities are desired in great leaders. These two pieces of information, when taken as a whole, create an understanding of what people are expecting from leaders. In the end, a recommended typology for leadership development is presented as a means for spurring future research...|$|E
