Alternatively, {{it has been suggested that}} oral parafunctional activities such as lip or cheek chewing become more pronounced during periods of stress, and hence the mucosa is subjected to more minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|A study {{conducted}} by a United States child psychiatrist, Dr Kyle D. Pruett, found that infants between 7 and 30 months responded more favorably to being picked up by their fathers. Pruett also found that a father's parenting style is beneficial for a child's physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral development. Mothers reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to manage their frustration. This helps the children learn to deal <b>with</b> <b>stress</b> and frustration. A long-term study Pruett conducted proved that a father's active involvement with his children, from birth to adolescence, promotes greater emotional balance, stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self-assurance in the child.|$|E

5|$|In Bergkamp's {{second season}} at Inter, the club changed {{managers}} again, appointing Ottavio Bianchi. Bergkamp endured a disappointing campaign, troubled <b>with</b> <b>stress</b> injuries and fatigue from the 1994 World Cup. He managed to score 5 goals in 26 appearances. Off the field, Bergkamp's {{relationship with the}} Italian press and fans became uncomfortable. His shy persona and his propensity to go home after matches was interpreted as apathy. Because of his poor performance on the pitch, one Italian publication renamed their award given to the worst performance of the week, L'asino della settimana (Donkey of the Week) to Bergkamp della settimana. Inter ended the league season in sixth position and failed to retain the UEFA Cup, with the club eliminated in the second round. In February 1995, the club was purchased by Italian businessman and fan Massimo Moratti, who promised to invest heavily in the squad. Bergkamp's future in the first team was uncertain following the signing of Maurizio Ganz {{a month after the}} takeover.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to requesting international aid, the Yemen government declared Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah governorates as disaster areas, after then-president Ali Abdullah Saleh surveyed the affected areas. The president also utilized the nation's military to assist storm victims, and sent aircraft with tents, food, and medicine {{to the worst}} hit areas. To {{raise money for the}} disaster recovery, the Yemeni government cut one day of salary for all workers, equating to $4.25million, and the government provided another $100million from its annual budget. Local charities and residents collectively raised $8.5million. Yemen's Red Cross provided meals and water to about 21,000people. The agency also provided school kits for 4,500students whose facilities were damaged. Ultimately, the Red Cross assisted over 70,000storm victims through health programs, and also helped residents cope <b>with</b> <b>stress,</b> hygiene promotion, and other ongoing vulnerabilities to their livelihoods.|$|E
