The bombers had been followed by 20 to 30 Zeros, and a dogfight quickly ensued. During {{the course of the}} engagement over Bougainville, Bolt scored two victories. His wingman, Ed Harper, also claimed a victory. For the next several weeks, the squadron operated out of Munda in the Solomon Islands.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{specific}} skills, Nash was particularly effective playing the pick and roll, notably with Nowitzki <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> the Mavericks and {{later with the}} Suns' Amar'e Stoudemire and Shawn Marion. When Nash returned to Phoenix in 2004, he helped the Suns improve from a 29–53 record in 2003–04 to 62–20 in 2004–05, reaching the Conference Finals {{for the first time}} in 11 years, earning him his first MVP award. The next season, he led the Suns into the Conference Finals, despite the injuries of all three big men (Stoudemire, Kurt Thomas and Brian Grant); further, Nash was responsible for seven of his teammates attaining career-highs in season scoring. With Nash operating at the point, between the 2005–06 and 2009–10 seasons, the Suns led the league in field goal percentage.|$|E
5000|$|Horacio drifts {{from city}} to city, job to job, love to love, life to life, yet even in his nomadic {{existence}} he tries to find a sense of order in the world's chaos. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> always isolated: <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> La Maga, <b>he</b> cannot relate to her; <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> the Club, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> superior; <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> Traveler and Talita, he fights their way of life. Even when with Morelli, the character he relates to most, there exists the social barriers of patient and orderly. Order versus chaos also exists {{in the structure of}} the novel, as in Morelli's statement, [...] "You can read my book any way you want to” (556). At the end of chapter 56, he realizes that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> neither on 'the territory' (Traveler's side, with society) nor on 'the bedroom' (what would be his side, his real place, if he had reached it).|$|R

5|$|One of the {{significant}} events of Darius's early reign was the slaying of Intaphernes, {{one of the seven}} noblemen who had deposed the previous ruler and installed Darius as the new monarch. The seven had made an agreement that they could all visit the new king whenever they pleased, except <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> his wife. One evening, Intaphernes went to the palace to meet Darius, but was stopped by two officers who stated that Darius had retired for the night. Becoming enraged and insulted, Intaphernes drew his sword and cut off the ears and noses of the two officers. While leaving the palace, he took the bridle from his horse, and tied the two officers together. The officers went to the king and showed him what Intaphernes had done to them. Darius began to fear for his own safety; he thought that all seven noblemen had banded together to rebel against him and that the attack against his officers was the first sign of revolt. He sent a messenger to each of the noblemen, asking them if they approved of Intaphernes's actions. They denied and disavowed any connection with Intaphernes's actions, stating that they stood by their decision to appoint Darius as King of Kings.|$|E
5|$|Rickey was a {{conservative}} teetotaler, while O'Malley freely enjoyed vices such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco. As O'Malley became {{more involved in}} affairs, he became critical of Rickey, the highest-paid individual in baseball, counting salary, attendance bonuses, and player contract sales commissions. O'Malley and Rickey had very different backgrounds and philosophies. It was O'Malley who put pressure on Rickey to fire manager Leo Durocher, who O'Malley felt was a drain on attendance. In board of directors meetings, O'Malley also opposed Rickey's extravagances. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> his political friends, he made fun of Rickey at every chance. Daily News columnist Jimmy Powers would deride Rickey for selling off players and for general miserliness. When Rickey asked O'Malley, the team lawyer, if he should sue, O'Malley said no. Powers' campaign became so public that after the 1946 season Rickey gave each player a new Studebaker, which gave O'Malley, a Dodgers shareholder, reason to speak ill of Rickey in the press. It {{got to the point}} where everything Rickey did was something O'Malley derided: O'Malley thought Rickey's construction of the state of the art Vero Beach spring training facility, known as Dodgertown, was extravagant; he thought Rickey's investment in the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference was questionable; he fought Rickey on the team's beer sponsor; and he demanded that players return their 1947 World Series rings before receiving the new ones Rickey ordered. As team lawyer, O'Malley had a role in breaking the racial barrier as well. In particular, he had a significant role in Rickey's top-secret search for suitable ballplayers to break the color barrier and then later he had a role in assessing the ongoing legal risks to the franchise.Other accounts, however, suggest that he played a lesser role in Robinson's signing.|$|E

25|$|The Hitmen were abysmal {{in their}} first two seasons, winning just 33 games combined. The team also faced further {{controversy}} when head coach Graham James resigned after being charged with, and later convicted of, sexually abusing two of his players <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> the Swift Current Broncos. In 1997, the Hitmen were purchased by the Calgary Flames. The team's fortunes improved immediately, as the Hitmen won their division in 1997–98, and the following season, the Hitmen captured the league championship in just their fourth season. The Hitmen advanced {{all the way to}} the 1999 Memorial Cup title game before losing in overtime to the host Ottawa 67's 7-6 in a thrilling final.|$|E

25|$|Roenis Elías {{made his}} first start for the Red Sox, against his former team. He went only 4 innings and gave up seven runs. Hembree and Layne saved the bullpen by going 3 and 2 innings respectively. Seattle took an early 2–0 off of Rick Porcello in game two but the hurler settled down after that and Boston could score six {{unanswered}} runs. In game three, David Price held the Mariners to just one run over 8 innings, his first time going 8 or more innings in three consecutive outings since July 2014 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> the Rays, but Boston could not score against Taijuan Walker despite two golden opportunities with a runner on third and only one out {{in the second and}} third inning. Walker left after five innings and the Red Sox scored twice with Craig Kimbrel striking out the side in the ninth. After receiving nearly seven runs (6.81) on average in support in his first 11 starts with an ERA of 5.11, David Price only received 1.75 runs on an ERA of 2.32 in his last four starts.|$|E

25|$|On July 16, the Nationals {{completed}} a five-player {{trade with the}} Oakland Athletics, acquiring relievers Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson for right-hander Blake Treinen and prospects Jesus Luzardo and Sheldon Neuse. Ross {{was moved to the}} 60-day disabled list to make room on the roster. The Nationals again purchased Turner's contract from Syracuse, re-adding him to the roster, to take Treinen's place in the bullpen on July 17 while awaiting the activation of Doolittle and Madson, who were expected to join the team in Anaheim the next day for a series against the Los Angeles Angels in interleague play; injured closer Koda Glover was transferred to the 60-day disabled list to clear roster space. That day, Washington concluded a four-game sweep of their series in Cincinnati in a 6–1 game that included several notable occurrences: Ryan Zimmerman hit his 20th home run of the year to surpass Expos star Vladimir Guerrero's Montreal–Washington franchise record with 235 career home runs as a National, Murphy scored all the way from second base on a sacrifice fly hit by catcher Matt Wieters, and Murphy struck out three times {{for the first time since}} May 20, 2014, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> the Mets.|$|E
25|$|In 2000–01, Roy's Avalanche won the Presidents' Trophy for {{the best}} regular season record. In the playoffs, his team {{advanced}} to the Finals, where they faced the defending champion New Jersey Devils, who were backstopped by Martin Brodeur, a star netminder who as a youngster had idolized Roy. In Game 4, while playing the puck behind his own net, Roy could not make a clearing pass, allowing the Devils to score into an empty net to tie the game. Roy had his worst game of the Finals in a 4–1 loss during Game 5, which gave the Devils a 3–2 series lead, but rebounded in Game 6 by stopping 24 shots for his then-record 19th career playoff shutout in a 4–0 victory. The Avalanche jumped to a three-goal lead in Game 7 before conceding one consolation goal to win their second Stanley Cup. Roy was named playoff MVP {{for the third time}} in his career, an NHL record. Roy has said that he and his teammates had wanted to win it for Ray Bourque, who finally won his first Cup after 22 seasons in the NHL; Bourque who had previously played 21 seasons with the Boston Bruins had numerous playoff encounters against Roy <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> the Canadiens.|$|E
