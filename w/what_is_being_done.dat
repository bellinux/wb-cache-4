Signs around the exhibit show <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>done</b> to protect the animals shown in their native habitats. The partnership allows the zoo to receive animals that would be unable to released back to the wild, such as with the 2006 addition of two jaguars which were household pets sent to the zoo from Guyana.|$|E
500|$|McAdams is an environmentalist. She ran an {{eco-friendly}} lifestyle website GreenIsSexy.org {{with two}} of her friends for five years, from 2007 to 2011. Her house is powered by Bullfrog renewable energy. She travels around Toronto by bicycle and does not own a car, but drives when in Los Angeles because it is [...] "a harder town to cycle in". She volunteered in Biloxi, Mississippi and Louisiana in fall of 2005, {{as part of the}} clean-up effort following Hurricane Katrina. McAdams sat on a TreeHugger/Live Earth judging panel in 2007. She appealed for donations during the Canada for Haiti telethon in 2010. She was involved in Matter of Trust's [...] "hair boom" [...] efforts following the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. In 2011, McAdams supported Foodstock, a protest against a proposed limestone mega quarry in Melancthon, Ontario. In 2013, she filmed two promotional videos for the Food & Water First Movement, aiming to preserve prime farmland and source water in Ontario, Canada. In 2014, she narrated the feature documentary Take Me To The River, which investigates <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>done</b> to try to save iconic rivers.|$|E
500|$|Civil disobedience as non-violent protest {{or civil}} {{resistance}} are also acts of conscience, but are designed {{by those who}} undertake them chiefly to change, by appealing to the majority and democratic processes, laws or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental social virtues and principles (such as justice, equality or respect for intrinsic human dignity). Civil disobedience, in a properly functioning democracy, allows a minority who feel strongly that a law infringes their sense of justice (but have no capacity to obtain legislative amendments or {{a referendum on the}} issue) to make a potentially apathetic or uninformed majority take account of the intensity of opposing views. A notable example of civil resistance or satyagraha ("satya" [...] in sanskrit means [...] "truth and compassion", [...] "agraha" [...] means [...] "firmness of will") involved Mahatma Gandhi making salt in India when that act was prohibited by a British statute, in order to create moral pressure for law reform. Rosa Parks similarly acted on conscience in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama refusing a legal order to give up her seat to make room for a white passenger; her action (and the similar earlier act of 15-year-old Claudette Colvin) leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rachel Corrie was a US citizen allegedly killed by a bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while involved in direct action (based on the non-violent principles of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi) to prevent demolition of the home of local Palestinian pharmacist Samir Nasrallah. Al Gore has argued [...] "If you're a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>done</b> right now, and not done, I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration." [...] In 2011, NASA climate scientist James E. Hansen, environmental leader Phil Radford and Professor Bill McKibben were arrested for opposing a tar sands oil pipeline and Canadian renewable energy professor Mark Jaccard was arrested for opposing mountain-top coal mining; in his book Storms of my Grandchildren Hansen calls for similar civil resistance on a global scale to help replace the 'business-as-usual' Kyoto Protocol cap and trade system, with a progressive carbon tax at emission source on the oil, gas and coal industries – revenue being paid as dividends to low carbon footprint families.|$|E

2500|$|A {{programming}} language compiler can also implement a dependent type or an effect system, which enables even more program specifications {{to be verified}} by a type checker.

2500|$|The Montoneros commanders had {{carefully}} studied the strategy that {{made possible the}} Sandinista victory in July 1979 in Nicaragua.

As Firmenich declared {{on the eve of the}} Sandinista victory: [...] "the solution to the crisis experienced in Argentina is to do <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>done</b> in Nicaragua." [...] The comandante of the Montoneros commandos (Tropas Especiales de Infantería or TEI) selected to take part in the infiltration in the work factories, Raúl Yager, explained that the purpose of the infiltrations was to assist in promoting open street battles. The conditions were ripe for a revolution, he believed, because the trade union protests had already gained momentum.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{an outdoor}} exhibit {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} African savanna and educate visitors about cheetahs and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>done</b> to preserve them in the wild. The {{main part of the}} Cheetah Conservation Station consists of two enclosures separated by a fence. One enclosures houses two South African cheetahs (both males; Gat [...] and Bakari), while the other houses two male Grevy's zebras. Other animals on display in the area include scimitar-horned oryxs, dama gazelles, Rüppell's vultures, sitatungas, red river hogs, maned wolves (a species native to South America), an Abyssinian ground hornbill and three lesser kudu. A female tammar wallaby named Maji had been on display until December 2013, when she was euthanized at the very old age of 18 (most do not live beyond 10).|$|E
2500|$|Scope - A {{practical}} {{issue is}} whether {{the fact that an}} accused is labouring under a [...] "mental disability" [...] should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for negating responsibility i.e. whether the test should also require an incapacity to understand <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>done,</b> to know that what one is doing is wrong, or to control an impulse to do something and so demonstrate a causal link between the disability and the potentially criminal acts and omissions. For example, the Irish insanity defence comprises the M'Naghten Rules and a control test that asks whether the accused was debarred from refraining from committing the act because of a defect of reason due to mental illness (see Doyle v Wicklow County Council 1974) 55 IR 71. The Butler Committee recommended that proof of severe mental disorder should be sufficient to negate responsibility, in effect creating an irrebuttable presumption of irresponsibility arising from proof of a severe mental disorder. This has been criticized as it assumes a lack of criminal responsibility simply because there is evidence of some sort of mental dysfunction, rather than establishing a standard of criminal responsibility. According to this view, the law should be geared to culpability not mere psychiatric diagnosis.|$|E
