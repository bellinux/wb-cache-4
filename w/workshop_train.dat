40|$|The Masai {{tribe in}} Kenya is {{increasingly}} facing problems with water resources. For a tribe who earn their living from cattle, water is essential. A recent survey from the Arid and Semi-Arid Land Development Ministry (ASAL) in the Kajiado district in Kenya showed that over 60 % of the 400 boreholes {{in the regions}} were no functioning. A new borehole and pump costs 2 million Kenyan shillings but i mechanical overhaul of an existing pump can be done for 40, 00 shillings. The first engines are being overhauled by a GTZ-suported workshop within the Ministry of Water. Artisans in the <b>workshop</b> <b>train</b> on defunct engines. Another goal of the project. to create a long-term maintenance facility which will continue to function when AMREF support is withdrawn. The repair of the boreholes has immediate impact on the Masai community as a reliable source of water is restored. It also helps toreduce the spread of overgrazed areas due to too many cattle being concentrated in one place.

40|$|This {{research}} project {{is an attempt}} to determine how principals handle educator misconduct in public schools in a sample of both primary and secondary schools. Procedures on handling misconduct are still new to schools principals. The need to empower principals with knowledge and procedures to handle educator misconduct is the main concern of the study. The main aim of the study is to investigate how principals handle educator misconduct in public schools. It is revealed in the introductory orientation of this study that educator misconduct is one of major challenges in principals' management of schools. Educator misconduct is a continuous problem that principals experience in their management of schools. Principals being given legal authority to handle less serious misconduct at school level, have a mammoth task and responsibility to ensure that procedural requirements are met in such misconduct cases. The attempts to <b>workshop</b> <b>train</b> and educate principals on handling educator misconduct which all proved insufficient. Misconduct among educators is on the increase and principals seem to fall short of handling such misconduct cases properly. In this regard both the literature study and an empirical investigation through interviews are used in the study. Principals are involved because they have a duty to handle educator misconduct. Procedures handling misconduct also involve educators. These data collection methods are useful in providing insights into principals' handling of educator misconduct as well as getting educators' views on how principals handle misconduct cases. The findings and recommendations of this study are expected to improve principals' handling of educator misconduct. The findings are supposed to help principals to realise the need to follow procedural steps and to apply principles of handling misconduct fairly and consistently. Based on what the study will find, it is recommended that principals adhere to principles, rules and procedures of handling misconduct as they serve to empower principals in their management responsibilities. Principals support mechanisms in the form of workshops, seminars and training programme should be provided to ensure that principals are well trained and have clear knowledge in both theory and practice of handling educator misconduct.

40|$|There {{is little}} {{controlled}} {{research on the}} impact of supervisor training on supervision. The current study examined the effects of supervision training in a sample of 46 supervisor-supervisee pairs of mental health practitioners. It compared Immediate 2 -day <b>workshop</b> <b>training</b> of the pair, a wait-list control in which <b>workshop</b> <b>training</b> was delayed 3 months, and a condition in which supervisors were trained 3 months before their partners (Split). Benefits of Immediate training were restricted to supervisors reporting fully specified agreements, and to reduction of some perceived problems. Self-efficacy in providing effective supervision fell in the Split condition, relative to the other conditions. Across conditions in general there was a fall from baseline to post-test assessment in the proportion of sessions where recommended supervision strategies were used, perhaps partly because the controlled trial extended across the summer vacation period. Results are consistent with other observations of the limited impact of <b>workshop</b> <b>training</b> on practice. ...|$|R

Although they are widely used, training methods such as self-study reading, internet-based courses, and educational workshops have not traditionally been the focus of empirical investigations. Based on electronic and manual searches of the literature, we summarize 17 evaluations of <b>workshop</b> <b>training</b> that describe the training program and the educational outcomes.

Some skill improvements, when measured, are usually seen immediately after training but are less often maintained over a longer time. Extended contact, through follow-up consultation, supervision, or feedback, appears to be necessary for the long-term adoption of skills. There are also a number of institutional factors that may influence the extent to which providers adopt new practices.
