5|$|Traditional Indonesian wax-resist batik {{designs on}} cloth combine {{representational}} motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the <b>wax</b> <b>resist,</b> and random variation introduced by cracking of the wax. Batik designs have a fractal dimension between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of Cirebon has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of Yogyakarta and Surakarta (Solo) in Central Java have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of Lasem {{on the north}} coast of Java and of Tasikmalaya in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.|$|E

500|$|Batik (Javanese: ꦧꦠꦶꦏ꧀, [...] ) is a {{technique}} of wax-resist dyeing applied to whole cloth, or cloth made using this technique. Batik is made either by drawing dots and lines of the resist with a spouted tool called a canting (Javanese: ꦕꦤ꧀ꦛꦶꦁ, , also spelled tjanting), or by printing the resist with a copper stamp called a cap (Javanese: ꦕꦥ꧀, , also spelled tjap). The applied <b>wax</b> <b>resists</b> dyes and therefore allows the artisan to colour selectively by soaking the cloth in one colour, removing the wax with boiling water, and repeating if multiple colours are desired.|$|R
50|$|The Tiwi {{people also}} create {{many of their}} designs on fabric. The main method uses <b>wax</b> to <b>resist</b> dyeing {{similarly}} to Indonesian batik prints. Various fabrics are used ranging from sturdy, woven cotton to delicate silks, from which they create silk scarves.|$|R

The wax together with chemicals rosin acted as a resist agent in making the batik,canting, batik cop and batik printing. Due to inadequate supplies of paraffin wax which happened in 1965, this research focused to identify an alternative to paraffin wax in order to minimize the dependency of batik canting industry towards paraffin wax. An alternative to paraffin identified in this study is Palm oil based wax which the samples of it were taken from the Malaysian Palm Oil Boar (MPOB).

40|$|Abstract. Banana bark {{is one of}} {{tropical}} indigenous natural resources {{that can be used}} as main material for many products. Being a fast-growing renewable material, it is durable and has natural patterns that people find visually attractive. Naturally, its textures and patterns are its main values; therefore {{it has the potential to}} be developed further. This research is needed to optimize the growth of small craft industries of banana bark, including the community where production activities take place, and also to provide information or reference of banana bark utilizations. Previous experiments conclude that banana bark has porous structure, high flexibility, relatively water-resistant due to its natural <b>wax</b> coating that <b>resists</b> water droplets, unless being washed down immensely. Also, due to its softwood- and paper-like properties, ithas many possibilities to be formed and processed into various functional products, mostly as craft products. In the subsequent study, the research about the utilization of banana bark in small industries starting from the harvesting system, handling problems in raw material supply, applying proper technology in improving the material’s quality, improving the human-resource working culture by appropriate technologies, and also innovating the product’s designs. The recommended designs can be implemented to improve the performance and qualities of banana bark products.

40|$|The waxes of Cagliari were {{manufactured}} between 1803 - 1805, {{and represent}} {{a work of}} the maturity of Clemente Susini (1754 - 1814) the chief modeller of La Specola. The dissections reproduced by Susini were carried out by Francesco Antonio Boi (Olzai, 1767 -Cagliari, 1865), from the University of Cagliari who had been sent on purpose to Florence by the Viceroy Carlo Felice of Savoy (1765 - 1831). The models which arrived in Cagliari in 1806 contained in 23 showcases, are attached to 23 wooden tables that bear the original tag with date and Susini’s signature. The latter is a distinctive character in that, of the over 2000 models accomplished under Susini’ guidance, only a few bear his signature. Moreover, they were made when Susini was eventually free from the influence of Felice Fontan. By order of Carlo Felice the models {{to be made for}} Cagliari, which consist of a special mix of <b>waxes</b> able to <b>resist</b> the hot climate of south Sardinia, had to be unique and, thus, at variance with those of La Specola, no copies of them are seen in other collections. On the other hand, possibly thanks to Francesco Antonio Boi, a few mistakes seen in the collections of Florence, Vienna, and Bologna, such as the presence of lymphatics in the human brain, are absent here. A distinctive character is the relevance given to visceral and somatic nerves which are shown in more than one third of the models. Of particular relevance is a representation of human brain convolutions preceding the one published by Rolando in 1830, and an extremely accurate and detailed preparartion of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. An overall evaluation of the collection greatly emphasizes both his artistic and scientific values, reflecting the intelligent cooperation between the Florentine artist and the Sardinian anatomist...|$|R

40|$|The waxes of Cagliari, {{having been}} made between 1803 - 1805, are later {{than those of}} the great {{collections}} of the La Specola in Florence and of the Josephinum in Vienna, and represent a work of the maturity of Clemente Susini (1754 - 1814) the chief modeler of La Specola museum. The dissections reproduced by Susini were performed by Francesco Antonio Boi (1767 - 1865), the anatomist from the University of Cagliari who had been sent on purpose to Florence by the Viceroy of Sardinia Carlo Felice of Savoy (1765 - 1831). The models (about 80), which arrived in Cagliari in 1806, contained in 23 showcases, are attached to 23 wooden tables that still bear the original tag with date and Susini’s signature The latter is a distinctive character in that, of the over 2000 models, said to have been accomplished under Susini’ guidance, only a few bear his signature. Moreover, they were made when Susini was eventually able to fully express his own artistic view, being eventually free from the somewhat oppressing influence of his great master Felice Fontana who, in that time, was no more the manager of La Specola. On the basis of the preparations displayed, the 23 showcases can be classified into 6 groups: 1 Microscopic and general Anatomy (case I). 2 Muscles (cases II; IV; V; VI, VII, VIII, IX, X). 3 Vessels and Muscles, with preparation of the perineum and of the left pectoral lymphnodes (case III). 4 Somatic -visceral nerves and vessels (cases XI, XII, XIII). 5 Sense Organs (cases XIV; XV; XVI, XVII, XVIII). 6 Abdominal and Pelvic Viscera (cases XIX, XX, XXI, XXII, XXIII). By order of Carlo Felice the models which consist of a special mix of <b>waxes</b> able to <b>resist</b> the hot climate of South Sardinia, had to be unique and no replicas of them are seen in other collections. Great relevance is given to the representation of organs of senses, muscles, and, in particular, to cranial and visceral nerves. Susini’s more mature style is particularly evident in the faces that are realistic portraits and veritable masterpieces of figurative art, in the skilful and harmonious use of colours, and in the perfect rendering of anatomical details. On the other hand, possibly thanks to Francesco Antonio Boi, a few mistakes, as the representation of lymphatic in brain, and omissions seen in the collections of Florence and Vienna, are absent here.

5000|$|The Briglin Pottery was {{a studio}} pottery founded in 1948 by Brigitte Goldschmidt (later known as Brigitte Appleby) and Eileen Lewenstein in the {{basement}} of premises at 66 Baker Street, London.

[...] It produced a large quantity of domestic pottery, much of it recognisable from its dark earthenware body, muted colours, white glaze and <b>wax</b> <b>resist</b> designs. In some ways Briglin was atypical of post-war studio potteries: it made tin-glazed earthenware when most others were making stoneware, it employed staff at the time when most studio potters worked alone or with a few assistants, and its pottery and shop were in the West End of London when many potters preferred the country.|$|E
5000|$|Wax resist: {{which is}} painted over the bare untainted clay, {{results in the}} {{suspension}} of wax in water [...] before the raku glaze goes on. This is done so that the glaze does not cover {{the area where the}} <b>wax</b> <b>resist</b> was applied, thus creating a design. When in the kiln, the wax melts off and the carbon, that results from oxygen reduction, replaces the wax. This {{is the result of the}} combustion reaction. Raku glazes contain alumina, which has a very high melting point. Therefore, carbon will not replace the glaze as it does the melted wax. Any unglazed areas turn black due to the carbon given off from the reduction of oxygen. Next, the clay is moved from the kiln to a container, usually a trashcan, which contains combustible organic materials such as leaves, sawdust, or paper.|$|E
50|$|Screen {{printing}} {{was first}} introduced in Japan in the early 18th century, {{said to be the}} invention of Yutensai Miyassak.The early Japanese version was a refinement to stenciling that used human hairs to hold together parts of the stencil, such as the outside and center of a circle, so that visible bridges could be eliminated. Eventually the technique evolved to use fine screens, with some areas blocked by a film and some lines or areas left open to allow paint to pass through.Techniques were developed to transfer images to screens photographically. The process was in use for ceramics by the mid-20th century, and is now the main way of decorating ceramics.

Almost every Indonesia artworks have their own cultural values, philosophy, and meanings, starts from dancing, performance art, until the art of processing textile materials, e. g. batik and woven fabrics. Batik has a very special {{place in the world}} archipelago. No other cloth in Indonesia archipelago, perhaps in the world as well, contains so much symbolism and meanings (Kerlogue, 2004 : 11). Batik is a term that refers to a cloth which has been decorated by a <b>wax</b> <b>resist</b> technique. But sadly, as the globalization emerge and tendency to exalt developed country’s culture in school life, the young generation became no longer care about their own country’s moral and cultural values. Batik consider obsolete, not fancy, and only suit to the old generation because of its values. But the presence of contemporary batik become one of a solution to introduce and preserve cultural values to the young generation, such as mutual aid, patience, respecting others and nature, and the introduction to hierarchy. In modern design world, in this case for interior design, there is a basic design subject which gives a lesson to the young designers of composing the elements and design principals as design sensitivity training. One of the tasks is making a pattern composition using local content and batik is a complex local pattern that commonly use. Therefore, this subject may become a good tool to introduce the local values and meaning to the young designers so that they can apply it in their future design to compete in global market. This research is an initial effort that has been done to enhance the knowledge, sense of belonging, and deeper comprehension to the local Indonesia values through basic design subject which the result may be applied into furniture and interior element. ...|$|E

For most of these people, craft production is a sole source of income. In 1982, a group of economists, anthropologists and sociologists of the Universidad Católica of Lima created Allpa to improve living standards of handicrafts producers. Allpa began active work as an alternative trading organization in 1986. In September 2010 R Winter undertook a short trip (7 days) to Lima R Winter and Allpa used this trip to research and establish where design and technical consultation would be of most benefit. Although very short, this trip was invaluable and gave Robert Winter an insight into the capabilities of the potteries concerned. R Winter concluded that the potteries are well equipped with all suitable materials and equipment for hand and cast made pottery. However it was foreseen that other techniques and alternative production methods which may be introduced may need additional equipment and perhaps support from Allpa, Traidcraft and The University of Sunderland 2011 Workshop/Trip The workshop covered three distinct areas of interest: 	A design and making workshop was delivered at the Chullucanas pottery and a shorter design and making workshop at the Lima pottery. 	A design and technical workshop took place to establish the capability of the Lima pottery to produce a range of specific products for the European Market These workshops were led by Robert Winter and Maria del Carmen director of Allpa assisted by three phd students fromn the University of Sunderland Design Workshops Chullucanas Prject (North Peru) New designs for Smoke Fired Ware The emphasis was on methods of production and design. The goal of the visit was to implement the development and design of a range of new pieces which will improve the products’ place in the modern ceramics market. Students arrived with designs ready for production and oversaw this with RW and Maria del Carmen. The designs were for a new range of highly decorative thrown vessel forms and two new designs for nativity sets. Both ranges used the traditional technique of Berbatine and Burnishing combined with Smoke Firing Key Areas Methods of Production: Establishing production and firing methods in line with existing practice. Design: Collating possibilities of design changes based on key elements from the market trend and existing Peruvian production. (Colour, form, decoration, functionality) Range: Expanding/adapting existing range to suit modern market, adding new products suitable to modern market place Materials: Adapting existing /available materials to new designs, possibility of introducing alternative materials suitable to new designs and function.
