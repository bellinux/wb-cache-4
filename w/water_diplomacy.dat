50|$|With Professor Shafiqul Islam at Tufts University, Susskind {{has created}} the <b>Water</b> <b>Diplomacy</b> Workshop, an annual {{train-the-trainer}} program for senior water professionals from the developing world who want {{to learn about the}} <b>Water</b> <b>Diplomacy</b> Framework—a consensus building alternative to more traditional ways of handling conflicts over shared or boundary waters. They have also organized the international Research Coordination Network for university-based research centers focused on water conflict. In addition, they have created the Aquapedia at Tufts, an open source advisory tool that describes and analyzes a growing number of case studies of efforts to manage water conflict around the world.|$|E
50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>diplomacy</b> {{focuses on}} {{establishing}} novel solutions {{founded on a}} scientific basis and sensitive to societal constraints {{to a wide range}} of water problems. Tools of water diplomats include environmental policy, water management strategy, and engineering solutions and are applied within the context of the individual water problem at the appropriate scale.|$|E

50|$|In 1934, Rhodes {{began to}} use his {{position}} as a local businessman to climb up the Columbus political ladder, and became a ward committeeman, {{a member of the}} Columbus school board, the city auditor, and eventually the mayor of Columbus (1944-1952). It was during this time that he married Helen Rawlins. Rhodes's time as mayor is primarily marked by two achievements, with the first being his convincing of 67% of Columbus voters to approve the city's first income tax, and the second being his successful use of <b>water</b> gun <b>diplomacy</b> to annex much of the surrounding suburbs to Columbus. As surrounding communities grew or were constructed, they came to require access to waterlines, which was under the sole control of the municipal water system. Rhodes told these communities that if they wanted water, they would have to submit to assimilation into Columbus. As a result of this, Columbus, Ohio, currently has the largest land area of any Ohio city.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Water</b> <b>Diplomacy</b> Consortium {{combines}} expertise {{from five}} Netherlands-based organizations {{to serve as}} a “global hub” to exchange knowledge and experience in water technology and water governance. The Hague Institute serves as the lead partner of the WDC which also includes Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael, Water Governance Centre, UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, and UPEACE.|$|E
50|$|He and {{his fellow}} professors offer {{multiple}} training sessions each year to interested participants. He offers sessions such as Senior Executive Program on Negotiation, Negotiation Master Class, Real Estate Negotiation, Dealing with an Angry Public, <b>Water</b> <b>Diplomacy</b> Workshop and many more. His expertise in these areas of study allow him to offer innovative {{information to the public}} that would not normally have access to his teachings.|$|E
50|$|The work of The Hague Institute is {{organized}} around three programs - Conflict Prevention, Rule of Law, and Global Governance - and covers {{a wide range}} of issues including R2P, education and conflict, climate change, <b>water</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> cyber security, mass atrocities, illicit financial flows and the role of institutions and governance such as the International Criminal Court (ICC), transitional justice. According to the Institute's website, The Hague Institute provides policy-relevant research, practitioner training and convenes actors from various areas of expertise to facilitate dialogue and stimulate knowledge sharing.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} utility of a new {{interval}} cooperative game theory as an effective <b>water</b> <b>diplomacy</b> tool to resolve competing and conflicting needs of water users from different sectors including agriculture, domestic, industry and environment. Interval parameter programming is applied in combination with cooperative game theoretic concepts such as Shapley values and the Nucleolus to provide mutually beneficial solutions for water allocation problems under uncertainty. The allocation problem consists of two steps: water resources are initially allocated to water users based on the Nash bargaining model and the achieved nonlinear interval parameter model is solved by transforming it into {{a problem with a}} deterministic weighted objective function. Water amounts and net benefits are reallocated to achieve efficient water usage through net benefit transfers. The net benefit reallocation is done by the application of different cooperative game theoretical methods. Then, the optimization problem is solved by linear interval programming and by converting it into a problem with two deterministic objective functions. The suggested model is then applied to the Zarrinehrud sub-basin, within Urmia Lake basin in Northwestern Iran. Findings suggest that a reframing of the problem using cooperative strategies within the context of <b>water</b> <b>diplomacy</b> framework - creating flexibility in water allocation using mutual gains approach - provides better outcomes for all competing users of water...|$|E
40|$|Trifunovic,Nemanja:This paper {{analyzes}} the intermittent water distribution {{system in the}} West Bank, Palestine. It quantifies the impacts of reduced supply duration on the hydraulics and costs of water distribution. It shows that designing systems based on intermittent supply criteria implies increasing the diameters of pipes significantly, which is expensive and infeasible. The paper recommends that studying the local conditions should precede the design of new systems to avoid reduced supply duration and related negative impacts. In addition, improving governance, revising tariffs, reducing leakage, saving water, involving the private sector, and improving <b>water</b> <b>diplomacy</b> {{should be considered in}} any water policy refor...|$|E

40|$|This thesis studies India's {{diplomatic}} relations with its western neighbours- namely- Pakistan and Afghanistan. In the context of increasing threats to its domestic and regional security, India has adopted a "soft power" approach in achieving its strategic interests. Through qualitative case selection, this thesis dwells into India's diplomatic approach especially through the study of <b>water</b> <b>diplomacy</b> {{in the case of}} Pakistan and public diplomacy in the case of Afghanistan. In this context, this thesis associate security concerns of the three countries with their national interests, particularly focusing on India. The underlying conclusion of this thesis is that while a hard power approach or use of coercion may serve as a base to further "soft power" approach, India needs to maintain a delicate balance between the two approaches for achieving regional stability and ensuring national security...|$|E
40|$|Water {{will be a}} {{root-cause}} or catalyst of conflicts. As a result, the Netherlands Armed Forces and {{its partners}} will be confronted with water issues in stabilisation operations. Consequently, a policy framework how to apply water management as a de-escalating, conflict prevention and resolution instrument in stabilisation operations is regarded essential by the Netherlands Army Corps of Engineers. However, an integrated and comprehensive policy framework which applies water management and <b>water</b> <b>diplomacy</b> as a development and peace instrument tailored for application in the complex and dynamic environment of stabilisation operations, did not yet exist. By means of this MSc thesis research the desired new policy framework is developed. As a result, the new policy framework will help the Netherlands Armed Forces including its military and non-military partners to conduct better stabilisation- and crisis management operations.

40|$|Planners {{and water}} {{managers}} seek to be adaptive to handle uncertainty {{through the use}} of planning approaches. In this paper, we study what type of adaptiveness is proposed and how this may be operationalized in planning approaches to adequately handle different uncertainties. We took a comparative case study approach to study two planning approaches: the <b>water</b> <b>diplomacy</b> framework (WDF) and adaptive delta management (ADM). We found that the approaches differ in their conceptualization of uncertainty and show that different types of adaptiveness are used in the approaches. While WDF builds on collaborative adaptive management as a set of ongoing adjustments and continuous learning to handle uncertainty, ADM deliberately attempts to anticipate future adaptations through a set of tools which allows for seizing opportunities and avoiding lock-in and lock-out mechanisms. We conclude that neither of the approaches is fully able to account for different uncertainties. Both approaches may benefit from specific insights in what uncertainty and adaptiveness entail for the development of water management plans. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{achievements}} of Middle East environmental diplomacy under the multilateral track and lays out a feasible program to build on these achievements. It argues that negotiations should be informed by three lessons {{from the history of}} international <b>water</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> These are: 1) unequal partners may unequally share {{the costs and benefits of}} cooperation; 2) third-party mediation is most successful if accompanied by “carrot and stick” policies; and 3) cooperation should proceed as a series of modest steps, rather than as a grand regional plan. The paper analyzes three issues in urgent need of multicountry cooperation. These are: 1) food for water trades to enhance food and water security in the region; 2) a transition to integrated pest management to halt the pollution of groundwater from agricultural runoff; and 3) the treatment and reuse of urban wastewater for health and water conservation. In addition, the countries of the region should, jointly and individually, invest in environmental training and outreach. The conclusion contains an itemized list of short-to-intermediate term recommendations for environmental diplomacy...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThis {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} explore the core drivers of international cooperation over shared water courses particularly in Southern African, using {{the example of the}} Okavango River Basin as a case study. As a starting point it highlights the hydro-political context of Southern African, which is dominated by more than 21 shared water courses and faces significant challenges to its water sector namely through climate variability and population growth. In light of these pressing issues which could create a security complex for sovereign riparian states, international cooperation over trans-boundary water sources is imperative. Drawing on core theories of international relations, this dissertation suggests that cooperation between riparian states is a result of strong institutional frameworks, at a river-basin, regional and international level. Cooperation is further reinforced through development functionalism which {{plays an important role in}} facilitating cooperation through the advancement of regional development goals and initiatives. Finally, the dissertation explores the role of international norms of cooperation over trans-boundary water courses and the important role they play in fostering cooperation. Using the case of the Okavango River Basin, the dissertation suggests that in Southern Africa, the strongest driver of cooperation is strong legal and institutional frameworks, which once established, form the basis for sustainable cooperation for <b>water</b> <b>diplomacy</b> between riparian states. Cooperation over the Okavango River Basin and the twenty years of cooperation established between Angola, Namibia and Botswana through the Permanent Cubango-Okavango River Basin Commission (OKACOM) highlights an optimistic account for hydro-political cooperation over trans-boundary water systems between sovereign riparian states and provides a useful model for water basin agreements that are yet to be established. This thesis thus concludes that in light of the growing challenges facing the water sector in Southern Africa, strong institutions and legal frameworks are required to enhance cooperation among riparian states...|$|E
40|$|At {{the time}} of writing this thesis, the {{construction}} of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is advancing. The controversies and cooperation over matters related to GERD are still {{up in the air}} amongst Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan. This study investigates whether the construction of GERD induces more cooperation or conflict amongst these states. When Ethiopia initiated the GERD project in 2011, the reactions from the two downstream countries (Egypt and Sudan) were totally variegated in a way that Sudan avowed and reaffirmed its support whilst Egypt vociferously opposed the project by alleging that the dam would infringe her historical water share rights. As a result, political tensions and war threat interactions were rampant between Egypt and Ethiopia. This scenario mounted at the peak following Ethiopia s tapping of the Nile water for the dam s purpose. Later, the signature of the 2015 tripartite agreement and perpetual <b>water</b> <b>diplomacy</b> replenished their interaction. Hence, hydro-political relations amongst these states fluctuate from cooperation scenario at a time to conflictive situation at another time. That is why this study aimed to clarify the main research question- is construction of GERD causing cooperation or conflict among the Eastern Nile Basin Nations? To entertain this question, the study employed a methodology called Framework of Hydro-hegemony as developed by Zeitoun and Warner (2006) and later updated by Cascão and Zeitoun (2010). The analysis of this framework centers itself on refining and capturing two water conflict predictions together Frey s (1993) power-analytic framework and Yoffe et. al s (2001) scale of water conflict event intensities into one so-called the framework of hydro-hegemony. The hydro-political power positions of these nations have been analyzed according to the four pillars of power positions: geographic, material, bargaining and ideation. The delve study of this research verified Egypt as the basin hydro-hegemon in material, bargaining and ideational powers while Ethiopia is leading the geographic power position owing to her upstream location. The study also reveals that Ethiopia and Sudan are progressively altering their power positions, which guaranteed them to contest Egypt´s incessant hydro-hegemony. Beyond the socio-economic benefits of the GERD, it is also served as one of Ethiopia s counter-hegemony strategies in the basin. Moreover, the bilateral and multi-lateral interactions of these states have also been evaluated per to Yoffe et. al s water intensity scale measurement and their outcomes display moderately positive correlations. The result of the study constitutes that the construction of GERD is progressively sprouting to open dialogue, trust building and cooperation on water share matters among these nations. This contributes a positive asset to the durability of peace and security, and integration in the Eastern Nile basin rather than provoking dispute and friction in the time period the study extends...|$|E
40|$|Water is {{the source}} of life. Its global {{importance}} is beyond question. It is essential for all human settlements, including cities. Water influences our social, economic, political and cultural lives. Above all, it is a human right, as recognised by the United Nations back in 2010. The 2015 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Clean Water and Sanitation aims to ensure access to water and sanitation for all, as part of an international effort to fight inequalities and tackle climate change. In order to quench the growing thirst of our planet, we need to manage water intelligently, certainly more intelligently than we have done to date. Water is an irreplaceable resource for society, but it is only renewable if well managed. We need to be open to innovation with regard to water management, especially in our cities - the urban areas which are home to an ever-increasing majority of the world’s population. In order to foster innovation and achieve its acceptance by society, scientific and technological knowledge must not only be generated but also communicated in a way that can be understood by all citizens. What must follow is an open public debate in which the priorities of our political agendas are established. And what better way to facilitate such a debate than through art? Through the passage of time, the role of water as the principal ingredient of life has been reflected in the world of art. It is the one element that has dominated human civilisation. Observing man’s perception of water {{through the eyes of the}} artist allows us to appreciate a simple truth, too often forgotten, hich is that we simply would not exist without water. The Urban Water Atlas for Europe reveals the new, pioneering concept of Sci-Art <b>Water</b> <b>Diplomacy.</b> This concept first appeared in a pilot scheme in Jordan which led to the exhibition “Science and Art in Water – Water through the eyes of Jordanian children”, organised under the auspices of the Jordanian Minister for Education by the European Commission’s science and knowledge service (the Joint Research Centre) and the partners of the Horizon 2020 Project, BlueSCities. Schoolchildren from different countries were encouraged to consider the water problems facing their region and to describe their personal feelings through drawings. The children’s thought-provoking, yet innocent images called on society to progress towards a more ecological, more sustainable and more peaceful future, perhaps far more effectively than any scientific treatise. The dramatic results of this exercise laid the philosophical basis for the Urban Water Atlas for Europe The Atlas gathers best practices of urban water management, and demonstrates how cities are addressing issues by endeavouring to become not only smart, but also resilient to the water challenges that lie ahead. The multisector collaboration involved in preparing the Atlas helped show local politicians the necessity for cities and towns to convert supranational intentions into feasible regional and local realities with regard to water and climate resilience, whilst demonstrating the advantages of an inter-municipal partnership based on trust and experience. The Atlas thus shows the way towards a new and even stronger European ideal. We hope it will be a source of inspiration for you all...|$|E
