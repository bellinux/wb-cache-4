40|$|Objective – The {{purpose of}} this {{empirical}} {{study was to examine}} the degree of alignment between the implementation of strategy and organization’s culture, and its implication on company performance. Methodology/Technique – The study is quantitative in nature using survey questionnaires. Total numbers of 201 questionnaires were sent to operational managers of Kimia Farma Pharmacy and 114 questionnaires were returned and analyzed using descriptive analysis with SPSS version 20, and the analysis of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with a statistical program AMOS version 7. Findings – The finding of the study shows the implementation of strategy and two types of organizational culture (adhocracy and clan culture) respectively influence the performance of PT Kimia Farma Pharmacy. This study, however, failed to find the best fit between the implementation of strategy and organizational culture in general. Further analysis shows that clan and hierarchy culture become the trigger of the implementation of strategy Novelty – This study proves that clan and hierarchy culture become the trigger of strategy implementation <b>which</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>generate</b> a better performance of the company...|$|E
40|$|Paper Session - Urban SustainabilityIn {{recent years}} {{there was an}} {{emerging}} debate on dense urban forms as the most proficient ways to reduce energy consumption and pollution and for contributing to sustainability. While high density development remains at {{the centre of the}} debate of developing a sustainable city, different countries adopt different density policies and achieve different density patterns <b>which</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>generate</b> distinctive consequences on livability. Very {{little is known about the}} impact of urban density on livability in the developing countries, despite their high densities. Dhaka, the Capital of Bangladesh, has been ranked as the most densely populated urban area of the world, and its densification process is still on going. As a first step to investigate how Dhaka as a high density city should be managed to realize the advantages and diminish the disadvantages of its density patterns on livability, this paper aims to address the following question: What is the impact of the density pattern on the livability of Dhaka in urban sustainability terms? Both qualitative and quantitative analyses will be undertaken. The major indicators to assess livability will include accessibility to public transport and community facilities, quality of and accessibility to open space, residential space standard, safety of the locality and health performance of the residents. Semi-structured interviews along with questionnaire survey will be undertaken. This study argues that in a high density city which is featured with contiguous low-rise development, it does not possess most of the sustainability benefits in livability as postulated in the compact city literature. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Space Flow between {{periods of}} time is always a deep {{dimensional}} projection of human beliefs. At best it can provide an echo of a spiritual universe which integrates man in a meaningful order and provides him with essential inner fulfilment, by {{the very fact that}} his small personal world is in harmony with a much larger reality. The conflict between the traditional culture and modern systems of thought has to be seen in this wider philosophical context, for the controversial issue is the interpretation of "development " and what it should entail: should development enable the balanced realization of the totality of human faculties and capabilities, or should it reduce reality to limited aspects of material life {{at the expense of other}} qualities? Should it promote an increase in quantifiable production only, or should it support a different type of creativity, which includes more fundamental forces and experiences? As far-fetched as these questions may seem, they determine the cultural responses <b>which</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>generate</b> the built environment and its physical expressions. This paper is an attempt to answer the following questions: What are the contributions to discover the potential of continuity between Past, Present and Future? By analyzing and interpreting basic urban and architectural patterns and by exemplifying, how some of them can be adopted or re-interpreted in a contemporary context?, how to deal with the problems and incompatibilities caused by the impact of time differences, both in philosophical and in practical terms?

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) {{is a highly}} prevalent disease worldwide. Cardiovascular disorders generated {{as a consequence of}} T 2 DM are a major cause of death related to this disease. Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by the morphological, functional and metabolic changes in the heart produced as a complication of T 2 DM. This cardiac disorder is characterized by constant high blood glucose and lipids levels <b>which</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>generate</b> oxidative stress, defective calcium handling, altered mitochondrial function, inflammation and fibrosis. In this context, insulin is of paramount importance for cardiac contractility, growth and metabolism and therefore, an impaired insulin signaling plays a critical role in the DCM development. However, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms leading to DCM are still a matter of study. Despite the numerous questions raised in the study of DCM, there have also been important findings, such as the role of micro-RNAs (miRNAs), which can not only have the potential of being important biomarkers, but also therapeutic targets. Furthermore, exosomes also arise as an interesting variable to consider, since they represent an important inter-cellular communication mechanism and therefore, they may explain many aspects of the pathophysiology of DCM and their study may lead to the development of therapeutic agents capable of improving insulin signaling. In addition, adenosine and adenosine receptors (ARs) may also {{play an important role in}} DCM. Moreover, the possible cross-talk between insulin and ARs may provide new strategies to reverse its defective signaling in the diabetic heart. This review focuses on DCM, the role of insulin in this pathology and the discussion of new molecular insights which may help to understand its underlying mechanisms and generate possible new therapeutic strategies.

40|$|In highly eusocial insects, such as {{the honey}} bee, Apis mellifera, the {{reproductive}} bias has become embedded in morphological caste differences. These are most expressively denoted in ovary size, with adult queens having large ovaries consisting of 150 - 200 ovarioles each, while workers typically have only 1 - 20 ovarioles per ovary. This morphological differentiation {{is a result of}} hormonal signals triggered by the diet change in the third larval instar, <b>which</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>generate</b> caste-specific gene expression patterns. To reveal these we produced differential gene expression libraries by Representational Difference Analysis (RDA) for queen and worker ovaries in a developmental stage when cell death is a prominent feature in the ovarioles of workers, whereas all ovarioles are maintained and extend in length in queens. In the queen library, 48 % of the gene set represented homologs of known Drosophila genes, whereas in the worker ovary, the largest set (59 %) were ESTs evidencing novel genes, not even computationally predicted in the honey bee genome. Differential expression was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR for a selected gene set, denoting major differences for two queen and two worker library genes. These included two unpredicted genes located in chromosome 11 (Group 11. 35 and Group 11. 31, respectively) possibly representing long non-coding RNAs. Being candidates as modulators of ovary development, their expression and functional analysis should be a focal point for future studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Detailed {{computer}} simulations are indispensable tools {{for the development}} and optimization of modern particle detectors. The interaction of particles with the sensitive medium, giving rise to ionization or excitation of atoms, is stochastic by its nature. The transport of the resulting photons and charge carriers, <b>which</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>generate</b> the observed signal, is also subject to statistical fluctuations. Together with the readout electronics, these processes - which are ultimately governed by the atomic cross-sections for the respective interactions - pose a fundamental limit to the achievable detector performance. Conventional methods for calculating electron drift lines based on macroscopic transport coefficients used to provide an adequate description for traditional gas-based particle detectors such as wire chambers. However, they are not suitable for small-scale devices such as micropattern gas detectors, which have significantly gained importance in recent years. In this thesis, a novel approach, based on semi-classical (``microscopic'') Monte Carlo simulation, is presented. As a first application, the simulation of avalanche fluctuations is discussed. It is shown that the microscopic electron transport method allows, for the first time, a quantitative prediction of gas gain spectra. Further, it is shown that the shape of avalanche size distributions in uniform fields can be understood intuitively {{in terms of a}} toy model extracted from the simulation. Stochastic variations in the number of electrons produced along a charged particle track are another determining factor for the resolution and efficiency of a detector. It is shown that the parameters characterizing primary ionization fluctuations, more specifically the so-called W value and the Fano factor, can be calculated accurately using microscopic techniques such that they need no longer be treated as free variables in the simulation. Profiting from recent progress in the determination of Penning transfer probabilities, the influence of excitation transfer on both primary ionization fluctuations and avalanche statistics is examined and a model for the microscopic calculation of Penning effects is proposed. "Garfield'" is a widely used program for the simulation of gas-based particle detectors. In the context of this thesis work, an object-oriented version (Garfield++) of this software package was developed which includes the above-mentioned microscopic methods. The integration of semiconductor detectors in Garfield++, comprising the adaptation of algorithms, modelling of material properties and validation against measurements, constitutes a further topic of the thesis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStabilizing {{unstable}} periodic {{orbits of}} a deterministic chaotic system which is perturbed by a stochastic process is studied in this paper.

Based upon the seminal idea by Yukawa [1], first field-theoretic {{attempts to}} derive the nucleonnucleon (NN) interaction focused on pion-exchange. While the one-pion exchange turned out to be very useful in explaining NN scattering data and the properties of the deuteron [2], multi-pion exchange was beset with serious ambiguities [3, 4]. Thus, the “pion theories ” of the 1950 s are generally judged as failures—for reasons we understand today: pion dynamics is constrained by chiral symmetry, a crucial point that was unknown in the 1950 s. Historically, the experimental discovery of heavy mesons [5] in the early 1960 s saved the situation. The one-boson-exchange(OBE) model [6, 7] emerged which is still the most economical and quantitative phenomenology for describing the nuclear force [8, 9]. The weak point of this model, however, is the scalarisoscalar “sigma ” or “epsilon ” boson, for which the empirical evidence remains controversial. Since this boson is associated with the correlated (or resonant) exchange of two pions, a vast theoretical effort that occupied more than a decad...|$|R

Voxelised breast models are {{a crucial part}} of VCT as they allow the generation of synthetic image projections of breast tissue distribution. Therefore, realistic breast models containing an accurate representation of women breasts are needed. Current voxelised breast models show, in their compressed version, a very round contour which might not be representative of the entire population. This work pretends to develop an imaging framework, based on depth cameras, to investigate breast deformation during mammographic compression.

It disentangles market means from welfare ends and recognises the importance, constitutional status and independent stand of the former. Freedom {{is placed in}} the same categories as rights.

Its successfulness however sometimes transforms into its biggest enemy. Economic prosperity is a category which can find supporters more rapidly than the notion of economic freedom does.

40|$|In {{order for}} {{oligodendrocyte}} progenitor cells (OPCs) to differentiate into fully mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes, {{they must be}} specified at the correct times and undergo coordinated changes in both gene expression and morphology. As oligodendrocytes differentiate, they transition from a bipolar morphology into a morphology characterized by a complex network of multiple processes, <b>which</b> will <b>eventually</b> <b>generate</b> membranous structures necessary for myelination of axonal segments. As changes are observed in cellular morphology, oligodendrocytes also undergo changes in their gene expression profile and express genes necessary for both early and later stages of development such as olig 1 and myelin basic protein (mbp), respectively. Data from our laboratory demonstrate that autotaxin (ATX), {{also referred to as}} phosphodiesterase Iα/autotaxin (PD-Iα/ATX), is involved in all of these processes as a multifunctional protein by regulating lysophospholipid signaling and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Previously, our laboratory has identified ATX as an oligodendrocyte-secreted factor present in the extracellular environment that via a newly-identified functional domain, named the MORFO domain (modulator of oligodendrocyte remodeling and focal adhesion organization), can regulate adhesion of oligodendrocytes to naturally occurring extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and ultimately the establishment of the oligodendrocyte’s complex process network. In vitro data presented in this dissertation suggest that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), via production from ATX’s well characterized lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) domain, can induce the expression of myelin basic protein (mbp) and the establishment of membranous structures by differentiating oligodendrocytes, both necessary for the initial stages of myelination. Interested in relating these functions to an in vivo model and due to the early embryonic lethality of atx-null mice, we utilized the zebrafish as an in vivo model. The in vivo data presented in this dissertation demonstrate that atx expression in the zebrafish is evolutionarily conserved within vertebrates. Interestingly, in both mouse and the zebrafish, atx was found expressed by cells of the cephalic floor plate in addition to differentiating oligodendrocytes. Functionally the in vivo data presented in this dissertation confirmed ATX’s role in stimulating mbp expression during later stages of oligodendrocyte development. In addition, a novel function for ATX was revealed by the studies undertaken as part of this dissertation that has never been described before. More specifically, based on the timing of atx expression and the phenotype seen upon atx knock-down, the data presented here suggest that ATX, released by the cephalic floor plate, regulates early oligodendrocyte development and/or specification. Taken together, these data identify ATX as a major regulator for early as well as late developmental stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage...|$|R
