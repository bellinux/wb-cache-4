2500|$|One of {{the more}} famous images of the event was the live {{broadcast}} of Hoy Mismo, a news program in the Televisa television network, when the earthquake struck. In the video, movement can be seen, especially in the lights above the newscasters. The three newscasters were María Victoria Llamas (substituting for Guillermo Ochoa), Lourdes Guerrero and Juan Dosal. As the movement began Llamas reports grabbing {{the underside of the}} desk, and whispering quickly to her colleagues that she hoped no one could see how scared she was. The last image broadcast from the studio was that of Lourdes Guerrero stating [...] "...it's still shaking a little (sigue temblando un poquitito), but we must take it calmly. We will <b>wait</b> <b>just</b> a second so we can keep talking." [...] Then the image disappeared. The transmission ended because a nearby 10-ton antenna had bent over and crushed parts of Televisa's buildings that were located on Niños Héroes and Dr. Río de la Loza Streets in Colonia Doctores.|$|E

60|$|RIDGEON. Of course. Shew him up. [She {{turns to}} go]. Stop. [To Sir Patrick] I want two minutes more with you between ourselves. [To Emmy] Emmy: ask Mr. Walpole to <b>wait</b> <b>just</b> two minutes, while I finish a consultation.|$|E
60|$|OLIVER. But, Anabel--we must fix a meeting. I say, <b>wait</b> <b>just</b> a moment. Could I call on your people? Go {{into town}} with me one day. I don't know whether Gerald intends to see you--whether {{he intends to}} ask you to Lilley Close.|$|E

60|$|I <b>waited</b> <b>just</b> {{long enough}} to see the baffled {{officers}} unbarring the window shutters for the purpose of giving the alarm, before I closed the peephole, and with a farewell look at the distorted face of my prostrate enemy, Screw, left the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's nothing!" [...] the Professor {{carelessly}} remarked, {{feeling in}} his pocket, as if he always carried at least that amount about with him. [...] "But wouldn't you like to <b>wait</b> <b>just</b> another year, and make it four thousand? Just think how rich you'd be! Why, {{you might be a}} King, if you liked!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{there you}} ARE! I thought I'd better come and see, {{so that we}} can fetch you at lunch time.--You've got a seat? Are you quite comfortable? Is there {{anything}} I could get you? Why, you're in a non-smoker!--But that doesn't matter, everybody will smoke. Are you sure you have everything? Oh, but <b>wait</b> <b>just</b> one moment--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{suppose it}} can't be helped: but I am {{used to being}} out in all weathers. I can <b>wait,</b> <b>just</b> as well as not. But I don't want my {{daughter}} here to get wet, and she has no umbrella. Would you mind taking her on your boat? When {{you get to the}} town, she can run up to our hotel by herself. She knows the way." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked into}} the white, piteous young face {{that had once been}} so lovely, and her soul faltered. It needed the {{knowledge}} that Bothwell <b>waited</b> <b>just</b> beyond the door, that he could overhear what was being said, to strengthen her fearfully in her tragic purpose.|$|R
60|$|It {{was only}} a few minutes later that the hunter who had {{followed}} Lightfoot across the River reached the bank and scrambled out of his boat. Lightfoot's friend was <b>waiting</b> <b>just</b> {{at the top of the}} bank. Of course the hunter saw him at once.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, now, <b>just</b> <b>wait,</b> Dave Porter! <b>Just</b> <b>wait</b> a little, and you'll {{find out}} what I mean. You are a poorhouse nobody and nothing else. Dave Porter? Why, you are not Dave Porter at all! You are a poorhouse nobody; that's all you are!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{day when}} I {{came in from}} a sail I saw two little figures upon the sands, and it needed no word from anyone to tell me my little ladies had come back. They jumped and clapped their hands when they saw me, and would have run across the water to meet me hadn't I shouted to them to <b>wait</b> <b>just</b> a minute till I should be with them.|$|E
60|$|The crowd seemed {{inclined}} to <b>wait</b> <b>just</b> a brief while longer {{in order to}} see Nola put up on the catasta and to hear the bid of twenty aurei made for her by her mother--a bid which, at the praefect's commands, was to be final and undisputed. Just to see the hammer come clashing down as an epilogue to the palpitating drama was perhaps worth waiting for. The human goods still left for sale after {{that would have to be}} held over for a more favourable opportunity.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's too dreadful! Marjorie," [...] she said, [...] "I {{want to ask}} you to do something. After all, {{a mother}} has some claim. Will you <b>wait</b> <b>just</b> a little. Will you promise me to do nothing--nothing, I mean, to commit you--until your father has been able to make inquiries. Don't see him for a little while. Very soon you'll be one-and-twenty, and then perhaps things may be different. If he cares for you, and you for him, a little {{separation}} won't matter.... Until your father has inquired...." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{they helped}} him shove open the cabin door, {{and he felt}} sure they shut it after him--at least he heard it slam and the latch fall sharply into place. And {{he knew they were}} <b>waiting</b> <b>just</b> without, <b>waiting</b> for him to do his task.|$|R
60|$|Once {{again the}} enemy withdrew, but again {{only for a}} short time, and now they came in full force, the lions and the men, {{possibly}} a half dozen of each, the men casting their spears and the lions <b>waiting</b> <b>just</b> behind, evidently for the signal to charge.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Puff-Pudgy {{popped into}} the hole like a flash, for {{she was used to}} it, and <b>waited</b> <b>just</b> below the opening to guide them. So, Twinkle slipped down {{to the floor of the}} tunnel and Chubbins {{followed}} close after her, and then they began to go downward.|$|R
6000|$|... "Too {{long for}} me, my boy. I'm a shady bird, in all senses of the word, in all senses of the word.--Now are you comfortable? What? Have another cushion? A rug for your knees? You're quite sure now? Well, <b>wait</b> <b>just</b> one moment till the waiter {{brings up a}} syphon, and you shall have a whiskey and soda. Precious--oh, yes, very {{precious}} these days--like drinking gold. Thirty-five lire a bottle, my boy!" [...] Argyle pulled a long face, and made a noise with his lips. [...] "But I had this bottle given me, and luckily you've come while there's a drop left. Very glad you have! Very glad you have." ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>wait,</b> <b>just</b> wait, if {{you feel}} anxious about the {{solidity}} of the British connection, till the twelfth of the month, when everybody is wearing an orange streamer in his coat and the Orangemen (every man in town) walk in the big procession. Allegiance! Well, perhaps you remember the address they gave to the Prince of Wales on the platform of the Mariposa station as he went through on his tour to the west. I think that pretty well settled that question. So you will easily understand that of course everybody belongs to the Knights of Pythias and the Masons and Oddfellows, just as they all belong to the Snow Shoe Club and the Girls' Friendly Society.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just this," [...] {{her voice}} almost a whisper. [...] "I am frightened of it all, {{and when you}} want me I will come to you. No, <b>wait</b> <b>just</b> a little. I could never marry {{the man who was}} {{fighting}} against my father and the people I belong to, while, now I know what you are, I could never ask him to go back on what he felt was right; but, Larry, the men you did so much for have turned against you, and the things they are doing are not right, and would never please you. Can't we go away and leave the trouble behind us? Nobody seems to want us now." ...|$|E
