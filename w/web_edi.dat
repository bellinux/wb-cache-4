ISL is developing a Security Event Management System which takes care of all security related events in the intermodal chain. The security system registers the schedule and transport information of a container and assigns a corridor for its transport. During the transport the system receives events which {{will be used for}} computing a security risk factor for each container, by considering restrictions like position with respect to the assigned corridor, duration of standstill and others.

Online businesses found EDI was too cumbersome to accommodate all the file formats and business rules the growing volume of e-commerce retailers required. CommerceHub developed a web-based approach to serve e-commerce integration needs with their Universal Connection Hub, a translation engine that provides integration to translate and normalize supply chain communications, and enable electronic processing of purchase orders, change orders, and remittance confirmations in native file format. The Universal Connection Hub supports industry communications and file format options including web browser, VPN, VAN, FTP, <b>web</b> services, HTTPS, <b>EDI,</b> XML, flat files, spreadsheets, and others.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the level of {{development}} reached by some Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as <b>web</b> pages, e-mail, <b>EDI,</b> and business management software in the business world. To this end, we have concentrated on the business behaviour of the service sector. Nevertheless, the technological development demanded changes depending on the activity of the firm, so the mediator effect of the industry has been tested in the process of acceptance of innovations. Our results show the technology acceptance process is influenced by the perception of both the usefulness and the ease of use of such innovation. Moreover, the industry effect mediates the technological behaviour of the firm; meanwhile, if the firms performs a “traditional activity”, there are less incentives to implement the innovation...|$|R
40|$|Interorganizational system {{standards}} are reaching {{a new era}} in industry. When asked about interorganizational systems, invariably most people think of electronic data interchange (EDI) standards (ANSI X 12). Albeit EDI still remains the preeminent type of interorganizational system, IOS solutions have been overhauled since the mid- 1990 s. IOS solutions are now collaboratively developed, structured around discretely defined cross-company business process standards and able to be distributed via the <b>web.</b> Compared with <b>EDI</b> technology from the past, the notions of open standards, modularity, scalability, and interorganizational business process reengineering have become embedded in modern-day IOS development. This paper is intended to examine assimilation levels of interorganizational system standards and process innovations (IOS SPI) among members of an industrial group where an IOS standards development organization (SDO) exists. A Conceptual IOS SPI Adoption and Innovation Diffusion Model is developed, defined and nine hypotheses are proposed and empirically tested based on firm-level cross-sectional surveys of 102 firms from 10 different industria...|$|R
40|$|Exel is {{a global}} company {{providing}} core expertise in contract logistics and freight management. Exel Sweden is currently in a growth phase {{and as part of}} its development, Exel strives to establish a homogenous IT structure. A vital part of an IT structure for logistics purposes is a Warehouse Management System (WMS). To make full use of a WMS, it is imperative to attain knowledge regarding the capabilities of these systems. Exel has on a global level decided to use a WMS from the WMS vendor Red Prairie. The intended system for Exel Sweden is a budget version, containing only the most basic functions, but with the possibility for future upgrades. The aim of this thesis is to create a knowledge base concerning the capabilities of such a system and with its help, analyze the need for WMS at the first site, LC GOT, where Red Prairie’s WMS is to be implemented. In the knowledge base I have defined a number of benefits that can derive from the effective utilization of a WMS. Each benefit is catalogued under one of the following categories: Reduction of operational costs Less capital tied up Increased customer service levels Moreover different functions and technologies of WMS are identified and defined. In order to provide with a holistic view of the potential role of a WMS in warehouse processes, these processes are presented with descriptive flowcharts. (This is the public version of the thesis and as a consequence it does not include the case study. The {{reason for this is that}} it contains sensitive information). In the case analysis, the specific needs for WMS at LC GOT are checked against the functions and technologies defined in the knowledgebase. Finally, Red Prairie’s responses to the needs of LC GOT are analyzed. The main conclusion of the case study is that the present need for WMS at LC GOT is, due to a very low workload, very rudimentary, limited to a few basic functions and technologies; Inventory management Basic transport administrative functions Electronic Data Interchange (<b>EDI)</b> <b>Web</b> interface technologies As a consequence of the low workload, substantial improvements should not be expected to derive from the implementation of the WMS. Red Prairie’s WMS is fully covering the present need for functions but does however lack <b>EDI</b> and <b>web</b> interfacing capabilities. The present system, GTS 2000 provides with these technologies. Due to the high implementation costs for EDI, this capability should be EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION OF IT WITHIN A LOGISTICS FACILITY sustained by the old system, until financially motivated. It is however not suitable to maintain the web interface of the old system as it would practically double the administrative work. Despite the lack of expected improvements and problems related to lack of technologies, the new WMS will be a great asset in a possible, more work intensive future. But for this to be true, it needs to be effectively utilized with the appropriate upgrades. The conclusions of the thesis as a whole are that a WMS can deliver significant improvements to a warehouse if properly utilized. In order to achieve this, a number of factors have to be taken into consideration: The technology factor: To facilitate most functions of a WMS, it needs to be supported by different technologies, of which Radio Frequency (RF) and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) are the two most vital. Capacity: Many of the improvements a WMS can deliver are related to the reduction of operational costs. This is practically done by making different warehouse processes more efficient. If a warehouse is operating well below its maximum capacity there is not much for a WMS to make more effective. Critical mass: The implementation of a WMS can be very cost intensive and the costs are not completely correlated with the warehouse size. A larger warehouse will also experience more considerable improvements than a smaller. As a consequence of this, a complete WMS can be hard to financially motivate for smaller warehouses. Even though some of the capabilities of a WMS can be difficult to financially motivate, other things have to be taken into consideration. The single most important factor is customer demands. On a highly competitive market like that of 3 PL/ 4 PL providers, the capabilities to offer the best possible services will always be imperative for success. The effective utilization of WMS and other IT systems is and will continue to be essential for attaining this success...|$|R
