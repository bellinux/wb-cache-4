The couple were wed on 3 October 1966 and have three sons; Darren, Stephen and Jonathan, who played semi-professional {{football}} for Nelson and Colne. He {{has lived in the}} village of Worsthorne since retiring from football in 1974. Following his retirement he rented a warehouse from a friend and started a do-it-yourself retail business in the centre of Burnley. The shop was reasonably successful, and Irvine opened a second branch in Keighley, West Yorkshire. However, the business became untenable after several years and left Irvine owing £44,000 to the bank after a potential buyer for the shop pulled out of the deal. Following the collapse of the business, Irvine suffered severe depression and at one stage attempted suicide by taking an overdose of paracetamol tablets. He was discovered in time by his wife and admitted to Burnley General Hospital, where he underwent an emergency procedure to pump his stomach. After the attempt, he got a part-time job with Burnley Borough Council, working with young people at local community centres. He later worked as a <b>window</b> <b>cleaner</b> for 12months before selling the round for a profit. Irvine then took a job in an engineering factory, where he worked for 14years, before joining electrical firm LED. From there, he moved to Aeropia, an aircraft parts manufacturer, where he has worked as a stores manager ever since. On matchdays at Turf Moor, he gives guided tours of the ground to supporters.|$|E

Friday regularly stole by this time, but despite numerous convictions, did not go to a detention centre until he was 16. Having been caught stealing what Tony recalled to be [...] "a car radio or something", he was released almost immediately because he suffered from asthma. However, after he re-offended three months later he was sent to Feltham Borstal where he served 14 months. During his time there, Friday became stronger and fitter and also starred for the Borstal football team.

2500|$|Berry {{recalls the}} artistic {{inspiration}} he obtained from... "the streets of my early childhood, the moorland landscape, pit villages, public houses, chip shops, night town and later avenue life." [...] Lamenting change, he bemoans that, [...] "the old wooden mangle rollers {{were replaced by}} rubber wringers, the iron range grate by little fancy tiled affairs, the elegant, slim paper packets of five Woodbines disappeared..." [...] He felt {{he had been born}} into a tightly cohesive society, but [...] "the values that had held the working class together began to slowly be eroded." [...] He loved a world that was filled with, [...] "a line of shunted coal waggons...wreaths of steam and a smell of gas...youths playing cards {{at the back of the}} old knackers yard...old men cough in the betting shops and huge fat women queue in the Co-op...the chain row and pit-head gear." [...] This was a [...] "place of empty chapels and aborted kilns", [...] "the <b>window</b> <b>cleaner</b> with wild eyes and a mania for gambling", or indeed [...] "an effeminate man who wears a ginger wig...muttering to himself all day, he pushes an old pram with a bird cage in it." [...] Touchingly, he noticed the habits of the people: [...] "at weekends when you are flush and filled with drink or the prospect of drink", and when one might feel [...] "as dry as a lime-burner's clog." [...] He loved [...] "the sunken bricks of his garden path." [...] and even a visit to the gents could become an inspiring revelation: [...] "as I stand piddling in the crazed urinal stall I can see the red and green tail lights of some night plane moving across this area of infinite velvet over the darkened hoop of the world." ...|$|E
