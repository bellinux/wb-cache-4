40|$|Low-cost {{tethered}} buoys {{are important}} for seawater observation, coastal area monitoring, and pollution sensing. Underwater sensor networks operating at 433 MHz (ISM band) suffer high attenuation due to seawater conductivity. Significant propagation distance cannot be achieved through seawater or along the seabed. This paper reports a novel technique for communication between sensors operating in shallow water. A sensor tethered to the bottom was connected to a floating monopole antenna via an insulated <b>wire</b> <b>transmission</b> line. Experiments and calculations show that the attenuation along the transmission line was 38 dB/m. Surface propagation for buoy-to-base station was approximately 1 dB/m with a communication range of 30 m using a 10 -dBm transmitter circuit with receiver sensitivity of − 110 dBm. For buoy to buoy the surface propagation was measured as 3. 5 dB/m with a communication range of 4 m. Experiments were carried out in calm water conditions. The results demonstrate that significant sensor network coverage of coastal regions is possible. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringNo Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} much improved, accurate, fast and simple {{crosstalk}} model for coupled interconnect line considering the skin effect. It {{is time for}} VLSI designers to examine the crosstalk noise effects in their designs, {{so that they are}} free from noise. Hence, accurate noise modelling for RLC lines is critical for timing and system integrity analysis. Skin effect alters the values of the resistance and also the inductance, which in turn affects the system integrity in particular and its response as a whole. Till now the skin effect has been neglected for modelling the on-chip interconnects. This paper addresses a novel analytical model to find the impact of skin effect on the noise variation in RLC interconnect, without considering the skin effect modelling in inductance under ramp input. In the proposed work, the resistance variation due to the skin effect is considered in a two <b>wire</b> <b>transmission</b> line model.
