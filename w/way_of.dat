5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life over the aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E

30|$|Indigenous <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> {{knowing and}} {{learning}} {{are described as}} relational and interconnected because they are seen from a holistic perspective (Steinhauer 2002).

A relational nature <b>of</b> Indigenous <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing is {{a stark contrast to}} Western <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing which attempts to dissect, compartmentalize and measure nature to understand it (Overmars 2010, p. 90). This binary has impacted negatively on Indigenous parents and children because their <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing have been depicted as inferior to Western <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing. Indigenous <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing are neither inferior nor superior to Western <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing; they are a different perspective which needs to be acknowledged rather than trying to justify their inclusion in the realms of Western education (Brayboy and Castagno, 2008).|$|R

40|$|Studies {{in organic}} {{chemistry}} education focus mainly on increasing students' performance. Studies from general chemistry education reveal that students' performance {{is not a}} good indicator of conceptual understanding. In support, Bhattacharyya and Bodner (2005) reveal that chemistry graduate students can produce correct answers to reaction mechanisms tasks in organic chemistry without understanding the underlying concepts behind the tasks. This dissertation uses the constructs of Harel's DNR-based instruction (1998, 2001, in press [a]) to categorize students' <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understanding aromaticity and electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. DNR refers to three instructional principles: Duality Principle, Necessity Principle and Repeated Reasoning Principle. Primarily, this study applies the following constructs integral to the Duality Principle: <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understanding and <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> thinking. The {{purpose of this study is}} three- fold. The first purpose is to identify students' <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understanding aromaticity and electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions and subsequently the <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> thinking that are inferred by these <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understanding. The second purpose of this study is to provide quantitative evidence of students' beliefs (one category <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> thinking) about learning organic chemistry. The third purpose is to show how we can help students develop more desirable <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understanding aromaticity. First, several <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understanding were identified from semi- structured interviews conducted with 12 undergraduate- level students. Three <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> thinking were inferred from these <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understanding: 1) non-referential symbolic reasoning, 2) non-referential use of terminology, and 3) beliefs about learning organic chemistry. Second, the results of a 46 -Item Likert Scale survey provided empirical evidence to support the claim that the students have a tendency towards memorization when learning organic chemistry. Third, this study demonstrated the potential for students' developing more scientific <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understanding aromaticity through teaching interview sessions where problem tasks were designed to perturb students existing <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understandin...|$|R

40|$|Literature {{shows that}} ‘new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> {{learning}}’ cause {{a shift in}} learning settings with a growing attention to facilitating autonomy, interaction and knowledge exploration anytime, anywhere. These trends show evident similarities with developments in office environments known for as ‘new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> working’. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore how facility managers in Dutch higher education perceive developments in learning and teaching in order to keep the learning facilities aligned to the changing demands of modern education. The study first describes the similarities between existing theory <b>of</b> new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> working in offices and new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> learning in educational environments, resulting in a conceptual framework that links learning space to new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> learning. The framework is empirically explored based on interviews with facility managers in 14 Dutch Institutes for Higher Education. The findings show that new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> learning requires an integral approach that considers new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> education, the new student, digitisation of learning and teaching and new learning space. The study presents ten points of attention to pro-actively cope with new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> learning in higher education institutes. The results of the research contribute to a better understanding of the alignment of learning space to the evolving needs that come from new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> learning supported by advanced information and communication technology (ICT) and can be used by facility managers and corporate real estate managers to support strategic decision-making.
