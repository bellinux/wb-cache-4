500|$|Early {{publicity}} {{for the film}} in 1984 included an announcement that David Bowie would play Zorin. He later decided {{to turn down the}} role, saying, [...] "I didn't want to spend five months <b>watching</b> <b>my</b> stunt double fall off cliffs." [...] The role was offered to Sting and finally to Christopher Walken.|$|E
500|$|By this time, the five-member Manson {{family had}} become the last native {{inhabitants}} of Stroma, [...] "Now liv in a silent community of empty houses, an empty church and an empty school." [...] Although {{the head of the}} family, Andrew Manson, called the island [...] "a paradise in summer" [...] and a place where he was [...] "free of outside distractions and <b>watching</b> <b>my</b> sons growing from boyhood to manhood– teaching them to live like men, to be dependent on no one," [...] it was a bleak life for the women, who had applied for a council house at Scrabster, near Thurso. The Mansons finally left Stroma on 6 December 1962, bringing to an end thousands of years of permanent habitation on the island.|$|E
500|$|In March 2005, Studio Ghibli {{split from}} Tokuma Shoten. In the 1980s, Miyazaki {{contacted}} Ursula K. Le Guin expressing interest in producing {{an adaptation of}} her Earthsea novels; unaware of Miyazaki's work, Le Guin declined. Upon <b>watching</b> <b>My</b> Neighbor Totoro several years later, Le Guin expressed approval {{to the concept of}} the adaptation. She met with Suzuki in August 2005, who wanted Miyazaki's son Gorō to direct the film, as Miyazaki had wished to retire. Disappointed that Miyazaki was not directing, but under the impression that he would supervise his son's work, Le Guin approved of the film's production. Miyazaki later publicly opposed and criticized Gorō's appointment as director. Upon Miyazaki's viewing of the film, he wrote a message for his son: [...] "It was made honestly, so it was good".|$|E

500|$|In his 2005 book Rip It Up and Start Again: Post Punk 1978–1984, British music {{journalist}} Simon Reynolds {{describes the}} sound of the album as [...] "pared and sparse". He goes on to describe Pattinson's [...] "granite basslines" [...] carrying the melody; Sergeant's guitar playing as [...] "jagged-quartz" [...] and avoiding [...] "anything resembling a solo, apart from the odd flinty peal of lead playing"; de Freitas' drumming as minimal and [...] "surging urgency"; and McCulloch's vocals as having [...] "precocious authority". Reynolds then describes the songs as being rooted in [...] "doubt, anguish, despair" [...] while the [...] "tightness and brightness of their sound transmits contradictory sensations of confidence, vigour and euphoria." [...] He also describes how the line [...] "Stars are stars and they shine so hard"– from the track [...] "Stars Are Stars"– showed how the band felt no embarrassment in their wish to be famous. In 1989 McCulloch told Reynolds how, as a teenager, he felt there was [...] "a big movie camera in the sky". McCulloch described the opening line of the track [...] "Going Up"– [...] "Ain't thou <b>watching</b> <b>my</b> film"– as a terrible line and he went on to say, [...] "It was meant to be tongue in cheek, but that was what spurred me on." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{wrote that}} [...] "after an underwhelming pre-credits sequence... this sucker moved, {{and lots of}} things happened. [...] We met our four new regulars, {{squeezed}} in useful flashbacks about [...] and even found out the real reason they're on the island ... The flipside of all this business is that 'Confirmed Dead' didn't have the same emotional resonance as ' Beginning of the End'... but you clearly can't have everything in every episode." [...] Times James Poniewozik said that [...] "What amazed [...] about this episode was the economy and precision with which it introduced... {{the crew of the}} downed chopper from [...] [...] Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island, and yet {{by the end of the}} episode, I felt I had a true handle on what they were like as individuals." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly thought that [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] "was downright alive with fascinating new characters, mind-blowing new possibilities, and exciting new theory fodder"; however, he had heard complaints from others who received the preview screeners that they found the episode to be flawed. [...] They considered the scene where 815 is found to be cheating the flashback formula because Daniel only experiences it by watching it on television, Frank's safe landing of the helicopter to be a mystery, Naomi's flashback to be cheating Lost rules because she is dead and Ben's manipulation of Locke to be an overused storyline. [...] E!'s Kristin Dos Santos exclaimed [...] "hot damn!" [...] in response to the scene where 815 is found in the Sunda Trench. [...] She also thought that [...] "Juliet and Kate giggling at Jack's 'wink thing' was hilarious" [...] and it was [...] "awesome to see [...] again". [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard highlighted [...] "watching Dan's landing from his point of view. [...] You can feel his panic as he's free-falling through the air, looks up at his parachute, looks down to see himself about to hit the trees... it was amazing." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott gave [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] an 8/10, writing that it [...] "isn't a disappointing episode by any means but it definitely suffers from being a 'setup' episode for these four new characters" [...] and praising the new actors by writing that [...] "Leung does an adequate job of getting Miles' arrogant brand of confidence across while Davies presents Faraday's awkward mannerisms well. [...] Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] "Watching 'Confirmed Dead' was like <b>watching</b> <b>my</b> dream episode of Lost [...] people asked direct questions for once... this episode was all about the Freighties." [...] A day after the original broadcast, BuddyTV's Dahl claimed that [...] " [...] on an epic journey, one that has been as entertaining and engrossing as any TV series has ever been". In contrast, TV Guides Michael Ausiello of [...] said that it [...] "was thirty-one flavors of awesome... the negatives outweighed the positives". [...] He had problems with Claire's lack of grief for Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) death and Jack waiting so long to find out the freighter folk's main objective. [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] three out of five stars, calling it [...] "so-so", but commenting that [...] "the new revelations in the episode are fairly startling and provide a momentary distraction from the frustrations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} DVD a [...] "B+" [...] rating and wrote, [...] "While you may enjoy <b>watching</b> <b>My</b> Own Private Idaho, whether {{you choose to}} view this two-disc Criterion edition in its {{entirety}} {{depends on how much}} you enjoy watching people talking about My Own Private Idaho", and concluded, [...] "But with all the various interpretations and influences, this is definitely a film worth talking about".|$|E

2500|$|Most reviewers {{rated the}} game poorly {{in terms of}} {{gameplay}} substance and originality, but gave high ratings to the game's graphic properties, physics engine, and overall very good pinball simulation. One IGN author wrote of his experience playing the game: [...] "I've had more fun <b>watching</b> <b>my</b> dog clean herself." [...] The same author also commented that the game's pinball simulation was superior, with physics, movement, and design that very closely replicated those of an actual pinball table.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, in {{his short}} story [...] "By The Turtles of Tasman", a character, {{defending}} her ne'er-do-well grasshopperish father to her antlike uncle, says: [...] "... {{my father has}} been a king.

2500|$|During the 1970s, Barbeau starred as Carol Traynor, the {{daughter}} of Bea Arthur's title character on the comedy series Maude, which ran from 1972 to 1978 (actress Marcia Rodd had originated the role of Carol in a 1972 episode of All in the Family, also titled [...] "Maude", alongside Arthur). [...] In her autobiography, There Are Worse Things I Could Do, Barbeau remarked: [...] "What I didn't know is that when I said [...] I was usually walking {{down a flight of}} stairs and no one was even listening to me. They were just <b>watching</b> <b>my</b> breasts precede me." [...] During the last season of Maude, Barbeau did not appear in the majority of the episodes. In a 2009 Entertainment Tonight TV interview, Barbeau mentioned that she had good on- and off-camera chemistry with Arthur; she said that the two stayed close until Arthur's death on April 25, 2009. Barbeau and Arthur reunited on camera during a 2007 taping of The View, reminiscing about their long-running friendship and their years as co-stars on Maude.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2014, it was {{reported}} that Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions had bought the rights to the film under the Stage 6 Films banner, with Michael London and his company Groundswell Productions producing the feature. The film was originally picked up by New Line Cinema in November 2011, but the script was shopped elsewhere when production did not get off the ground. The screenplay was written by Joshua John Miller and M.A. Fortin, and was directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson. Miller's father, Jason Miller, was an actor and writer who appeared as Father Karras in The Exorcist. The script for The Final Girls was in part inspired by The Exorcist, with Miller pointing out, [...] "I grew up <b>watching</b> <b>my</b> dad in The Exorcist, and there's something haunting, strange, confusing, and a little bit unnatural to see your parent constantly die in a film. But it's something that also becomes iconic, and we tried to deconstruct what the effects of that would be, as well as {{what it would be like}} if you had a second chance, but your second chance was inside of a movie?" [...] Miller and Fortin also served as executive producers, alongside Darren M. Demetre.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1983, {{a sports}} writer noted: [...] "These {{days in the}} Oakland Coliseum, where the Athletics do their thing, the phrase is 'Computer Ball' [...] as {{programmed}} by Martin's successor, Steve Boros." [...] In May 1983, Newsweek published a story on Boros's pioneering use of the computer titled [...] "The Computers of Summer." [...] In a June 1983 feature story titled [...] "It's the Apple of His Eye", Sports Illustrated wrote that Boros made access to a computer a condition of his hiring and used an Apple II, loaded with pitch-by-pitch data from the 1981 and 1982 seasons, as a scouting tool. The article's author opined: [...] "Though traditionalists may shudder at the thought, {{it was inevitable that}} such a stat-happy pursuit as baseball would plug into a data bank. And Boros, 46, a Michigan grad who plans to take classes in computer science during the off-season, is in the forefront of a new wave of enlightened technocrats who are rewiring the game." [...] However, Boros tried to downplay his reliance on the computer, noting, [...] "We're not down in the dugout frantically leafing through pages of computer printouts. I'm too busy <b>watching</b> <b>my</b> pitchers for signs of fatigue or checking my base runners — all the little nuances and gut feelings that you get and no computer can pick up. However, I do study the printouts before each game." ...|$|E
