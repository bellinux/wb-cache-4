5|$|Loup was one {{of eight}} {{pitchers}} in the bullpen for the Blue Jays' 2014 opening day. On April 20, Loup walked three consecutive batters {{for the first time}} in his career, and took the loss as the Blue Jays fell to the Cleveland Indians 6–4. On May 3, the Blue Jays announced that Loup would replace Sergio Santos as the team's closer until Casey Janssen returned from injury. After walking as many batters in three months as he had the entire last season, Loup regained confidence after pitching the last few innings of a game on June 4 that <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 3–2 lead to an 8–2 win against the Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|The 2014–15 team {{needed to}} replace the losses of Nik Stauskas, Mitch McGary and Glenn Robinson III to the 2014 NBA draft and Jon Horford and Jordan Morgan to graduation. It began the season ranked in both the AP Poll (#24) and Coaches' Poll (#23). Guard Caris LeVert was named a preseason All-American {{according}} to numerous media outlets and preseason All-Big Ten according to the Big Ten media. LeVert, however, suffered a season-ending foot injury in January. At {{the end of that}} month, Derrick Walton was sidelined for the season. The team struggled without two of its leaders as it <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 6–3 win–loss record in conference to finish 8–10. After falling in the quarterfinals of the 2015 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament the team's season ended with a 16–16 record.|$|E

5|$|The post-World War II Sabor {{developed}} from the National Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH), formed in 1943. In 1945, ZAVNOH transformed itself into the National Sabor of Croatia, preserving the continuity of Croatian sovereignty. After the war, the Communists ran unopposed in the 1945 elections; all opposition parties boycotted the elections due to coercion and intimidation by the OZNA secret police and the Communist Party, aimed at eliminating electoral dissent. Once in power, the Communists introduced a single-party political system, with the Communist Party of Yugoslavia as the ruling party and the Communist Party of Croatia as a branch party. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation. During Communist rule, the Sabor <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> unicameral parliament as specified by the 1947 constitution, to bicameral in 1953, changing again in 1963 {{to as many as}} five chambers, and then to three in 1974. The constitutional amendments of 1971 established the Presidency of the Sabor, and one of its functions became representing Croatia, as the Yugoslav constituent republics were essentially viewed as nation-states generally surrendering only their foreign and defence policies to the federation; the federal bodies were no longer independent of, but instead formed by, the republics.|$|E
5|$|To {{handle this}} new, {{considerably}} {{more complex and}} expensive task, {{it was decided that}} a new organisation was needed. The Mary Rose Trust, a limited charitable trust, with representatives from many organisations would handle the need for a larger operation and a large infusion of funds. In 1979 a new diving vessel was purchased to replace the previous 12m (40ft) catamaran Roger Greenville which had been used from 1971. The choice fell on the salvage vessel Sleipner, the same craft that had been used as a platform for diving operations on the Vasa. The project <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> team of only twelve volunteers working four months a year to over 50 individuals working almost around the clock nine months a year. In addition there were over 500 volunteer divers and a laboratory staff of about 70 that ran the shore base and conservation facilities. During the four diving seasons from 1979 to 1982 over 22,000 diving hours was spent on the site, an effort that amounted to 11.8 man-years.|$|E

25|$|Irrigation is {{essential}} for reliable agriculture on the coastal lowlands of the state, and large scale irrigation infrastruction is needed for large scale production. After the Mexican Revolution, the federal government took control of Sonora’s irrigation infrastructure and after World War II, began extensive dam and reservoir construction. From the 1940s to the 1970s, advanced in agricultural techniques were pioneered by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) based in Ciudad Obregón. This combined new varieties of wheat, with irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides to greatly increase production. Mexico <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> wheat importer in the 1940s to a wheat exporter in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Rome <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{population}} of 800,000 {{in the beginning}} of the period to a {{population of}} 30,000 by the end of the period, the most precipitous drop coming with the breaking of the aqueducts during the Gothic War. A similar though less marked decline in urban population occurred later in Constantinople, which was gaining population until the outbreak of plague in 541. In Europe there was also a general decline in urban populations. As a whole, the period of late antiquity was accompanied by an overall population decline in almost all Europe, and a reversion to more of a subsistence economy. Long-distance markets disappeared, and there was a reversion to a greater degree of local production and consumption, rather than webs of commerce and specialized production.|$|E
25|$|The nation <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> surplus {{manpower}} {{pool with}} high unemployment and relief in 1940 to a severe manpower shortage by 1943.

(Large numbers of soldiers were not used until the invasion of Europe in summer 1944.) In 1940–43 the Army often transferred soldiers to civilian status in the Enlisted Reserve Corps {{in order to increase}} production. Those transferred would return to work in essential industry, although they could be recalled to active duty if the Army needed them. Others were discharged if their civilian work was deemed essential. There were instances of mass releases of men to increase production in various industries. Working men who had been classified 4F or otherwise ineligible for the draft took second jobs.|$|E
