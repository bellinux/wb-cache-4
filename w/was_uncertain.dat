5|$|The {{synthesis}} of element 108 was first attempted in 1978 by a Russian research {{team led by}} Yuri Oganessian and Vladimir Utyonkov at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, using reactions that would generate the isotopes hassium-270 and hassium-264. The data <b>was</b> <b>uncertain</b> and they carried out new experiments on hassium five years later, where these two isotopes as well as hassium-263 were produced; the hassium-264 experiment was conducted again and confirmed in 1984.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed on October11 {{in the central}} Atlantic Ocean, northeast of the Lesser Antilles and southeast of Bermuda. Two days later, a ship reported strong winds and a rapid pressure drop, indicating a hurricane was in the region; the tropical cyclone was given the name Jig. It moved northwestward, steadily intensifying before turning {{to the north and}} northeast. On October15, Hurricane Jig passed about 300mi (480km) east of Bermuda, and later that day its sustained winds reach peak winds of 115mph (185km/h), although the intensity <b>was</b> <b>uncertain,</b> based on estimates from the Hurricane Hunters. The hurricane began weakening on October16. Jig became an extratropical cyclone later that day and quickly dissipated, never having affected land due to its small size.|$|E

5|$|After the Fall of France, some French {{scientists}} {{escaped to}} Britain with their stock of heavy water. They were temporarily {{installed in the}} Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where they worked on reactor design. The MAUD Committee <b>was</b> <b>uncertain</b> whether this was relevant to the main task of Tube Alloys, that of building an atomic bomb, although there remained a possibility that a reactor {{could be used to}} breed plutonium, which might be used in one. It therefore recommended that they be relocated to the United States, and co-located with the Manhattan Project's reactor effort. Due to American concerns about security (many of the scientists were foreign nationals) and patent claims by the French scientists and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), it was decided to relocate them to Canada instead.|$|E
5|$|Although {{built in}} {{response}} to Gloire, the Warriors had a very different operational concept from the French ship, which was meant to replace wooden ships of the line. The Warriors were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates and were not intended {{to stand in the}} line of battle, as the Admiralty <b>was</b> <b>uncertain</b> about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three-deck ships of the line. Unlike Gloire, they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage. In contrast to Gloires square profile, Warrior has a clipper bow, but she is twice as long as a typical clipper ship.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} revolutionary {{movement}} <b>was</b> <b>uncertain</b> whether {{to destroy the}} prison, to reoccupy it as a fortress {{with members of the}} volunteer guard militia, or to preserve it intact as a permanent revolutionary monument. The revolutionary leader Mirabeau eventually settled the matter by symbolically starting the destruction of the battlements himself, after which a panel of five experts was appointed by the Permanent Committee of the Hôtel de Ville to manage the demolition of the castle. One of these experts was Pierre-François Palloy, a bourgeois entrepreneur who claimed vainqueur status for his role during the taking of the Bastille, and he rapidly assumed control over the entire process. Palloy's team worked quickly and by November most of the fortress had been destroyed.|$|E

5|$|British Admiral George Brydges Rodney, who {{had been}} {{tracking}} de Grasse around the West Indies, was alerted to the latter's departure, but <b>was</b> <b>uncertain</b> of the French admiral's destination. Believing that de Grasse would return {{a portion of his}} fleet to Europe, Rodney detached Rear Admiral Sir Samuel Hood with 14 ships of the line and orders to find de Grasse's destination in North America. Rodney, who was ill, sailed for Europe {{with the rest of his}} fleet in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impacts {{state of}} health <b>was</b> <b>uncertain</b> during the first day after launch. Shortly after {{entering}} orbit around the Sun and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to safe mode. The {{cause of the problem}} was simply an incorrect temperature limit in the fault protection logic for the spacecraft's RCS thruster catalyst beds. The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode and healthy.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, the Albert Dock was requisitioned by the Admiralty {{serving as}} a base for boats of the British Atlantic Fleet. The complex was damaged during air raids on Liverpool, notably during the May Blitz of 1941. In the {{aftermath}} of the war, the financial problems of the owners and the general decline of docking in the city meant that the future of the Albert Dock <b>was</b> <b>uncertain.</b> Numerous plans were developed for the re-use of the buildings but none came to fruition and in 1972 the dock was finally closed. Having lain derelict for nearly ten years, the redevelopment of the dock began in 1981, when the Merseyside Development Corporation was set up, with the Albert Dock being officially re-opened in 1984.|$|E
