5|$|Entrance to {{national}} park is available by boat in Wijdefjorden from the north, or over land from Billefjorden and Dicksonfjorden from the south. During winter, {{the area is}} accessible from Longyearbyen, either by snowmobile or by ski. There are several older trapper cabins in the park, {{and some of these}} are lent to residents of Longyearbyen. Except for Einsteinvatnet, a lake with Arctic char, there are few destinations <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> although the park {{can be used as a}} basis for other destinations. This includes trips to Perriertoppen, Svalbard's second-highest peak, and the glacier Åsgårdsfonna. Because of the shape of the park, there is little good hiking <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> except for walking along the beaches on either side of the fjord. It is possible to see the entire national park from Mittag-Lefflerbreen, which can be hiked to from Pyramiden.|$|E
5|$|Geologists and the {{official}} Ricketts Glen State Park web page classify the falls at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake falls descend {{in a series of}} small steps. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In bridal-veil falls, the second type, water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a plunge pool in the stream bed below. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder caprock which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil falls drops is gray sandstone. The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool. Brown's book Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers uses four types to classify waterfalls: falls, cascade, slide, and chute.|$|E
50|$|<b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> {{buffer zone}} {{there are five}} {{communities}} with atotal {{population of more than}} 45,000. These communities rely heavily on the natural resources of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> for food, shelter and their livelihoods.|$|R

5|$|The lake <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> {{is at an}} {{elevation}} of about , and the park itself sits in a natural basin. The basin and the underlying sandstone trap water and thus form the lake and surrounding bogs. The higher elevation leads to a cooler climate, and the basin helps trap denser, cooler air, leading to longer winters and milder summers.|$|E
5|$|The {{third of}} the rock {{formations}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> is the Huntley Mountain Formation, from the late Devonian and early Mississippian. This is made of layers of olive green to gray sandstone and gray to red shale. The Huntley Mountain Formation is relatively hard and erosion resistant. It caps the Allegheny Front and has kept it from eroding {{as much as the}} softer Catskill Formation, to the south. The Catskill Formation is the lowest and oldest layer in the park, and is composed of red shale and siltstone up to 370million years old. The Allegheny Front <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> is named North Mountain and Red Rock Mountain, with the latter name coming from an exposed band of Huntley Formation red shale and sandstone visible along Pennsylvania Route 487 (PA 487).|$|E
5|$|There are 33 {{archaeological sites}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> which include: cave paintings, ancient settlements, {{terraces}} for agriculture, tombs, fortresses and irrigation works. There's also a pre-Columbian road between {{the towns of}} Olleros and Chavin.|$|E
