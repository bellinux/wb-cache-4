A male figure in a red Phrygian cap (a symbol of the French and American Revolutions) reclines <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> around the waist of a female figure (identified as a bacchante by Sarah Burnage of the University of York). The female figure shades her eyes, either against the brightness of the angel or to block out the horror taking place in front of her.|$|E
5|$|Lavelli {{initially}} {{planned to}} retire in 1955 but came back for a final year in 1956, when the Browns posted a 5–7 record, the team's first-ever losing season. In his 11-year career, Lavelli caught 386 passes for 6,488 yards and 62 touchdowns. He was a confident receiver, former teammates said in later years. He could often be heard calling for Graham to throw him the ball while running routes. He was also known {{for his ability to}} improvise on the field. In a 1955 game against the Eagles in slippery conditions, he caught the winning touchdown with less than a minute left by swinging around the goalpost <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> to get open.|$|E

She tells Sawyer that she knows {{the letter was written}} when Sawyer was a kid, and also works out that the letter wasn't written to Sawyer, but by him. He tells Kate that his real name isn't Sawyer and that the letter was written to the real Sawyer, a con man, who ruined his family. He ended up {{becoming}} a con man himself, so he took the name Sawyer as an alias. He snatches the letter from Kate and tells her not to feel sorry for him and to leave.|$|E

5|$|The second {{match was}} a Casket match between The Undertaker and Heidenreich. The match started {{back and forth}} until Heidenreich sent 'Taker into the casket. 'Taker applied the {{triangle}} choke until Gene Snitsky interfered and attacked 'Taker. Snitsky and Heidenreich attacked The Undertaker and called for the casket to be opened but Kane was revealed to be inside the casket. He attacked Snitsky and Heidenreich and fought Snitsky throughout the arena. Heidenreich sent 'Taker into the steel steps and pushed the casket into him. Heidenreich put 'Taker in the casket after applying the cobra clutch but 'Taker stopped the lid from closing <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> Heidenreich put 'Taker in the casket again but 'Taker countered. 'Taker executed a chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver and put Heidenreich in the casket to win the match.|$|E
5|$|When Bart, Lisa and Maggie {{come home}} from trick-or-treating, Marge {{switches}} out the candy with dental hygiene products and asks Homer to deliver the candy to a drive for the troops overseas. Homer instead runs off with the bag to eat its contents in privacy at a canyon cliff. Unfortunately, Homer trips and falls {{to the bottom of}} the canyon <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> pinned. Fueled by his need to get the out-of-reach bag of candy, and reluctant to wait twenty minutes for help, Homer is forced to chew off his arm. Though he manages it after a few tries, Homer learns that he was carrying a bag of vegetables, as Bart, Lisa and Maggie had secretly stolen back their candy, inciting an upset Homer to scream in rage.|$|E
5|$|McCall played {{football}} for Upper Wortley Primary School and Thornhill Middle School, even scoring a winning {{goal for the}} latter in a cup final when he came on as a substitute <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> in a sling. While McCall also played table tennis as a schoolboy, football was a focus, and he captained the Leeds under-11 boys team and played for other Leeds representative sides. McCall's parents split and he made up for his size {{when he moved to}} one of Leeds' toughest estates and played for pub sides by the age of 14. He moved schools to Harrington High and also played for local young sides Pudsey Juniors, Holbeck and later Farsley Celtic. McCall thought he had missed his chance of playing professionally after a string of other players were signed by professional clubs, until Farsley played Bradford City's junior side in a friendly and he impressed coach Bryan Edwards enough to be asked for a trial.|$|E

5|$|Born {{into the}} Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar on the Clarence River in {{northern}} New South Wales, Marsh first {{made an impression}} as a professional runner, travelling to Sydney and then competing interstate, winning races as a sprinter and a hurdler. While in Sydney, Marsh began competing in the local club cricket competition and his action quickly came under scrutiny. He was first no-balled for throwing in 1897, {{but it was not}} until 1900 that he came to prominence in a trial match against the New South Wales state team. Marsh dismissed leading Test cricketers Victor Trumper and Monty Noble, but was called for throwing. Marsh vowed to prove the legitimacy of his action by bowling <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> encased in splints, which prompted the umpire to resign in humiliation. Having topped the bowling averages in the local competition, Marsh was selected to make his debut in the Sheffield Shield. He made an immediate impression and led the first-class bowling averages for the season after three matches. He was no-balled in his second match by Bob Crockett, but things came to a head in his fourth match when the same umpire no-balled him seventeen times, leading to angry crowd demonstrations. The cricket community was divided on whether Marsh's action was fair and various theories were propounded, which sought to show a motive for foul play against Marsh. The most popular of these theories was that Marsh was scapegoated in a campaign against throwing and was a soft target because of his race.|$|E
5|$|Nelthorpe was {{released}} by Oxford {{at the end of}} the season and he subsequently signed for fellow Conference Premier club York City on 19 May 2009. He suffered from illness during much of York's pre-season, and during a friendly against FC Halifax Town he was sent off for jumping dangerously <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> raised. He made his debut as a stoppage time substitute in a 2–1 defeat to former club Oxford on 8 August 2009. After failing to start any matches for York, he requested a loan move away from the club in October 2009. On 10 November 2009, he joined league rivals Barrow on loan until 1 January 2010. He made his debut in a 2–2 with AFC Wimbledon on 14 November 2009, assisting Jason Walker's goal through a corner kick. He scored his first goal for Barrow in a 2–2 draw with Grays Athletic on 24 November 2009 with a free kick and finished the loan spell with six appearances and two goals. He joined Conference Premier rivals Luton Town on trial in January 2010, starting a reserve-team match against Peterborough United, before signing on loan until the end of the 2009–10 season on 22 January. He made his debut a day later as an 83rd-minute substitute for Tom Craddock in a 1–0 victory over Gateshead. His loan period at Luton came to an end on 7 May 2010, having made eight appearances for the club. He finished the season with eight appearances for York and {{was released}} by the club on 18 May 2010.|$|E

25|$|Whatever the origin, John Willes {{realised}} {{that the}} pace and bounce generated by this raised arm action made the delivery potentially more difficult to play than a conventional underarm one and so he adopted the style himself <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> coming through at shoulder height. He tried, without success, to have it accepted in senior cricket.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt was an {{enthusiastic}} singlestick player and, according to Harper's Weekly, {{showed up at}} a White House reception <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> bandaged after a bout with General Leonard Wood in 1905.

He had only £250 a year in private income, rather than the £400 needed (around £25,000 and £40,000 at 2016 prices), and was soon in debt.|$|E

25|$|<b>With</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> injured, Paige {{suddenly}} found himself unemployable. He looked for {{work as a}} manager or coach, but was unsuccessful. One ballclub owner {{was willing to give}} him a chance to play ball again—J.L. Wilkinson of the Monarchs. Wilkinson offered him the modest opportunity to play, not for the Negro American League Monarchs, but for a second-string barnstorming team called the Travelers, which was now renamed the Satchel Paige All-Stars. Paige would pitch when he could and play first base when he could not.|$|E
25|$|Criticised in {{previous}} years for his lack of fitness Montoya began a training program {{under the direction of}} McLaren personnel however all the effort was lost when after the Malaysian Grand Prix he injured his shoulder playing tennis. This was in breach of his contractual obligations forbidding potentially dangerous pastimes. As a result of his negligence he missed two Grands Prix and had to return to competition before his injuries were healed. He was often seen <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> almost motionless for the remaining five Grands Prix.|$|E
25|$|This match {{had a very}} {{exciting}} climax. When time ran out, England were six runs short of the 234 {{that they needed to}} win. The ninth wicket fell when Derek Shackleton was run out from the fourth ball of the final over. Colin Cowdrey had had his left arm broken earlier in the innings, and had retired hurt. Now he reappeared, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> in plaster. Luckily for him, and for England, he was not required to face a ball, David Allen playing out the remaining two deliveries.|$|E

Batista {{then went on to}} remove his arm vice, as it was a fake just to lure out Orton, and proceeded to attack Orton. He then announced that he will not retire, but moving to SmackDown instead. Later that night, he defeated Orton in a no-holds barred match which was to be his last match on Raw.|$|E
