25|$|Charles Fourier (1772–1837) was a French philosopher who {{believed}} that the structure of modern civilization lead to poverty, unemployment, isolation, and unhappiness and that people {{would be better off}} living in organized communal societies rather than individual family units. Fourier developed the idea of the phalanstère, a collectively dwelling and cooperatively <b>working</b> <b>community</b> of 1,620 people organized {{on the basis of a}} joint stock company.|$|E
25|$|A nurse {{working at}} the {{hospital}} in the later years of its operation describes the situation much less critically than Frame, noting that while many patients at Seacliff during her time (1940s) {{would not have been}} confined in modern days, the atmosphere was more like that of a large <b>working</b> <b>community.</b> Patients capable of working were asked to help with various duties, partly because of staff shortages in World War II. Unless considered dangerous, patients were allowed some liberties, such as being allowed to go fishing - an activity that provided patients with leisure time, while also helping the fishing business Truby King had long ago established at nearby Karitane.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Bauhaus {{strives to}} bring {{together}} all creative effort into one whole, to reunify all the disciplines of practical art—sculpture, painting, handicrafts, and the crafts—as inseparable components of a new architecture. The ultimate, if distant, aim of the Bauhaus is the unified work of art—the great structure—in {{which there is no}} distinction between monumental and decorative art. [...] The Bauhaus wants to educate architects, painters, and sculptors of all levels, according to their capabilities, to become competent craftsmen or independent creative artists and to form a <b>working</b> <b>community</b> of leading and future artist-craftsmen. These men, of kindred spirit, will know how to design building harmoniously in their entirety—structure, finishing, ornamentation, and furnishing."-Walter Gropius, Aims of the program of the Staatliche Bauhaus in Weimar 1919 ...|$|E
60|$|She had a {{standing}} ground now apart from her parents. She {{was something else}} besides the mere daughter of William and Anna Brangwen. She was independent. She earned her own living. She was an important member of the <b>working</b> <b>community.</b> She was sure that fifty shillings a month quite paid for her keep.

60|$|France {{was a far}} richer {{country than}} Scotland, and the King had a much greater mind to conquer it. So, he let Scotland alone, and pretended {{that he had a}} claim to the French throne in right of his mother. He had, in reality, no claim at all; but that mattered little in those times. He brought over to his cause many little princes and sovereigns, and even courted the {{alliance}} of the people of Flanders--a busy, <b>working</b> <b>community,</b> who had very small respect for kings, and whose head man was a brewer. With such forces as he raised by these means, Edward invaded France; but he did little by that, except run into debt in carrying on the war to the extent of three hundred thousand pounds. The next year he did better; gaining a great sea-fight in the harbour of Sluys. This success, however, was very shortlived, for the Flemings took fright at the siege of Saint Omer and ran away, leaving their weapons and baggage behind them. Philip, the French King, coming up with his army, and Edward being very anxious to decide the war, proposed to settle the difference by single combat with him, or by a fight of one hundred knights on each side. The French King said, he thanked him; but being very well as he was, he would rather not. So, after some skirmishing and talking, a short peace was made.|$|E
