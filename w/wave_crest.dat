25|$|The wave peel {{angle is}} one of the main {{constituents}} of a potential surfing wave. Wave peel angle measures the distance between the peel-line and the line tangent to the breaking crest line. This angle controls the speed of the <b>wave</b> <b>crest.</b> The speed of the wave is an addition of the propagation velocity vector (Vw) and peel velocity vector (Vp), which results in the overall velocity of the wave (Vs).|$|E
25|$|When the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, {{and stay}} {{toward the front}} of the wave to become stable and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The {{acceleration}} is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (Fsinθ) and the vertical force (Fcosθ=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain more speed, and lean on back foot to brake. Also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the <b>wave</b> <b>crest.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because f(η) is real valued, {{the three}} roots η1, η2 and η3 are either all three real, or {{otherwise}} one {{is real and}} the remaining two are a pair of complex conjugates. In the latter case, with only one real-valued root, {{there is only one}} elevation η at which f(η) is zero. And consequently also only one elevation at which the surface slope η’ is zero. However, we are looking for wave like solutions, with two elevations—the <b>wave</b> <b>crest</b> and trough (physics)—where the surface slope is zero. The conclusion is that all three roots of f(η) have to be real valued.|$|E

40|$|A {{short and}} largely {{traditional}} {{review of the}} concept of group velocity, prepared for the forthcoming Encyclopedia of Nonlinear Science Waves often propagate as a packet, or group, within which there are several <b>wave</b> <b>crests.</b> A common illustration is given by the wave pattern formed when a stone is thrown into a pond. An axially symmetric ring of waves on the water surface propagates outwards as a wave group; within the group, however, one can see that the <b>wave</b> <b>crests</b> propagate through the group, apparently from the rear to the front. The speed of the <b>waves</b> <b>crests,</b> called the phase velocity, is {{different from that of the}} group as a whole, this speed being called the group velocity. For water waves, the phase velocity is greater than the group velocity, except for the very short waves dominated by surface tension.

500|$|When {{it takes}} off, the Atlantic puffin patters {{across the surface}} of the water while vigorously {{flapping}} its wings, before launching itself into the air. The size of the wing is a compromise between its uses above and below water and its surface area is small relative to the bird's weight. To maintain flight, the wings need to beat very rapidly at a rate of several times each second. The bird's flight is direct and low over the surface of the water and it can travel at [...] per hour. Landing is awkward; it either crashes into a <b>wave</b> <b>crest</b> or, in calmer water, does a belly flop. While at sea, the Atlantic puffin has its annual moult. Land birds mostly lose their primaries one pair at a time to enable them still to be able to fly, but the puffin sheds all its primaries at one time and dispenses with flight entirely for a month or two. The moult usually takes place between January and March but young birds may lose their feathers a little later in the year.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reason for}} the Doppler effect {{is that when the}} source of the waves is moving towards the observer, each {{successive}} <b>wave</b> <b>crest</b> is emitted from a position closer to the observer than the previous wave. [...] Therefore, each wave takes slightly less time to reach the observer than the previous wave. Hence, the time between the arrival of successive wave crests at the observer is reduced, causing an increase in the frequency. While they are traveling, the distance between successive wave fronts is reduced, so the waves [...] "bunch together". [...] Conversely, if the source of waves is moving away from the observer, each wave is emitted from a position farther from the observer than the previous wave, so the arrival time between successive waves is increased, reducing the frequency. The distance between successive wave fronts is then increased, so the waves [...] "spread out".|$|E

40|$|Ocean waves {{forced by}} the wind are multi{{direction}}al, even if the wind direction is steady. Directionality can occur due to superposition of long-crested waves propagating at angle to each other. Lateral modulation of the <b>wave</b> <b>crests,</b> however, also takes place for strictly unidirectional waves, due to nonlinear effects. Here short crestedness of unidirectional waves is investigated. A series of experiments on the lateral instability of monochromatic, deep water, unidirectional, initially long-crested steep waves was performed in a large wave basin. The cross modulation of <b>wave</b> <b>crests</b> is clearly visible; its magnitude depends on the wave steepness in the wave propagation direction.

40|$|We {{present a}} second-order {{stochastic}} model of weakly nonlinear waves and develop theoretical expressions for the expected shape of large surface displacements. The model also {{leads to an}} exact theoretical expression for the statistical distribution of large <b>wave</b> <b>crests</b> {{in a form that}} generalizes the Tayfun distribution (Tayfun, J. Geophys. Res., vol. 85, 1980, p. 1548). The generalized distribution depends on a steepness parameter given by μ = λ 3 / 3, where λ 3 represents the skewness coefficient of surface displacements. It converges to the Tayfun distribution in narrowband waves, where both distributions describe the <b>crests</b> of all <b>waves</b> well. In broadband waves, the generalized distribution represents the <b>crests</b> of large <b>waves</b> just as well whereas the Tayfun distribution appears as an upper bound and tends to overestimate them. However, the theoretical nature of the generalized distribution presents practical difficulties in oceanic applications. We circumvent these by adopting an appropriate approximation for the steepness parameter. Comparisons with wind-wave measurements from the North Sea suggest that this approximation allows both distributions to assume an identical form with which we can describe the distribution of large <b>wave</b> <b>crests</b> fairly accurately. The same comparisons also show that third-order nonlinear effects do not appear to have any discernable effect on the statistics of large surface displacements or <b>wave</b> <b>crests.</b> 1...|$|R
