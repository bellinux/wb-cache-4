40|$|Physically loading {{aspects of}} work may have {{adverse effects on}} the health of both the {{pregnant}} woman and the unborn child. Improving the fit between the pregnant woman and the workplace layout contributes to minimizing the load associated with given tasks. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate two layout aspects for standing manual work, namely <b>working</b> surface <b>height</b> and <b>working</b> surface areas, for the condition of pregnancy. Two approaches were used. (1) The effects of changed body dimensions were evaluated with regard to (a) fit problems while working at a workplace in accordance with common guidelines and (b) the validity of assumptions of these guidelines. (2) The appreciation of relevant aspects of workplace layout at a specific manual task was assessed. Twenty-seven women were examined in pregnant and non-pregnant conditions. The first approach showed that fit problems are likely: guideline <b>working</b> surface <b>height</b> is just (2 - 7 cm) under the most protruding abdominal point, and areas based on non-pregnant abdominal depth are relatively large in pregnant condition. Further, existing methods to assess working surface areas have various assumptions that are not valid in pregnant condition. The second approach showed that at a specific manual task, women in late pregnancy preferred a considerably lower table height than the common guideline heights. Possibly, abdominal height becomes a relevant design factor with regard to <b>working</b> surface <b>height</b> during pregnancy. The task position on the working surface at which effort started became closer to the table edge due to pregnancy. Both approaches show that common guideline <b>working</b> surface <b>heights</b> for manual work, and working surface areas assessed in non-pregnant condition seem not suitable in pregnant conditio...|$|R

50|$|The {{vertical}} loom enables weaving {{of larger}} rug formats. The most simple vertical loom, usually used in villages, has fixed beams. The {{length of the}} loom determines {{the length of the}} rug.

The wefts are fixed and spanned on the beams, or, in more advanced types of looms, the wefts are spanned on a roller beam, which allows for any length of carpet to be woven, as the finished part of the carpet is rolled up on the roller beam. Thus, the weavers' benches always remain at the same height.|$|E

50|$|The Orbiter camera seat is a {{seat for}} a {{cameraman}} that swivels {{at a low}} <b>working</b> <b>height.</b> The orbiter {{is characterized by a}} partial separation of the camera and the movable/swivelling seat. This ensures that the natural vibrations of the camera operator are absorbed in the seat and are, therefore, transferred to the camera to a very small extent. This is especially important with telephoto lens with up to x101 zoom, where vibration resistance is vital for stable pictures. The swiveling seat is not mounted on the centre camera column (which would increase vibration), but it rotates with the camera as the camera pans. The name ‚ÄòOrbiter‚Äô was chosen because the cameraman is in orbit around the camera, and because orbital means ‚Äòconcerning an eyeball‚Äô, and the camera is an electronic eye.|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of musculoskeletal disorders {{of the lower}} back is high in female assembly line workers. This has posed serious problems in health management at workplaces. We have already pointed out that such health related problems {{are closely related to}} working conditions and have advocated the need for ergonomy-based improvement of working conditions for the prevention of occupational diseases. This study was designed to ergonomically determine the optimum <b>working</b> <b>height</b> and the optimum period of work for the relief of muscle stress associated with working postures. A field experiment was undertaken. In the experiment, the body length distribution of workers was taken into consideration. 1. Many of the workers felt that the low <b>working</b> <b>height,</b> high speed of the conveyor-belts and long period of work were the sources of stress. The complaint that the <b>working</b> <b>height</b> was too low was more frequent in tall workers. 2. To determine the optimum <b>working</b> <b>height,</b> conveyor-belts of four different heights, 73, 78, 83 and 88 cm, were prepared and tested. The conveyor-belt of 78 cm in height was best suited por 90 % of the workers, regardless of their statures. When the angle of stooping action and the smooth movement of arms are taken into consideration, a 5 - 10 cm increase from the current height (73 cm) seemed to be the optimum <b>working</b> <b>height.</b> 3. Shortening the current period of 60 minutes to 20 minutes was found to be desirable. The above results suggest that introduction of working time management and ergonomically-derived measures in addition to the already advocated health-management plans would be effective for the relief of musculoskeletal disorders...|$|E
