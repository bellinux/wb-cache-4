The Ki- 67 assay is standard at our institution, and results were documented in the patients' medical record. However, the assays were performed in batches so post-therapy results were not routinely available to clinicians within a timeframe that could influence treatment.

40|$|Targeted toxins are {{powerful}} and specific lesioning agents {{used in the}} technique known as Molecular Surgery. The ribosome-inactivating protein, saporin (from {{the seeds of the}} plant, Saponaria officinalis) is bound to a targeting agent (anything that is recognized on the cell surface and internalized). The targeted toxin is administered to the cells (in vitro or in vivo). The targeting agent seeks out and binds to its target on the cell surface. The conjugate is internalized, saporin breaks away from the targeting agent, and inactivates the ribosomes which causes protein inhibition and, ultimately, cell death. Cells which do not have the cell surface marker are not affected. Specificity and Preparation: This targeted toxin (molecular weight 33 kDa) recognizes cells that express orexin receptors. Orexin-SAP is a chemical conjugate of the 28 amino-acid orexin-B peptide (hypocretin- 2) and the ribosome-inactivating protein, saporin. The orexin B sequence is the rat/mouse sequence.

The soluble antigens reacted in the IHA test with HVH immune animal sera, but very few convalescent-phase human sera showed reactivity with soluble antigens. Overall, none of the subunit antigens showed greater type-specificity than did crude antigens in IHA tests with immune animal or convalescent-phase human sera. Recurrent infections with type 1 or type 2 viruses tended to broaden heterotypic reactivity of the patients' sera with both crude and subunit antigens, even in patients showing only a single type of antibody by IHA inhibition. Subunit antigens were no more sensitive than crude antigens in demonstrating significant IHA antibody titer rises for serodiagnosis of herpesvirus infections, and they generally had to be used at lower <b>working</b> <b>dilutions</b> than crude antigens...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A novel {{generation}} of rabbit monoclonal antibodies {{has been released}} recently for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor evaluation in breast cancer by immunohistochemistry. Aims: We compared novel rabbit monoclonal antibodies anti-ER SP 1 (LabVision®) and B 644 (Cell Marque®) to mouse monoclonal antibodies 1 D 5 (Dako®) and 6 F 11 (Novocastra®) using a tissue microarray of breast carcinomas. METHODS: Two cylinders (2 mm diameter) of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue were obtained from 24 invasive breast carcinomas and immunostained by using the anti-ER rabbit and mouse antibodies and the streptavidin-biotin detection system (Biogenex®). Immunostaining was evaluated considering positive those tumors {{in which more than}} 10 % of the tumor cell nuclei stained. The stain intensity was also evaluated as weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). Results: Both rabbit antibodies against ER have similar staining pattern to each other and also to 6 F 11, but significantly stronger scores compared to mouse 1 D 5. The rabbit antibodies allow better cost/benefit because of higher <b>working</b> <b>dilutions</b> compared to mouse antibodies using the same procedure.

40|$|Fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugates were {{prepared}} by improved methods from standard reference antisera to influenza A and B, mumps, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4, herpesvirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus hexon. The antisera, prepared {{in a variety}} of animals, were fractionated three times with selected optimal concentrations of ammonium sulfate and yielded gamma globulins of adequate purity for conjugation with FITC. Conjugates containing optimal fluorescein-to-protein ratios of between 5 and 10 were produced in 2 h by dialysis labeling. Serological titers of each antiserum and conjugate were determined by complement fixation, hemagglutination-inhibition, serum neutralization, and indirect hemagglutination tests where appropriate. When corrected for dilution, the serological titers of the FITC conjugates were identical to those of the starting antisera. The fluorescent-antibody staining titers correlated well with one of the serological parameters of the original serum. The conjugates stained homologous antigens specifically and were free of nonspecific staining at the <b>working</b> <b>dilution.</b> Undesired staining of host cells which was a problem with some of the conjugates produced from sera containing cellular antibodies was removed by absorption with packed cells.

40|$|To {{characterize}} polyclonal antisera for two-point immuno-turbidimetric applications, we defined, as {{functions of}} antiserum concentration, two parameters derived from dose-response curves: the maximum bichromaticoptical response, Tmai, and the antigen {{concentration in the}} region of excess antibody correspondingto one-half Tm, or C. We raised monospecific polyclonal antisera in goats against several human immunoglobulins, C-reac-tive protein, C 3, C 4, apolipoproteins A-I and B, and several other proteins. We could linearly relate the loga-rithm of the antiserum concentration to log C and to log Tm. The concentration of polyethylene glycol affected not only C and Tmas but also their functional dependen-cies on antiserum concentration.

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} microwave irradiation on the staining quality {{of a range of}} commonly used primary antibodies in archival, formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded material, with emphasis on antibodies that have previously worked successfully only on frozen tissue. METHODS [...] Immunocytochemistry (streptavidin-biotin complex technique) was performed on histological sections of a range of normal and pathological tissues, after varying treatment with microwave irradiation. The staining quality of each antibody was compared with that achieved without prior treatment of the sections or after enzyme predigestion. RESULTS [...] Microwave irradiation permitted successful immunostaining with 20 antibodies that stained only frozen tissues before. The staining characteristics of 21 antibodies that were already known to stain formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded material were improved. Another 39 antibodies did not show enhanced staining with microwave irradiation. The method preserves tissue morphology and produces more consistent staining than that achieved by enzyme predigestion with many antibodies. Microwave irradiation may also allow some primary antibodies to be used at higher <b>working</b> <b>dilutions.</b> The citrate buffer used in this study avoids the necessity of exposure to heavy metal salts.

Brains were harvested and frozen in isopentane (− 20 °C) and serial coronal sections were taken. Brain sections were used for ex vivo autoradiography, fluorescence microscopy, Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. Two digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes complementary to the Mus musculus translocator protein (TSPO) mRNA sequences (NM- 00977.4 : coding sequences 102 - 380 and 322 - 577, respectively) were used. The cDNA amplicons from total RNA extracted from a mouse brain cortex were inserted in a TOPO-pCR 4 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) followed by linearization and in vitro transcription in presence of dUTP-digoxigenin (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The in situ hybridization histochemistry procedures were previously reported in detail [10]. The use of sense probes, in serial tissue sections, resulted in the absence of any hybridizing signal whereas the two antisense independent probes mentioned above gave the same patterns of labeling. Thus, these data were in favor of the specificity of the hybridizing signal for TSPO mRNA visualized in the tumor tissue sections. TSPO-immunoreactivity expressed by glioma cells was further suggested by immunohistochemistry and the TSPO-immunoreactive band seen in a Western blot using an anti-TSPO antibody (goat anti-mouse TSPO antibody LS-B 5755, LifeSpan Biosciences, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA; <b>working</b> <b>dilution</b> 1 : 1, 000).

40|$|Leptin, {{the protein}} {{product of the}} ob gene, is a hormone {{synthesized}} by adipocytes that signals available energy reserves to the brain. It has {{an important role in}} the regulation of appetite and metabolism but this hormone has also pleiotropic actions in development and physiology. Some of the major actions of leptin uncovered in recent years include the promotion of linear growth through its influence on energy balance and the stimulation of secretion of pituitary growth hormone. Leptin seems to be a phylogenetically preserved protein and in non mammalian vertebrates it has been found in all major taxa (Paolucci M., 2010). In the present work we have analysed the action of leptin on the GTH cells of the lizard Podarcis sicula. The study was performed on five groups of female lizards by the intraperitoneal injection of recombinant human leptin for three consecutive days at four different concentrations. As control, one group of lizards were treated with an injection of physiological solution.

40|$|The endocannabinoid {{system is}} an {{important}} intercellular signaling system in which are involved cannabinoid receptors, endocannabinoids (endogenous transmitters) and different enzymes (McPartland et al., 2002). Two types of cannabinoid receptors have been characterized, CB 1 and CB 2 receptors. While CB 2 receptors are mainly express by cells of the immune system, CB 1 receptors are indeed expressed in many brain regions {{where they have a}} relevant neuromodulatory role (Felder and Glass, 1998). The endocannabinoid system appears to be phylogenetically ancient, because its homologs are expressed in the genoma of many organism. The phylogenetic distribution of this system is yet poorly known and its components are apparently evolved separately in different epochs (McPartland, 2004). Genes encoding orthologues of the mammalian CB 1 receptor have been identified in a fish, an amphibian and a bird, indicating that CB 1 receptors may occur throughout the vertebrates (Elphick and Egertová, 2001). To our knowledge few is known regard CB 1 receptors in the reptilian species. In the present work we have studied the occurrence and distribution of the CB 1 receptors in the brain of the reptile Podarcis sicula.

Few CB 1 -IR structures were also observed in the telencephalon, confined in the central area, and in the cerebellum.

Antibody-based {{diagnosis}} of small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) has been efficiently achieved using serum and milk, but not semen, for which {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) has been proposed as a confirmatory technique. This work, involving 296 ovine (Ovis aries) and caprine (Capra hircus) semen donors, investigates whether seminal fluid (SF) can be reliably used in antibody-based SRLV diagnosis. First, a gold standard was established to assess the infection status and determine the sensitivity and specificity of three commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in serum testing using Western blot and PCR as confirmatory tests. For SF testing, both gold standard and serum testing results were used as reference. The performance of SF testing was affected {{not only by the}} ELISA assay sensitivity (related to antigen spectrum) compared with that of the gold standard (as it occurred in serum testing) but also by SF sample quality and SF <b>working</b> <b>dilution.</b> Nonturbid SF samples, commonly collected in artificial insemination centers (AICs), were required. Compared with serum, SF testing had a decreased sensitivity in two of the ELISA assays (with original serum working dilutions ≤ 1 / 20 in serum testing) but reached a similar sensitivity (and specificity) in the assay designed to work at the highest serum dilution (1 / 500). A SF concentration of about 1 / 2 (250 -fold that used in serum testing) was found optimal in this assay, yielding highly repeatable results that were in almost perfect agreement with those of serum testing (κ ± SE, 0. 91 ± 0. 81). Thus, SF ELISA can be reliably applied in antibody-based SRLV diagnosis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the responses of sera from five groups of cattle to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for paratuberculosis by using serum absorbed with Mycobacterium phlei at a single <b>working</b> <b>dilution.</b> The infection status of the cattle was determined by fecal culture. Cattle with different levels of exposure (high versus low prevalence and test negative) and disease manifestation (clinically suspect infection versus subclinical infection) were examined, as follows: (i) two paratuberculosis-negative herds; (ii) a fecal culture-confirmed, clinically suspect cases of paratuberculosis; (iii) cows from a paratuberculosis-infected herd with a high infection rate, as determined by fecal culture, but with no clinical cases at the time of sampling; (iv) cows from three paratuberculosis-infected herds known to have paratuberculosis diagnosed on the farm (low infection rate determined by fecal culture); and (v) one fecal culture-negative herd with known serologically positive cattle. Results generally showed a decreased ELISA response when absorbed rather than nonabsorbed serum from each animal was used. The results of the fecal culture confirmed clinically suspect cases, which were analyzed in relation to the amount of colonies isolated from the animals on fecal culture (0, +, ++,+++, ++++, and above). There was a significant increase in the ELISA response for animals with heavy Mycobacterium paratuberculosis shedding (++++ or above), when both unabsorbed and absorbed sera were used, compared with the response in animals that were fecal culture negative or that shed M. paratuberculosis at lower levels (less than +) (P less than 0. 05). The effects on sensitivity and specificity by using different cutoff points for the five groups of cattle with different levels of exposure is described, since sera were not discretely segregated into distinct groups of positive and negative samples. The specificity of the ELISA in the two fecal culture-negative herds was 100 % at an ELISA cutoff of an optical density (OD) of 0. 1 and above for absorbed serum. For unabsorbed serum the specificity was 62. 9 % at a similar cutoff value. Similarly, the specificity of the fecal culture-negative, serologically positive herd increased from 37. 5 to 72. 2 at an ELISA cutoff value of 0. 1 to 0. 2 (OD) by using absorbed versus unabsorbed serum from 75. 0 to 94. 4 at an ELISA cutoff value of 0. 2 to 0. 3 (OD) ...|$|E
40|$|To {{estimate}} ELISA serological studies {{results of}} IgM and IgG specific Measles and Rubella Viruses (MRV) antibodies detection the “in-house” laboratory controls (ILC) including the specific markers of MRV infections {{were for the}} first time commercially prepared by the Vector Best PLC (Russia) : “Measles-IgM, ser. 1 ”, “Measles-IgM, ser. 2 ”, “Rubella-IgM”, Measles-IgG” and “Rubella-IgG”. This task was realized under the special Executive Order of the Government of Russia N 523 -r, 2014, April, 4. According to passport characteristics ILC samples are the lyophilized human sera, inactivated by heating (1 hour at 56 °C) and stabilized by the mixture of sucrose (5 %) and ProClin- 3000 as the conservation agent. Samples are free of HBs Ag, anti-HVC, T. Pallidum, HIV- 1 / 2, HIV- 1 Ag р 24. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the possibility of using the ILC for detection of the MRV IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA with commercial ELISA kits used in Russia and CIS countries. In the process of detecting the specific activity of “Measles-IgM, ser. 1 ”, “Measles-IgM, ser. 2 ” and “Rubella-IgM” by ELISA kits of different formats (Vector Best, EcoLab and Siemens Companies) the statistically different results were received (p < 0. 05). The optical density (OD) values of IgM in the “Measles-IgM, ser. 1 ” and “Measles-IgM, ser. 2 ” ILC, obtained by ELISA “VectoMeasles IgM” (Vector Best) were significantly higher than those obtained by ELISA IgEnzygnost®Anti-MeaslesVirus/IgМ. These values consisted for the ser. 1 – 1. 33 ± 0. 02 о. u. vs. 0. 18 ± 0. 01 о. u. (р < 0. 05) and for the ser. 2 – 2. 83 ± 0. 03 о. u. vs. 0. 7 ± 0. 02 о. е. (р < 0. 05) in the Vector Best and Siemens ELISA kits correspondently. In the “Rubella-IgM” ILC the OD values of the specific IgM by the “ELISA-Rubella IgM” EcoLab were also higher than those obtained by IgEnzygnost®Anti-RubellaVirus/IgМ ELISA kit. These values consisted 2. 92 ± 0. 04 о. u. vs. 0. 88 ± 0. 03 о. u. (р <  0. 05) in EcoLab and Siemens ELISA test-systems correspondently. In the studies when the ILC working solution parameters for ELISA of “capture” and “indirect” formats were evaluated the statistic reliability and high information capability of the mathematic models of the OD value changes vs. the degree of dilution of the initial ILC were determined. For the “capture” and “indirect” formats the determination coefficient (R 2) consisted 97. 34 and 99. 29 correspondently, the Fisher criteria (F) —  219. 62 and 556. 55 correspondently, the significance level (p) — < 0. 05 for both formats. The evaluated optimal working dilution degrees of the IgM-containing ILC make possible to exclude the influence of the IgG antibodies as the non-target marker in the ILC. On the other hand, taking into account the format of the used ELISA kit the optimal <b>working</b> <b>dilution</b> degrees give the possibility to obtain the desirable 2 – 3 “cut-off” values of the specific marker. Moreover, the issue of the target marker quantitative content in ILC is discussed in the study. In order to improve the quality of the commercial MRV IgM and IgG ELISA test-systems the joint studies with those who develop and produce these systems are desirable to be organized. </p...|$|E

Additionally, the T- 47 D media {{was supplemented with}} 0.2 units/ml bovine insulin. Cells were maintained in log phase at 37  °C and 5  % CO 2 and seeded at a concentration of 5 [*]×[*] 105 cells/well in 96 -well plates for Jurkat and Hut- 78 cells. For the T- 47 D and LNCaP cells, the cells were first trypsinized using 0.25  % trypsin/ 0.53  mM EDTA (MP Biomedicals, LLC; Santa Ana, CA), re-suspended in fresh media, and then seeded at a concentration of 2.5 [*]×[*] 105 cells/well in 24 -well plates. The cells were then incubated overnight to allow the cells to re-adhere to the plate. Prior to treatment, the growth medium was gently aspirated from each well and replaced with 400  μL of fresh medium. Cells were subsequently treated with freshly sonicated (30 -min) NPs reconstituted in the desired solution. Jurkat cells and Hut- 78 cells were treated with NPs immediately after plating. For example, for a 2  mg/ml ZnO NP stock dispersion, 3.2  mg of NP was re-suspended in 1.58  ml of solution medium and sonicated at 50  W for 30  min. Then <b>working</b> <b>dilutions</b> were prepared from the NP stock dispersion and added to 200  μl of cell suspensions in 96 -well plates or 400  μl of cell suspensions in 24 -well plates and cultured for 24  h.

The alamar blue metabolic assay was employed to assess viability based on the fluorogenic redox indicator dye resazurin being converted to the fluorescent resofurin upon reduction by mitochondrial enzymes in metabolically active cells. In this assay, cell populations were seeded into the desired plate at the concentrations indicated above, treated with NPs for 20  h, and then incubated with alamar blue (10  % of total volume) for an additional 4  h. Changes in fluorescence were evaluated spectrophotometrically using excitation/emission at 530 / 590  nm in a Biotek Synergy MX® plate reader (Winooski, VT).|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the phenotype of special dog mammary gland tumours that were grown in nude mice. 26 tumours were examined by the immunohistochemical ABC-Elite protocol. The tumour tissues were labelled with following anti-human antibodies: - AE 1 /AE 3 (pankeratin antibody) labelled epithelial and myoepithelial cells - CD 31 labelled endothelial cells - desmin labelled cross-striated and smooth muscle cells - myosin labelled cross striated muscle cells - neurofilament (NF) labelled nerve cells - osteopontin labelled preosteoblasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes - p 63 labelled nuclei of the myoepithelial cells - smooth muscle actin (SMA) labelled the cytoplasm of myoepithelial cells - type I collagen labelled the extracellular matrix in connective tissue and bone - type II collagen labelled the extracellular matrix in cartilage - vimentin labelled fibroblasts, fibrocytes, lipocytes, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, nerve cells, macrophages and myoepithelial cells The tumours were also submitted to a double immunolabelling study using p 63 and SMA. The study could not give a final conclusion about the origin the tumours. There was still need for more research to answer that question. However, the immunohistochemical technique was analysed in detail, {{in order to obtain}} perfect labelings. Initially, all the antibodies were tested on normal dog tissue, to acquire the best <b>working</b> <b>dilutions</b> with the lowest background problems. In the tumours, good results were obtained with these dilutions for the antibodies p 63, SMA, vimentin, desmin, NF, AE 1 /AE 3 and CD 31. Except for type I collagen, type II collagen and osteopontin that gave too much unspecific labelling of the mouse connective tissue. Even, when using the Vector® M. O. M. blocking kit, the results were still very difficult to interpretate. The antigen retrieval methods were evaluated for all the antibodies. The antibodies p 63, SMA, vimentin, desmin, AE 1 /AE 3, myosin, neurofilament and CD 31 needed the antigen retrieval treatment. The antibodies type I collagen and type II collagen needed the treatment with the enzyme pepsin, while osteopontin did not need any pretreatment at all. The double immunolabelling with p 63 and SMA gave excellent results. Different combinations were tried out with different substrates, namely Vector® Nova RED, Vector® DAB and Vector® SG.

40|$|The {{ability to}} measure Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca in foraminiferal calcite has {{increased}} in importance following their identification as palaeoceanographic tracers with significant potential to constrain past changes in ocean chemistry and temperature. However, in order to tackle palaeoceanographic problems, {{it is essential to}} develop methods for the determination of these ratios that have both rapid sample throughput and high analytical precision. Here, we demonstrate the importance of simultaneous measurement for high-precision Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca analysis. Our method is readily applicable to automated analysis over a wide range of Ca concentrations and is not subject to significant matrix effects. Using a “dual view? inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), supported by a dedicated autosampler, we have investigated three nebulizers and two spray chambers and determined optimum analytical parameters. We show that there are consistent relationships between signal-to-noise ratio and gas flow rates and that the <b>working</b> sample <b>dilution</b> range has an important effect on linear response. Further, for this instrument it is important to manually constrain the timing of measurements to obtain truly simultaneous readings.

40|$|Introduction The Fluorescence Polarization ImmunoAssay (FPIA) is a {{homogeneous}} and very simple method with many {{applications in the}} determination of biologically active compounds. We study and investigate new aproaches, materials and conditions, for further improvement of basic characteristics of the method. The research for optimisation of FPIA {{and the development of}} new systems has been intensified the last years aiming at the application of method in environmental analysis. There are many problems to be solved in this area, taking into account the abundance of toxic substances used and the different requirements of each analytic process. The big variety of samples and the complex matrices, impose sample pretreatment and preconcentration with negative effect to speed and simplicity. Additionally, the homogeneous immunoassays suffer from low sensitivity and cross reactivity with structural related compounds and metabolites. The standard analytical methods used in environmental analysis are chromatographic (HPLC, GC, GC-MS), and include time-consuming steps of extraction, purification concentration and enrichment of samples. These methods are expensive (solvents, standards, operation and service of equipment) and require absolutely specialised personnel. The basic conditions for the widest application of immunoassays in the environmental analysis, in combination with the standard methods, is the development of faster, simpler, reliable and more sensitive assays. The fluorescence polarisation immunoassay (FPIA) as {{a homogeneous}} assay can satisfy all these requirements. Further research to improve FPIA is essential in order to meet these conditions. For our studies we used the herbicides 2, 4 -dichloro phenoxy acetic acid (2, 4 D) and 2, 4, 5 - trichloro phenoxy acetic acid (2, 4, 5 T) as model antigens. These molecules were the base for synthesis of new tracers and immunogens and we studied their effect in the characteristics of FPIA. The constant increase in sensitivity that was observed, independently from the type of antigen, led to the determination of new conditions and materials that further improve the method. Principle of FPIA FPIA uses two technologies a) the competitive binding of antigen by the antibody and b) the polarisation of fluorescence. FPIA is based on the principle that the molecules of tracer are rotated in solution and their speed of rotation is related with the size of molecules. Free tracer molecules absorb vertical polarized light. Due to their small Molecular Weight and the high speed of rotation, they change orientation and emit unpolarized light (low polarisation of fluorescence). On the contrary, bound tracer molecules by the antibody are turned slowly due to their high Molecular Weight and they emit almost polarized light (high polarisation of fluorescence). The degree of inhibition of the tracer with the presennce of antigen, from the antibody binding sites, and hence the final polarization, depends on the concentration of antigen present in the sample. Experimental part Immunogen synthesis, immunizations - antibodies: Herbicide 2, 4, 5 T were coupled with BSA using as chemical bridge β-alanine or ε-aminocaproic acid. The immunogens 2, 4, 5 Τ-BSA, 2, 4, 5 T- βAla-BSA and 2, 4, 5 T-εAca-BSA were used for immunization of New Zealand rabbits and the IgG fraction was isolated from antiserum with ammonium sulfate. For 2, 4 D assay we used the monoclonal antibody E 2 /G 2 which has been used by others in immunoassays development. Tracer synthesis: Using solid phase chemistry we developed method for hapten synthesis and subsequent preparation of new immunogens and novel tracers. We prepared a series of monolabeled and multilabeled tracers of high purity using as connecting bridge L-lysine molecules in different orientations and FITC. Tracers were isolated with preparative TLC and the structure was confirmed with UV and NMR. We also prepared conventional tracers that are proposed by other researchers and compared with regard to their effectiveness in FPIA. In order to verify our results we synthesized similar tracers using the antigens endosulfan and indomethacin. Implementation of FPIA: The intensity and polarization values was measured in the TDx Abbot analyzer in photocheck mode and the dilution and standard curves were constructed. The sensitivity was estimated with the measurement of the I 50 value (concentration of antigen that gives 50 % reduction in the polarisation of fluorescence) and the limit of detection (the concentration which coresponds 3 SD below the initial polarization). Other characteristics like reproducibility, specificity and recovery were measured in bottled water samples. We also developed and proposed other aproaches like the use of the ratio *B/*F for the construction of standard curves. The measurement of affinity constants between antibody and tracers were used to explain our results. Results - Conclusions Structure of tracers and sensitivity: The use of L-lysine allowed us to synthesize a big variety of monolabeled and multilabeled tracers homologous or heterologous to immunogens. Using these tracers we were able to make a complete study with regard to the influence of their structure in the characteristics of the method. We also studied the relation between their structure and self quenching in multilabeled tracers. The results show structure dependent decrease in their quantum yield. The two most important limitations for the use of multilabels in FPIA, is the decrease in quantum yield and the important propeller effect which reduces significantly the polarization. Upon binding of monolabeled tracers by the antibody, appeared fluorescence quenching caused by the interaction of fluorescein with the binding site. The shorter the chemical bridge, the higher the interaction. This reduces propeler effect and increases polarization. The use of L-lysine as chemical bridge resulted in improved tracers especially when the antigen was attached to the α-amino group and the FITC to the ε-amino group of L-lysine (Ag-K(F) -OH). These tracers had better characteristics leading the method to lower detection limits and lower I 50 values, up to nine times, compared to those reported in the literature. The tracer 2, 4 D-K(F) -OH was used in combination with the monoclonal antibody E 2 /G 2 and the I 50 was 12 ng/ml, while in the literature it is reported 80 - 100 ng/ml with the tracer 2, 4 D-EDA-F (ethylene diamine as spacer). The I 50 with isomeric tracer (F-K(2, 4 D) -OH) was measured 93, 5 ng/ml, and with the tracer 2, 4 D-EDA-F which was used by other researchers, was measured 65 ng/ml. Similar results were observed when other antigens (2, 4, 5 T, endosulfan, indomethacin) used for preparation of tracers. From Scatchard analysis we concluded that the affinity of tracer 2, 4 D-K(F) -OH with the antibody was comparable with the affinity for 2, 4 D. On the contrary the affinity of antibody with other tracers was one order of magnitude higher. In conclusion we have found a structure of tracer (Ag-K(F) -OH) which creates conditions for specific recognition by the antibody, thus increasing considerably the assay sensitivity. Other characteristics of the new tracers: The use of new tracers do not influences other characteristics of FPIA like specificity, reproducibility, recovery etc. The percent cross reactivities remain similar with those already reported. The percent coefficient of variation (intra and inter assay) was less than 7 % while the recovery was ranged from 90 - 110 %. The limit of detection was defined at 0, 8 ng/ml. The very well defined structure of tracers and their high purity allowed us easily to calculate the ratio *B/*F (bound tracer / free tracer). Standard curves of *B/*F vs antigen concentration were constructed. The advantages with this approach were: the important reduction and stability of I 50 and the stability of standard curves. The I 50 values were improved at least 3 times and the limit of detection for 2, 4 D was below 0, 35 ng/ml. Antibodies and sensitivity: The above results repeated also with polyclonal antibodies. The influence of immunogen structure was important to the antibody quality. Antibodies with the highest sensitivity correspond to immunogens with the 3 carbon atoms chemical bridge β- alanine. Development of Single - Reagent FPIA The antibody is stabilized when mixed with tracer in <b>working</b> <b>dilution.</b> The mixture is used directly for the implementation of the assay. The antibody - tracer mixture is the single reagent (SR). The standard or unknown sample is added to the SR and the polarization is measured after 5 - 10 min in equilibrium. The SR-FPIA has the following characteristics: a) SR-FPIA is a one step method b) The 30 X concentrated single reagent can be used for at least 4 months and shows increased stability in comparison with its ingredients before mixing c) In all measurements I 50 values was 10 12 ng/ml similar to those obtained with conventional FPIA d) The simplification and the fewer addition steps, reduce the SD values. As a result the limit of detection was reduced further and estimated to be lower than 0, 8 ng/ml. General conclusions Λ The use of solid phase chemistry was proved to be a very useful tool for rapid synthesis of high purity haptens and their use in immunoassays. Λ The negative effect of self quenching in multilabels and mainly the propeller effect due to unavoidable long chemical bridges do not allow their use in homogeneous FPIA. Λ The succesfull introduction of L-lysine as chemical bridge led to tracers up to 10 times more sensitive than the conventional ones proposed in the literature. These tracers were recognized specifically by the antibody. Λ Using standard curves with the *B/*F ratio and the single reagent technique the method was simplified and the detection limit of 2, 4 D FPIA was reduced close to the European MRLs. Λ The results of the present dissertation led to important improvements of FPIA characteristics. We propose tracers with well defined structure and synthetic pathway which can be applied also to other antigens. Λ The analysis with FPIA was improved almost one order of magnitude providing thus toxicological analysis with an important analytical tool. Εισαγωγή H ανοσοδιαγνωστική μέθοδος πόλωσης φθορισμού (FPIA) είναι μια ομογενής, πολύ απλή στην εκτέλεση της μέθοδος με πολλές εφαρμογές στην ανάλυση βιολογικά ενεργών ουσιών. Η έρευνα για τη βελτιστοποίηση της FPIA και την ανάπτυξη νέων συστημάτων πόλωσης φθορισμού έχει ενταθεί τα τελευταία χρόνια με σκοπό την εφαρμογή της μεθόδου στην περιβαλλοντική ανάλυση. Οι δυσκολίες που αντιμετωπίζονται είναι πολλές λαμβανομένου υπόψιν του πλήθους των τοξικών ουσιών αλλά και των διαφορετικών απαιτήσεων κάθε αναλυτικής διαδικασίας. H πολυπλοκότητα των δειγμάτων προς ανάλυση και η επίδραση του υποστρώματος του δείγματος στο αποτέλεσμα επιβάλει σε πολλές περιπτώσεις την προκατεργασία του δείγματος με αρνητικές συνέπειες στην ευκολία εκτέλεσης και την ταχύτητα. Επίσης οι ομογενείς ανοσοδιαγνωστικές μέθοδοι συχνά υποφέρουν από χαμηλή ευαισθησία και από διασταυρούμενες αντιδράσεις με συνέπεια τα αποτελέσματα πολλές φορές να αλλοιώνονται. Oι αναλυτικές μέθοδοι αναφοράς στην περιβαλλοντική ανάλυση είναι χρωματογραφικές (HPLC, GC, GC-MS), περιλαμβάνουν χρονοβόρα βήματα εκχύλισης, καθαρισμού συγκέντρωσης και εμπλουτισμού των δειγμάτων, είναι ακριβές (διαλύτες, πρότυπα διαλύματα, λειτουργία και συντήρηση μηχανημάτων κλπ), απαιτούν απόλυτα εξειδικευμένο προσωπικό, ενώ σε ορισμένες περιπτώσεις δεν ενδείκνυται η χρήση τους. Οι βασικές προϋποθέσεις για την πιο ευρεία εφαρμογή των ανοσοδιαγνωστικών μεθόδων γρήγορου ελέγχου, για προσδιορισμό τοξικών ουσιών σε συνδυασμό με τις μεθόδους αναφοράς ενόργανης ανάλυσης είναι η απλοποίηση, η συντόμευση, η μείωση των ορίων ανίχνευσης και η βελτίωση της αξιοπιστίας τους. H ανοσοδιαγνωστική μέθοδος πόλωσης φθορισμού (FPIA) μπορεί να ικανοποιήσει όλες αυτές τις απαιτήσεις γι'αυτό και είναι απαραίτητη η έρευνα για την Για τις ανάγκες της παρούσας διατριβής χρησιμοποιήθηκαν σαν μοντέλα τα ζιζανιοκτόνα 2, 4 διχλωροφαινοξυ οξικό οξύ (2, 4 D) και 2, 4, 5 τριχλωροφαινοξυ οξικό οξύ (2, 4, 5 Τ). Με βάση αυτά τα μόρια συντέθηκαν ανοσογόνα και νέα φθορίζοντα αντιγόνα και μελετήθηκε η επίδραση τους στα χαρακτηριστικά της FPIA. Η σταθερή βελτίωση της ευαισθησίας που παρατηρήθηκε ανεξάρτητα από το είδος του αντιγόνου οδήγησε στον καθορισμό νέων συνθηκών και υλικών που βελτιώνουν Aρχή της ανοσοδιαγνωστικής μεθόδου πόλωσης φθορισμού Η FPIA χρησιμοποιεί δύο τεχνολογίες α) την ανταγωνιστική δέσμευση του αντιγόνου από το αντίσωμα και β) την πόλωση φθορισμού. Αυτή βασίζεται στην αρχή ότι τα μόρια περιστρέφονται στο διάλυμα και η ταχύτητα περιστροφής τους σχετίζεται με το μέγεθος των μορίων. Ελεύθερα μόρια φθορίζοντος ανιχνευτή απορροφούν κάθετα πολωμένο φως. Λόγω του μικρού μεγέθους τους περιστρέφονται γρήγορα και καθώς αλλάζουν προσανατολισμό εκπέμπουν μη πολωμένο φως (μικρή πόλωση φθορισμού). Αντίθετα, δεσμευμένα από το αντίσωμα μόρια ανιχνευτή περιστρέφονται αργά λόγω του μεγάλου μεγέθους τους. Παραμένουν σχεδόν με ίδιο προσανατολισμό και συνεπώς εκπέμπουν σχεδόν πολωμένο φως (μεγάλη πόλωση φθορισμού). Η ύπαρξη ή όχι αντιγόνου στο δείγμα προς ανάλυση, οδηγεί σε μικρή ή μεγάλη πόλωση φθορισμού αντίστοιχα, λόγω της ανταγωνιστικής δέσμευσης του αντιγόνου και του ανιχνευτή στις θέσεις του αντισώματος. Πειραματικό μέρος Σύνθεση ανοσογόνων, ανοσοποιήσεις - αντισώματα: Το 2, 4, 5 Τ συνδέθηκε με την BSA είτε χωρίς γέφυρα, είτε χρησιμοποιώντας την β-Αλανίνη ή το ε-Αμινοκαπροϊκό οξύ σα χημική γέφυρα. Τα ανοσογόνα που συντέθηκαν ήταν 2, 4, 5 Τ-BSA, 2, 4, 5 T-βAla-BSA και 2, 4, 5 T-εAca- BSA. Ανοσοποιήθηκαν πειραματόζωα (κουνέλια Νέας Ζηλανδίας), οι αντιορροί που παρήχθησαν κατεργάσθηκαν με θειικό αμμώνιο για την απομόνωση των ανοσοσφαιρινών και χρησιμοποιήθηκαν σε συγκριτικές μελέτες με άλλους αντιορρούς. Για τη μέτρηση του 2, 4 D χρησιμοποιήθηκε το μονοκλωνικό αντίσωμα E 2 /G 2 το οποίο έχει χρησιμοποιηθεί και από άλλους ερευνητές σε ανοσοδιαγνωστικά συστήματα. Σύνθεση ανιχνευτών: Χρησιμοποιώντας χημεία στερεής φάσης, αναπτύχθηκε μέθοδος σύνθεσης απτενίων με την οποία παρασκευάστηκαν μια σειρά από μονοσημασμένοι και πολυσημασμένοι με FITC ανιχνευτές υψηλής καθαρότητας. Σα χημική γέφυρα χρησιμοποιήθηκε η L-λυσίνη σε διαφορετικούς προσανατολισμούς. Απομονώθηκαν με παρασκευαστική χρωματογραφία λεπτής στοιβάδας και η δομή τους επιβεβαιώθηκε με UV και NMR. Επίσης παρασκευάστηκαν ανιχνευτές που προτείνονται από άλλους ερευνητές και συγκρίνονται όσον αφορά την αποτελεσματικότητα τους στην FPIA. Για την επιβεβαίωση των αποτελεσμάτων συντέθηκαν επίσης αντίστοιχοι ανιχνευτές με τα αντιγόνα ενδοσουλφάν και ινδομεθακίνη. Εκτέλεση της FPIA: Οι μετρήσεις έγιναν στον αναλυτή TDx Abbot στην λειτουργία photocheck. Κατασκευάστηκαν καμπύλες για την τιτλοδότηση των αντιορρών και πρότυπες καμπύλες χρησιμοποιώντας σταθερά διαλύματα αντιγόνου. Η ευαισθησία εκτιμήθηκε με την μέτρηση της τιμής Ι 50 (η συγκέντρωση του αντιγόνου που δίδει 50 % μείωση στην πόλωση φθορισμού) ενώ επίσης μετρήθηκαν τα ποσοστά των διασταυρούμενων αντιδράσεων με χημικά παρόμοιες ουσίες. Ακόμα εκτιμήθηκαν παράμετροι όπως η ανάκτηση, η ακρίβεια και η επαναληψιμότητα σε δείγματα εμφιαλωμένου νερού στα οποία προηγουμένως είχε προστεθεί ορισμένη ποσότητα αντιγόνου. Επίσης προτείνομε την χρήση του λόγου *B/*F σαν τεταγμένη για την κατασκευή πρότυπων καμπυλών. Οι σταθερές σύνδεσης του αντισώματος Ε 2 /G 2 με τους ανιχνευτές αλλά και με το 2, 4 D υπολογίστηκαν με ανάλυση Scatchard. Αποτελέσματα - Συμπεράσματα ομή ανιχνευτών και ευαισθησία: Η L-λυσίνη έδωσε τη δυνατότητα να συντεθούν ανιχνευτές σε μεγάλη ποικιλία (μονοσημασμένοι ή πολυσημασμένοι, ομόλογοι ή ετερόλογοι ως προς το ανοσογόνο) και να γίνει μια ολοκληρωμένη μελέτη της επίδρασης της δομής τους στην αποτελεσματικότητα της μεθόδου. Από τα αποτελέσματα των μετρήσεων προκύπτει κατ'αρχάς ότι σε συμβατική FPIA δεν μπορούν να χρησιμοποιηθούν πολυσημασμένοι ανιχνευτές λόγω της εμφάνισης σημαντικής αυτοαπόσβεσης φθορισμού. Η ένταση του φαινομένου αυτού αποδεικνύεται ότι εξαρτάται από τη στερεοχημεία του μορίου, όμως σε καμμία περίπτωση δισημασμένου ανιχνευτή δεν είχαμε καλύτερη ευαισθησία σε σχέση με τους μονοσημασμένους λόγω της εμφάνισης και φαινομένου προπέλας. Κατά τη δέσμευση των μονοσημασμένων ανιχνευτών στο αντίσωμα υπάρχει απόσβεση φθορισμού που οφείλεται στην αλληλεπίδραση της φθορίζουσας ουσίας με την περιοχή δέσμευσης. Αυτή η αλληλεπίδραση μεγαλώνει καθώς μικραίνει το μήκος της χημικής γέφυρας, ελλατώνεται το φαινόμενο προπέλας και αυξάνεται η πόλωση φθορισμού. Όταν το αντιγόνο συνδέεται στην α-αμινομάδα της L-λυσίνης και το φθορίζον μόριο στην ε-αμινομάδα (Ag-K(F) -OH) προκύπτουν ανιχνευτές με βελτιωμένα χαρακτηριστικά προσδίδοντας στη μέθοδο χαμηλώτερα όρια ανίχνευσης και τιμές Ι 50 τέσσερις έως εννέα φορές χαμηλώτερες από αυτές που αναφέρονται στη βιβλιογραφία. Όταν χρησιμοποιήθηκε ο ανιχνευτής 2, 4 D-K(F) -OH σε συνδυασμό με το αντίσωμα Ε 2 /G 2 το Ι 50 ήταν 12 ng/ml, ενώ όταν ο ανιχνευτής έχει σαν γέφυρα τη αιθυλενοδιαμίνη (2, 4 D-EDA-F) το Ι 50 που αναφέρεται στην βιβλιογραφία είναι μεταξύ 80 και 100 ng/ml. Το Ι 50 με τον ισομερή ανιχνευτή (F-K(2, 4 D) -OH) μετρήθηκε 93, 5 ng/ml, ενώ όταν χρησιμοποιήθηκε ο ανιχνευτής που προτείνεται από άλλους ερευνητές 2, 4 D-EDA-F, αυτό ήταν 65 ng/ml. Παρόμοια αποτελέσματα παρατηρούνται όταν για την σύνθεση ανιχνευτών χρησιμοποιούνται και άλλα αντιγόνα (2, 4, 5 Τ, ενδοσουλφάν, ινδομεθακίνη). Από την Scatchard ανάλυση προέκυψε ότι η σταθερά σύνδεσης του ανιχνευτή 2, 4 D-EDA-F με το αντίσωμα ήταν περίπου μια τάξη μεγέθους μεγαλύτερη από την αντίστοιχη του 2, 4 D-K(F) - OH. Συμπεραίνεται ότι η ιδιαιτερότητα της δομής Αg-K(F) -OH δημιουργεί συνθήκες πιο ειδικής αναγνώρισης της από το αντίσωμα με συνέπεια την σημαντικά αυξημένη ευαισθησία σε σχέση με οποιαδήποτε άλλη δομή που χρησιμοποιήθηκε. Αλλα χαρακτηριστικά της μεθόδου: Η χρησιμοποίηση των νέων ευαίσθητων μορίων αφήνει σχεδόν ανεπηρέαστη την ειδικότητα των μετρήσεων αφού οι διασταυρούμενες αντιδράσεις παραμένουν όπως ήδη έχουν αναφερθεί στην βιβλιογραφία. Η ανάκτηση της μεθόδου κυμαίνεται σε φυσιολογικά επίπεδα από 90 - 110 %, ενώ ο συντελεστής μεταβλητότητας ήταν μικρότερος από 7 %. Το όριο ανίχνευσης για το 2, 4 D προσδιορίστηκε στα 0, 8 ng/ml. Μια άλλη σημαντική προσέγγιση είναι η χρησιμοποίηση του λόγου του δεσμευμένου προς τον ελεύθερο ανιχνευτή (*B/*F) αντί της πόλωσης, σαν αναλυτική παράμετρο στις πρότυπες καμπύλες. Τα πλεονεκτήματα ήταν: η σημαντική μείωση και σταθερότητα των Ι 50 και η σταθερότητα των πρότυπων καμπυλών. Το όριο ανίχνευσης με αυτή την προσέγγιση ήταν μικρότερο από τα 0, 35 ng/ml. Αντισώματα και ευαισθησία: Τα αποτελέσματα που αναφέρονται πιο πάνω επαναλαμβάνονται χωρίς να επηρεάζονται από το είδος του αντισώματος (μονοκλωνικό ή πολυκλωνικό). Η επίδραση της δομής του αντιγόνου ήταν σημαντική στην ποιότητα του αντισώματος. Αντισώματα που παρουσίασαν την μεγαλύτερη ευαισθησία σε συνδυασμό με τους ανιχνευτές Ag-K(F) -OH αντιστοιχούν σε αντιγόνα με τη χημική γέφυρα των τριών ατόμων άνθρακα βAla. Ανάπτυξη της FPIA ενιαίου αντιδραστηρίου Η μέθοδος απλοποιείται ακόμη περισσότερο καθώς το αντίσωμα σταθεροποιείται όταν αναμιχθεί στην αραίωση εργασίας του με τον ανιχνευτή. Το μίγμα αντισώματος-ανιχνευτή αποτελεί το ενιαίο αντιδραστήριο. Σ' αυτό προστίθεται το προς ανάλυση δείγμα και η μέτρηση λαμβάνεται σε 5 - 10 λεπτά αφού έχει πια αποκατασταθεί ισορροπία. Η FPIA ενιαίου αντιδραστηρίου έχει τα εξής χαρακτηριστικά: α) Ουσιαστικά αποτελεί μέθοδο ενός βήματος. β) Το ενιαίο αντιδραστήριο σε συμπυκνωμένη μορφή 30 φορές μπορεί να χρησιμοποιηθεί για τουλάχιστον 4 μήνες και έχει αυξημένη σταθερότητα έναντι των συστατικών του πριν την ανάμιξη. γ) Τα αποτελέσματα όσον αφορά τα Ι 50 είναι απολύτως συγκρίσιμα με αυτά που λήφθησαν με τη συμβατική FPIA αφού σε όλες τις μετρήσεις ήταν 10 - 12 ng/ml. δ) Η απλούστευση στην εκτέλεση και τα λιγότερα στάδια προσθήκης αντιδραστηρίων ελλατώνουν τις τυπικές αποκλίσεις. Αποτέλεσμα είναι η μείωση των ορίων ανίχνευσης σε σχέση με τη συμβατική FPIA, τα οποία σε όλες τις μετρήσεις για το 2, 4 D με τεταγμένη πόλωση βρέθηκαν μικρότερα από 0, 8 ng/ml. Γενικά συμπεράσματα Η χρησιμοποίηση χημείας στερεής φάσης αποδεικνύεται ότι είναι ένα πολύ χρήσιμο εργαλείο για την σύνθεση απτενίων σε ανοσοδιαγνωστικές μεθόδους. Η αρνητική επίδραση της αυτοαπόσβεσης στους πολυσημασμένους ανιχνευτές και κυρίως το φαινόμενο προπέλας δεν επιτρέπουν την χρήση τους σε συμβατική FPIA. Χρησιμοποιήθηκε για πρώτη φορά L-λυσίνη σαν γέφυρα για μονοσημασμένους ανιχνευτές οι οποίοι ήταν σχεδόν δέκα φορές πιο ευαίσθητοι σε σχέση με άλλους που αναφέρονται στην βιβλιογραφία. Αυτοί οι ανιχνευτές αναγνωρίζονταν ειδικά από το αντίσωμα. Χρησιμοποιώντας το ενιαίο αντιδραστήριο και τον λόγο *B/*F σαν αναλυτική παράμετρο η μέθοδος απλοποιήθηκε ακόμη περισσότερο και το όριο ανίχνευσης πλησίασε τα ευρωπαϊκά MRLs. Τα αποτελέσματα της παρούσας διατριβής οδήγησαν σε σημαντικές και βασικές παρεμβάσεις στην FPIA με αποτέλεσμα τη βελτίωση των χαρακτηριστικών της και κυρίως της ευαισθησίας. Προτείνονται ανιχνευτές με συγκεκριμένη δομή και συγκεκριμένο τρόπο σύνθεσης που μπορούν να εφαρμοστούν σχεδόν σε όλα τα αντιγόνα. Η ανάλυση τοξικών ουσιών με την FPIA έγινε σχεδόν μια τάξη μεγέθους πιο ευαίσθητη αποτελώντας ένα σημαντικό εργαλείο για την τοξικολογική ανάλυση...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time on ISS, BASS-II {{utilized}} MSG <b>working</b> volume <b>dilution</b> with gaseous nitrogen (N 2). We developed a perfectly stirred reactor model to determine the N 2 flow time and flow rate to obtain the desired reduced oxygen concentration in the working volume for each test. We calibrated the model with CSA-CP oxygen readings offset using the Mass Constituents Analyzer reading of the ISS ambient atmosphere data for that day. This worked out extremely well for operations, and added a new vital variable, ambient oxygen level, to our test matrices. The main variables tested in BASS-II were ambient oxygen concentration, ventilation flow velocity, and fuel type, thickness, and geometry. BASS-II also utilized the on-board CSA-CP for oxygen and carbon monoxide readings, and the CDM for carbon dioxide readings before and after each test. Readings from these sensors allow us to evaluate the completeness of the combustion. The oxygen and carbon dioxide readings before and after each test were analyzed and compared very well to stoichiometric ratios for a one step gas-phase reaction. The CO versus CO 2 followed a linear trend for some datasets, but not for all the different geometries of fuel and flow tested. Lastly, we calculated the heat release rates during each test from the oxygen consumption and burn times, using the constant 13. 1 kJ of heat released per gram of oxygen consumed. The results showed {{that the majority of the}} tests had heat release rates well below 100 Watts...|$|R
40|$|Fire {{safety is}} one of the most {{important}} issues for manned space missions. A likely cause of fires in spacecraft is wire insulation combustion in electrical system. Regarding the wire insulation combustion it important to know the effect of low external flow on the combustion because of the presence of ventilation flow in spacecraft. Although, there are many researches on flame spreading over solid material at low external flows under microgravity, research dealing with wire insulation is very limited. An example of wire insulation combustion in microgravity is the Space Shuttle experiments carried out by Greenberg et al. However, the number of experiments was very limited. Therefore, the effect of low flow velocity is still not clear. The authors have reported results on flame spreading over ETFE (ethylene - tetrafluoroetylene) insulated wire in a quiescent atmosphere in microgravity by 10 seconds drop tower. The authors also performed experiments of polyethylene insulated nichrom wire combustion in low flow velocity under microgravity. The results suggested that flame spread rate had maximum value in low flow velocity condition. Another interesting issue is the effect of dilution gas, especially CO 2, which is used for fire extinguisher in ISS. There are some researches <b>working</b> on <b>dilution</b> gas effect on flame spreading over solid material in quiescent atmosphere in microgravity. However the research with low external flow is limited and, of course, the research discussing a relation of the appearance of maximum wire flammability in low flow velocity region with different dilution gas cannot be found yet. The present paper, therefore, investigates the effect of opposed flow with different dilution gas on flame spreading over ETFE insulated wire and change in the presence of the maximum flammability depending on the dilution gas type is discussed within the limit of microgravity time given by ground-based facility...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{specificity}} and sensitivity of the techniques for the human anisakidosis diagnosis, a method of affinity chromatography for the purification of species-specific antigens from Anisakis simplex third-stage larvae (L 3) has been developed. New Zealand rabbits were immunized with A. simplex or Ascaris suum antigens or inoculated with Toxocara canis embryonated eggs. The IgG specific antibodies were isolated by means of protein A-Sepharose CL- 4 B beads columns. IgG anti-A. simplex and -A. suum were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 B. For the purification of the larval A. simplex antigens, these were loaded into the anti-A. simplex column and bound antigens eluted. For {{the elimination of the}} epitopes responsible for the cross-reactions, the A. simplex specific proteins were loaded into the anti-A. suum column. To prove the specificity of the isolated proteins, immunochemical analyses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were carried out. Further, we studied the different responses by ELISA to the different antigenic preparations of A. simplex used, observing their capability of discriminating among the different antisera raised in rabbits (anti-A. simplex, anti-A. suum, anti-T. canis). The discriminatory capability with the anti-T. canis antisera was good using the larval A. simplex crude extract (CE) antigen. When larval A. simplex CE antigen was loaded into a CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 B coupled to IgG from rabbits immunized with A. simplex CE antigen, its capability for discriminate between A. simplex and A. suum was improved, increasing in the case of T. canis. The best results were obtained using larval A. simplex CE antigen loaded into a CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 B coupled to IgG from rabbits immunized with adult A. suum CE antigen. When we compared the different serum dilution and antigenic concentration, we selected the <b>working</b> serum <b>dilution</b> of 1 / 400 and 1 µg/ml of antigenic concentration...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Med. Sc.) -University of Natal, Durban, 1985. Mortality and {{morbidity}} rates {{associated with}} tuberculous meningitis (TBM) are substantial. The average {{duration of the}} untreated disease from onset to death is about 17 days. The prognosis of TBM is known to correlate with {{the stage of the}} disease at the time of diagnosis and commencement of chemotherapy. Early diagnosis improves the chances of recovery without neurological sequelae. Early diagnosis is a problem because the presenting symptoms are non-specific and the onset of the disease is typically insidious. To date no single test is available that is totally reliable and specific for TBM. I have attempted to develop a reliable and easily applicable test for the diagnosis of TBM. In fulfilling this objective, the work undertaken may be divided into three major sections:- 1. Detection of soluble Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with TBM and in control groups by using Mycobacterium bovis BCG antigens. The technique used was that of inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The principle of this technique is illustrated in Fig. 5. 2. Detection of soluble M. tuberculosis antigens in the CSF of tuberculous and control groups of patients by using antibodies raised against M. bovis BCG. The technique used was that of the double antibody sandwich ELISA. An outline of this ELISA is given in Fig. 6. 3. Correlation of chloride levels in the blood and CSF of patients with tuberculous and other forms of meningitis. It has been established that the SERUM/CSF ratio of bromide tends towards unity in patients with TBM because the permeability of the blood-brain barrier is impaired. Since both bromide and chloride are chemically similar (both being halides), it was thought that a similar pattern may exist for BLOOD/CSF chloride ratios; and this was investigated. The method used for the INHIBITION ELISA had to be standardized before the samples could be tested. This involved investigating the acceptability of various microtitre plates; determination of the optimal <b>working</b> <b>dilutions</b> for the coating solution and conjugate; and determination of optimal conditions for the various incubation periods, both in terms of time and temperature. A total of 70 specimens was tested. These consisted of 25 normal CSF controls; 25 pleural and ascitic fluid samples; 10 TBM samples, and 10 bacterial meningitis CSF samples. It was found that a distinction existed between the absorbance values obtained from positive TBM CSF samples (Mean 0, 658 + 0, 043) and that from normal CSF samples (Mean 1, 089 + 0, 224). The mean absorbance of the culture-positive bacterial CSF's also differed significantly from the other 2 groups (Tables VII; IX). Some overlap occurred amongst the absorbance values of bacterial culture positive CSF's (Range 0, 975 - 0, 879) and normal CSF's (Range 1, 486 - 0, 934). The mean absorbance value for bacterial positive CSF samples (0, 920 _+ 0, 029) differed significantly (p < 0, 01) from those of normal CSF (1, 089 + 0, 224) and TBM CSF's (0, 658 + 0, 043). The difference between the mean values obtained with tuberculous and non-tuberculous groups of pleural and ascitic fluid was also significant (p < 0, 01). The method used for the DOUBLE ANTIBODY SANDWICH ELISA was that of Sada et al. (1983). Before the samples could be tested, the method had to be standardized and similar investigations to those for the INHIBITION ELISA were performed. In addition, antibodies raised against M. bovis BCG were conjugated to alkaline phosphatase since no commercial preparation was available. Unfortunately no distinction was recorded between negative and positive test specimens, even on repetition of the entire procedure. Measurement of chloride was done by a fully automated procedure using the BECKMAN ASTRA- 8. A total of 149 samples were tested. Of these 10 were tuberculous, 34 were viral, and the remainder were bacterial meningitis. No pattern was established that could differentiate TBM from viral or bacterial meningitis. The results obtained are tabulated in Table III and illustrated in Figures 9, 10, and 11. In summarizing, the use of the INHIBITION ELISA technique for the accurate diagnosis of TBM seems promising. However, its validity in the clinical situation will have to be assessed further and with greater numbers of specimens before it can be adopted as a diagnostic procedure for TBM. OBJECTIVE. To determine 1. The ability and reliability of the INHIBITION ELISA 1 technique to detect mycobacterial antigens in pleural, ascitic, and cerebrospinal fluids. 2. The accuracy and reproducibility of the double antibody sandwich ELISA in the detection of mycobacterial antigens in CSF of patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM). 3. Whether a correlation exists between blood and CSF chloride levels in patients with tuberculous and other forms of meningitis...|$|R
40|$|Summary: A time-resolved fluoroimmuno assay of the IgM-rheumatoid {{factor is}} described. Aggregated rabbit IgG was coated to microtitre plates {{to serve as}} the target protein. F(ab') 2 -fragments from antibodies, raised in rabbits against human IgM, were {{labelled}} with Eu 3 + and used in the assay to mark the bound IgM-rheumatoid factor. The labelling procedure is easy to perform, and {{there is no need for}} special equipment. The shelf life of the label at — 20 °C is at least one year. The lower detection limit of the assay is 1. 3 χ ΙΟ 3 IU/ 1. The range over which the IgM-rheumatoid factor can be measured at a within-run precision of < 5 % without varying the <b>dilution</b> (<b>working</b> range) is 5 — 1200 χ l O 3 IU/ 1. Linearity in serum dilutions is good. There is good correlation with existing methods for the assay of IgM-rheumatoid factor. This correlation is better with an assay using rabbit IgG as the target than with one using human IgG. Comparison of methods shows that standardization, despite the use of the WHO Reference Preparation as the first calibrator, remains problematic. The 95 th percentile in normal bloodbank donors is 8 χ ΙΟ 3 IU/ 1. The costs for the reagents were about 0. 5 Dutch florin (ca 0. 30 US-$) per well. In conclusion, the method described here is analytically at least comparable with other methods, in precision, linearity, working range etc. Finally, it is easy to perform.
