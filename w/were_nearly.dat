5|$|As the VOR {{system was}} phased {{in around the}} world, the LFR was {{gradually}} phased out, mostly disappearing by the 1970s. There are no remaining operational LFR facilities today. At its maximum deployment, there <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> 400 LFR stations in the U.S. alone.|$|E
5|$|Between 1918 and 1951, there <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> {{two dozen}} jazz nightclubs along Jackson Street, {{running from the}} current Chinatown/International District to the Central District.

5|$|By June 1906 there <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> 200 {{machine tools}} under {{construction}} at the factory, and in 1907 around £5,000 {{was spent on}} enlarging the premises, although a year-on-year drop in sales of 36% in 1908 demonstrated that all was not a smooth progression. Dividends had to be suspended for that year but were resumed in 1909.|$|E

5|$|Comets 42P/Neujmin and 53P/Van Biesbroeck {{appear to}} be {{fragments}} of a parent comet. Numerical integrations have shown that both comets had a rather close approach to Jupiter in January 1850, and that, before 1850, the two orbits <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> identical.|$|E
5|$|In Fiscal Year 2017, Lottery sales <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> $2 billion. The lottery {{generated}} {{more than}} $558 million, or 28.1% of total sales, for public education, 60.9% was paid out as prizes, 5.6% {{was paid to}} retailers as sales commissions, and 5.3% covered the Lottery's operational expenses.|$|E
5|$|In a 1905 paper, Einstein {{postulated}} that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta). Einstein's light quanta <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, {{and with the}} measurement of Compton scattering.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} {{half of the}} 2010s, CGI <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> {{ubiquitous}} in video, pre-rendered graphics <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> scientifically photorealistic, and real-time graphics on a suitably high-end system may simulate photorealism to the untrained eye.|$|R

5|$|In a March 2008 {{survey of}} 3,000 UK women, the Wonderbra was {{reported}} {{as the greatest}} fashion innovation in history. According to one magazine article, survey respondents <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> unanimous in giving push-up bras the number one position.|$|E
5|$|The two U-43-class U-boats <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> {{identical}} to the eight boats of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-27 class, which were built to UB II plans. Despite the similarities, the two groups are identified in sources as distinct classes.|$|E
5|$|Wales won two {{matches in}} each Five Nations of 1980 and 1981, and in 1983 <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> upset by Japan; winning 29–24 at Cardiff. In 1984, Australia {{defeated}} Wales 28–9 at Cardiff Arms Park {{and in the}} process scored a push-over try. Australia went on to win their first Home Nations Grand Slam.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> {{eliminated}} from the competition in the following round when they played Port Vale. After eight minutes, Tom Parker scored an own goal, putting Port Vale ahead. Buchan equalised for Arsenal {{early in the second}} half, but then Port Vale went ahead once more with a goal by Wilf Kirkham, as a rebounded shot after Dan Lewis saved the initial penalty. Arsenal chased a further equaliser, which came four minutes from time by Brain.|$|E
5|$|As {{it became}} clear the stocks <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> depleted, the world banned right whaling in 1937. The ban was largely successful, {{although}} violations continued for several decades. Madeira took its last two right whales in 1968. Japan took 23 Pacific right whales in the 1940s and more under scientific permit in the 1960s. Illegal whaling continued {{off the coast of}} Brazil for many years and the Imbituba land station processed right whales until 1973. The Soviet Union illegally took at least 3,212 southern right whales during the 1950s and '60s, although it reported taking only four.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the horses}} <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> blown, but d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers charged the third line, which they also broke. The Russian cossacks, {{assembled}} in the reserve, entered the melee, but their light horses were {{no match for the}} French mounts, big horses confiscated from the Prussians the previous year. The Russian infantry had started to reform their squares behind d'Hautpoul's men. During this charge, d'Hautpoul was struck by artillery grapeshot and badly wounded. Several of his men managed to carry or drag him back to French lines.|$|E

5|$|Born to an upper-class family, David {{rebelled against}} social {{norms of the}} day. In the 1930s she studied art in Paris, became an actress, and ran off with a married man with whom she sailed in a small boat to Italy, where their boat was confiscated. They reached Greece, where they <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> trapped by the German {{invasion}} in 1941, but escaped to Egypt, where they parted. She then worked for the British government, running a library in Cairo. While there she married, but the marriage was not long-lived.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} word planet, though it had yet to be defined, had become a working term applied only to a small set of objects in the Solar System. After 1992, however, astronomers began to {{discover}} many additional objects beyond the orbit of Neptune, as well as hundreds of objects orbiting other stars. These discoveries not only increased the number of potential planets, but also expanded their variety and peculiarity. Some <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> large enough to be stars, while others were smaller than Earth's moon. These discoveries challenged long-perceived notions of what a planet could be.|$|E
5|$|Chesbro pitched for the Richmond Bluebirds of the Atlantic League from 1897 through 1899. After the 1898 season, he {{was drafted}} by Ned Hanlon of the Baltimore Orioles. However, Hanlon took {{a job with the}} Brooklyn Superbas and the Orioles <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> contracted, {{resulting}} in Chesbro not signing with Baltimore, as Hanlon allowed the option to lapse. He returned to Richmond for the 1899 season.|$|E

While Enchanted topped the DVD sales chart on the week of its release in the United States, narrowly defeating the DVD sales of I Am Legend, the Blu-ray Disc sales of I Am Legend <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> four {{times the number of}} Blu-ray Disc sales of Enchanted. The DVD {{was released}} in United Kingdom and Europe on April 7, 2008, and in Australia on May 21, 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, there <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> 25,000 filling {{stations}} in the UK, of which 10,000 were independents (typically, privately owned and supplied by a major or jobber while using a brand under license). By the end of 1999, the number of filling stations had dropped to 13,700 and to 9,700 {{at the end of}} 2005. In recent years, filling stations have been closing at a rate of 50 per month. Many of the smaller and independent stations have succumbed to competition from out-of-town supermarkets that undercut local enterprises through sheer volume of sales and shared overheads.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, {{the company}} {{informed}} shareholders {{that it had}} failed to meet expectations, that company founder Shaun (Seán) McCarthy was being replaced as CEO, and that operating costs <b>were</b> <b>nearly</b> €1 million per year. After investments totaling nearly €23 million over a ten-year period, in November 2016 the company shut down and laid off its staff, {{due to a lack}} of additional funding to continue operations.|$|E

50|$|Air {{pressure}} variations do {{not affect}} pitch (the ratio {{of pressure to}} air density in an ideal gas is constant. Air pressure and density changes therefore cancel, and {{have no effect on}} the speed of sound; air <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> an ideal gas, so there <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> no effect).|$|R
50|$|Traffic shaping is the {{retiming}} (delaying) of packets (or frames) {{until they}} meet specified bandwidth and or burstiness limits. Since such delays involve queues that <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> always finite and, once full, excess traffic <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> always dropped (discarded), traffic shaping nearly always implies traffic policing as well.|$|R
