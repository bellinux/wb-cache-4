5|$|Little brown bats produce {{calls that}} are high {{intensity}} frequency modulated (FM) and that last {{from less than}} one millisecond (ms) to about 5 ms and have a sweep rate of 80–40kHz, with most of their energy at 45kHz. Bats usually emit 20 calls per second <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b> When pursuing prey, a bat emits 200 calls per second. It also emits a high-pulse repetitive call {{if it wants to}} land.|$|E
5|$|Pied currawongs are vocal birds, calling <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> and at {{all times}} of the day. They are more noisy {{early in the morning}} and in the evening before roosting, as well as before rain. The loud {{distinctive}} call has been translated as Kadow-Kadang or Curra-wong, akin to a croak. They also have a loud, high-pitched, wolf-like whistle, transcribed as Wheeo. The endemic Lord Howe Island subspecies has a distinct, more melodious call.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, {{the western}} jackdaw is unmistakable; its short bill and grey nape are {{distinguishing}} features. From a distance, {{it can be}} confused with a rook (Corvus frugilegus), or <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>flight,</b> with a pigeon or chough. Flying western jackdaws are distinguishable from other corvids by their smaller size, faster and deeper wingbeats and proportionately narrower and less fingered wing tips. They also have shorter, thicker necks, much shorter bills and frequently fly in tighter flocks. They can be distinguished from choughs by their uniformly grey underwings and their black beaks and legs. The western jackdaw is very similar in morphology, behaviour, and calls to the Daurian jackdaw, with which its range overlaps in western Asia. Adults are readily distinguished, since the Daurian has a pied plumage, but immature birds are much more similar, both species having dark plumage and dark eyes. The Daurian tends to be darker, with a less contrasting nape than the Western.|$|E

50|$|The {{ailanthus}} webworm (Atteva aurea) is an {{ermine moth}} now found commonly in the United States. It was formerly known under the scientific name Atteva punctella (see Taxonomy section). This small, very colorful moth resembles a true bug or beetle <b>when</b> not <b>in</b> <b>flight,</b> but <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> it resembles a wasp.|$|R
25|$|In 1945 the {{establishment}} re-opened {{as a research}} centre known as The Explosives Research and Development Establishment, or ERDE. In 1977 it became the Propellants, Explosives and Rocket Motor Establishment, Waltham Abbey, or PERME Waltham Abbey. As a research centre Waltham Abbey was responsible for military propellant and high explosives and expanded into the increasingly significant field of rocket propellants, solid and liquid {{and a range of}} specialised applications, e.g. 'snifters' for altering space vehicles direction <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>flight,</b> cartridges for firing aircraft ejector seats, engine and generator starter cartridges - these applications have been called 'a measured strong shove'. The rocket activity later extended to the production of rocket motors, including work on the Skylark project.|$|E
500|$|Floury bakers are not {{proficient}} fliers {{compared with}} other Australian cicadas. They are slow, with a typical speed of , which rises to around [...] (14km/hr) when they are pursued or provoked. They are only able to generate low aerodynamic power and their flights are relatively short, lasting around 3.4s, {{with an average of}} 3.3 changes in direction. Nor are they adept at landing. The distance at which they react to an approaching observer is moderate, both when stationary and <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
500|$|The high {{metabolic}} {{rates of}} birds during the active {{part of the}} day is supplemented by rest at other times. Sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vigilant sleep, where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye-opening [...] "peeks", allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats. Swifts are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight. It has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
50|$|Yellow-crowned parakeets are 23 cm {{long and}} {{primarily}} bright green. They have a red band fronting their eponymous golden crown. Their wings, <b>when</b> spread <b>in</b> <b>flight,</b> are bluish purple. Their eyes are either orange or red and their bill is grey.|$|R
50|$|The typical form of {{the great}} blue mime mimics the striped blue crow (Euploea mulciber) in both sexes. There also occurs in India a form danisepa which mimics the magpie crow (Euploea radamanthus). Though the great mimes are easily {{distinguished}} <b>when</b> caught, <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> they very closely resemble the mimicked butterflies.|$|R
50|$|This whale {{is capable}} of very fast swimming, {{particularly}} <b>when</b> startled. <b>In</b> <b>flight,</b> it often makes short, low jumps clear of the sea surface, splashing lots of water. Melon-headed whales usually gather in large numbers (at least 100 and possibly as many as 1,000 on rare occasions) and sometimes strand together.|$|R
500|$|<b>When</b> <b>in</b> <b>flight,</b> the {{movements}} of the condor are remarkably graceful. The lack of a large sternum to anchor their correspondingly large flight muscles restricts them to being primarily soarers. The birds flap their wings when taking off from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation they largely glide, sometimes going for miles without a single flap of their wings. They have been known to fly up to speeds of [...] and as high as [...] They prefer to roost on high perches from which they can launch without any major wing-flapping effort. Often, these birds are seen soaring near rock cliffs, using thermals to aid them in keeping aloft.|$|E
500|$|Little brown bats are insectivores, eating moths, wasps, beetles, gnats, mosquitoes, midges and mayflies, among others. [...] Since many {{of their}} {{preferred}} meals are insects with an aquatic life stage, such as mosquitoes, they prefer to roost near water. Brown bats forage near bodies of water and {{move in and out}} of adjacent vegetation. Evening forages are done in groups and above the water. They echolocate to find their prey. They are particularly good at hunting insects when they are at close range and packed together. When hunting, little brown bats capture prey both by gleaning and by catching them in the air. <b>When</b> <b>in</b> <b>flight,</b> bats scoop up the prey with their wings, while prey above water is directly grabbed with the mouth.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{undercarriage}} legs, {{for the first}} time in the Spitfire's life, were fitted with forward-facing torque links. In addition, the leg doors were slightly concave, allowing the undercarriage to sit lower in the wheel wells when retracted: this meant the upper wing skinning was free of the small bulge which had hitherto been necessary to clear the wheels. The wheels themselves were a new strengthened Dunlop AH10019 [...] "four spoke" [...] pattern, replacing the [...] "five spoke" [...] pattern used since the first Mk Is. This revised undercarriage was also fitted on some mid to late Mk IXs and all Mk XVIs. A retractable tailwheel (Dunlop 2184) was fitted, covered by small doors <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b> This also applied to the PR Mk Xs and most PR Mk XIs.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>in</b> gliding <b>flight,</b> {{the upward}} {{aerodynamic}} force on both birds and gliders {{is equal to}} the weight. <b>In</b> gliding <b>flight,</b> no propulsion is used; the energy to counteract the energy loss due to aerodynamic drag is either taken from the potential energy of the bird, resulting <b>in</b> a descending <b>flight,</b> or is replaced by rising air currents ("thermals"), referred to as soaring flight.|$|R
2500|$|Cuvier reiterated his {{previous}} conclusions that the Ptero-Dactyle was a reptile that flew with membranous wings. He also advanced novel speculations about its paleobiology, like that it used the claws on its wings to climb trees and [...] "crawled" [...] quadrupedally <b>when</b> not <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> rather than walking {{on its hind}} limbs.|$|R

50|$|This {{is a small}} dark {{species of}} heron with a dark grey head, back and breast {{contrasting}} with a rufous belly wings and tail. <b>When</b> seen <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> the bright yellow legs and feet contrast with the dark feathers of {{the underside of the}} body. Juveniles are paler and browner, darkening as they mature.|$|R
50|$|The {{pilot and}} {{observer}} sat very far forward {{in order for}} the pilot to have a reasonable field of downward vision for takeoff and landing and so that both he and the observer had a good field of view for spotting surface vessels even <b>when</b> <b>in</b> level <b>flight.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 1966 Asian Games in Bangkok {{proved to}} be a {{disaster}} for Sequeira who was forced to retire <b>when</b> <b>in</b> full <b>flight</b> <b>in</b> the final and had to settle for the award of" [...] the Unlucky Athlete of the Games". The Indian star had obviously been pushed and the organizers perhaps thought fit to compensate him with the most unlikely labelled award.|$|R

50|$|<b>When</b> <b>in</b> <b>flight,</b> {{the main}} or major forces {{acting on the}} {{projectile}} are gravity, drag, and if present, wind; if in powered flight, thrust; and if guided, the forces imparted by the control surfaces.|$|E
50|$|Power {{available}} {{has made}} possible {{to fit in}} the bulky fuselage a high fuel reserve, heavy warhead and a data-link (Mk 2 model) to receive updates, at least once <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> to the target.|$|E

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>in</b> forward <b>flight,</b> the Aeroscraft is {{controlled}} by the aerodynamic control surfaces (vertical stabilizers, empennages and canards); however, the low speed control system aids the pilot in lower wind conditions such as during VTOL and hover. The LSC system acts as a rear thruster to propel the vehicle <b>in</b> forward <b>flight,</b> and permits the thrust to be redirected while in hover to help the vehicle maintain desired positioning and orientation.|$|R
5000|$|Vocalizations are high-pitched and sibilant. There {{are several}} calls; one {{rendered}} as ssii-p is given both <b>when</b> perched and <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b> [...] The song is jerky {{and consists of}} two-to-four-note phrases separated by pauses, tueee-teew, chu-chee-wee-chu, teweee.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of air traffic control and the {{adoption}} of call signs to identify aircraft and their operators, BOAC chose {{the name of their}} now well-known logo, [...] "Speedbird", as their call sign <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E

50|$|Grace {{is pictured}} as a stunningly beautiful, lithe, {{athletic}} woman with large and powerful dragonfly wings on her back. She uses the wings for flight and, {{at least on}} one occasion, as weapons - despite their delicate appearance, the wings {{are strong enough to}} block incoming blows and inflict damage. <b>When</b> not <b>in</b> <b>flight,</b> Grace folds the wings along her back, and they can be concealed by a cloak.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{design for}} a thermal airship using a rigid, but {{foldable}} envelope is described. <b>When</b> not <b>in</b> <b>flight,</b> the envelope can be readily deflated and disassembled for storage and transportation. Operational advantages of the design include hovering/VTOL operation, minimal ground support and facilities (no hanger or mooring mast) as well as rapid transportation, deployment, and recovery.

50|$|There is {{frequent}} confusion {{between the}} carrion crow and the rook, another black corvid found within its range. The beak of the crow is stouter and in consequence looks shorter, and {{whereas in the}} adult rook the nostrils are bare, those of the crow are covered at all ages with bristle-like feathers. As well as this, {{the wings of a}} carrion crow are proportionally shorter and broader than those of the rook <b>when</b> seen <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|R
