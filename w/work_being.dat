5|$|Busch drew on {{contemporary}} parochial and city life, satirizing Catholicism, Philistinism, strict religious morality and bigotry. His comic text was colourful and entertaining, using onomatopoeia, neologisms and other figures of speech, {{and led to}} some <b>work</b> <b>being</b> banned by the authorities.|$|E
5|$|Another {{historic}} bridge {{stands in}} Clarysville, near {{the intersection of}} Alt US40 and MD55. This bridge, which crosses Braddock Run, was built in 1812, with later <b>work</b> <b>being</b> done in 1843. The stone arch bridge, located {{just south of the}} current alignment of Alt US40, was restored in 1976.|$|E

5|$|In September 2016, {{the museum}} {{announced}} the final {{cost of the}} restoration as £4.5 million, having risen from a £4.2m estimate released in summer 2015 due to further <b>work</b> <b>being</b> necessary, {{and the need to}} meet the deadline for the return to service.|$|E
5|$|The Dayton Project {{began in}} 1943 when Monsanto's Charles Allen Thomas was {{recruited}} by the Manhattan Project to coordinate the plutonium purification and production <b>work</b> <b>being</b> carried out at various sites. Scientists at the Los Alamos Laboratory calculated that a plutonium bomb would require a neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources used radioactive polonium and beryllium, so Thomas undertook to produce polonium at Monsanto's laboratories in Dayton.|$|E

5|$|The GWR {{objected to}} the {{reduction}} of the Bakerloo Tube's Paddington connection to a shuttle and the MR {{objected to the}} connection of the two lines, which would be in competition with its line through Kilburn. Parliament rejected the proposed connection and the changes to the NWLR's route and the company's permissions eventually expired without any construction <b>work</b> <b>being</b> carried out. The Bakerloo Tube bill was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|The great {{majority}} of the art in and around the Houses of Parliament is of British origin, due to a policy of acquiring British art for the building.

5|$|The new castle {{was used}} to hold French prisoners taken in at Poitiers in 1357, {{including}} John II, who was held for a considerable ransom.

5|$|The {{official}} re-opening {{took place}} on Wednesday, 8 September 2010, just ten {{and a half months}} after the original campaign was launched, with the building <b>work</b> <b>being</b> completed on schedule. The ceremonial re-opening was performed on-stage by actors Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles, who were starring in the Theatre Royal's own production of The Rivals, Richard Brinsley Sheridan's classic Restoration comedy, set in and around 18th-century Bath. In 2011, the theatre won a British Construction Industry Award Conservation Award.|$|E
5|$|When Champollion {{submitted}} his Coptic {{grammar and}} dictionary {{for publication in}} 1815, it was blocked by Silvestre de Sacy, who {{in addition to his}} personal animosity and envy towards Champollion also resented his Napoleonic affinities.

5|$|A {{survey in}} 1932 {{found that the}} roof was cracked and it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the roof structure was straightened, preserving the medieval trusses where possible, and covered with clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, with the <b>work</b> <b>being</b> funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961. A survey in 2002 found minor repairs were needed to the doors and wall plate.|$|E

5|$|After killing Yeates, Tabak {{attempted}} to cast suspicion {{for the murder}} onto Jefferies after watching a news broadcast about the case while spending the New Year with relatives in the Netherlands. He contacted Avon and Somerset Police {{to tell them that}} Jefferies had been using his car on the night of 17 December, and a CID officer, DC Karen Thomas, was sent to Amsterdam to talk to him. They met at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport on 31 December, where Tabak elaborated on his story, but Thomas grew suspicious of his interest in the forensic <b>work</b> <b>being</b> carried out by the police and because what he said did not concur with a previous statement.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{under the}} PRC State Council was announced on 16 November, {{the day after}} the fire, to determine the cause of the blaze. A preliminary finding by investigators concluded that sparks from welding <b>work</b> <b>being</b> done on the building, undertaken by unlicensed welders, ignited scaffolding around the structure, which led to the apartments' destruction. The municipal government also placed the blame on illegal multi-layered subcontracting, and detained four managers from several construction companies. In all, sixteen individuals have been arrested in connection to the fire, as well as four others accused of being unlicensed welders.|$|E
5|$|Delays {{in finding}} the funding, {{opposition}} from the two mainline companies that the line was intended to connect, and World War I, led {{to the start of}} construction <b>work</b> <b>being</b> delayed until 1927. The line was completed and opened in January 1930, although the planned extension of the DR was not implemented and the service was provided by the Southern Railway. The opening of the line stimulated residential development as planned, but competition from the London Underground's City and South London Railway, which had its terminus at Morden, meant that the line did not achieve the hoped-for passenger numbers.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the first}} Bayreuth Festival, Wagner {{began work on}} Parsifal, his final opera. The {{composition}} took four years, much of which Wagner spent in Italy for health reasons. From 1876 to 1878 Wagner also embarked on {{the last of his}} documented emotional liaisons, this time with Judith Gautier, whom he had met at the 1876 Festival. Wagner was also much troubled by problems of financing Parsifal, and by the prospect of the <b>work</b> <b>being</b> performed by other theatres than Bayreuth. He was once again assisted by the liberality of King Ludwig, but was still forced by his personal financial situation in 1877 to sell the rights of several of his unpublished works (including the Siegfried Idyll) to the publisher Schott.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{fears of}} {{invasion}} after 1544 prompted further <b>work</b> <b>being</b> {{carried out on}} the blockhouse by Sir Richard Lee, a prominent military engineer, although peace was declared the following year. It is uncertain exactly what shape the fort took; archaeological investigations suggest that it was probably D-shaped, two storeys tall, with a circular bastion facing the river; {{there would have been}} battery positions {{on either side of the}} main defences, and a more modern, angular bastion was added later on the landwards side. By 1546 the King's accountants estimated that £1,072 had been spent on building and developing the fortification.|$|E
5|$|Groves and Conant {{were hoping}} to harness Thomas's {{industrial}} expertise {{for the benefit of}} the project. They offered him a post as a deputy to Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, but he did not wish to move his family or give up his responsibilities at Monsanto. Instead he accepted the role of coordinating the plutonium purification and production <b>work</b> <b>being</b> carried out at Los Alamos, the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, and Ames Laboratory in Iowa. Chemistry and metallurgy at Los Alamos would be led by the youthful Joseph W. Kennedy.|$|E
