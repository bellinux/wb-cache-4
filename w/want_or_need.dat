According to the traditional account, she gave birth to a son, named Rāhula. Siddhartha is said to have spent 29 years as a prince in Kapilavastu. Although his father ensured that Siddhartha was provided with everything he could <b>want</b> <b>or</b> <b>need,</b> Buddhist scriptures say that the future Buddha felt that material wealth was not life's ultimate goal.|$|E
25|$|The {{built-in}} ROM-resident BBC BASIC {{programming language}} interpreter realised the system's educational emphasis and was key to its success; {{not only was}} it the most comprehensive BASIC compared to other contemporary implementations but it ran very efficiently and was therefore fast. Advanced programs could be written without resorting to non-structured programming or machine code (necessary with many competing computers). Should one <b>want</b> <b>or</b> <b>need</b> to do some assembly programming, BBC BASIC featured a built-in assembler that allowed a very easy mixture of BBC BASIC and assembler for whatever processor BBC BASIC was operating on.|$|E

25|$|The Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity (MASGD) in the United States {{began on}} January 23, 2013. It supports, {{empowers}} and connects LGBTQ Muslims. It aims “to increase {{the acceptance of}} gender and sexual diversity within Muslim communities.” On June 20, 2016, an interview with Mirna Haidar (a member of the MASGD’s steering committee) was published in The Washington Post. She described the MASGD as supporting “LGBT Muslims who <b>want</b> <b>or</b> <b>need</b> to embrace both their sexual and religious identities.” Haidar said that the support the MASGD provides is needed because {{a person who is}} “Muslim and queer “ faces “two different systems of oppression”: Islamophobia and homophobia.|$|E
25|$|Children with {{persistent}} GID {{are characterized}} by more extreme gender dysphoria in childhood than children with desisting gender dysphoria. Some (but not all) gender diverse / gender independent / gender fluid youth will <b>want</b> <b>or</b> <b>need</b> to transition, which may involve social transition (changing dress, name, pronoun), and, for older youth and adolescents, medical transition (hormonal and surgical intervention). Treatment may {{take the form of}} puberty blockers such as Lupron Depot or Leuprolide Acetate, or cross-sex hormones (i.e., administering estrogen to an assigned male at birth or testosterone to an assigned female at birth), or surgery (i.e., mastectomies, salphingo-oophorectomies/hysterectomy, the creation of a neophallus in female-to-male transsexuals, orchiectomies, breast augmentation, facial feminization surgery, the creation of a neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals), with the aim of bringing one’s physical body in line with their felt gender. The ability to transition (socially and medically) are sometimes needed in the treatment of gender dysphoria.|$|E
500|$|Japan employs both analog {{and digital}} broadcasting, but by July 2011 all {{television}} broadcasting {{is to be}} digital. Tokyo Tower is not a reliable broadcasting antenna for completely digital broadcasting because the tower is not tall enough to transmit the higher frequency waves to areas surrounded by forests or high-rise buildings. As an alternative, a new 634-metre-tall (2,080ft) tower called the Tokyo Skytree was opened in 2012. To make Tokyo Tower more appealing to NHK and five other commercial broadcasters who plan to move their transmitting stations to the new tower, Nihon Denpatō officials drafted a plan to extend its digital broadcasting antenna by 80to100metres {{at a cost of}} approximately ¥4billion (US$50 million). Because these plans have not been realized, Tokyo Tower is expected to stop transmitting digital TV radio waves with the exception of Open University of Japan, who will continue to broadcast through the tower. FM radio stations will also continue to use the tower for broadcasting in the Tokyo area. Masahiro Kawada, the tower's planning director, also pointed out the possibility of the tower becoming a backup for the Tokyo Skytree, depending on what the TV broadcasters <b>want</b> <b>or</b> <b>need.</b>|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of her {{compilation}} album Something to Remember (1995), Madonna started taking vocal lessons in preparation {{for her role in}} Evita (1996). She also gave birth to her daughter, Lourdes, the same year. These events inspired a period of introspection. [...] "That was a big catalyst for me. It took me on a search for answers to questions I'd never asked myself before," [...] she said to Q magazine, in 2002. During the same period, she embraced Kabbalah and started studying Hinduism and yoga, all of which helped her [...] "step outside [...] and see the world from a different perspective." [...] Madonna felt that there was a [...] "whole piece" [...] of her voice left unused, which she decided to utilize for the album. By May 1997, Madonna had started writing songs for the album. She began collaborating with Babyface, who had first worked with her on her previous album Bedtime Stories. The two wrote a couple of songs together before Madonna decided the collaborations were not going in the musical direction she wanted for the album. According to Babyface, the songs [...] "had a 'Take a Bow-ish' kind of vibe, and Madonna didn't <b>want,</b> <b>or</b> <b>need,</b> to repeat herself." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 13, 2009, {{during the}} 2009 MTV Video Music Awards while Taylor Swift was {{accepting}} her award for Best Female Video for [...] "You Belong with Me", West went {{on stage and}} grabbed the microphone to proclaim that Beyoncé's video for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", nominated for the same award, was [...] "one of the best videos of all time". He was subsequently removed from {{the remainder of the}} show for his actions. When Beyoncé later won the award for Best Video of the Year for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", she called Swift up on stage so that she could finish her acceptance speech. West was criticized by various celebrities for the outburst, and by President Barack Obama, who called West a [...] "jackass". In addition, West's VMA disruption sparked a large influx of Internet photo memes with blogs, forums and [...] "tweets" [...] with the [...] "Let you finish" [...] photo-jokes. He posted a Tweet soon after the event where he stated, [...] "Everybody wanna booooo me but I'm a fan of real pop culture... I'm not crazy y'all, I'm just real." [...] He then posted two apologies for the outburst on his personal blog; one {{on the night of the}} incident, and the other the following day, when he also apologized during an appearance on The Jay Leno Show. After Swift appeared on The View two days after the outburst, partly to discuss the matter, West called her to apologize personally. Swift said she accepted his apology. In September 2010, West wrote a series of apologetic tweets addressed to Swift including [...] "Beyonce didn't need that. MTV didn't need that and Taylor and her family friends and fans definitely didn't <b>want</b> <b>or</b> <b>need</b> that" [...] and concluding with [...] "I'm sorry Taylor." [...] He also revealed he had written a song for Swift and if she did not accept the song, he would perform it himself. However, on November 8, 2010, in an interview with a Minnesota radio station, he seemed to recant his past apologies by attempting to describe the act at the 2009 awards show as [...] "selfless" [...] and downgrade the perception of disrespect it created.|$|E
2500|$|The {{degree of}} {{advancement}} Andrews achieved {{in her career}} as a writer, textbook author, and teacher would have been unthinkable {{had it not been for}} the collapse of her beloved antebellum estate in Washington, Georgia. The question then becomes whether she was motivated to advance her career and assert her independence out of <b>want</b> <b>or</b> <b>need.</b> A good illustration of her often contradictory nature was her desire to remain unmarried for life. This is apparent in her first novel A Family Secret (1876) which creates a vivid image of the role of women in the post war South. She remarks upon the misery inherent in marrying for money and writes at one point [...] "Oh, the slavery it is to be a woman and not a fool." [...] At the same time, Andrews believed that the domestic wife and mother was the only acceptable role for women in Southern society, and she considered teaching [...] "a mental tread-mill, a dull road traveled over and over requiring only patience." [...] On the surface, her ideas seem to be in direct conflict with her accomplishments as a teacher and scholar, but over time she seems to have become more accepting [...] that she could not rescue her beloved antebellum society. As she observed in the introduction to her Wartime Journal that “In the lifetime of a single generation the people of the South have been called upon to pass through changes that the rest of the world has taken centuries to accomplish” she had been assuming a new role in an era where society was experiencing rapid economic and social changes.|$|E
