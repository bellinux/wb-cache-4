5|$|Loss {{of hybrid}} vigour occurs and {{phenotype}} varies greatly in subsequent generations if F1 hybrids are inter-bred or backcrossed with animals genetically {{similar to the}} F1 parent. Inter-bred F1 hybrids will produce progeny that can be either heterozygous for each gene variant, homozygous for one gene variant, or homozygous for the other gene variant. When one of the variants has a large effect on a trait, for example the effect of myostatin variants on muscularity, larger phenotypic variation will occur among the progeny. Backcross progeny <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> phenotypic variation and comprise animals that are either heterozygous for each gene variant or homozygous for the variant found in the original F1 backcross parent.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E

25|$|Together, the Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) act as {{a carbon}} sink, {{absorbing}} atmospheric carbon dioxide and storing it in solution. If the SAMW temperature increases {{as a result of}} climate change, the SAMW <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> capacity to store dissolved carbon dioxide. Research using a computerized climate system model suggests that if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration were to increase to 860 ppm by the year 2100 (roughly double today's concentration), the SAMW will decrease in density and salinity. The resulting reductions in the subduction and transport capacity of SAMW and AAIW water masses could potentially decrease the absorption and storage of CO2 in the Southern Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The {{ratio of}} sugars, acids and {{phenolics}} to {{water is a}} key determination of how well a wine can age. The less water in the grapes prior to harvest, the more likely the resulting wine will have some aging potential. Grape variety, climate, vintage and viticultural practice come into play here. Grape varieties with thicker skins, from a dry growing season where little irrigation was used and yields were kept low <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> water and a higher ratio of sugar, acids and phenolics. The process of making Eisweins, where water {{is removed from the}} grape during pressing as frozen ice crystals, has a similar effect of decreasing the amount of water and increasing aging potential.|$|E
25|$|Rosés can be {{produced}} {{in a variety of}} ways with the most common method being early pressing of red grape varieties after a very short period, usually 12–24 hours, of skin-contact (maceration). During maceration, phenolics such as the anthocyanins and tannins that contribute to color as well as many flavor components are leached from the skins, seeds and any stems left in contact with the must. In addition to adding color and flavor, these phenolics also serve as antioxidants, protecting the wine from degradation of oxygen exposure. While red wines will often have maceration last several days to even several weeks, the very limited maceration of rosés means that these wines <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> stable color, potential flavor components and oxygen protection. This contributes to wines with shorter shelf-life that are meant to be consumed soon after release.|$|E
60|$|We can, perhaps, {{on these}} views, {{understand}} some facts {{which will be}} again alluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution; for instance, that the productions of the smaller continent of Australia have formerly yielded, and apparently are now yielding, before those of the larger Europaeo-Asiatic area. Thus, also, it is that continental productions have everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands. On a small island, the race for life <b>will</b> <b>have</b> been <b>less</b> severe, and there <b>will</b> <b>have</b> been <b>less</b> modification and less extermination. Hence, perhaps, it comes that the flora of Madeira, according to Oswald Heer, resembles the extinct tertiary flora of Europe. All fresh-water basins, taken together, make a small area {{compared with that of}} the sea or of the land; and, consequently, the competition between fresh-water productions <b>will</b> <b>have</b> been <b>less</b> severe than elsewhere; new forms <b>will</b> <b>have</b> been more slowly formed, and old forms more slowly exterminated.

These anomalous forms may almost be called living fossils; they have endured to the present day, from having inhabited a confined area, and from having thus been exposed to less severe competition.|$|R

25|$|Many {{long-term}} {{problems with}} hip replacements {{are the result}} of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.|$|E
500|$|Preparations {{for a new}} Benfica season {{started in}} late-May 2000. Manager Jupp Heynckes {{remained}} for a second year, with more control this time in building up the squad. His choices caused immediate controversy, the biggest being the release of Benfica veteran João Pinto. Pinto was the incumbent team captain and the longest-serving player, who had been at Benfica since the 1992–93 season. José Manuel Delgado of Record predicted a difficult season for the German manager: [...] "...he <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> tolerance from the fans than that offered to Artur Jorge (three match days), or Manuel José (four match days)..." [...] He forwent internationals like Paulo Bento and Amaral, but indulged on Marchena, Meira and Van Hooijdonk.
