This dissension is indicative of the disparate nature of Ibrahim's supporters. The Alid cause was fractured into several competing groups with different political objectives, and Ibrahim represented the Hasanid branch only. The Husaynids refused to take part in an uprising, while Ibrahim quarrelled with the Zaydi branch on everything from political objectives and leadership to the tactics to be followed or the provisioning of their troops. Elsewhere, support for the uprising was cautious and most Alid supporters adopted a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude,</b> limiting themselves to verbal support or contributions of money.|$|E

5000|$|Russell Humphreys and John Hartnett {{have both}} been criticized by {{members of their own}} ranks, to which both have {{submitted}} rebuttals. In his remarks, Hartnett says he is [...] "under no illusion" [...] and is well aware that his cosmology uses an [...] "unknown" [...] (namely, the introduction of a fifth spacetime dimension) to help solve another [...] "unknown" [...] - dark matter. When challenged about a possible horizon problem in his model, Hartnett deferred to an inability to understand the problem posed by his critic and did not oblige an answer. Humphreys' critic pointed out that the well-known equation for gravitational redshift/blueshift may countermand his model’s efforts to achieve today’s observed redshift from cosmic sources, to which Humphreys countered by terming the gravitational redshift equation a “flawed equation” and became dismissive in his remarks about any potential applicability to his model. Since Humphreys relies heavily on the anomalous sunward acceleration of the Pioneer spacecraft to underscore a fundamental component of his cosmology, his critic was obliged to cite the findings of researchers from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California who attributed the apparent anomaly to the thermal recoil force acting on the spacecraft. In response, Humphreys adopted a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In foreign affairs, the Tornaco {{government}} had to face a profound crisis from 1866 to 1867, which threatened Luxembourg's independence. The German Confederation was dissolved after the Austro-Prussian war of 1866. Although Luxembourg did not join the new North German Confederation formed by Prussia, the latter continued to maintain a garrison in the fortress of Luxembourg. At the same time, France now demanded a territorial compensation for having stayed neutral during the conflict. Napoleon III proposed to the King-Grand Duke to purchase the Grand Duchy for 5 million francs. William III accepted, but the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck was staunchly opposed. To resolve this crisis in which Napoleon III risked losing face, the great powers came together in London. They finally agreed that Prussia would withdraw its garrison, the fortress would be demolished, and the Grand Duchy would become neutral in perpetuity. France would renounce its territorial claims. The Tornaco {{government had}} observed a strict neutrality during the Austro-Prussian war. During the negotiations in London, the Luxembourgish delegates had adopted a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude,</b> almost one of resignation. The government was mainly concerned with {{the costs of the}} impending demolition of the fortifications, whereas the city council of Luxembourg was anxious to guarantee the revenues of the city's businesses and shops, which would suffer from the departure of the garrison.|$|E

Overall, logistics service providers seem to have a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude</b> towards sustainability where food companies are more proactive following market demands for more sustainable products...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} positive and negative social interactions experienced by infertile Japanese women. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 infertile women. The informants were asked about their experiences of positive (helpful) and negative (unhelpful) social interactions with members of their social networks, excluding their partners, with regard to their infertility. RESULTS: Nine posi-tive social interaction categories were clarified, including listening closely to the distress experienced in infertility and treatment, not prying or interfering with the topic of children and respecting the women’s decision regarding fertility treatment and taking a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude.</b> Nine negative social interaction categories were also identified, including prying with the topic of children, showing a negative attitude toward infertility or reproductive medicine, being criticized for not having children and avoiding contact. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings systematically and qualitatively determined the positive and negative social interactions experienced by infertile Japanese women within their social networks. This is essential knowledge for medical staff to counsel patients and their family members. To form a supportive social environment for infertile women, we recommend practical measures for health workers and helpful advice with regard to interactions between infertile women and their social networks...|$|E
40|$|Confronted with {{a looming}} crisis of {{ecological}} deprivation and global resource depletion, the political response of most liberal regimes {{has been a}} complacent <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude,</b> at best combined with piecemeal environmental reforms and moral support for international initiatives such as the Kyoto Treaty. Meanwhile, the theoretical discourse on sustainability seems to be oscillating between the unsound extremes of deep-green ecologism {{on one hand and}} neo-classical hopes of infinite growth on the other. This paper takes on the aviation industry – perhaps the most extreme exponent of the fossil economy – in an attempt to show that radical sustainable policies {{do not have to be}} as politically unpleasant as many pro-market liberals may think. By reconciling the politics of scarcity with technological optimism, the paper explores how a new taxation scheme could be used to drive innovation while offering a path to sustainability that goes beyond just curbing consumption. It is concluded that such a policy orientation would allow social democratic and liberal parties to challenge the prevailing pessimistic discourse on sustainability at the same time as they remain consistent with their own historical roots...|$|E
40|$|Information {{asymmetry}} {{in building}} quality {{has resulted in}} under-investment in building maintenance, which has a consequential negative impact on sustainable urban development. Devising and publicizing a building classification system can reveal “hidden” {{information to the public}} and lessen the problem of information asymmetry. However, if such a system is purely voluntary, property owners will normally adopt a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude</b> in view of the high cost of assessment and uncertainty of realizing any benefits. This will hamper the effectiveness of a building classification system. This paper explores the possibility of “jump-starting” a voluntary system by synthesizing the resources of various stakeholders. First, universities can make use of their research capacity to develop an assessment scheme. Second, the government can make use of the building information it possesses to provide data for assessments. Third, private or community donations can be used as initial funding to operate the classification system. Once the system is jump-started, with its benefits proven, it will become self sustainable by a user pays mechanism. It is believed that the disclosure of more information on the quality of buildings on the market will lead to a solution that ensures a net welfare gain, and thus a more sustainable environment for society. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Orchiopexy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} used surgical procedures for cryptorchidism and has been shown to have a beneficial effect on fertility. However, orchiopexy, especially for bilateral cryptorchidism, does not always guarantee subsequent fertility and paternity. Compared with a control group, paternity was significantly compromised in men with previous bilateral, but not unilateral cryptorchidism. Recent techniques of assisted reproductive technology, especially testicular sperm extraction with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (TESE-ICSI), have brought revolutionary changes in clinical therapy for infertiliy. If spermatozoa exists in testis of infertile men, logically there is a possibility of paternity. However, our study demonstrated that about 20 % of pubertal boys who had had orchiopexy, were predicted to have lost their future paternity potential even if TESE-ICSI were conducted, because they were predicted to have no spermatozoa in the testis. To prevent or reverse the damage of spermatogenesis at prepuberty or puberty, we should not take a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude</b> but should consider a countermeasure for the pubertal boys who had had bilateral orchiopexy in childhood, especially when the serum follicle stimulating hormone level is elevated and testicular volume is lowered, before paternity is lost. In this review, we discuss the potential approaches including epidermal growth facter therapy, gene therapy and stem-cell therapy for cryptorchid patients in the future...|$|E

The Norwegian context {{is the point of}} departure, but with clear references to relevant processes at the European level. At the EU level there is an overall drive towards establishing common infrastructure for electricity distribution across borders, but no concrete measures concerning a meshed grid. At the Norwegian level, there is currently no clear commitment towards a North Sea Grid development. Norwegian authorities' approach to off-shore infrastructure, and related processes in the EU and NSCOGI, has thus far been characterized by a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude.</b> The Norwegian approach is characterized by socio-economic perspectives, with limited attention towards possible long-term and cross-sectoral effects; such as innovation, and new industrial possibilities. Off-shore wind power development could constitute a 'proxy', and licensing procedures for such installations have been in place for some years, but without any economic incentives. Furthermore, interconnector projects between Norway, the UK and Germany could be considered as potential steppingstones towards a meshed grid. However, harmonization between different national licensing systems stands out as challenging, and there is limited experience of coordinating the licensing of crossborder projects. Closely related to this is the question of public acceptance, including the possible need for on-shore grid upgrading which can trigger local resistance...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{last twenty}} years have seen an {{enormous}} {{increase in the number}} of long-term survivors of cancer, and it has been suggested that the follow-up care of these patients should be shifted from secondary to primary care, with general practitioners having a coordinating role. We investigated the opinions of primary care professionals and in this article evaluated whether general practitioners are ready for this central role. Method: The opinions of 53 primary care professionals, including 15 general practitioners, were investigated in the period 2008 - 2010. In-depth interviews were held with 35 participants (11 general practitioners); the other 18 participants (4 general practitioners) took part in a focus group discussion. Results: General practitioners preferably approach patients with treated cancer as ‘normal’ patients with chronic disorders. They also prefer to harness the patient’s strengths and abilities and tend not to provide structured follow-up care or to refer the patient to other primary care professionals. Conclusion: After treatment, patients with cancer often have not only physical disabilities but also specific emotional and social problems. Good follow-up care thus requires that general practitioners actively maintain their relationship with the patient, take the initiative to raise and discuss patient’s problems, and proactively organize help and care. This is in sharp contrast to the ‘demand-driven’ approach of many general practitioners, who often adopt a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude.</b> (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|EC Agricultural Commissioner Ray MacSharry {{surprised}} many {{by suggesting}} dramatic reductions in EC commodity prices, which would in effect recouple {{much of its}} agriculture with world prices. In July, all twelve EC agriculture ministers accepted the MacSharry proposal {{as the basis for}} negotiation. The entire package will be voted on in October 1991, and the general consensus is that some version of the MacSharry proposal will be adopted at that time. There exists a real possibility, therefore, that the European Community will eventually find an agricultural price reform proposal that is acceptable to the United States and other GATT participants. Should this occur, it will inevitably be in the closing moments of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations. One can then imagine a scenario in which the South Korean or Japanese negotiators are forced to decide between accepting a proposal that is politically unacceptable at home or being blamed for the failure of the GATT round.

40|$|The {{most common}} causes for {{surgical}} procedures involving peripheral nerves are injuries and carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel decompression surgery consists in cutting the transverse carpal ligament thereby releasing the nerve entrapped by this ligament. Following the procedure, pain symptoms should subside immediately. If the patient complains about pain {{that does not}} subside with time, it is necessary to conduct a diagnostic process. Until recently, electrophysiological tests, which determine the ability to conduct impulses, have been the gold standard. In the recent years, however, ultrasound examinations with the use of high-frequency transducers, which precisely specify the cause of postoperative complications, have been used {{more and more often}} as the first choice examination. Such an examination also enables assessment of the adjacent tissues which may be the source of persisting symptoms. This facilitates designing proper treatment. In the case of posttraumatic changes in the nerves, the neurological status (the return of sensation and motor function of the muscles innervated by a given nerve trunk) depends on the time from the procedure since nerve tissue regenerates gradually. If the healing process is incorrect, “a neuroma-in-continuity” may form when the regenerate does not penetrate to the peripheral stump and forms a chaotic scar at the reconstruction level. An ultrasound examination enables assessment of the nerve suturing site in terms of nerve trunk continuity restoration, identification of neuromas and control of their growth. Moreover, it enables adhesions to be diagnosed. Based on the interview, clinical examination as well as neurophysiological and ultrasound examinations in posttraumatic or postoperative neuropathies, one can precisely plan the management, i. e. decide whether a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude</b> should be assumed or a surgical procedure should be conducted as soon as possible...|$|E

The management can be surgical, medical and observational. Surgery can be performed in symptomatic patients with hemodynamic instability and clinical contraindications to Methotrexate therapy. Available surgical options for tubal pregnancy are: conservative treatment (salpingotomy), intermediate surgery (partial salpingectomy), and radical treatment (salpingectomy), usually performed by laparoscopy. Medical treatment by Methotrexate can be performed in stable, asymptomatic patient, with β-hCG values ≤ 3000 - 5000 mIU/mL and without ultrasonographic evidence of haemoperitoneum or fetal cardiac activity.

The energy function contains three distinct terms, namely, the ferromagnetic two-body interaction term (endogenous information), random field term as external information (exogenous news), and chemical potential term which controls the number of traders who are watching the market calmly at the instance. We specify the details of the model system from the past financial market data to determine the conjugate hyper-parameters and draw each parameter flow as a function of time-step. Especially we will examine to what extent one can characterize the crisis by means of a brand-new order parameter [...] - `turnover' [...] - which is defined as the number of active traders who post their decisions $S_{i}= 1,- 1 $, instead of $S_{i}= 0 $.

40|$|To {{examine the}} nature of the trust that Turkish and Arabic ethnic {{minority}} patients suffering from cancer have in their oncologist, and to explore how this trust is established. We interviewed 9 cancer patients with Turkish and Arabic backgrounds about the trust they have in their oncologist. Semi-structured qualitative interviews. We interviewed 9 cancer patients with Turkish and Arabic backgrounds about the trust they have in their oncologist. The trust that these patients have in their oncologist seemed to evolve gradually over time. According to the patients, three specific elements seemed to promote trust. Firstly, patients attached importance to a strongly proactive physician approach, even in the palliative phase when treatment was no longer indicated. A <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude</b> was perceived by patients as a lack of willingness to help, and was detrimental to their trust. Secondly, patients indicated that they needed their oncologist to reassure them and avoided discussing depressing topics, so that they would not give up hope. Finally, the oncologist's non-verbal communication, particularly his or her facial expression, contributed to patients' trust. Among these Turkish and Arabic ethnic minority cancer patients, trust in the physician appeared not to be self-evident, and might to some extent need to be 'earned' by oncologists. Because of these patients' great need for a proactive attitude, it is desirable that oncologists clearly explain their motivation when choosing for a possibly less active approach. In order to preserve hope, it is important that oncologists discover exactly what their patients' information needs are. The results of this explorative, small-scale study may help physicians to optimise the trust that Turkish and Arabic ethnic minority patients have in the...|$|E
40|$|The European Forecasting Network (EFN) is a {{research}} group of European institutions, founded in 2001 {{under the auspices of}} the European Commission. · High growth dynamics and demand coming from emerging markets will slow only modestly in the rest of 2011 and in 2012, but the intensification of the financial turmoil and the doubts about the ability of the European Union to contain the consequences of possible defaults will hamper world economic growth considerably in our forecasting horizon. · For the euro area, we expect GDP to grow by around 1. 6 % in 2011 and 0. 8 % in 2012, not enough to bring the unemployment rate back below 10 % and substantially less for 2012 than in our Summer report. Many private households and firms will adopt a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude</b> while, to restore confidence in the euro area sovereign debt, fiscal policy will become even more restrictive. · Our industrial production forecast has also been revised downwards with respect to the Summer report, now we expect a growth rate of 3. 7 % in 2011 and 1. 6 % in 2012, mostly due to the relative deterioration of the euro area external demand. · Because of energy prices and aggregate demand moderation, our inflation forecasts for 2011 and 2012 are reduced to 2. 6 % and 1. 3 % respectively. · Lower inflation and growth forecasts, combined with the intensification of the financial turmoil and the announced restrictive fiscal policy in many euro area countries, make us suggest that the next interest rate decision of the ECB should be a fast and substantial cut, notwithstanding the September value for HICP inflation...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{treatment}} practice of chronic tennis elbow (TE) among general practitioners (GPs) and physiotherapists (PTs), {{the effects of}} a simple, graded home exercise regime versus expectation, the effects of eccentric versus concentric exercise, and the involvement of the substance P – NK 1 receptor system in the peripheral, painful tissue of chronic TE patients by positron emission tomography (PET). Materials and methods: A postal survey regarding therapeutic methods used in patients with chronic TE was sent to 129 GPs and 77 PTs, 81 subjects with chronic TE were randomly and blindly assigned to either an exercise group or a wait list group, 120 subjects were randomly assigned to either eccentric or concentric exercise and ten subjects were examined by PET and the NK 1 specific radioligand [11 C]GR 205171. Results: High proportions of GPs and PTs used ergonomic counselling and stretching in the treatment of chronic TE. The majority of GPs prescribed passive anti-inflammatory measures such as sick leave and anti-inflammatory medication. Many PTs prescribed dynamic, particularly eccentric, exercise. Graded dynamic exercise according to a simple low-cost protocol, has better effect on pain than a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude.</b> Adjusted for outcome affecting variables, eccentric graded exercise has quicker effect than concentric graded exercise. During PET scan with the NK 1 specific radioligand [11 C]GR 205171, voxel volume and signal intensity of this volume was significantly higher in the affected than the unaffected arm in subjects with unilateral chronic TE. Conclusions: GPs and PTs used many treatments to a similar extent but differed regarding the use of exercise. Chronic TE responds favourably to graded dynamic exercise aimed specifically at the painful tissue. The exercise should stress the eccentric work phase. The substance P – NK 1 receptor system seems to play a part in the peripheral, painful tissue of a chronic, soft tissue pain condition such as chronic TE. Epi-...|$|E
40|$|Internet Protocol Telephony (IPT), {{also known}} as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), has evolved from a niche {{technology}} to one that is adopted fairly well in developed countries. The aim of this research report {{was to determine whether}} IPT will also be a success in the Republic of South Africa, which is one of many developing countries. The technology was analysed and it was found that cost reduction, increased productivity and enhanced applications were the most valuable benefits the technology could offer. Particular interesting impediments of the technology were discovered and it was found that there existed both hard issues like security and quality problems, as well as softer issues like internal politics, that could hinder the global success of the technology. The adoption rate of South Africa was compared to that of industrial countries and it was found that South African organisations overall posed a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>attitude</b> towards IPT. Various implementation models were discussed and it was found that a hybrid approach would be the most viable option for local organisations. The South African environment were analysed and it was discovered that the biggest obstacle for success in South Africa was the regulatory environment. But it was also found that the environment would soon change and that competitors, including Black Economic Empowerment companies, should use the opportunities available. Social factors like HIV/AIDS and theft as well as economic factors like the exchange rate could hamper the competitiveness of local companies using IPT. IPT technology can only be a success in South Africa if it is intensely supported by Government, implemented in the correct manner and adopted aggressively by the local market.
