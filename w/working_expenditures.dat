40|$|The {{problem of}} working time {{standardization}} attracts {{the attention of}} the managers of Latvian sewing enterprises since it is the main condition to reduce working time consumption. Many sewing companies are forced to produce goods in small series constantly changing and expanding the assortment.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if the amount of weight an employee was required to lift per day would affect the capabilities of that employee in terms of anthropometrics, aerobic capacity, dynamic strength and grip strength. In addition, this research was designed to compare worker capabilities with tasks regularly required in the work environment. Data was gathered on 442 (403 male, 39 female) experienced manual material handlers from a variety of companies with the intent of determining physical condition. Sample size varied among measures with data collected on working anthropometrics, oxygen consumption, dynamic strength, and grip strength. The participants were then divided into five groups to determine the effects of varying job demands. Both descriptive statistics and a single factor ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) were used to evaluate these results. A Tukey's test was used to compare the differences among means. Findings indicated that there was indeed a difference related to job demand. Statistically significant results were found for aerobic capacity, body weight, and age with employees in the jobs with lowest demand tending to be heavier, older and less aerobically fit. The percentage of females also declined as the demand of the job increased. In addition, results showed that a large percentage of workers were exceeding suggested values for aerobic capacity based on <b>working</b> energy <b>expenditure.</b> In response to these findings, suggestions were made: 1) to incorporate fitness programs into the regular work environment, 2) to determine appropriate values for acceptable <b>working</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> and 3) to provide improved information relating to effects of increased frequency on cardiovascular and biomechanical concerns.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the welfare costs of inflation {{in the presence}} of financial market frictions.

These costs are reduced, but remain above those computed by Cooley and Hansen, when a financial intermediary is introduced that engages in asset transformation by creating liquid, interest-bearing deposit accounts and using the proceeds to finance working capital loans to firms. Explicitly modeling home production activities tends to reduce the distortion that inflation induces in employment and market output, but results in higher estimates of the welfare losses. Both of these effects are magnified when households must also finance their gross investment in home capital by borrowing from the financial intermediary.

40|$|Poverty {{is still}} {{a major problem in}} Pakistan. Worse, the {{excellent}} progress made in poverty reduction in the 1970 s and 1980 s has been reversed in the 1990 s. That is the bad news. The good news is that Pakistan is unusually well placed to return to rapid reduction in poverty. We have long known that agricultural growth is closely related to poverty reduction. Recent studies by Peter Timmer and by Martin Ravallion and their colleagues provide massive statistical evidence of this relationship. Rural growth and agricultural growth have a major effect on poverty reduction; urban growth and manufacturing growth do not. At first glance that is strange because farmers are not the poorest rural people, and the direct benefits from agricultural growth are distributed roughly proportionately to size of landholding. The poor in rural areas are heavily concentrated in the rural non-farm sector. They produce non-tradable goods and services. That is, local demand is essential to their growth. It is rising agricultural incomes that provide that growth in local demand. Thus, agriculture’s massive impact on poverty is indirect, <b>working</b> through <b>expenditures</b> on the rural non-farm sector. The bulk of those expenditures are for consumption goods...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the incidence and welfare costs of inflation {{in the presence}} of financial market frictions and home production. The results suggest that financing constraints on firms' <b>working</b> capital <b>expenditures</b> significantly increase the welfare costs relative to the standard Cooley-Hansen (1989) cash-in-advance framework. These costs are reduced, but remain above those computed by Cooley and Hansen, when a financial intermediary is introduced that engages in asset transformation by creating liquid, interest-bearing deposit accounts and uses the proceeds to finance working capital loans to firms. Explicitly modeling home production activities tends to exacerbate the distortions that inflation induces in employment and market output to a considerable degree, and suggests that welfare costs of anticipated inflation may be substantially higher than previous estimates. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the magnitude of the market response to inflation and the attendant welfare costs of inflation depend strongly on the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor in home production, and to a much lesser degree on the elasticity of substitution between home and market consumption. When households must also finance their gross investment in home capital by borrowing from the financial intermediary, home production is indirectly taxed by inflation. As a result of this credit friction, resources thus tend to move back into the market, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of inflation on employment and output, while further increasing the welfare losses.

40|$|China’s high {{corporate}} {{savings rate}} is commonly {{claimed to be}} a key driver for the country’s large current account surplus. The mainstream explanation for high corporate savings is a combination of windfall profits in state-owned firms, especially in resource sectors, and mis-governance of state-owned firms represented by their low dividend payout. The paper casts doubt on these views by comparing the savings of 1557 Chinese listed firms with those of 29330 listed firms from 51 other countries over 2002 - 07. First, Chinese firms do not have a significantly higher savings rate (as a share of total assets) than the global average because corporations in most countries have a high savings rate.

40|$|A {{decision}} support system to evaluate and formulate business portfolio strategies is proposed. Strategies are {{expressed in terms of}} market share objectives to be achieved in each of the N business units in the portfolio. STRATPORT evaluates a strategy in terms of the net present value of its after-tax cash flows in the long term as well as its short-term net cash flow implications.

The model explicitly considers marketing investment, capacity <b>expenditures,</b> <b>working</b> capital and the impact of "experience" on costs and revenues over a time horizon. The formulation of strategy is accomplished by maximizing long-term profit subject to a short-term net cash flow limit, with the maximization repeated over a range of values for the short-term net cash flow limit. The use of the Generalized Lagrange Multiplier permits the simultaneous optimization of N market shares to be accomplished more efficiently by N univariate maximizations. Although the function that is maximized in the univariate maximization is not unimodal, the newly proposed procedure guarantees that a global maximum will be found.

In the 1970 s and 1980 s the agriculture of Pakistan grew at better than four percent per year, sufficient to reduce poverty levels rapidly. To return to those growth rates requires several public actions. Institutional reform in the irrigation system needs to reverse the losses that have occurred from poor management. There must be increased expenditure on the agricultural research and extension systems and that expenditure must be subject to a few priorities and increased efficiency. The rural road and education systems need to be massively expanded. Much more emphasis needs to be placed on expansion of the high value horticultural sector for which Pakistan has a strong comparative advantage in international markets. Those actions can be expected to bring a return to high growth rates in the four to six percent range and a resumption of rapid decline in poverty and its virtual elimination in a ten to twenty year period. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this field}} study was to compare in two APP-problem herds the {{efficiency}} and profitability of a single-dose -injection of Tulathromycin with the usual feed medication of Amoxicillin resp. Tetracycline for metaphylaxis after weaning resp. starting fattening. The clinical trial was conducted from October 2007 to May 2008 in a farrow to wean herd (two series of 686 weaned piglets) and in an independent fattening herd (one series of 603 pigs), both with the repeated occurrence of acute Pleuropneumonia by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP). After weaning resp. herd addition for fattening pigs were separated to different pens or stable rows for alternative metaphylaxis of Tulathromycin by a single i. m. -injection or of Amoxicillin-Trihydrat (weaned piglets) resp. of Tetracycline-HCL (fattening pigs) by oral feed medication of 7 days {{on the basis of}} preceding resistograms. With consideration for the farm owners only every 6 th or 10 th pig served as a non treated control (risk of losses). For space and feeding reasons (oral medications) these controls had to be housed in the same pens as the Tulathromycin medicated pigs. Objectives of this trial were kind and frequency of diseases and losses, growing performance (daily weight gain) and frequency of unsaleable pigs at delivery for fattening resp. slaughtering, as well as costs for drug treatments during the total growing period and for the growing delay. In addition, a sample of 280 weaned pigs was bleeded four times until delivery in order to control associations of C-Reactive-Proteine (CRP) and herd health resp. efficiency of metaphylaxis. Respiratory diseases and losses did not occur during their effective period. Afterwards the incidence of sporadically diseased pigs with different symptoms varied over time between 0 % an 19 % in weaned pigs resp. 1. 5 % and 6 % in fattening pigs without significant group differences. Losses in weaned pigs ranged from 0 to 5. 1 % and in fattening pigs significantly (p< 0. 05) from 1. 2 % resp. 1. 6 % (metaphylactic treatments) and 9. 3 % (untreated controls). At {{the end of the first}} weaner series, in the 7 th week, only the Amoxicillin-group was affected by an acute APP-infection with 93. 5 % of diseased pigs. CRP-serum values of the first weaner series with an acute APP-outbreak differed extremely between groups and dates, particularly between first and follow up dates. Consecutive studies should clarify, if high values, as observed in our study and in contrast to others, are associated with a powerful immunity resp. with an efficient metaphylaxis (Tulathromycingroup), and if low values indicate the onset of the incubation of an infectious disease (Amoxicillin-group). In the first series of weaned pigs daily weight gains were significantly higher in the Tulathromycin-treated group (p< 0, 05) than in the APP-diseased Amoxicillin-group (0, 433 kg vs. 0, 388 kg) but not in the control group. In the second series of weaners and in fattening pigs groups did not differ in the growing performance. Due to the APP-infection in the first series of weaners, the rate of unsaleable pigs at delivery was significantly higher (p< 0, 001) in the Amoxicillin-group (24, 9 %) as compared to the Tulathromycin-group (5, 9 %) and the untreated controls (10, 9 %). Costs for metaphylaxis and additional medications per pig over time (drugs and treatments by stock´s person), and daily costs per unsaleable pigs after delivery were in case of the APP-infection much lower with Tulathromycin than with Amoxicillin as a metaphylaxis. In the second series of weaners and in fattenting pigs, each without APP-infection, oral Amoxicillinresp. Tetracycline-metaphylaxis was less expensive in total than the Tulathromycinmetaphylaxis by single dose injection. This is mainly due to higher drug volumes and <b>working</b> <b>expenditure</b> for the i. m. application. Further studies under field conditions should prove if total costs of Tulathromycin-metaphylaxis in case of extremely exposed APP-fattening herds may adjust or even reverse these costs. The good health and growing performance of non treated controls which were housed commonly with the Tulathromycin treated pigs might be the result of the antimicrobial caused decrease in germ pressure and its consecutive lower risk of infection. With reservation of the specific herd situations in this field study we conclude that in extremely APP-exposed weaned piglets the parenteral metaphylaxis of Tulathromycin with a single i. m. injection might be more efficient and less expensive during the growing period than oral medication of Amoxicillin over 7 days...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine the causes and consequences of child labor. The first chapter of this work examines the empirical relationship between <b>working</b> and educational <b>expenditure</b> budget shares for children ages 5 - 14 in Mexico. The results indicate that, on average, girls engaged in paid work have total annual education expenditure shares that are 49 % higher than girls who do not work. This relationship varies significantly with characteristics of both the individual and the household. The second chapter explores the differential impact of migration by male and female household members on household decision making and child outcomes. Using household and individual level data from four rounds of the Indonesian Family Life Survey and exploiting an instrumental variables approach, this paper shows that as the total number of household migrants increases, both the probability that a child works and his actual work hours decline. On the other hand, the total number of migrants has no impact on school attendance, but children in households with only female migrants are less likely to attend school overall. The final chapter examines the impact of state level political reservation for two minority groups, namely Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, on child labor in India.
