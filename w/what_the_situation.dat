5|$|Women {{were usually}} {{identified}} as victims during the independence wars since {{the women of}} Latin America were forced to sacrifice for the cause. The ideals of womanhood meant that women must sacrifice <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> required such as a mother sacrificing her son or a virgin knowing she might be sacrificing motherhood or marriage due {{to the loss of}} many young men. This view meant that women were meant to contribute to independence in a supportive role while leaving the combat and politics {{in the hands of the}} men.|$|E

Later, Lacus and Kira reveal to the crew of the Archangel Durandal's plan to assign behavioral genes to every human being in order to render war and conflict obsolete. Lacus then leads Terminal and its allies in the final battle to stop Durandal.|$|E

Burdon immediately became concerned that police would find drugs at the apartment, and as he was collecting incriminating evidence, he found the poem that Hendrix had written hours earlier, [...] "The Story of Life". Burdon, {{who said he had}} previously discussed suicide and death with Hendrix, assumed the poem was a suicide note. Under this assumption, he made comments to the press regarding his belief that Hendrix had committed suicide that he has since recanted: [...] "I made false statements...

500|$|Despite the {{apparent}} agreement, the Hobbs Company continued to interpose objections. Engraver Barber was {{asked for his}} view; he stated that Reith, who had attended the trial striking, had been given {{all the time and}} facilities he had asked for in testing the new pieces, and the mechanic had pronounced himself satisfied. [...] Hobbs Company agent C. U. Carpenter suggested that Reith had been intimidated by the preparations that had already gone into the issue of the modified nickel, [...] "and, instead of pointing out clearly just <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> demanded, agreed to adapt our device to the coin more readily that [...] he was warranted in doing". [...] On February 3, Hobbs sent Roberts a lengthy list of changes that he wanted in the coin, and the sculptor was required to attend a conference with Hobbs and Reith. [...] On the fifth, following the conference, which ended with no agreement, Fraser sent MacVeagh a ten-page letter, complaining that his time was being wasted by the Hobbs Company, and appealing to the Secretary to bring the situation to a close. [...] MacVeagh agreed to hold a meeting at his office in Washington on February 14. When the Hobbs Company requested permission to bring a lawyer, Fraser announced he would be doing the same. The Hobbs Company sought letters of support from the business community, with little success; Fraser's efforts to secure support from artists for his position were more fruitful. [...] Barber prepared patterns showing what the nickel would look like if the changes demanded by Hobbs were made.

He responded that a different standard would apply, and held to that position when asked how, {{if that was the}} case, the ordinance could still be vague on its face, since that would more clearly indicate such marketing. [...] "f a customer had gone into a grocery store and purchased a thousand Glad bags or Ziploc bags because that is the common way that marijuana is distributed in small amounts, and if he sold it, would that grocer be required to get a license?" [...] He maintained that the ordinance strictly targeted just the marketing, and so its requirements wouldn't be triggered by any reference to illegal sale.|$|E

Her choice of individual colours and a colour scheme was also determined based on the mood of each film, a particular scene and the personality of each individual character. In the Los Angeles Times Cristy Lytal observed: [...] "For Yasuda, color is a storytelling tool that is every bit as powerful as words". In the article, Lytal quotes Yasuda, saying: [...] "What I like best is when I am building up the colors in my head, thinking of how to get the tone worked out," [...] and [...] "Color has a meaning, and it makes the film more easily understood. Colors and pictures can enhance <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> is on screen." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1954, Dien Bien Phu alone required 20 C-119s and 50 C-47s, so, on January 2, Navarre’s second-in-command asked for additional aircraft and crews under the so-called “Navarre Plan.” U.S. President Eisenhower, fearing both domestic and international backlashes {{if he were to}} send in U.S. troops, sent an American mission to Indochina {{to determine the extent of}} help that the French needed. Following a personal letter from the French prime minister, Joseph Laniel, Eisenhower authorized the loan of aircraft with French markings painted on them and flown by crews from Civil Air Transport (CAT), a commercial airline, which had been started in 1946 by then-retired Major General Chennault, the famous commander of the American Volunteer Group (AVG), better known as the “Flying Tigers”, in China during World War II, and then purchased by the CIA in the year war broke out in Korea. He further authorized the dispatch of American “specialists” to Indochina, that is, mechanics from the Far East Air Force (FEAF) of the USAF. Once sworn to secrecy owing to the political ramifications of their presence, they would go to work on B-26s at Da Nang (then called Tourane) in the south and on C-47s at Do Son, located south of Haiphong, in the north, respectively. (In fact, Eisenhower was so concerned about their presence, which itself caused the Chinese government to label the American mechanics as “combatants”, that he told U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that he wanted them withdrawn by the end of June 1954 no matter <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Indochina was at that time.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{getting the}} job of director, Watts created images of Nick Fury as Parker's mentor in the story in early [...] "mood reels" [...] saying, [...] "I don’t know <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> would be, {{but that would be}} a person he’d want to get in trouble with." [...] Feige said the films of John Hughes would be a major {{influence}} and that Parker's personal growth and development would be just as important as his role as Spider-Man. He noted that [...] "at that age, in high school, everything feels like life or death." [...] He also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet, and that filming would begin in June 2016. In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt. It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay, and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch; both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay. The pair had proposed a take on the character that was [...] "diametrically opposed" [...] to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a [...] of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them in this film. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character and [...] "what {{it would be like to}} be a real kid who gets superpowers", rather than the [...] "drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man". They felt this would differentiate him from the other MCU superheroes as well. Daley called the film [...] "an origin story of him finding his place in the Marvel [...] Universe", with the writing team wanting the film to [...] "focus on [...] coming to terms with his new abilities and not yet being good with them, and carrying with him some real human fears and weaknesses," [...] such as a fear of heights when he has to scale the Washington Monument. Daley noted, [...] "Even within the context of this movie, I don't think you would feel that fear of heights or even the vertigo the audience feels in that scene if you establish him as swinging from skyscrapers at the top of the movie." [...] The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of Manhattan because of how often they were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as [...] "the suburbs, on a golf course, the Staten Island Ferry, Coney Island, and even Washington D.C." [...] One of the first sequences they pitched was [...] "seeing Spider-Man attached to a plane 10,000 feet up in the air, where he had absolutely no safety net. If you have a character that you’re so familiar with, and you’re familiar with the sort of areas he’s been in, why not turn it on its head and make it something different that people haven’t seen before?" [...] The pair conceded that the film took a more grounded, [...] "low-stakes" [...] approach than previous films, in part to Spider-Man existing in a world with the Avengers, since [...] "if the threat became world-threatening, you would obviously bring in the big guys to handle it." ...|$|E
