The legend {{explained}} the later walling up of the gate as a Turkish precaution against this prophecy.|$|E

As Black returns to help Catherine with the suitcases, she has disappeared, leaving behind only an origami dove given to her by her mother.|$|E

Built on ten acres of land in Yonkers, with award-winning gardens a large parking lot and an artificial lake, the Westchester Candlelight was said to be the largest restaurant in the East. It seated almost a thousand customers while nearly as many were often waiting for tables. Serving was continuous, and 10,000 customers sometimes ate at the restaurant on a single day, according to Murphy. Engineered to maximize sales, the Westchester Candlelight invited diners enduring long <b>waits</b> <b>to</b> stroll its extensive gardens, browse at a gift shop featuring Patricia Murphy-branded fragrances, and buy drinks at the bar or flowers in the greenhouses. Charter buses from upstate New York and Pennsylvania arrived regularly with tour groups.|$|E

25|$|Driving {{through the}} mist, David finds his house {{destroyed}} {{and his wife}} dead. Devastated, he drives the group south, passing destroyed vehicles and seeing a gigantic six-legged, tentacled beast. When they run out of gas, the group decides {{there is no point}} in going on. David shoots the others (with their consent, except for his son who is not old enough to understand) rather than have them endure horrifying deaths. When David is done killing all of them, he is left with no bullet to use on himself. He leaves the car and <b>waits</b> <b>to</b> be killed, but the mist suddenly recedes, revealing that the U.S. Army has arrived, managed to close the portal, and are in the process of exterminating the creatures. David also witnesses rescued survivors, and restoring order. Among the survivors is the woman who left the store at the phenomenon's onset, completely unscathed and having rescued her two children. David realizes that his group was only moments away from being rescued, aware now that their deaths were premature and in vain, and drops to his knees screaming.|$|E
25|$|The {{recruitment}} {{process of}} a migrant domestic worker into Lebanon is conducted by sponsorship. The worker has {{to receive an}} invitation before being granted a working permit to enter the country. The invitation comes through a recruiting agency either by use of the services of {{their counterparts in the}} worker’s country of origin or directly from the agency itself and sometimes at the request of an individual employer. First, the Ministry of Labour issues preliminary work authorization to migrant domestic workers. In 2010, the Ministry of Labour issued and approximate 118,000 work permits to migrant domestic Workers. Next, the Ministry of Interior issues entry visas through the General Directorate for General Security. Then the General Directorate of General Security authorizes the legal entry of migrant domestic workers and arranges work permission and residence when they arrived in the country. Lastly, the sponsor’s name is located on the migrant domestic worker's entry visa, residence and work permit. The visa is for a three-month period {{and the name of the}} sponsor is included in the passport. When the migrant domestic worker arrives at the airport they are subjected to an immigration routine which includes the handing over of their passports to the Lebanese General Security in order to process the papers, while the migrant domestic worker <b>waits</b> <b>to</b> be collected by their sponsor. After this, the sponsor brings the migrant domestic worker to a local agency for a basic medical checkup.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{received}} favourably {{by the majority}} of music critics, although opinions have become more negative in subsequent decades and it has rarely been featured in [...] "Best Albums of the 1980s" [...] lists since. It won three Grammy Awards including for Album of the Year in 1986. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that Collins was [...] "quietly revolutionising and expanding the role of the drums in pop record making". Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke wrote that, [...] "Like his '81 and '82 outings, Face Value and Hello, I Must Be Going!, No Jacket Required is not an album that <b>waits</b> <b>to</b> be liked". Collins' most commercially successful solo album, it reached number one in several countries, including the US (where it {{was at the top of}} the charts for seven weeks), the UK and Canada. According to the RIAA, the record sold over twelve million copies in the US, and in the UK, the album sold over two million copies, and was certified 6× platinum. It was the second-best-selling album of 1985 in the UK, beaten to first place by Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms. Worldwide, the album has sold over 25 million copies, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time.|$|E

2500|$|A {{dominant}} {{theory of}} explaining the self-organized {{division of labor}} in social insect societies such as honey bee colonies is the Response-Threshold Model. [...] It predicts that individual worker bees have inherent thresholds to stimuli associated with different tasks. [...] Individuals with the lowest thresholds will preferentially perform that task. [...] Stimuli could include the “search time” that elapses while a foraging bee <b>waits</b> <b>to</b> unload her nectar and pollen to a receiver bee at the hive, the smell of diseased brood cells, or any other combination of environmental inputs that an individual worker bee encounters. [...] The Response-Threshold Model only provides for effective task allocation in the honey bee colony if thresholds are varied among individual workers. [...] This variation originates from the considerable genetic diversity among worker daughters of a colony due to the queen’s multiple matings.|$|E
