50|$|San Bruno Police {{declared}} the area {{a crime scene}} to determine if foul play was involved. The National Transportation Safety Board began {{an investigation into the}} cause of the explosion. During the days prior to the explosion, some residents reported smelling natural gas in the area. A source within PG&E reported a break in natural gas line number 132 caused the explosion. The gas line is a large 30 in steel pipe. National Transportation Safety Board vice chairman Christopher Hart said at a briefing that the segment of pipe that blew out onto the street was 28 ft long, the explosion sent that piece of pipe about 100 ft and the blast created a crater 167 ft long and 26 ft wide, though the NTSB Pipeline Accident Report would later size the crater to be 72 ft long and 26 ft wide. He said that an inspection of the severed pipe chunk revealed that it was made of several smaller sections that had been welded together and that a seam ran its length. The presence of the welds did not necessarily indicate the pipe had been repaired, he said. Newer pipelines are usually manufactured into the shape needed for these applications, rather than having multiple weaker <b>welded</b> <b>sections</b> that could potentially leak or break.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} an experimental investigation of thermally induced residual stresses in fabricated 3 CR 12 (DIN 1. 4003) T-sections. 3 CR 12 is a weldable utility stainless steel developed {{to provide a}} superior alternative to coated carbon steels and other alloys which have a poor corrosion/abrasion resistance. Because of the difficulty and costs involved in hot-rolling stainless steel structural sections, they are usually fabricated by welding. In this investigation, full-penetration laser- and manual metal arc (MMA) joints were considered along with partial-penetrated MMA- and metal inert gas (MIG) welded joints. The residual stresses induced during welding were measured by neutron diffraction. All the sections displayed a largely tensile residual stress field around the weld that subsequently implied a compressive residual stress field in the flange regions. This was most pronounced for the MMA and MIG welds. The laser- <b>welded</b> <b>sections</b> displayed a more localized tensile residual stress field in the heat-affected zone that translated to lower average stresses in the flanges. In {{the latter part of}} this article, the effect of the weld-induced residual stress fields on the structural performance of appropriate T-section-based columns are assessed and compared. A significant difference in structural performance between the different weld techniques is predicted with the laser- <b>welded</b> <b>sections</b> displaying the highest predicted strength...|$|E

The welds were produced on a 1. 5 mm thick plate of 16 wt%Cr ferritic stainless steel conforming to AISI 430 commercial steel grade, using TIG torch in argon environment at a heat flux between 1008 W and 1584 W and speed between 2. 5 mm/s and 3. 5 mm/s. The sensitization was evaluated by electrolytic etching of the <b>weld</b> cross <b>sections</b> in 10 % oxalic acid. The characterization of the <b>weld</b> <b>section</b> for sensitization indicates that the size of the sensitized zone increases in direct proportion to the quantum of the heat input (combination of heat flux and welding speed). Microstructural analysis suggests that sensitization is promoted in the welds when the processing conditions (heat flux and welding speed) restricts the transformation occurring during cooling through the dual phase region, i. e. the welding conditions that promote transformation of delta ferrite (δ) to austenite (γ) during cooling cycle can prevent sensitization in the FSS welds and such conditions found in this investigation correspond to welding with a heat flux in the range 1008 W to 1296 W   and speed 3 mm/s to 3. 5 mm/s.

40|$|The {{final draft}} of the EN version of part 1. 1 of Eurocode 3 has {{introduced}} {{significant changes in the}} evaluation of the lateral-torsional buckling resistance of unrestrained beams at room temperature that reduce the over-conservative approach of ENV 1993 - 1 - 1 in the case of non-uniform bending.

40|$|The {{cross-sectional}} {{capacity is}} limited by material yielding {{on one hand and}} local buckling on the other hand. Most current metallic structural design codes use the concept of section classification for determining the section capacity of hot-rolled profiles. In this system, there exists a discontinuity between the classes 2 and 3 under pure bending load condition, while for the class 4, the effective width method (EWM) must be used to account for local buckling phenomenon. With the appearance of the more complex cross-sections, especially for thin-walled steel structures, the calculation using EWM becomes more and more intolerable and complicated. In order to overcome these difficulties when evaluating the cross-section strength, the alternative Direct Strength Method (DSM) approach, developed only for cold-formed thin-walled members, has gained importance over the last few years, and has been adopted by the North American and Australian standards for the design of cold-formed steel structural members recently. This thesis investigates the possibility to extend the DSM method to hot-rolled and welded structural steel members, and the objective is to derive a new formulation that would cover the whole field of section slenderness without section classification system used in Eurocode 3, using the same procedure for the DSM developed for cold-formed thin-walled steel structural members. Hot-rolled and welded H sections are mainly considered in this thesis. The DSM is premised {{on the assumption that the}} strength can be predicted from the yield strength to the elastic critical load ratio used in conjunction with a strength curve; i. e. the same concept than the one used in Eurocode 3, in terms of member buckling phenomenon. In the DSM approach applied for cold-formed thin-walled sections, local buckling and distortional buckling modes should be considered. For common hot-rolled or <b>welded</b> <b>sections,</b> only local buckling needs to be considered since distortional buckling does not occur for these sections. All available test results in literature are collected and evaluated with the current methods for calculating the cross-section resistance such as EWM, DSM, and the recent Continuous Strength Method (CSM). A short comparison is made and their domains of applicability are commented. A consistent approach has been adopted to develop numerical models for hot-rolled and <b>welded</b> <b>sections</b> subjected to compression and bending respectively. The FE model was built in FineLg and verified against test results of the “Semi-comp: Plastic member capacity of semi-compact steel sections - a more economic design” project, which was carried out earlier with the objective of improving the utilization of plasticity in rolled and <b>welded</b> <b>sections</b> with medium cross-section slenderness. Measured material and geometric properties, initial geometrical imperfections and residual stresses distributions have been highlighted. Once verified against the test results, the FE models have been used to carry out a parametrical study aimed at providing more FE results and highlighting the local buckling interaction between the webs and the flanges. All the experimental and FE numerical results constitute data base for the derivation of the new DSM curves. On the basis of Winter Formula for plate buckling and the generic DSM strength curve, different formulas are proposed for hot-rolled and welded H cross-sections under axial and bending load respectively. Also the statistical evaluation and safety study is conducted to obtain the safety factor γ_M, which is required for practical design...|$|E

Data were also generated which facilitated investigation of: (1) the relationship of welding skill development to cognitive attainment of welding information as measured by welding proficiency posttest scores and written test scores, respectively; (2) a comparison of skill development among three levels of students grouped according to welding proficiency pretest scores; and (3) a comparison of welding skill development of students in separated and mixed (whole or part method) <b>welding</b> <b>sections.</b> Fifty-five students comprised the population for this study. Subjects were selected from beginning welding students enrolled in day or evening programs at Everett Community College during the Fall and Winter quarters of the 1971 - 72 school year. Students selected for participation were programmed through a 15 -hour practice session running flat and overlapping flat beads. Students were tested and paired according to similarity of welding proficiency pre-test scores. Pairs were split or arbitrarily assigned to the whole or part method of learning. Four <b>welding</b> <b>sections</b> were homogeneous; that is, contained only whole- or part-method students. All other <b>welding</b> <b>sections</b> were heterogeneous; that is, both whole- and part-method students learning together. Three welding positions, horizontal, vertical, and overhead, were selected as the learning elements used to test the whole versus part method of learning. That concept was implemented by assigning students to one of two sequences. Whole-method, experimental students practiced a total of 45 hours. The welding practice sessions were divided into three equal parts, time-wise. Each student practiced one-third of each session on horizontal fillet welds, one-third on vertical fillet welds, and one-third on overhead fillet welds. This schedule was followed until 45 hours of practice were completed. Part-method, control students utilized the following sequence: (1) fifteen hours of welding practice on horizontal fillet welds, then (2) 15 hours of welding practice on vertical fillet welds, and finally (3) 15 hours of welding practice on overhead fillet welds. Upon completion of a 45 -hour practice schedule, all students made fillet weld test plates in the three positions and were tested on the cognitive aspects of welding which were judged relevant. The welding proficiency and cognitive test scores provided the data for the statistical test of each of the hypotheses. Within the limits of this study, the following conclusions are evident concerning the hypotheses: 1. Whole (experimental) and part (control) method students demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the level of welding proficiency. 2. Students who scored highest on the pre-test demonstrated statistically significant higher welding proficiency post-test scores than students who scored lowest on the pre-test. 3.

40|$|Abstract. A {{process model}} for {{electron}} beam (EB) welding with a variable thickness weld joint has been developed. Based on theoretical aspects and experimental calibration of electron beam focusing, welding parameters including beam power, focus current, working distance and welding speed were formulated {{in the heat}} source model. The model has been applied for the simulation of assembly of components in a gas turbine engine compressor. A series of metallographic <b>weld</b> <b>sections</b> with different <b>welding</b> thickness were investigated to validate the predicted thermal results. The workpieces were scanned both prior to- and after welding, using automated optical metrology (GOM scanning) {{in order to measure}} the distortion induced in the welding process.
