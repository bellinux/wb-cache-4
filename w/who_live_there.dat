5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{has been}} in use for many years but, {{given the number of}} people buried in such a small area, the bodies are no longer decomposing properly. They have begun to overflow and fall into the neighbouring houses as greater excavations take place and basement walls are weakened. The entire area is also permeated with a foul smell, turning fresh produce rotten in far shorter times than natural and tainting the breath of those <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>there.</b> Baratte finds that he has both friends and enemies in the area – the cemetery is both loved and hated by the people of the district. He finds resistance from all sides, notably Ziguette who strikes Baratte during his sleep in opposition to his work. He befriends the church's flamboyant organist named Armand, recruits his old colleague Lecoeur to assist with the excavation, is monitored by the infamous Guillotin and falls in love with Heloïse, widely known in the area as a whore.|$|E

25|$|Valhalla is {{an afterlife}} {{destination}} where {{half of those}} who die in battle gather as einherjar, a retinue gathered for one sole purpose: to remain fit for battle {{in preparation for the}} last great battle, during Ragnarök.

Cluny the Scourge—the evil one-eyed rat warlord, is hell-bent on destroying the tranquility {{as he prepares to}} fight a bloody battle for the ownership of Redwall. This dazzling story in the Redwall series is packed with all the wit, wisdom, humor, and blood-curdling adventure of the other books in the collection, but has the added bonus of taking the reader right back to {{the heart and soul of}} Redwall Abbey and the characters <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Book of Joshua takes forward Deuteronomy's {{theme of}} Israel {{as a single}} people worshipping Yahweh in the land God has given them. Yahweh, as the main {{character}} in the book, takes the initiative in conquering the land, and Yahweh's power wins the battles. For example, the walls of Jericho fall because Yahweh fights for Israel, not because the Israelites show superior fighting ability. The potential disunity of Israel is a constant theme, the greatest threat of disunity coming from the tribes east of the Jordan. Chapter 22:19 even hints that the land across the Jordan is unclean and that the tribes <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>there</b> have secondary status.|$|E

Catherine tries to comfort Heathcliff, but he vows revenge on Hindley.|$|E
500|$|Sérgio Penna, a {{theatrical}} director and a theater guest professor at University of São Paulo, coordinated the cast preparation.

[...] Former psychiatric institution patients from the theatrical groups Pazzo a Pazzo and Teatral Ueinzz, both directed by Penna, appeared as guests. They, however, did not play characters that were interned but supporting characters who remained outside of the hospital.|$|E

500|$|The Abbey Church is {{the liturgical}} {{center of the}} college. It is {{frequently}} cited as the [...] "heart of campus." [...] The upper church allows the college community to join with the monastic community for the daily celebration of the Eucharist and the Liturgy of the Hours. The lower church permits smaller groups {{of the community to}} assemble for worship and houses the Lady Chapel, the Saint Basil Byzantine Chapel, the former offices of Campus Ministry (relocated to Cushing Center), and meeting rooms. The Lower Church is the location of the weekly 9 p.m. Mass held on Wednesday nights. The original monastery was Alumni Hall. An interim monastery existed between 1919 and 1955 in what is now Joseph Hall, adjacent to Alumni Hall. The current monastery, built in 1955, is staffed with only a cook, as the monks perform all other tasks such as cleaning, maintenance and upkeep. Having four floors, including a basement, the monastery can house up to one hundred monks; as of 2012 approximately 30 rooms were filled. The Dean of the College and several members {{of the board of trustees}} live in the monastery, as they are practicing Benedictine monks. Since 2012, Abbot Mark Cooper, O.S.B has been the fifth elected Abbot of Saint Anselm Abbey. Male students frequently dine in the monastery as guests; they are required to comply with the Benedictine rule of silence while eating, which allows for contemplation and prayer. The monastery has a refectory, a smaller guest refectory, a smaller chapel, two welcoming rooms near the main entrance and is complete with elevator access to all four floors. The monastery also serves as the mother house for the Woodside Priory School and the abbot serves as the spiritual father for the monks <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>there.</b> Saint Anselm Abbey is a member of the American-Cassinese Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation. Saint Anselm Abbey was founded from Saint Mary's Abbey in Newark, New Jersey.|$|E
