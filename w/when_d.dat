40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the networking-theoretic {{multicast}} capacity for both random extended networks (REN) and random dense networks (RDN) under Gaussian Channel model, when all nodes are individually power-constrained. During the transmission, the power decays along path with the attenuation exponent α > 2. In REN and RDN, n nodes are randomly distributed in the square region with side-length √n and 1, respectively. We randomly choose n B nodes as the sources of multicast sessions, and for each source v, we pick uniformly at random n d nodes as the destination nodes. Based on percolation theory, we propose multicast schemes and analyze the achievable throughput by considering all possible values of n s and n d · As a special case of our results, we show that for n s = Θ(n), the per-session multicast capacity of RDN is Θ Equation Persented <b>when</b> n <b>d</b> = O Equation Persented and is Θ(1 /n) <b>when</b> n <b>d</b> = Ω Equation Persented the per-session multicast capacity of REN is Θ Equation Persented <b>when</b> n <b>d</b> = O Equation Persented and is Θ Equation Persented <b>when</b> n <b>d</b> = Ω Equation Persented. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the class of}} shaped partition problems of partitioning n given vectors in d-dimensional criteria space into p parts so as to maximize an arbitrary objective function which is convex on the sum of vectors in each part, subject to arbitrary constraints {{on the number of}} elements in each part. This class has broad expressive power and captures NP-hard problems even if either d or p is fixed. In contrast, we show that <b>when</b> both <b>d</b> and p are fixed, the problem can be solved in strongly polynomial time. Our solution method relies on studying the corresponding class of shaped partition polytopes.

25|$|The {{formation}} of proliferating buds in ebony spleenwort has also {{given rise to}} a taxonomic treatment. Bud formation was first observed by Conrad Loddiges in 1817, in specimens in cultivation in Great Britain. However, the phenomenon was overlooked until 1879, <b>when</b> <b>D.</b> C. Eaton observed it in specimens from Florida. He took this for an aberrant variety, which he named A.ebeneum var.proliferum. Willard Clute reduced its status from a variety to a form, A.ebeneum f.proliferum, in 1906. Similar specimens were subsequently reported from Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut; the buds appeared on the rachis of sterile fronds, and were often only detected when mounting the specimen. In 1924, Frederick G. Floyd argued that the {{formation of}} these proliferations was a normal characteristic of the species, which appeared regularly, if not universally, and did not warrant a varietal designation. He also observed the formation of proliferating buds on a fertile rachis of A.ebeneum var.serratum. Floyd's position was not universally accepted: Louise Tanger made a new combination for the form, A.platyneuron f.proliferum in 1933, and Taylor et al. recognized it in a discussion of infraspecific taxa in the species in 1976. However, these authors noted that specimens of A.platyneuron f.proliferum would be assigned to various other varieties if they were not proliferous. Wagner & Johnson, in 1981, declined to recognize the taxon on grounds similar to Floyd's, and Wagner's treatment in Flora of North America does not mention the form.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the battle the Australians were left to {{speculate}} on the reason it occurred. One hypothesis was that the Viet Cong had intended to attack and overwhelm Nui Dat, with the initial plan to mortar the base to draw a response force into an ambush after which the base would be attacked and captured, but that they had been prevented from doing so after clashing with D Company. A second possibility was that they may have had the more limited aim of drawing D Company into an ambush to destroy it and secure a small victory over an isolated force. Finally, it was possible no ambush was planned at all, and that the Viet Cong had been moving on Nui Dat in regimental strength when they unexpectedly ran into D Company, resulting in an encounter battle. The evidence suggested they intended an attack on Nui Dat in some form, while the lack of prepared positions from which to mount an ambush made this unlikely. Brigadier David Jackson—Commander 1 ATF—believed the Viet Cong had been on their way to attack Nui Dat on the night of 18/19 August <b>when</b> <b>D</b> Company intercepted them and this was supported by information from a prisoner captured afterwards. They were carrying large quantities of ammunition and may have had sufficient strength to seriously damage the base, even if its defences were likely strong enough to withstand such an attack. Yet, from the earliest Jackson had felt the Viet Cong would have to engage 1 ATF in a major battle if they wished to retain control of Phuoc Tuy, and this interpretation fitted his previous thinking. In dispatching patrols east of Nui Dat following the mortar attack on 16/17 August Jackson seemingly reacted to his opponent's first move, and he may have allowed himself to be shaped into responding as the Viet Cong had intended.|$|E

The pair eventually started playing music together, mostly covering songs from artists they admired. In the summer of 1973 Watt and Boon formed the Bright Orange Band, with Boon's brother Joe on drums. In 1976 they discovered punk; Boon's mother died, and the Bright Orange Band disbanded shortly thereafter. The next year, the two joined a short-lived band called Starstruck. Following Starstruck's disbandment, Boon and Watt met drummer George Hurley and formed The Reactionaries with vocalist Martin Tamburovich.|$|E

2500|$|While Vietnamese sources {{maintain}} an ambush was planned at Long Tan, whether they also intended attacking Nui Dat remains uncertain. The fact a large Viet Cong force {{had not been}} identified in the area before midday on 18 August suggests no such force was there, and consequently {{it could not have}} been occupying an ambush position awaiting the arrival of the reaction force from Nui Dat. Despite this, it seems likely the 5th Division had planned an ambush but were ill-prepared {{due to a lack of}} co-ordination between the morning of 17 August and the selection and occupation of the intended site. As a result, they appear to have been unready <b>when</b> <b>D</b> Company entered the plantation and were likely somewhere on its eastern edge instead. The Viet Cong were probably still conducting their reconnaissance and establishing the ambush in the vicinity of where the rubber met the jungle when the battle occurred, while the Australians may have upset their plan by moving faster than the ARVN and US troops they had previously fought. What followed then appears to have been an encounter battle as the two advancing forces clashed on open ground in a meeting engagement. An alternative explanation is that D Company approached from an unexpected direction, physically dislocating the ambush. Indeed, Thu stated [...] "...we didn't know how many... had in Nui Dat. We tried to draw them out... We thought they would go one way but... went the wrong way and came behind us." [...] In July 2006, David Sabben—platoon commander 12 Platoon—and Bob Buick—platoon sergeant 11 Platoon—visited the battlefield for a television story on 60 Minutes, where they met Nguyen Minh Ninh, former vice-commander D445 Battalion.
