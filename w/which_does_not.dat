25|$|However, {{despite the}} {{intersection}} of evidentiality systems with other semantic or pragmatic systems (through grammatical categories), Aikhenvald believes that several languages do mark evidentiality without any grammatical connection to these other semantic/pragmatic systems. More explicitly stated, she believes that there are modal systems <b>which</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> express evidentiality and evidential systems <b>which</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> express modality.

5|$|Although 247Bk is {{the most}} stable isotope of berkelium, its {{production}} in nuclear reactors is very inefficient due to the long half-life of its potential progenitor curium-247, <b>which</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> allow it sufficient time to beta decay before capturing another neutron. Thus, 249Bk {{is the most}} accessible isotope of berkelium, which still, is available only in small quantities (only 0.66grams have been produced in the US over the period 1967–1983) at a high price of the order 185 USD per microgram.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is an}} attractive-looking bolete, Caloboletus calopus is not {{considered}} edible on account of its very bitter taste, <b>which</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> disappear upon cooking. There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. The bitter taste {{is largely due to}} the compounds calopin and a δ-lactone derivative, O-acetylcyclocalopinA. These compounds contains a structural motif known as a 3-methylcatechol unit, which is rare in natural products. A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003.|$|E
