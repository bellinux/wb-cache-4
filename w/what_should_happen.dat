Pierlot supported retreating to London, but was keen to preserve the unity of his government, most of which supported remaining in France. Hoping to keep the Belgian Congo under Belgian sovereignty, Pierlot allowed the Minister of the Colonies, Albert de Vleeschauwer, to leave France while the government met to consider whether it should resign {{to make way for}} a new constitutional authority in occupied Brussels.|$|E

25|$|Eritrea {{was made}} a British {{protectorate}} {{from the end of}} World War II until 1951. However, there was debate as to <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>happen</b> with Eritrea after the British left. The British proposed that Eritrea be divided along religious lines with the Christians to Ethiopia and the Muslims to Sudan. This, however, caused great controversy. Then, in 1952, the UN decided to federate Eritrea to Ethiopia, hoping to reconcile Ethiopian claims of sovereignty and Eritrean aspirations for independence. About nine years later, Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie dissolved the federation and annexed Eritrea, triggering a thirty-year armed struggle in Eritrea.|$|E
25|$|A {{resulting}} trust {{will also be}} found where the purposes of a trust have been completed, but there is excess property left over; for example, a trust by a settlor to provide for his children's university education. Judges and academics disagree over <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>happen</b> to the property; possibilities are {{that it should be}} held for the donors, that it should be held for the beneficiaries (as the donors intended to make an irrevocable gift) or that it should be given to the Crown as bona vacantia. A fourth suggestion is that the trustees take the surplus, as in Re Foord. The general rule was set out in Re Trusts of the Abbot Fund, where it was decided that excess funds will be held on {{resulting trust}} for the settlor. There are exceptions to this rule; the general rule is put aside if the court can find intention to benefit specific individuals, as in Re Osoba.|$|E

In Western Canada, however, respondents were sharply opposed to the coalition, led by Albertans, who responded 71% in favour of new elections. Quebec showed {{the highest level of}} support for the coalition, with 58% preferring it to a new election. Ontario was split, with 43% preferring an election compared to 39% supporting the coalition. This poll also showed that 60% of Canadians were concerned that the Bloc Québécois would hold {{the balance of power in}} a coalition, compared to 35% that were not concerned, with the majority of respondents in every region, excluding Quebec, expressing concern. 34% of those polled argued that the Conservatives were best able to handle the economic crisis, compared to 18% for the coalition. 14% felt the Liberals individually were best prepared, 7% felt the NDP individually were the best choice, and 2% felt the Bloc Québécois were best.|$|E

John's predecessors had ruled using {{the principle of}} vis et voluntas, or [...] "force and will", taking executive and sometimes arbitrary decisions, often justified {{on the basis that}} a king was above the law. Both Henry II and Richard had argued that kings possessed a quality of [...] "divine majesty"; John continued this trend and claimed an [...] "almost imperial status" [...] for himself as ruler. During the 12th century, there were contrary opinions expressed about the nature of kingship, and many contemporary writers believed that monarchs should rule in accordance with the custom and the law, and take counsel of the leading members of the realm. There was as yet no model for <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>happen</b> if a king refused to do so. Despite his claim to unique authority within England, John would sometimes justify his actions on the basis that he had taken council with the barons. Modern historians remain divided as to whether John suffered from a case of [...] "royal schizophrenia" [...] in his approach to government, or if his actions merely reflected the complex model of Angevin kingship in the early 13th century.|$|E
