Higher effort is more costly to workers, and firms have no mechanism for punishing or rewarding workers. Consistent with the gift exchange hypothesis, workers provide more effort at higher wages, but undergraduates provide substantially less effort than MBAs. Evidence suggests this results from differences in prior work experience. Firms' nonbinding effort requests {{are at least}} partially honored, resulting in increased overall effort for undergraduates. Although higher wages are relatively more costly for lower productivity firms, workers do not provide them with more effort. ...|$|R

Our results suggest that laboratory gift exchange is highly sensitive to the parameterization of the model and implementation characteristics and question the common belief that trust and reciprocity are robust phenomena...|$|R

Insurance protects the individual, but insurance cannot, in the nature of things, protect the nation. If you drop a thousand sovereigns in the street, that is a loss to you, but not to the nation.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{findings}} of {{a large body of}} gift exchange experiments is that a considerable fraction of workers reward higher wages with higher effort.

But when the words free, and liberty, are applied to any thing but bodies, they are abused; for that which is not subject to motion, is not subject to impediment: and therefore, when it is said, for example, the way is free, no liberty of the way is signified, but of those that walk in it without stop. And when <b>we</b> say <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> is free, there is not meant any liberty of the gift, but of the giver, that was not bound by any law or covenant to give it. So when we speak freely, it is not the liberty of voice, or pronunciation, but of the man, whom no law hath obliged to speak otherwise than he did.

40|$|Many {{software}} security solutions require accurate tracking of control/data dependencies among information objects in network applications. This paper presents a general dynamic information flow tracking framework (called GIFT) for C programs that allows an application developer to associate applicationspecific tags with input data, instruments the application to propagate these tags {{to all the}} other data that are control/data-dependent on them, and invokes application-specific processing on output data according to their tag values. To use <b>GIFT,</b> <b>an</b> application developer only needs to implement input and output proxy functions to tag input data and to perform tag-dependent processing on output data, respectively. To demonstrate the usefulness of <b>GIFT,</b> <b>we</b> implement <b>a</b> complete <b>GIFT</b> application called Aussum, which allows selective sandboxing of network client applications based on whether their inputs are ”tainted ” or not. For a set of computation-intensive test applications, the measured elapsed time overhead of GIFT is less than 35 %. ...|$|R
