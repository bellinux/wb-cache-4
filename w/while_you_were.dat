He debuted in 2005 as a runway model, {{becoming}} the youngest male model ever {{to participate in}} Seoul Fashion Week.

25|$|The {{amount of}} {{redundancy}} {{is based on}} a length of service calculation and age. For each year you have worked <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> under 21 years old, you get half a week's pay. For each year between ages 21 and 40, one week's pay. For each year over 40, one and a half week's pay (s.162). However, there is an upper limit set on what can be considered a week's pay, which is approximately the same as a week on the minimum wage (if you were made redundant on or before 31 January 2011, it was £380 per week - from 1 February 2011 to 31 January 2012, it was £400 - currently it is £450, before tax).|$|E
500|$|On 8 February, ZANLA cadres at Connemara Barracks in Gwelo {{surprised}} their ZIPRA counterparts, killed over 60 of {{them and}} forced the rest to flee into the bush. When the ZIPRA portion of the 13th Infantry Battalion, based at Glenville Camp near Entumbane, learned of this later in the day, it waited until its instructors from the British Army left in the evening, then attacked its ZANLA comrades, killing 12 {{of them and}} scattering the rest. Charged with restoring order, McKenna sent Devine's armoured cars and D Company, 1RAR, commanded by the American Lieutenant Dave Hill, to Glenville. Arriving late in the evening, the Elands drove into the camp and flattened the ZIPRA tents, killing many of the occupants and {{clearing the way for}} Hill's troops. Taken totally by surprise, the ZIPRA troops put up little resistance; 40 were killed and many more captured, including two officers, Captains Mpofu and Dlamini. On the morning of 9 February, the British instructors were bewildered to find the ZANLA half of their unit gone, and the remaining ZIPRA men squatting in rows in 1RAR captivity. [...] "What happened?" [...] asked the British sergeant. [...] "I am afraid that <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> away, your battalion fell apart," [...] replied McKenna.|$|E
