50|$|Diseases {{that affect}} elkhorn coral include <b>white</b> <b>pox</b> disease, white band disease, and black band disease. <b>White</b> <b>pox</b> disease, which only affects elkhorn coral, {{is caused by}} a fecal enterobacterium, Serratia marcescens. The disease is very {{contagious}} and commonly moves from one colony to its nearest neighbor. <b>White</b> <b>pox</b> creates white lesions on the coral skeleton and results in an average tissue loss of 2.5 cm2 per day, but can cause as much tissue loss as 10.5 cm2 per day. White band disease and black band disease have also greatly reduced the abundance of elkhorn coral. Diseases are one of the major causes of coral mortality, however, they are not well studied or understood.|$|E
50|$|Alastrim {{was also}} called <b>white</b> <b>pox,</b> kaffir pox, Cuban itch, West Indian pox, milk pox, and pseudovariola.|$|E
50|$|Pollution can {{introduce}} pathogens. For example, Aspergillus sydowii {{has been associated}} with a disease in sea fans, and Serratia marcescens, has been linked to the coral disease <b>white</b> <b>pox.</b>|$|E
50|$|In elkhorn coral, S. marcescens is {{the cause}} of the disease known as <b>white</b> <b>pox</b> disease. In silkworms, S. marcescens can also cause a lethal disease, {{especially}} in association with other pathogens.|$|E
5000|$|<b>White</b> <b>pox</b> disease (also [...] "acroporid serratiosis" [...] and [...] "patchy necrosis"), first {{noted in}} 1996 on coral reefs near the Florida keys, is a coral disease {{affecting}} Elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) throughout the Caribbean. It causes irregular white patches or blotches on the coral {{that result from}} the loss of coral tissue. These patches distinguish <b>white</b> <b>pox</b> disease from white band disease which produces a distinctive white band where the coral skeleton has been denuded. The blotches caused by this disease are also clearly differentiated from coral bleaching and scars caused by coral-eating snails. It is very contagious, spreading to nearby coral.|$|E
50|$|So far one agent {{has been}} identified, the ciliate {{protozoan}} Halofolliculina corallasia. Skeletal eroding band {{is the first}} recorded disease of corals that {{is caused by a}} protozoan, and thus the first known to be caused by an eukaryote - most are caused by prokaryotic bacteria. For example, black band disease is caused by microbial mats of variable composition, and <b>White</b> <b>pox</b> disease by the bacterium Serratia marcescens.|$|E
5000|$|The Caribbean's {{coral reefs}} have been {{increasingly}} becoming diseased by 20 percent [...] Coral diseases can cause tissue damage {{or it could}} even destroy the entire colony [...] In 1980, white-band disease killed 95 percent of the Acroporid palmata and Acroporid cervicornis colonies which placed them on the Endangered Species Act [...] A 2010 study concluded that sewage runoff in was correlated to the <b>white</b> <b>pox</b> coral disease that destroyed the Acroporid palmata species [...]|$|E
50|$|At the {{locations}} where <b>white</b> <b>pox</b> disease has been observed, {{it is estimated}} to have reduced the living tissue in elkhorn corals by 50-80%. In the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS), the losses of living coral are estimated to average around 88%. Elkhorn coral was formerly the dominant shallow water reef-building coral throughout the Caribbean but now is listed as a threatened, {{due in part to}} disease. Elkhorn coral is the first species of coral to be listed as threatened in the United States, Also due in part to this disease.|$|E
40|$|Populations of the shallow-water Caribbean elkhorn coral, Acropora palmata, {{are being}} {{decimated}} by <b>white</b> <b>pox</b> disease, with losses of living {{cover in the}} Florida Keys typically in excess of 70 %. The rate of tissue loss is rapid, averaging 2. 5 cm 2 ⋅day− 1, and is greatest during periods of seasonally elevated temperature. In Florida, the spread of <b>white</b> <b>pox</b> fits the contagion model, with nearest neighbors most susceptible to infection. In this report, we identify a common fecal enterobacterium, Serratia marcescens, as the causal agent of <b>white</b> <b>pox.</b> This is the first time, to our knowledge, that a bacterial species associated with the human gut {{has been shown to}} be a marine invertebrate pathogen...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{diseases}} of corals caused by opportunistic pathogens have become widespread. How opportunistic pathogens establish on coral surfaces, interact with native microbiota, and cause disease {{is not yet}} clear. This study compared the utilization of coral mucus by coral-associated commensal bacteria (“Photobacterium mandapamensis” and Halomonas meridiana) and by opportunistic Serratia marcescens pathogens. S. marcescens PDL 100 (a pathogen associated with <b>white</b> <b>pox</b> disease of Acroporid corals) grew to higher population densities on components of mucus from the host coral. In an in vitro coculture on mucus from Acropora palmata, S. marcescens PDL 100 isolates outgrew coral isolates. The <b>white</b> <b>pox</b> pathogen {{did not differ from}} other bacteria in growth on mucus from a nonhost coral, Montastraea faveolata. The ability of S. marcescens to cause disease in acroporid corals may be due, at least in part, to the ability of strain PDL 100 to build to higher population numbers within the mucus surface layer of its acroporid host. During growth on mucus from A. palmata, similar glycosidase activities were present in coral commensal bacteria, in S. marcescens PDL 100, and in environmental and human isolates of S. marcescens. The temporal regulation of these activities during growth on mucus, however, was distinct in the isolates. During early stages of growth on mucus, enzymatic activities in S. marcescens PDL 100 were most similar to those in coral commensals. After overnight incubation on mucus, enzymatic activities in a <b>white</b> <b>pox</b> pathogen were most similar to those in pathogenic Serratia strains isolated from human mucosal surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{have recently}} caused substantial com-munity- and ecosystem-wide impacts in marine com-munities. A long-spined sea urchin disease virtually eradi-cated urchins from the Caribbean and facilitated a coral to algal shift on many reefs (Hughes et al. 1994). Coral dis-eases, such as white band (Figure 1), white plague, <b>white</b> <b>pox,</b> and aspergillosis (Figure 2), have caused {{major changes in}} Caribbean reef community structure (Aronso...|$|E
40|$|During {{the survey}} 1386 colonies of hard corals, {{belonging}} to 27 genera were examined {{to identify the}} occurrence of different diseases and the disease prevalence data was collected for the entire study period. The percentage occurrence of the nine major diseases, which were prevalent among the corals in the islands, was as follows: <b>White</b> <b>Pox</b> disease (12. 19), White Plague (11. 04), White Band (12. 77), White Syndrome (17. 89), Pink Spot (1. 01), Dark Spot (10. 25), Pink Line Syndrome (15. 30), Polychaete infestation (16. 23) and Crown of thorn grazing (1. 23). Area- wise analysis of the disease prevalence data showed that {{the highest number of}} incidences was at Marina park (21. 3 %), followed by North Bay (16. 13 %), Car Nicobar (13. 89 %), Radhanagar Beach (13. 74 %), Boat Island (12. 44 %), Tarmugli Island (9. 85 %), Silver sand beach (8. 07 %) and Havelock Jetty (5. 63 %). Among the coral species, Acropora spp. and Porites spp. were dominantly affected. The other affected species include Platygyra spp., Gardineroseris sp., Goniastrea spp., Leptorea spp., Montipora spp., Favites spp., and Lobophyllia spp...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{evolutionary}} adaptions to new {{and previously}} detrimental environmental conditions {{can increase the}} risk of invasion by novel pathogens. We tested this hypothesis with a 133 -day-long evolutionary experiment studying the evolution of the pathogenic Serratia marcescens bacterium at salinity niche boundary and in fluctuating conditions. We found that S. marcescens evolved at harsh (80 g/L) and extreme (100 g/L) salt conditions had clearly improved salt tolerance than those evolved in the other three treatments (ancestral conditions, nonsaline conditions, and fluctuating salt conditions). Evolutionary theories suggest that fastest evolutionary changes could be observed in intermediate selection pressures. Therefore, we originally hypothesized that extreme conditions, such as our 100 g/L salinity treatment, could lead to slower adaptation due to low population sizes. However, no evolutionary differences were observed between populations evolved in harsh and extreme conditions. This suggests that in the study presented here, low population sizes did not prevent evolution in the long run. On the whole, the adaptive potential observed here could be important for the transition of pathogenic S. marcescens bacteria from human-impacted freshwater environments, such as wastewater treatment plants, to marine habitats, where they are known to infect and kill corals (e. g., through <b>white</b> <b>pox</b> disease) ...|$|E
40|$|Disturbances such as {{tropical}} storms cause coral {{mortality and}} reduce coral cover {{as a direct}} result of physical damage. Storms can be one of the most important disturbances in coral reef ecosystems, and it is crucial to understand their long-term impacts on coral populations. The primary objective of this study was to determine trends in disease prevalence and snail predation on damaged and undamaged colonies of the threatened coral species, Acropora palmata, following an episode of heavy ocean swells in the US Virgin Islands (USVI). At three sites on St. Thomas and St. John, colonies of A. palmata were surveyed monthly over one year following a series of large swells in March 2008 that fragmented 30 to 93 % of colonies on monitored reefs. Post-disturbance surveys conducted from April 2008 through March 2009 showed that swell-generated damage to A. palmata caused negative indirect effects that compounded the initial direct effects of physical disturbance. During the 12 months after the swell event, <b>white</b> <b>pox</b> disease prevalence was 41 % higher for colonies that sustained damage from the swells than for undamaged colonies (df = 207, p = 0. 01) with greatest differences in disease prevalence occurring during warm water months. In addition, the corallivorous snail, Coralliophila abbreviata, was 46 % more abundant on damaged corals than undamaged corals during the 12 months after the swell event (df = 207, p = 0. 006) ...|$|E
40|$|Colonies of the {{scleractinian coral}} Acropora palmata, listed as {{threatened}} under the US Endangered Species Act in 2006, have been monitored in Hawksnest Bay, within Virgin Islands National Park, St. John, from 2004 through 2010 by scientists with the US Geological Survey, National Park Service, and the University of the Virgin Islands. The {{focus has been}} on documenting the prevalence of disease, including white band, <b>white</b> <b>pox</b> (also called patchy necrosis and white patches), and unidentified diseases (Rogers et al., 2008; Muller et al., 2008). In an effort {{to learn more about the}} pathologies that might be involved with the diseases that were observed, samples were collected from apparently healthy and diseased colonies in July 2009 for analysis. Two different microbial assays were performed on Epicentre Biotechnologies DNA swabs containing A. palmata coral mucus, and on water and sediment samples collected in Hawksnest Bay. Both assays are based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of portions of the small rRNA gene (16 S). The objectives were to determine 1) if known coral bacterial pathogens Serratia marcescens (Acroporid Serratiosis), Vibrio coralliilyticus (temperature-dependent bleaching, White Syndrome), Vibrio shiloi (bleaching, necrosis), and Aurantimonas coralicida (White Plague Type II) were present in any samples, and 2) if there were any differences in microbial community profiles of each healthy, unaffected or diseased coral mucus swab. In addition to coral mucus, water and sediment samples were included to show ambient microbial populations. In the first test, PCR was used to separately amplify the unique and diagnostic region of the 16 S rRNA gene for each of the coral pathogens being screened. Each pathogen test was designed so that an amplified DNA fragment could be seen only if the specific pathogen was present in a sample. A positive result was indicated by bands of DNA of the appropriate size on an agarose gel, which separates DNA fragments based on the size of the molecule. DNA from pure cultures of each of the pathogens was used as a positive control for each assay...|$|E
