500|$|President of the Cambridge University Boat Club, Max Justicz, {{said of the}} {{previous}} year's race: [...] "We were burned on that day. Badly burned. It was worse than other defeats because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> win ... Oxford just rowed through us; with every stroke they took they destroyed our belief in ourselves." [...] His crew mate, Nick Clarry, focused on the approach to this year's race: [...] "This year it's heads down {{and get on with}} the job. [...] We know that if we don't cross the line first on the day, nobody could care less who we are." ...|$|E
500|$|Matheos {{originally}} intended the first OSI album as a [...] "project" [...] which would never produce a second album. For Free, Matheos and Moore {{wanted to use}} a different musician lineup to focus OSI on primarily being Matheos and Moore. They {{did not want to}} give the impression that the guests on the first album were part of the band. Matheos stated that the music on Free was [...] "focused less on the progressive elements or the metal elements that were on the first record. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do something just a little more groove oriented." [...] Matheos and Moore had both worked with bassist Joey Vera in the past and considered him [...] "perfect" [...] for the album. Moore was pleased with Vera's bass parts: Vera sent them to Moore in a state such that they required very little editing or enhancement for the final mix of the album.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles asked {{producer}} Martin {{to come to}} the rescue, so {{he borrowed}} two four-track recorders from EMI, and long-time Beatles' engineer Geoff Emerick was given the task of building and setting up a studio with portable equipment. After Allen Klein was brought in to be the Beatles' manager in 1969, he closed Apple Electronics and Mardas left the company. It was later estimated that Mardas' ideas and projects had cost the Beatles at least £300,000 (£4.5 million in 2015 pounds). Starr once approved of one of Mardas’ ideas: [...] "He [...] had an idea to stop people taping our records off the radio – you’d have to have a decoder to get the signal, and then <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> sell the time and put commercials on instead. We brought EMI and Capitol in from America to look at it, but they weren’t interested at all".|$|E
5000|$|On October 16, 2009, Mosshart {{confirmed}} {{that a second}} album was [...] "halfway done". White later announced that the first single from the new album would be called [...] "Die By The Drop", for which he would sing lead vocals. He commented that it was [...] "bluesier and heavier than <b>we</b> ever <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> be".|$|R

5000|$|The {{magazine}} was co-founded by William E. Pearson and Mangesh Hattikudur {{while they were}} students at Duke University. According to the Mental Floss website, the idea came from conversations in the Duke cafeteria {{about the need for}} an entertaining educational magazine. According to Hattikudur, they wanted to [...] "distill some of the best lectures from our favorite college professors. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> bottle their enthusiasm and deliver it in monthly installments, it'd be great." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked to}} look back on the album, the band {{themselves}} have described Gold Against the Soul as their least favourite album and the period surrounding the album as being the most unfocused of their career. The band's vocalist and guitarist James Dean Bradfield has said [...] "All we wanted to do was go under the corporate wing. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> ignore it but you do get affected." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though In/Casino/Out was {{recorded}} live, [...] "Relationship of Command {{may very well}} be the first record to harness the chaotic balance of adrenaline and intellect of ATDI's live performance." [...] "Ross was instrumental in bringing out a lot of feeling from us," [...] Bixler recalls. [...] "We channeled a lot of emotion into this record. He pushed us farther than <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> go. I learned to cut loose the way we do live and not to be afraid to break something or whatever." [...] While capturing the essence of At the Drive-In's live shows in a way never before seen, the record also featured some of the band's most experimental songs, including [...] "Rolodex Propaganda", [...] "Non-Zero Possibility", and [...] "Invalid Litter Dept." [...]|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, those {{voting on}} the bill were later {{surprised}} by the reaction it gained. [...] State Representative Michele Reagan reflected three months later: [...] "The majority of us who voted yes on that bill, myself included, did not expect or encourage an outcry from the public. The majority of us just voted for it because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> try to fix the problem. Nobody envisioned boycotts. Nobody anticipated the emotion, the prayer vigils. The attitude was: These are the laws, let's start following them." [...] State Representative Kyrsten Sinema, the assistant House minority leader who {{tried to stop the}} bill and voted against it, similarly reflected: [...] "I knew it would be bad, but no one thought it would be this big. No one." ...|$|E
5000|$|Discussing the lyrics, singer Julian Hamilton told Rolling Stone Australia: [...] "It's a {{break up}} song but I didn't {{want it to}} be a guy pissed off at a girl because that always sounds so wimpy. I thought it'd be cool to write it from a girl's perspective. The lyrics came out a bit weird and <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> maybe <b>we</b> <b>could</b> flog this off to a girl singer, but then I thought no, this song needs to be sung with balls!" ...|$|R

We and our {{families}} have received great indignities from the Boers; {{and although we}} are conscious {{that we should be}} of little use as troops, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do service as scouts on our own account, and have been lucky in inflicting some blows on them. I was fortunate enough to attract Colonel Yule's attention at Dundee, and he furnished me with an open letter addressed to you, and to officers commanding stations, saying that we had done so." ...|$|R

2500|$|David Lewis relates “Although we {{had been}} counseled by Joseph the Prophet to leave the mill and go to Far West, but being deceived by the {{messenger}} we sent him for council, we understood it not, for our messenger said to Joseph what shall we do {{that is at the}} mill, Joseph said gather up all of you and come to Far West. [...] "What?" [...] said the messenger, whose name was Jacob Hawn, the owner of mill, [...] "leave the mill and let it be burnt down? We think we can maintain it." [...] "If you maintain it" [...] said Joseph, [...] "you will do well do as you please." [...] The messenger returned and said if <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> maintain the mill it was Joseph’s council for us to do it, if we thought not, to come to Far West and we thought from the way the thing was represented it would be like cowards to leave and not try to maintain it, and as they agreed to be at peace we thought to gather up our houses would be useless, for we did not know that it was Joseph’s decided council for us to do so [...] [...] [...]” ...|$|E
2500|$|George Clinton {{produced}} the next album, Freaky Styley (1985). Clinton combined various elements of punk and funk into the band's repertoire, allowing their music to incorporate {{a variety of}} distinct styles. The album featured Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley {{on many of the}} album's tracks. The band often indulged in heavy heroin use while recording the album, which influenced the lyrics and musical direction of the album. The band had a much better relationship with Clinton than with Gill, but Freaky Styley, released on August 16, 1985, also achieved little success, failing to make an impression on any chart. The subsequent tour was also considered unproductive by the band. Despite the lack of success, the band was satisfied with Freaky Styley; Kiedis reflected, that [...] "it so surpassed anything <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have done that we were thinking we were on the road to enormity." [...] The band appeared in the 1986 movie Thrashin' (directed by David Winters and starring Josh Brolin) playing the song [...] "Blackeyed Blonde" [...] from Freaky Styley. During this time the band also appeared in the movie Tough Guys starring Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas performing the song [...] "Set It Straight" [...] at a Los Angeles nightclub.|$|E

40|$|The Early Gothic Period of English Literature {{was widely}} {{scrutinized}} for its sensationalism. This thesis explores {{the value of}} the genre by offering an alternative view of the monster typically portrayed. A close textual analysis of The Mysteries of Udolpho, The Monk, and Frankenstein prove that the real monster is society, and more importantly ourselves. While this thesis dissects the innate characteristics of humankind in the novels, the author hopes that the readers will recognize the same themes in contemporary society. As students of the learned world, we all can acknowledge that Gothic fiction can teach us more than <b>we</b> ever <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> learn...|$|R

Eight years later, in 2004, Alberto joined Romance 106.7 FM colleague Ariel Ramírez {{to participate in the}} Walt Disney World Half Marathon as part of “Team in Training”, a program that raises funds for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, dedicated to finding a cure for blood related cancers. In order to accomplish this goal, he abandoned a sedentary lifestyle and started training four to five times a week, several miles per day. “If we did it, almost everyone can. Trust me: <b>We</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> be marathon runners,” Alberto told the local press at that time.|$|R

We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins and let our hair grow. It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples.

5000|$|In 1980, Reliance also {{acquired}} Foucar, Ray & Simon, {{a specialty}} tube distributor in Hayward, California, with a branch in Portland, Oregon. The Hayward center was eventually merged into the Reliance center in Santa Clara. The Portland operation foundered and then closed in 1984. Gimbel told Metal Service News the acquisition {{had been a}} mistake. [...] "Foucar was probably the second oldest service center in California, with a good reputation. They'd done well over the years, but I guess they'd gotten rigor mortis. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> change all that. We tried and tried to change it, and it didn't work. So we had to admit defeat and close up the place." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{next day}} we walked around the walls two or three times, and found a place where <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get up, {{if we had a}} rope {{fastened}} {{to the top of the}} wall.

Henceforth till we feed ourselves again, we live on sufferance, and dangle before all eyes the apple of discord. A self-supporting Britain, free from this carking fear, would become once more a liberalising power.

2500|$|It was {{an unusual}} game at Grace Road, which was all done by 3.30pm.

Marcus Trescothick, the Somerset captain, who only made 11 said, [...] "Conditions were not conducive to one-day cricket, that's for sure.

Among the more drastic changes is the deletion of the chapters on the Algae and the Fungi & Lichens in the Bibliography, as we threatened to do in the last issue.

The results have proven that the application of adapted massage, Shiatsu, and stretching programs on postpartum women {{over the course of the}} first eight weeks after birth (three sessions per week during the first four weeks, and two sessions per week during the following four) contributes to the acceleration of the process of returning to normal physical and emotional parameters and to the improvement of their self-esteem, successfully preventing the postnatal depression...|$|R
60|$|We had a {{good many}} discussions about our grapnel.

This would deaden the sound when it struck, but would not prevent the points of the hooks from holding to the inner edge of the wall. Everything now seemed all right, except that we had no object in view after we got over the wall. I always like to have some reason for doing a thing, especially when it's pretty hard to do.

60|$|It was a laughable {{thought to}} us, {{what had become}} of our cheerful {{wandering}} Hebrews. We could not suppose they had reached a destination. The meanest boy could lead them miles {{out of their way to}} see a gopher-hole. Boys we felt to be their special danger; none others were of that exact pitch of cheerful irrelevancy to exercise a kindred sway upon their minds: but before the attractions of a boy their most settled resolutions would be wax. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> follow in fancy these three aged Hebrew truants wandering in and out on hilltop and in thicket, a demon boy trotting far ahead, their will-o'-the-wisp conductor; and at last about midnight, the wind still roaring in the darkness, we had a vision of all three on their knees upon a mountain-top around a glow-worm.|$|E

This was on account of Brown's character--great generosity and kindliness, but complicated with unusual shyness and diffidence, particularly in the presence of ladies. There was his love for Mary, in a hopeful state but not yet secure--just in a condition, indeed, where its affair must be handled with great tact, and no mistakes made, no offense given. And there was the mother wavering, half willing-by adroit and flawless diplomacy to be won over, now, or perhaps never at all. Also, there were the helpless Old People yonder in the woods waiting-their fate and Brown's happiness to be determined by what Brown should do within the next two seconds. Mary was reaching for the lap-robe; Brown must decide-there was no time to be lost.|$|E
