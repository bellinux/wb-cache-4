We are the advance guard of a massive moral revolution that is not confined to the Negro, nor is it confined to civil rights, for our white allies know that they are not free while we are not.|$|E
25|$|I want to {{conclude}} with a few remarks about the domestic scene {{and the role of}} Social Democrats, U.S.A. in it. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> political party with our own candidates. We are not alone in our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. Our spiritual task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.|$|E
500|$|Deep Purple debuted at The Roundhouse Theatre in London on 6 July 1968, {{opening for}} The Byrds, before The Gun and The Deviants. Their {{performance}} was badly {{received by the}} audience and by other attending musicians, including Mick Jagger. In spite of this, the band went on playing their live set in local pubs and festivals, but were received coldly and ignored by the press. In an interview with Melody Maker, Ian Paice explained that their lack of touring and promotion in England {{was due to the}} low wages they were offered and {{to the fact that they}} had very few danceable numbers to attract audience. He stressed that [...] "we make a point of warning promoters that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> dancing group." ...|$|E

That is a question for which the material necessary for <b>a</b> conclusive answer <b>is</b> <b>not</b> fully available. It {{depends on what the}} essential element is in the constitution of the British Commonwealth.|$|R
500|$|However, {{because of}} the devastation caused in Haiti, these plans were postponed. Phillips said that Jones had called Lionel and said, [...] "this is what this song is written for, as a {{fundraising}} vehicle for causes, tragedies, catastrophes like this. Why don't we take over the process, call our friends, and actually do this?" [...] Lionel understood the urgency of Haiti, and in January 2010, {{it was agreed that}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] would be re-recorded to help benefit Haiti, similar to how the original recording helped famine relief in Africa. Richie commented, [...] "Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a hit record to make someone decide to save a life. I want this song to be the battle cry again. Every once in a while, you have to wake the world up. We slept right through Katrina. If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> socially aware culture, we're going to fail." ...|$|E

Wim Pijbes, the museum director, said of the exhibition, [...] "It boosts our image. Of course, we do the Old Masters but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> 'yesterday institution'. It's for now. And Damien Hirst shows this in a very strong way." ...|$|E

On 22 February 2011, he held an exclusive interview with OnIslam.net, dismissing the allegation that he wanted a religious state established in Egypt: [...] "On the contrary, my speech supported establishing a civil state with a religious background, I am totally against theocracy. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> state for mullahs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kurzweil {{introduces}} several thought experiments {{related to}} brain implants and brain scanning; he concludes <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> collection of atoms, instead {{we are a}} pattern which can manifest itself in different mediums at different times. He tackles the mystery of how self-awareness and consciousness can arise from mere matter, but without resolution. Based partly on his Unitarian religious education Kurzweil feels [...] "all of these views are correct when viewed together, but insufficient when viewed one at a time" [...] {{while at the same}} time admitting this is [...] "contradictory and makes little sense".|$|E

60|$|There is {{something}} in the contemplation of the mode in which America has been settled, that, in a noble breast, should forever extinguish the prejudices of national dislikes. Settled {{by the people of}} all nations, all nations may claim her for their own. You can not spill a drop of American blood without spilling the blood of the whole world. Be he Englishman, Frenchman, German, Dane, or Scot; the European who scoffs at an American, calls his own brother Raca, and stands in danger of the judgment. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> narrow tribe of men, with a bigoted Hebrew nationality--whose blood has been debased in the attempt to ennoble it, by maintaining an exclusive succession among ourselves. No: our blood is as the flood of the Amazon, made up of a thousand noble currents all pouring into one. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> nation, so much as a world; for unless we may claim all the world for our sire, like Melchisedec, we are without father or mother.|$|E

On 18 May spokesman Samir Dilou stated again in an interview: [...] "We do <b>not</b> want <b>a</b> theocracy. We want a democratic state, that is characterised by the idea of liberty. The people are to decide themselves how they live. ... <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> Islamist party, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> an Islamic party, that also gets its bearings by the principles of the Quran." [...] Moreover, he named Turkey a model, regarding the relation of state and religion, and compared the party's Islamic democratic ideology to Christian democracy in Italy and Germany. A foreign journalist attending Ennahdha rallies in Tunisia noted enthusiasm for the Palestinian cause and the slogan [...] "no to American military bases, no to foreign interventions." ...|$|R
