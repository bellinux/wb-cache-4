5|$|The Cascade Range is {{dramatically}} different in climate from west to east. The west side is heavily forested and features trees such as Douglas firs, <b>western</b> <b>hemlock,</b> Pacific silver firs, and Alaska yellow cedars. East of the Cascades, where Yamsay lies, the climate becomes much drier, even arid. Precipitation significantly declines and vegetation becomes more sparse, with lodgepole pine, white fir, ponderosa pine, and juniper. To the south, chaparral {{plants such as}} beargrass and bitterbrush prevail.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} found in the Pacific Northwest region of North America where it grows on large (at least 1m diameter) {{specimens}} of noble fir (Abies procera), Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), or <b>western</b> <b>hemlock</b> (Tsuga heterophylla). Bridgeoporus nobilissimus causes a brown rot in its tree hosts. Genetic analysis shows that the fungus is more prevalent than fruit body distribution indicates.|$|E
5|$|Washington's first {{official}} symbol was its flag, adopted in 1923. While some symbols, including the state flower and state seal, were selected before then, {{they were not}} adopted by the Legislature until later. Washington's second symbol was <b>western</b> <b>hemlock,</b> selected as the state tree in 1947. Fourteen symbols were added between 1950 and 2000. Five symbols have been adopted in the 21st century. The newest symbol of Washington is the Olympic marmot, declared the state endemic mammal in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Forests of large, {{coniferous}} trees (Western red cedars, Douglas-firs, <b>Western</b> <b>hemlocks,</b> firs, pines, spruces, and others) dominate {{most of the}} Cascade Range. Cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers (largely a result of oceanic influence) favor evergreen species, whereas mild temperatures and rich soils promote fast and prolonged growth.|$|R

5000|$|A hiking guide {{calls the}} river [...] "one {{of the most}} remote large streams {{in the state of}} Oregon". The Hillockburn Trail, which {{provides}} the only access to the lower river corridor, is 3.2 mi round trip. It is usually open from mid-March to December, is moderately difficult, and has an elevation gain of 900 ft. It runs from Forest Road 45 west of the river to a campsite along the stream. Trail uses include hiking, mountain biking, backpacking, and access to catch-and-release fishing for trout. Vegetation along the trail consists mainly of Douglas-firs and <b>Western</b> <b>hemlocks</b> with an understory of salal, sword fern, and Oregon-grape.|$|R
5|$|Basalt, mostly {{covered by}} silt in the uplands and {{sediment}} in the lowlands, underlies the Balch Creek watershed. The {{upper part of}} the watershed includes private residential land, the Audubon Society of Portland nature sanctuary, and part of Forest Park. Mixed conifer forest of Coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and <b>western</b> <b>hemlock</b> with a well-developed understory of shrubs and flowering plants is the natural vegetation. Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use Forest Park. A small population of coastal cutthroat trout resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major water body in Portland that met state standards for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Ramaria {{botrytis}} {{is found}} in Africa (Tunisia), Australia, Asia (including the eastern Himalayas of India, Nepal, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, China, the Far East of Russia, and Turkey) and Europe (including the Netherlands, France, Portugal, Italy, Bulgaria, and Spain). It is also present in Mexico and in Guatemala. Widely distributed in North America, it is most common in the southeast and along the Pacific Coast. The variety R.botrytis var. aurantiiramosa, limited in distribution to Lewis County, Washington, associates with Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and <b>western</b> <b>hemlock</b> (Tsuga heterophylla). Variety compactospora is known from Sardinia, Italy, {{where it has been}} found growing in sandy soil in forests comprising strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), tree heath (Erica arborea), and holm oak (Quercus ilex).|$|E
5|$|The Chetco River {{watershed}} {{is covered}} primarily by temperate coniferous forest, which includes {{species such as}} Douglas fir, <b>western</b> <b>hemlock,</b> white fir, Port Orford cedar, California incense cedar, and Sitka spruce. Jeffrey pine, knobcone pine, and golden chinquapin have also been identified. Hardwoods including tanoak, bigleaf maple, red alder, and Pacific madrone are common. Manzanita, hazelnut, vine maple, western skunk cabbage, and multiple species of berries and grasses make up the understory. Kalmiopsis, a flowering evergreen shrub and the namesake of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, only grows in the Siskiyou Mountains. Several noxious weeds have also been identified, including gorse, Scotch broom, blackberries, and thistles.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with <b>Western</b> <b>hemlock</b> and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. <b>Western</b> <b>hemlock</b> and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} common trees that grow in the Big Butte Creek {{watershed}} include four species of fir, two species of pine, incense cedar, and <b>western</b> <b>hemlock.</b> The understory contains plants such as Pacific yew, Pacific madrone, chinquapin, and vine maple. Several invasive species {{have been reported in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, such as Kentucky bluegrass, common bent, drooping brome, and redtop. The spread of these species is most likely due to overgrazing. Sensitive species that grow in the watershed include Howell's yampah, Egg Lake monkeyflower, clustered lady's slipper, green-flowered ginger, Mount Mazama collomia, and Detling's microseris. Mallow and popcorn flower have also been discovered in riparian zones. The Poverty Flats Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) is home to several rare species of plants, including Bellinger's meadowfoam, Howell's yampah, and Rocky Mountain woodsia.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Columbia's {{drainage}} basin (which, at , {{is about the}} size of France) lies roughly between the Rocky Mountains on the east and the Cascade Mountains on the west. In the United States and Canada the term watershed is often used to mean {{drainage basin}}. The term Columbia Basin is used to refer not only to the entire drainage basin but also to subsets of the river's full watershed, such as the relatively flat and unforested area in eastern Washington bounded by the Cascades, the Rocky Mountains, and the Blue Mountains. Within the watershed are diverse landforms including mountains, arid plateaus, river valleys, rolling uplands, and deep gorges. Grand Teton National Park lies in the watershed, as well as parts of Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, and North Cascades National Park. Canadian National Parks in the watershed include Kootenay National Park, Yoho National Park, Glacier National Park, and Mount Revelstoke National Park. Hells Canyon, the deepest gorge in North America, and the Columbia Gorge are in the watershed. Vegetation varies widely, ranging from <b>western</b> <b>hemlock</b> and western redcedar in the moist regions to sagebrush in the arid regions. The watershed provides habitat for 609known fish and wildlife species, including the bull trout, bald eagle, gray wolf, grizzly bear, and Canada lynx.|$|E

Extensive mortality has occurred, particularly east of the Appalachian Mountains. The Asian species are resistant to this pest, and the two <b>western</b> American <b>hemlocks</b> are moderately resistant. In North America, hemlocks are also attacked by hemlock looper. Larger infected hemlocks have large, relatively high root systems that can bring other trees down if one falls. The foliage of young trees is often browsed by deer, and the seeds are eaten by finches and small rodents.|$|R
5000|$|Cicuta douglasii (<b>western</b> water <b>hemlock)</b> is a {{poisonous}} {{plant in the}} family Apiaceae. It is a perennial plant that grows in wet places such as marshes, stream banks, slough margins, ditches, meadows, and wet pastures. [...] The roots of this plant are thick and tuberous, with many smaller tubers coming from the main tuber. [...] This root structure allows the water hemlock to adapt and survive wet conditions. Water hemlock is most abundant in British Columbia, and is indigenous to North America. [...] In North America it primarily grows {{from the base of}} the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific coast, stretching all the way from Alaska down to California. Water necessities limit this plant from growing in open rangelands.|$|R

40|$|<b>Western</b> water <b>hemlock</b> is a {{perennial}} {{plant in the}} parsley and carrot family that grows in wet areas of meadows, pastures, and streams. It has small white flowers that grow in umbrella-like clusters which each produce two seeds. The brown kidney-shaped seeds develop late in June and are dispersed mostly by wind and water. The compound leaves are; alternate, have jagged edges, and are about two inches long and 3 / 4 inch wide. It is distinguished from water parsley by the leaf veins- water hemlock’s leaf veins go from the mid-rib {{to the base of}} the notches on the leaf margin. In Thurston County, water hemlock grows about three feet tall. <b>Western</b> water <b>hemlock</b> has a bulb-like rootstalk that contains several hollow chambers and produces a highly poisonous oil (cicutoxin) that has a strong carrot odor. When the rootstalk is broken, the oil is exposed to air and turns bright yellow-orange. Off the rootstalk grows thick root tubers and other slender, hairy roots. Impacts: Water hemlock is the most toxic plant native to North America. Only a small amount of the toxic oil from the plant is needed to produce poisoning in livestock or humans. The roots are the most toxic part, but the green seed heads are also highly poisonous. The leaves and stems are poisonous in the early stages of growth, but lose much of their toxicity when mature. (Cicuta douglasii) Livestock usually show signs of poisoning fifteen minutes to six hours after they eat the plant. Symptoms include: muscle twitch, rapid pulse, rapid breathing, tremors, convulsions, excessive salivation or frothing at the mouth, and dilation of the pupils. Cattle poisonings from water hemlock are frequently reported and severe poisoning can result in death. Although human deaths from water hemlock poisoning are relatively infrequent, fiv...|$|R
