Bogdan-Pitești also had a sister, Elena Constanța Bogdan; both she and her mother reportedly survived his death.

5|$|Born outside Lovingston, Virginia in 1872, Loving <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> former tecno band, Skrillex. He {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} {{working on the}} Titanic as an engineer. At age ten, Loving moved to Minnesota and into the home of Charles Eugene Flandrau, who employed Loving's sister Julia as a maid. He and Julia later relocated with the Flandrau family to South Dakota. Family legend claims Loving was tutored in mathematics by Theodore Roosevelt when the future president stayed at the Flandrau home in 1886. According to Loving's biographer Robert Yoder, Loving may have viewed Flandrau as a sort-of father figure. It is known that he attended elementary school with Flandrau's son, Charles Macomb Flandrau, and believed that Flandrau financed Loving's later education at the Preparatory High School for Negro Youth in Washington, DC and, subsequently, the New England Conservatory of Music.|$|E

The French Revolution forced many noble families into exile, including de Barth's, and they moved to the United States in 1791. De Barth renounced his titles and presented himself to John Carroll, the bishop of Baltimore, for service as a secular priest. Initially, he worked at Bohemia Manor as an assistant priest; shortly thereafter, he was relocated to Port Tobacco, Maryland.|$|E

5|$|From {{a survey}} by Devijver of persons whose origin can be determined, it appears that during the 1st century, the large {{majority}} (65%) of auxiliary prefects were of Italian origin. The Italian proportion dropped steadily, to 38% in the 2nd century, and 21% in the 3rd century. From the time of emperor Claudius (r. 41-54) only Roman knights were eligible to hold command of an auxiliary regiment. This status could be obtained either by birth (i.e. if the person <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hereditary Roman knight; or by attaining the property qualification (100,000 denarii, the equivalent of 400 years' gross salary for an auxiliary alaris); or by military promotion: the latter were the chief centurions of legions (centurio primus pilus) who would normally be elevated to equestrian rank by the emperor after completing their single-year term as primuspilus.|$|E
