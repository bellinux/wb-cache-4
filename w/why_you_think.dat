[...] Oliver St. John Gogarty, in his literary memoir As I Was Going Down Sackville Street, considers [...] the Pillar [...] "the grandest thing we have in Dublin", where [...] "the statue in whiter stone gazed forever south towards Trafalgar and the Nile". [...] That Pillar, says Gogarty, [...] "marks {{the end of a}} civilization, the culmination of the great [...] period of eighteenth century Dublin". [...] Yeats's 1927 poem [...] "The Three Monuments" [...] has Parnell, Nelson and O'Connell [...] on their respective monuments, mocking Ireland's post-independence leaders for their rigid morality and lack of courage, the obverse of the qualities of the [...] "three old rascals".A later writer, Brendan Behan, in his Confessions of an Irish Rebel (1965) wrote from a Fenian perspective that Ireland owed Nelson nothing and that Dublin's poor regarded the Pillar as [...] "a gibe at their own helplessness in their own country". In his poem [...] "Dublin" [...] (1939), written as the remaining vestiges of British overlordship were being removed from Ireland, Louis MacNeice envisages [...] "Nelson on his pillar/ Watching his world collapse".Austin Clarke's 1957 poem [...] "Nelson's Pillar, Dublin" [...] scorns the various schemes to remove the monument and concludes [...] "Let him watch the sky/ With those who rule. Stone eye/ And telescopes [...] can prove/ Our blessings are above".|$|E

6000|$|Now, do {{you think}} so? When I say [...] "The kingdom of God is {{salvation}}," [...] {{do you think}} it is? Have you even any clear notion of what I mean when I say it? Some of you have not, I am afraid; you cannot see at first sight what salvation and the kingdom of God have to do with each other. And <b>why?</b> <b>You</b> <b>think</b> salvation means being saved from hell, and going to heaven, when you die. And so it does: but I trust in God and in God's holy scripture, that it means a great deal more; for I think it means being unfit for hell, and fit for heaven, before we die. At least, so says the Church Catechism, which teaches every little child to thank his Heavenly Father for having brought him into such a state of salvation in this life, even while he is young. Thanks be to The Spirit of God which taught our fore-fathers to put these precious words into the Church Catechism, to guard us against falling into the very same mistake as the Pharisees of old fell into, when they asked our Lord when the kingdom of God was to come. And, believe me, it is easy enough and common enough to fall into the same mistake.|$|E
