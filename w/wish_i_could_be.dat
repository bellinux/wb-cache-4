500|$|... 2002: In September, sportswriter Peter King {{conducted}} {{an interview with}} Favre during spring training. Favre {{told him that he}} missed home and was thinking more and more about retirement. When then head-coach Mike Sherman told the players they could have off on Saturday and Sunday, Favre replied [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> on my lawn mower back home." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Song began {{appearing}} {{in the role of}} spoiled heiress London Tipton in the Disney Channel Original Series, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. The role was named [...] "Paris" [...] in an early script and alludes to Paris Hilton (London spoofing Paris, and Tipton {{is the name of the}} hotel her father owns in the show). She got the role without an audition and was surprised to find her friend Ashley Tisdale working in the show. Song says, [...] "London is my fantasy person, I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> her. I wish I had her closet." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Gaga the Grammy {{performance}} {{was inspired by}} many things, including Gregorian music, Alvin Ailey dance moves and Martha Graham's dance energy. On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno she explained that Smith inspired her to [...] "whip my hair {{back and forth on}} stage," [...] referring to Smith's similar named song. Gaga continued that the incubating vessel was meant to signify an artistic statement of birthing a new race with no prejudice. The idea occurred to her when she was in Amsterdam on her tour bus, and was thinking about birth and embryos. She had thought to herself, [...] "Gosh, the thing I hate most about doing award shows is, it can be [...] distracting... I want to exist only for my fans and for the stage. I don't want to exist in this machine or this circus that is the industry. I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> encapsulated for three days and just think only about my performance, think only about the album, think only about the future of my fans. So that's what I did." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV felt that the {{performance was}} [...] "surprisingly" [...] sparse compared to Gaga's previous [...] "over-the-top" [...] endeavors. Soraya Roberts from New York Daily News was disappointed with the [...] "highly expected" [...] performance, feeling that it had copied Madonna and her Blond Ambition World Tour choreography. Jason Lipscultz from Billboard described the performance as [...] "spirited", and felt that Gaga's appearance inside the egg was one of the memorable moments of the Grammy Awards. Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly praised the performance saying that although there were definite influences of Madonna in it, the performance was {{one of the highlights of}} the show. Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone concurred that [...] "It should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga's performance of her new single 'Born This Way' was the evening's most visually stunning and bizarre spectacle." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Los Angeles Times, The Atlantic, Slate, and Time all {{published}} opinion columns {{where the}} writer thought {{the incident was}} not getting as much media coverage as it deserved. Megan McArdle explains that she didn't cover it because it made her ill, but also how being pro-choice influenced writers saying [...] "most of us {{tend to be less}} interested in sick-making stories if the sick-making was done by 'our side,'" [...] saying, [...] "this story should have been covered much more than it was — covered as a national policy issue, not a 'local crime story.'" [...] Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, claims he wasn’t aware of the story until Thursday, 11 April, when readers began emailing him about it, saying “I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> conscious of all stories everywhere, but I can’t be". [...] They ultimately decided that, in fact, the story warranted attention because of [...] "the seriousness and scope of the alleged crimes and because this was a case that resonated in policy arguments and national politics", adding “In retrospect, we regret not having staffed the trial sooner. But, as you know, we don’t have unlimited resources, and [...] {{there is a lot of}} competition for our staff’s attention". He insisted that “we never decide what to cover for ideological reasons, no matter what critics might claim. [...] Accusations of ideological motives are easy to make, even if they’re not supported by the facts". The New York Times also acknowledged the lack of coverage and reported on the online campaign and subsequent increase in coverage of the case. While Powers' piece clearly sparked debate among journalists, Katherine Bindley also highlights contrasting views, as does Paul Farhi. [...] A column on Salon.com questioned whether the Gosnell case was an example of liberal media bias, saying that conservative media and politicians had also given little attention to the story until April 2013.|$|E

60|$|I lived {{six years}} in this happy but unhappy condition, in which time I brought him three children, but only the first of them lived; and though I removed twice in those six years, yet I came back the sixth year to my first lodgings at Hammersmith. Here it was that I was one morning {{surprised}} with a kind but melancholy letter from my gentleman, intimating {{that he was very}} ill, and was afraid he should have another fit of sickness, but that his wife's relations being in the house with him, it would not be practicable to have me with him, which, however, he expressed his great dissatisfaction in, and that he <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> allowed to tend and nurse him as I did before.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{good enough}} for you,' she replied, {{as she began to}} arrange his things for dressing.

6000|$|... 'Lie down by me; please {{put your}} arms round me. There! Oh! {{it is so}} comfortable. Why did I never find it out before? I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a little child, and begin again from the time my father made me over to you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> sure," [...] she mused. [...] "I have {{a feeling}} of being bowled over, and yet I hesitate. The two are not compatible. Perhaps I never shall be bowled over by any man. And you don't seem to help me in the least." ...|$|E
