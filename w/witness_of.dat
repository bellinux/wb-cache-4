The Intensive Individual Play Therapy comparison group, consisting <b>of</b> 11 child <b>witnesses,</b> and the non-treatment control group, consisting <b>of</b> 11 child <b>witnesses,</b> were utilized from the Kot (1995) study. The Intensive Sibling Group Play Therapy comparison group was utilized from the Tyndall-Lind (1999) study. Children in all studies completed the Joseph Preschool and Primary Self-concept Screening Test and the Child Behavior Checklist.

Analyses of Covariance revealed the children in the experimental group significantly increased in self-concept, and significantly reduced overall behavior problems. A comparison of t-test scores of the pretests and posttests revealed mothers in the experimental group significantly increased communication of empathy to their children...|$|R
