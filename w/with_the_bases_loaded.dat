40|$|Abstract—With the {{expectation}} of increasing market share of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs), utilities {{expect to see a}} significant increase in energy demand and system peak as a result of PEVs recharging their batteries from the grid, if the charging is not controlled at the distribution system level. By making the grid ”smarter”, utilities would be able to maximize utilization of existing assets and defer capital investments, while maintaining system security and reliability. The current research proposes a modeling framework for day-ahead dispatch and dynamic control of PEV loads as well as scheduling of taps and capacitors. The first step of the proposed work, which is presented in this paper, involves the development of a static Genetic Algorithm (GA) -based optimization model that determines the day-ahead schedule for PEV loads, taps and capacitors, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>load</b> an...|$|R

Kevin Tapani allowed {{successive}} singles to Brent Mayne and Mueller to open the inning before Terry Mulholland relieved him. Stan Javier singled to score Mayne and Ellis Burks then walked to load the bases. Bonds came to bat <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> for the second time in the game and lined out to deep right field, scoring Mueller on a sacrifice fly and Javier advanced to third base. Rod Beck entered and got successive outs by Jeff Kent, which scored Javier, and Joe Carter to end the game 5–3 for the Cubs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ninth}} inning, Sad Sam Jones, a 22-year veteran in the American League, {{replaced}} Dutch Ruether, who had replaced pitcher Shawkey. Jones gave up an inside-the-park home run to Thevenow. Thevenow {{had only two}} other home runs in his career, {{both of which were}} inside-the-park and during the 1926 regular season. Jones then walked Douthit and Hornsby and gave up a single to Southworth. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> and two outs {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, Bottomley hit a fly ball to center fielder Earle Combs. The Yankees did not score in the bottom of the ninth inning, and lost the game to the Cardinals by a 6–2 score. Alexander pitched a complete game, allowed hits in only two of the nine innings and did not allow a Yankee hit after the third inning. He also had a series-high 10 strikeouts, allowing four hits, one earned run and one walk. Meanwhile, the Yankees' starter Shocker allowed ten hits and five earned runs, including a home run, in seven innings of work. Shawkey had a perfect inning with two strikeouts, while Jones gave up two hits and allowed two walks in the ninth inning.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{immediately}} {{took advantage}} of Sherdel {{in the top of}} the tenth inning. Koenig led things off by singling into left field. Sherdel threw a wild pitch to Ruth, and Koenig advanced to second base. Ruth then walked, and Meusel followed with a sacrifice bunt straight to pitcher Sherdel. Meusel was out at first base, but Ruth and Koenig were safe at second and third base, respectively. Gehrig was intentionally walked, loading the bases. Lazzeri hit a fly ball to left field, and Koenig tagged up on the play to score a run and give the Yankees a one-run lead. Mike Gazella, in place of Joe Dugan at third base, was hit by a pitch from Sherdel. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> again, Severeid popped up to second baseman Rogers Hornsby to end the Yankee rally. The Cardinals got a single from Thevenow in the bottom of the tenth inning, but they could not score any runs. The game ended with the Yankees winning by a score of 3–2. Both Pennock and Sherdel pitched ten-inning complete games. Sherdel gave up nine hits and two earned runs, while walking five and striking out two. Pennock finished the game giving up just seven hits and two runs, while striking out four batters.|$|E

Greinke struck out seven while allowing just four hits in seven scoreless innings as the Dodgers won {{the first game of the}} weekend series against the [...] Padres at Petco Park, 3–0. The Dodgers hit four home runs on April 25 as they won a slugfest <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Padres, 11–8. Andre Ethier's home run and three hits on the night gave him 22 homers and 143 hits in his career against San Diego, the most by any player against that team. The victory was a costly one, however, as starting pitcher Brandon McCarthy suffered a torn Ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow, a season-ending injury. Scott Baker was called up from Oklahoma City to start the next game and pitched well but the offense failed to produce and the Dodgers lost the final game of the road trip, 3–1.|$|R
50|$|The score {{would remain}} 4-2 until {{the bottom of}} the 6th, where the Royals mustered the first of their many comebacks of this postseason. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> Astros {{threatening}} to take a 2-0 series lead back to Houston, where the Royals would have to face eventual AL Cy Young winner Dallas Keuchel, Lorenzo Cain got a rally started with a double.

5|$|Wilson's 2012 season {{would be}} short-lived. With the Giants leading the Colorado Rockies 4–1 {{entering}} {{the bottom of}} the ninth inning on April 12, he made his second appearance of the season to get the save for the Giants. He walked in a run to make it 4–2, but retired Marco Scutaro <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> to earn the save. He injured his elbow during the game and underwent Tommy John surgery for the second time in his career on April 19, causing him to miss the remainder of the season. During his injury shortened season, Wilson made only 2 appearances with an ERA of 9.00 and 1 save. The Giants went on to win their second World Series in three years. Wilson expressed confidence in an interview on April 15 that he would return to the Giants in 2013. However, because he was coming off an injury and would be owed at least $6.8 million for 2013, he was non-tendered after the season, which made him a free agent for the first time in his career. As of the end of the 2012 season, he ranked third all-time in saves as a Giant with 171, behind only Robb Nen (206) and Rod Beck (199).|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} 12appearances of 2009, Rivera {{surrendered}} four {{home runs and}} had a 3.97ERA, leading to speculation about his cutter's effectiveness and his shoulder's health at age 39. As the season progressed, his numbers improved, and he reached a milestone on June28 by becoming the second pitcher with 500regular season saves. In the same game, while batting against fellow closer Francisco Rodríguez, he collected his first career run batted in by walking <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded.</b> With 23saves in 24opportunities and a 2.43ERA in the season's first half, Rivera was named an All-Star for the tenth time. At the 2009 MLB All-Star Game, he set a record by saving his fourth career All-Star Game. In the season's second half, Rivera allowed earned runs in only two of his final 40appearances, while he set a new personal best for consecutive save opportunities converted with 36. He finished the regular season with a 1.76ERA, 44saves in 46opportunities, and a 0.90WHIP. In the postseason, he pitched 16innings, allowing one earned run and saving five games, and he clinched the Yankees' victory in the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies—his fifth championship. He was the only closer who did not record a loss or blown save that postseason. Rivera collected several awards at season's end, including his third Delivery Man Award, his fifth AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, and the 2009 Sporting News Pro Athlete of the Year Award. Reflecting on the decade's end, ESPN.com's Jerry Crasnick called Rivera the most valuable major league pitcher of the previous 10 years.|$|E

40|$|International audienceLong-term {{planning}} {{models are}} useful to describe future energy and technology options and to analyze environmental issues. They propose solutions for meeting future energy consumption. Focusing on the electricity sector, {{we argue that}} in order to provide a more relevant assessment of the power supply system ahead we need to tackle both flexibility needs and network reliability. On the one hand, flexibility is integrated in long-term planning models as an additional criterion for new investment decisions: it allows electricity generation capacity with short start-up periods {{to be part of the}} mix to satisfy peak demand, despite their higher marginal costs in comparison <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cost of <b>base</b> <b>load</b> technologies. On <b>the</b> other hand, and in order to assess network reliability, a suitable representation of dynamic dissipative processes over the electrical network is necessary. We introduce the notions of conveyance and reliability losses and their qualitative impacts on power transmission. We propose a methodology to exhibit the level of losses associated with a given level of reliability, whether generation capacities are centralized or decentralized. Our methodology is based on a thermodynamic description of the electric system and lumps it into a "one-loop grid". It provides a figure for the amount of reactive power and kinetic reserve needed to ensure network reliability and face admissible load fluctuations...|$|R
