25|$|When World War I {{broke out}} on 4 August 1914 No.9r was nearly ready for erection, and despite {{competing}} demands for materials and manpower for other projects, construction continued {{during the first}} months of the war. However, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that the project was no longer favoured by the Admiralty: Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty was known to be unenthusiastic about airships, and on 12 March 1915 he cancelled the order for the ship. The reasons given for this decision were that it was expected that the war would be finished in 1915, and that the vessel would not be operational by then and thus was a waste of valuable resources.|$|E

The schools by their nature, a Federal service academy and a public university, differ radically in terms of culture and lifestyle. For many years, the University of Maryland possessed the reputation of a blue-collar, working-class school. Some students viewed the Naval Academy, with its strictly regimented culture, as elitist. A former Terrapins linebacker, Jerry Fishman, believed that many Midshipmen [...] "thought they were far superior to the Maryland redneck coal miners."

Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.|$|E

[...] Grace was scarcely kinder, noting that he was [...] "inclined to think that he ought to have been no-balled in every over." [...] Despite the widespread opinion against his action, the umpires, themselves professional, were reluctant to no ball him. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> in the press that the biggest fault lay with the cricket authorities; both the umpires and the MCC; The Daily News, echoed by Cricket magazine, said that [...] "no blame can possibly attach to a bowler who continues a delivery which is habitual with him ... when the proper authorities decline [...] their disapproval of it." [...] As a batsman, he was an aggressive tail-ender, while he {{was considered}} a good fielder with a long throw. In all first-class matches, Crossland claimed 322 wickets at an average of 10.95. He took ten wickets in a match on six occasions, and five wickets in an innings 25 times. He scored 1,172 runs with a high score of 51.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> I can't describe. I still get it every time I get into a race car." [...] Andretti's first racing experience was in a new youth racing league called Formula Junior [...] in Ancona, Italy when he was thirteen years old.

In an interview during an , Mr. Andretti recounts the story of his early days of Dirt Track racing in Pennsylvania with his brother, Aldo, and implies that he and his brother made up the story of racing in the Formula Junior league because they looked the part after having purchased racing suits from Italy.|$|E

500|$|Given {{the task}} of {{overhauling}} the Cardinals by owner Gussie Busch (and specifically to unload Templeton), Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager Jack McKeon at the 1981 baseball winter meetings. While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal. [...] McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece. It was then that Padres manager Dick Williams informed Herzog that a no-trade clause had been included in Smith's 1981 contract. Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in San Diego, {{but he was still}} interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say. While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday. Smith later recalled that, [...] "Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there to talk to us was more than enough to convince me that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 1, 1978, {{following}} the monthly meeting of general {{authorities in the}} Salt Lake Temple, Kimball asked his counselors and the ten members of Quorum of the Twelve Apostles then present to remain behind for a special meeting. Kimball began by describing his studies, thoughts, and prayers on removing the restriction and on his growing assurance that {{the time had come}} for the change. Kimball asked each of the men present to share their views, and all spoke in favor of changing the policy. After all present had shared their views, Kimball led the gathered apostles in a prayer circle to seek final divine approval for the change. As Kimball prayed, many in the group recorded feeling a powerful spiritual confirmation. Bruce R. McConkie later said: [...] "There are no words to describe the sensation, but simultaneously the Twelve and the three members of the First Presidency had the Holy Ghost descend upon them and they knew that God had manifested his will.... I had had some remarkable spiritual experiences before... but nothing of this magnitude." [...] L. Tom Perry described: [...] "I felt something like the rushing of wind. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that came over the whole group. When President Kimball got up he was visibly relieved and overjoyed." [...] Gordon B.

500|$|The {{downside}} of demobilization was that around 70,000 military personnel were left unemployed. That meant {{little to the}} conscripts, and most returned home, but the career military personnel saw their livelihoods taken away, and houses, land, and money which was promised to them was either not delivered due to inadequate resources or seemed to be paid arbitrarily. Since only 5.8% of the former officers had received benefits by early 1992, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that those who had political favor had either kept their jobs in the 14% of the military which was retained or received their promised compensation. Between April and December 1992, a series of strikes were held in protest of the situation. Pockets of army veterans ("recompas") and resistance veterans ("recontras") threatened to re-arm, but realizing {{they had the same}} issues, the two sides joined forces. To pacify the groups, Chamorro integrated some of the former Contra fighters into the rural police services and established a Civil Inspectorate to investigate claims of police abuses and human rights violations. [...] She also allowed the Sandinistas' agrarian reform movement's redistribution of land to be maintained and expanded it on the Caribbean coast to meet veterans' demands. That move created conflict with the Caribbean indigenous people and infringed on forestry reserves leading to criticism. Others who had received land from the Sandinistas began to return their co-operative land titles to the large landholders who had owned them before the reforms, or simply to sell their portions to opportunists. Unable to solve the problem, Chamorro dealt with the most egregious claims and then turned the issue over to the courts to resolve individual disputes.|$|E

500|$|Following Victoria Climbié's death, the {{agencies}} in the case, {{as well as the}} child services system in general, were widely criticised. Milburn said, [...] "this was not a failing on the part of one service, it was a failing on the part of every service". Fox said Climbié's case amounted to [...] "a shocking tale of individual professional failure and systemic incompetence". Burstow said, [...] "there is a terrible sense of déjà vu in the Laming Report. The same weaknesses have led to the same mistakes, with the same missed opportunities to save a tortured child's life". Labour Party Member of Parliament Karen Buck said, [...] "the Bayswater families unit told me that there must be hundreds of other Climbié cases waiting to happen", and [...] "the Victoria Climbié inquiry highlighted how easy it is for vulnerable families to fall through the net, especially if they do not have English as a first language and are highly mobile". The 1999 Department of Health document, Working Together to Safeguard Children (now superseded), set out child protection guidance to doctors, nurses, and midwives. The Royal College of Nursing, however, said that there was evidence that many nurses did not receive proper training in these areas. Denise Platt, chief inspector of the social services inspectorate (SSI), said doctors, police officers and teachers often thought their only responsibility was to help social services, forgetting that they had a distinct role to play. Mike Leadbetter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said that many health professionals were [...] "not engaged in child protection". After the inquiry, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that senior managers had managed to escape responsibility and that only junior staff members were punished. Burstow said, [...] "the majority of children who die from abuse or neglect in this country know the perpetrator; it is within the family and by 'friends' that most abuse occurs. As a society we are still in denial about that hard truth".|$|E
