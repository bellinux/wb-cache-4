In his choreographic credo he writes: It is the mission of art in general, and the theatre in particular, to intensify thought, to elevate the mind, and to refresh the senses. Music and dance elevate the mind and refresh the senses, but it is when the story comes into play that thought is intensified.|$|E

He was one of several characters offered to Ellis, who picked him because, according to Thunderbolts editor Molly Lazer, [...] "here <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Norman, his instability, and his fixation with Spider-Man that Warren liked, so he's in the book!" ...|$|E

She said of Ford, [...] "When I was 15, {{one of the few}} people who said, 'Well done', was my drama teacher, and she was really brilliant. She was a powerful woman. Those women change your life. You always remember them. There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> her. She basically made me feel very good about myself as a 15-year-old girl." [...] Abandoning her childhood ambition to become a nurse, Ripley decided to go into acting.|$|E
500|$|Gillian Anderson {{considered}} the episode an emotionally difficult one, saying [...] "Piper Maru was challenging. There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it – having to pull from the past... how it brought {{the present and}} the past together. It was just good to play." [...] Director Kim Manners complimented Anderson's performance, stating [...] "you look at season one and look at season three and that girl exploded as an actress in terms of talent and capability." [...] The 2004 film Alien vs. Predator featured an icebreaker named the Piper Maru, the naming of the ship being a nod to this episode.|$|E

[...] There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> {{the setting for}} this painting that {{reminded him of his}} homeland. [...] He asked his brother Theo to frame an earlier version of the painting in blue and gold (blue in the front, gold on the side) and offer it to an art-dealer in the Netherlands, named Tersteeg. Tersteeg knew Van Gogh and his brother Theo when they lived in The Hague. [...] He nurtured Van Gogh's early artistic interests but their relationship suffered after Van Gogh lived with a prostitute named Sien.|$|E

While Corgan briefly considered simply tuning the guitar down a half-step and playing the song {{as if it were}} in the key of E, he said, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the E voicing that I liked. So it's absolutely, intentionally in E, not E." [...] "Today" [...] is one of the Siamese Dream songs on which Corgan took over Iha and D'arcy's duties on guitar and bass to ensure quality; Wretzky later stated that Corgan [...] "can do something in three takes where it would maybe take me 20." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Provenance" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Chris Carter and {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz, and directed by Kim Manners. Manners was very pleased with Anderson's performance in the episode. He later noted, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Gillian that was very sexual." [...] He further elaborated, [...] "There's some burning within her that really comes across on screen. She really is brilliant, and she brings so much; the camera loves her." [...] A {{large portion of the}} episode was based on the ancient astronaut theory; a theory that proposes intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans. The themes had previously been visited in the [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"" [...] story arc.|$|E
500|$|To Bamber's supporters, who {{over the}} years have {{included}} MPs and journalists, he is a victim of one of Britain's worst miscarriages of justice. The Guardian took up his case at one point. One or more Guardian journalists began corresponding with him in 2006, and two interviewed him in 2011. Describing him as [...] "clever and strategic", they wrote that there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> him that made the public unsympathetic toward him. He was [...] "handsome in a rather cruel, caddish way—he seemed to exude arrogance and indifference.... Like Meursault in the Camus novel L'Etranger, he did not seem to display the appropriate emotions." [...] He is reported to have passed a lie detector test in 2007.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{introduced}} two new {{characters in}} Gibson Praise, played by Jeff Gulka, and Diana Fowley, portrayed by Mimi Rogers. Kim Manners later said of Gulka, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> that kid's personality that really came off on screen. He really exuded an intelligence {{that was pretty}} special. Chris saw what Bob Goodwin did {{with him and he}} knew that this kid was a special storytelling tool for the chronicle of the X-Files". Chris Carter said that Fowley [...] "was a character you were destined to hate because she was a competitor for Mulder's affection with Scully. Gillian Anderson said, [...] "She didn't make it easy on Scully. I think she was aware of her effect on Mulder and on the situation." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the band}} ended its brief tour {{in support of}} Tweez, most of its members {{attended}} college. Around this time McMahan and Walford began writing together for the band's next record, creating six new songs which the band practiced throughout the summer of 1990. Slint entered River North Records in August 1990 to record Spiderland. At that time there were no vocals or lyrics prepared for the album, so the band wrote them while in the studio. The album's producer, Brian Paulson, {{was known for his}} [...] "live" [...] recording style in the studio, with minimal takes. Paulson recalled [...] "It was weird while I was doing [...] because I remember sitting there, and I just knew there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it. I've never heard anything like this.

500|$|He lived a frugal existence, {{his only}} source of income being a £20-a-week {{retainer}} he received from Island Records (...) [...] At one point he could not afford {{a new pair of}} shoes. He would often disappear for days, sometimes turning up unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: [...] "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back." [...] Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, once saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously clinically depressed. [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Wisden in 1901, as a batsman Ollivierre [...] "was {{particularly}} strong in cutting and playing to leg". J. N. Pentelow, a cricket writer, suggested in 1928 that [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Ollivierre that reminded {{one of the}} great Ranji. He was a more heavily built man than the slim Ranji of the days when we were young; but his strokes and his movements had real grace." [...] A correspondent in the Observer in 1931 remembered Ollivierre as a [...] "great batsman", while Neville Cardus, writing in 1920, named Ollivierre among a list of top-quality batsmen who did not do themselves justice at the highest level: [...] "Geniuses who have just lost their way...every one of them in possession of an excellent enough record in county cricket, but every one of them really intended by nature to wear the most precious laurels the greatest of games has to offer".|$|E

She claimed she [...] "just knew there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it" [...] and chose to include it on Taylor Swift. [...] "I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one." [...] The song is a narrative and describes a young couple who use the events in their lives in place of a regular song. The banjo-riddled song is placed {{at the end of the}} album due to its closing lyrics, a request to [...] "play it again". [...] "Invisible" [...] is ballad describing loneliness and heartache of going unnoticed. Sean Dooley of About.com writes, the [...] "piano-driven song [...] perfectly captures the awkward teenage angst we all endure—or have endured—at one time or another." ...|$|E
500|$|Murphy hounded Pat Kiernan {{until he}} got an {{audition}} at Corcadorca, and in September 1996, he made his professional acting debut on the stage, playing {{the part of a}} volatile Cork teenager in Enda Walsh's Disco Pigs. Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> him– he was incredibly enigmatic and he would walk into a room with real presence and you'd go, [...] "My God". It {{had nothing to do with}} those bloody eyes that everyone's going on about all the time." [...] Murphy observed, [...] "I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose." [...] Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork, Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university and his band. Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off.|$|E
500|$|Actress Kristen Bell {{was cast}} {{as the voice of}} Anna on March 5, 2012. Lee {{admitted}} that Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks Bell had recorded when she was young, where the actress performed several songs from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World". Bell completed her recording sessions while she was pregnant, and subsequently re-recorded some of her character's lines after her pregnancy, as her voice had deepened. Bell was called in to re-record dialogue for the film [...] "probably 20 times," [...] which is normal for lead roles in Disney animated films whose scripts are still evolving. As for her approach to the role of Anna, Bell enthused that she had [...] "dreamed of being in a Disney animated film" [...] since she was four years old, saying, [...] "I always loved Disney animation, but there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the females that was unattainable to me. Their posture was too good and they were too well-spoken, and I feel like I really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and scrappier and more excitable and awkward.
