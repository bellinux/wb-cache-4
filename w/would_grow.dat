5|$|Chef premiered on March 7, 2014 at South by Southwest, {{where it}} was the opening film of the festival and was {{attended}} by Favreau, Leguizamo, Anthony, and Platt. It was subsequently screened at the Tribeca Film Festival in April.

50|$|It is a {{humanoid}} yōkai {{that appears}} above roads, and when those that see it look up, the shidaidaka <b>would</b> accordingly <b>grow</b> taller. In reverse, {{if one looks}} down it becomes shorter, but if one doesn't look down, it <b>would</b> steadily <b>grow</b> taller.|$|R
50|$|The monsters of {{this series}} were used by Divatox. They were adapted from the monsters seen in Gekisou Sentai Carranger. To make a monster <b>grow,</b> Divatox <b>would</b> give orders to launch special torpedoes at the monster. These torpedoes when hitting the monster upon impact <b>would</b> make them <b>grow.</b> Footage from Carranger was also used to show monster growth. The monster who was <b>growing</b> <b>would</b> gain a red face and breathe smoke/steam before the monster <b>would</b> {{actually}} <b>grow.</b>|$|R
5|$|During World War II, Allison became {{involved}} in defence-related work. He was {{a consultant to the}} National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) from October 1940 to January 1941. In January 1941 the NDRC let him a contract to study the possibility of using beryllium as a neutron moderator. The team he assembled in Chicago <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> into the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|George's {{distrust}} of the Tories aided the passing of power to the Whigs. Whig dominance <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> to be so great under George that the Tories would not return to power for another half-century. After the election, the Whig-dominated Parliament passed the Septennial Act 1715, which extended the maximum duration of Parliament to seven years (although it could be dissolved earlier by the Sovereign). Thus Whigs already in power could remain in such a position for a greater period of time.|$|E
5|$|Hallie Ford {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the Ford Family Foundation. She {{graduated}} from East Central University in Oklahoma and moved to Oregon after graduation. Ford became a trustee at Willamette University in 1975. She was the wife of Kenneth W. Ford and they built Roseburg Forest Products Company in Roseburg, Oregon, beginning in 1936. From this they later started a foundation that <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> to become the Ford Family Foundation in 1996. Ford died on June 4, 2007, at age 102.|$|E

5|$|The monitor {{was renamed}} by the Peruvian Navy as Manco Cápac, after Manco Cápac, the legendary first {{king of the}} Kingdom of Cuzco which <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> into the Inca Empire. To prepare the ship for her lengthy voyage to Peru around Cape Horn, Swift & Co. added a {{breakwater}} on the bow, stepped two masts with a fore-and-aft rig to supplement her engine, and provided closures to make vents and deck openings water tight.|$|E
5|$|While Mooseheart {{began as}} a school, it soon grew to become a small {{incorporated}} village and hub of the organization, housing {{the headquarters of the}} LOOM, as well as the Women of the Moose. The population of Mooseheart <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> to 1,000 by 1920, reach a peak of 1,300 during the Great Depression and go down to approximately 500, the campus' current maximum capacity, in 1979.|$|E
5|$|In 1619, King James I {{decreed that}} the American colonists of Jamestown {{would need to}} step up efforts to do their fair share towards {{supporting}} England. The Virginia Company enacted the decree, asking Jamestown's land owners to grow and export 100 hemp plants to help support England's cause. Later the colonists <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> it to support its expansion in the Americas. George Washington grew hemp at Mount Vernon {{as one of his}} three primary crops. The use of hemp for rope and fabric later became ubiquitous throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States. Medicinal preparations of cannabis became available in American pharmacies in the 1850s following an introduction to its use in Western medicine by William O'Shaughnessy a decade earlier in 1839.|$|E

5|$|The child <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> up healthy, {{but with}} some of the {{behaviours}} of a pig. She would eat from a silver trough, and speak only in grunts or with a grunting sound to her speech. The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her parents would be concerned about what would become of her after their death. They would thus make arrangements either to find a man willing to marry her, or to use their fortune to endow a hospital on condition that the hospital take care of her for the remainder of her life.|$|E
5|$|Umar, {{apparently}} {{wanting to}} defeat the Byzantines first, employed the best Muslim troops against them. The continuing stream of Muslim reinforcements worried the Byzantines, who fearing that the Muslims with such reinforcements <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> powerful, decided {{that they had no}} choice but to attack. The reinforcements that were sent to the Muslims at Yarmouk arrived in small bands, giving the impression of a continuous stream of reinforcements, in order to demoralize the Byzantines and compel them to attack. The same tactic would be repeated again during the Battle of Qadisiyah.|$|E
5|$|Before Báthory's {{election}} to the throne of the Commonwealth, Ivan the Terrible of Russia had begun encroaching on its sphere {{of interest in the}} northeast, eventually invading the Commonwealth borderlands in Livonia; the conflict <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> to involve a number of nearby powers (outside Russia and Poland-Lithuania, also Sweden, the Kingdom of Livonia and Denmark-Norway). Each of them was vying for control of Livonia, and the resulting conflict, lasting for several years, became known as the Livonian War. By 1577 Ivan was in control of most of the disputed territory, but his conquest was short-lived. In 1578 Commonwealth forces scored a number of victories in Liviona and begun pushing Ivan's forces back; this marked the turning point in the war. Báthory, together with his chancellor Zamoyski, led the army of the Commonwealth in a series of decisive campaigns taking Polotsk in 1579 and Velikiye Luki in 1580.|$|E

5|$|Established on 25 March 1941 in {{response}} to lobbying by women wanting {{to serve in the}} war, and to free more male ground crew for overseas postings, the WAAAF was the first uniformed women's branch of an armed service in Australia, predating similar organisations in the Army and Navy. Fewer than two hundred personnel had been recruited when Stevenson became Director in June; this number <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> to around a thousand {{by the end of the}} year. For the first three months of its existence the WAAAF had been under the temporary command of Flight Officer Mary Bell, wife of an RAAF group captain and former Australian Commandant of the Women's Air Training Corps, an organisation of female pilots and ground staff that had been formed in 1939 and had been providing voluntary support to the Air Force. Bell chose to resign on learning of Stevenson's appointment, rather than stay on as Deputy Director and report to someone from outside the service fraternity; she later rejoined at Wrigley's request, on the condition that she would receive no promotion higher than flight officer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries the Borough of Bournemouth <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> to {{encompass}} {{a number of}} ancient settlements along the River Stour, including Longham where a skull thought to be 5,500 years old was found in 1932. Bronze Age burials near Moordown, and the discovery of Iron Age pottery on the East Cliff in 1969, suggest {{there may have been}} settlements there during that period. Hengistbury Head, added to the borough in 1932, was the site of a much older Palaeolithic encampment. During {{the latter half of the}} 16th century James Blount, 6th Baron Mountjoy, began mining for alum in the area, and at one time part of the heath was used for hunting, although by the late 18th century little evidence of either event remained. No-one lived at the mouth of the Bourne river and the only regular visitors to the area before the 19th century were a few fishermen, turf cutters and gangs of smugglers.|$|E
5|$|It later {{emerged that}} Harding had also promised former Utah senator George Sutherland {{a seat on}} the Supreme Court, and was waiting in the {{expectation}} that another place would become vacant. Harding was also considering a proposal by Justice William R. Day to crown his career by being chief justice for six months before retiring. Taft felt, when he learned of this plan, that a short-term appointment would not serve the office well, and that once confirmed by the Senate, the memory of Day <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> dim. After Harding rejected Day's plan, Attorney General Harry Daugherty, who supported Taft's candidacy, urged him to fill the vacancy, and he named Taft on June 30, 1921. The Senate confirmed Taft the same day, 61–4, without any committee hearings and after a brief debate in executive session. Taft drew the objections of three progressive Republicans and one southern Democrat. When he was sworn in on July 11, he became the first and to date only person to serve both as president and chief justice.|$|E

5|$|Later that evening, Jiminy and {{his parents}} {{convince}} a couple {{to give up some}} goods in exchange for a tonic that will supposedly make them immune to a plague. He soon discovers that his father switched Rumpelstiltskin's tonic with the one they sold, and finds that the couple have been turned into dolls. Even worse, he then discovers that the couple were the parents of the young boy he spoke to earlier. Having realized what he has done, Jiminy makes a wish and receives an answer from The Blue Fairy, who shows up to give him his one true wish: becoming a cricket. Jiminy is also told that {{he has a chance to}} help someone in the future, starting with the young boy, who <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> up to be Gepetto. As for the cursed dolls, they end up as a collection at Mr. Gold's (Carlyle) pawn shop.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of dam removal {{state that}} the {{estimated}} demolition cost of $3–10 billion is a poor investment, especially in regards of the resulting loss of renewable hydroelectric power, which {{would have to be}} replaced by polluting fossil fuel generation. Although there are several options available to replace San Francisco's water, none are of the purity currently supplied by Hetch Hetchy. There is also no guarantee that the valley can be successfully restored, as the original valley floor was actually the product of thousands of years of intensive controlled burning and management by the native Paiute and Miwok peoples that once lived in the area. Without this intervention, a forest <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> in the place of the valley's renowned meadows. Finally, the increased pressure of new tourism could cause its own environmental damage, as has been demonstrated in the crowded Yosemite Valley.|$|E
5|$|Riefenstahl fell in {{love with}} the arts in her childhood. She began to paint and write poetry at the age of four. She was also athletic, and at the age of twelve joined a {{gymnastics}} and swimming club. Her mother was confident her daughter <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> up to be successful in the field of art and therefore gave her full support, unlike Riefenstahl's father, who was not interested in his daughter's artistic inclinations. In 1918, when she was 16, Riefenstahl attended a presentation of Snow White which interested her deeply; it led her to want to be a dancer. Her father instead wanted to provide his daughter with an education that could lead to a more dignified occupation. His wife, however, continued to support her daughter's passion. Without her father's knowledge, she enrolled Riefenstahl in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil.|$|E
