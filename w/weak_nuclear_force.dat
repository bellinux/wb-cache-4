5|$|The {{utility of}} Feynman {{diagrams}} {{is that other}} types of physical phenomena {{that are part of}} the general picture of fundamental interactions but are conceptually separate from forces can also be described using the same rules. For example, a Feynman diagram can describe in succinct detail how a neutron decays into an electron, proton, and neutrino, an interaction mediated by the same gauge boson that is responsible for the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the weak}} interaction (the weak force or <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force)</b> is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the weak interaction is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E
5|$|QED {{has served}} as the model and {{template}} for all subsequent quantum field theories. One such subsequent theory is quantum chromodynamics, which began in the early 1960s and attained its present form in the 1970s work by H. David Politzer, Sidney Coleman, David Gross and Frank Wilczek. Building on the pioneering work of Schwinger, Gerald Guralnik, Dick Hagen, and Tom Kibble, Peter Higgs, Jeffrey Goldstone, and others, Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single electroweak force.|$|E
50|$|Nuclear {{potential}} energy is the {{potential energy}} of the particles inside an atomic nucleus. The nuclear particles are bound together by the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force.</b> <b>Weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> provide the potential energy for certain kinds of radioactive decay, such as beta decay.|$|R
2500|$|Physicists had {{believed}} that there were four fundamental forces of nature: the gravitational force, the strong and <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces,</b> and the electromagnetic force. Salam had worked on the unification of these forces from 1959 with Glashow and Weinberg. While at Imperial College London, Salam successfully showed that <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> are not really different from electromagnetic forces, and two could inter-convert. Salam provided a theory that shows the unification of two fundamental <b>forces</b> of nature, <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> and the electromagnetic forces, one into another. Glashow had also formulated the same work, and the theory was combined in 1966. In 1967, Salam proved the electroweak unification theory mathematically, and finally published the papers. For this achievement, Salam, Glashow, and Weinberg were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979. The Nobel Prize Foundation paid tribute to the scientists and issued a statement saying: [...] "For {{their contributions to the}} theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles, including, inter alia, the prediction of the weak neutral current". [...] In the 1970s Salam continued trying to unify forces by including the strong interaction in a grand unified theory.|$|R
50|$|After that, motivations differ. Two major {{concerns}} were {{the development of}} quantum theory and {{the discovery of the}} strong and <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> Attempts to quantize and unify gravity are outside the scope of this article, and so far none has been completely successful.|$|R
5|$|The Standard Model of {{particle}} physics {{is a theory}} which describes {{three of the four}} known fundamental interactions between the elementary particles that make up all matter. This theory allows predictions to be made about how particles will interact under many conditions. The energy per particle in a supernova is typically one to one hundred and fifty picojoules (tens to hundreds of MeV). The per-particle energy involved in a supernova is small enough that the predictions gained from the Standard Model {{of particle}} physics are likely to be basically correct. But the high densities may require corrections to the Standard Model. In particular, Earth-based particle accelerators can produce particle interactions which are of much higher energy than are found in supernovae, but these experiments involve individual particles interacting with individual particles, and {{it is likely that the}} high densities within the supernova will produce novel effects. The interactions between neutrinos and the other particles in the supernova take place with the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> which is believed to be well understood. However, the interactions between the protons and neutrons involve the strong nuclear force, which is much less well understood.|$|E
25|$|The W and Z bosons are carrier {{particles}} that mediate the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> {{much as the}} photon is the carrier particle for the electromagnetic force.|$|E
25|$|Quantum field {{theories}} for {{the strong}} nuclear force and the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> have also been developed. The quantum field theory of the {{strong nuclear force}} is called quantum chromodynamics, and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons. The <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and the electromagnetic force were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as electroweak theory), by the physicists Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg. These three men shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for this work.|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} the strong and <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> (the latter {{explained}} by Enrico Fermi via Fermi's interaction in 1934) led physicists to collide nuclei and electrons at ever higher energies. This research became the science of particle physics, {{the crown jewel of}} which is the standard model of particle physics which describes the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces.|$|R
50|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, {{the search for}} a unifying theory was {{interrupted}} by the discovery of the strong and <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> (or interactions), which differ both from gravity and from electromagnetism. A further hurdle was the acceptance that in a ToE, quantum mechanics had to be incorporated from the start, rather than emerging as a consequence of a deterministic unified theory, as Einstein had hoped.|$|R
40|$|It is {{suggested}} {{that it is possible}} to define an equivalent electric charge for an intense laser pulse (which can be described as a photon bunch) propagating in a plasma. It is also shown that this equivalent charge can be a source of new radiation processes in an inhomogeneous plasma. The results are extended to the case of a neutrino bunch, which is coupled to the plasma by <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|R
25|$|Building on {{pioneering}} work by Schwinger, Higgs and Goldstone, the physicists Glashow, Weinberg and Salam independently showed how the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and quantum electrodynamics could be merged {{into a single}} electroweak force, for which they received the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
25|$|It {{is already}} known that {{electromagnetism}} and the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> are different manifestations {{of a single}} force called the electroweak force. The LHC may clarify whether the electroweak force and the strong nuclear force are similarly just different manifestations of one universal unified force, as predicted by various Grand Unification Theories.|$|E
25|$|This {{first step}} is {{extremely}} slow because the positron emission of the diproton to deuterium is extremely rare (the {{vast majority of the}} time, the diproton decays back into hydrogen-1 through proton emission). This is because the emission of the positron is brought about by the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> which is immensely weaker than the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force.|$|E
5|$|In {{his pursuit}} of a {{unification}} of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces,</b> which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.|$|R
2500|$|For much of {{the last}} quarter of the 20th century, the physics {{community}} was involved in attempts to produce a unified field theory, a single physical theory that explains the four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> Scientists have made progress in unifying the three quantum forces, but gravity has remained [...] "the problem" [...] in every attempt. This has not stopped any number of such attempts from being made, however.|$|R
50|$|Hall's Nth metal also enhances his {{strength}} and eyesight, speeds healing, and regulates body temperature, preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while flying at high altitudes. Nth metal is known to affect electromagnetism {{as well as the}} strong and <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> of the universe, but only if one has the knowledge of how to use it in those ways. It is also mentioned in Hawkman: Secret Files #1 (2002) that Nth metal possesses powers still unknown to Hall.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{spectacular}} success of quantum electrodynamics in the 1950s, attempts were undertaken {{to formulate a}} similar theory of the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force.</b> This culminated around 1968 in a unified theory of electromagnetism and weak interactions by Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg, and Abdus Salam, for which they shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics. Their electroweak theory postulated not only the W bosons necessary to explain beta decay, but also a new Z boson {{that had never been}} observed.|$|E
25|$|Particle {{physicists}} study matter {{made from}} fundamental particles whose interactions are mediated by exchange particles – gauge bosons – acting as force carriers. At {{the beginning of}} the 1960s a number of these particles had been discovered or proposed, along with theories suggesting how they relate to each other, some of which had already been reformulated as field theories in which the objects of study are not particles and forces, but quantum fields and their symmetries, however, attempts to unify known fundamental forces such as the electromagnetic force and the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> were known to be incomplete.|$|E
25|$|Physicist Sean M. Carroll {{has written}} that spoons, like all matter, {{are made up of}} atoms and that any {{movement}} of a spoon with the mind would involve the manipulation of those atoms through the four forces of nature: the strong nuclear force, the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> electromagnetism, and gravitation. Psychokinesis would have to be either some form of one of these four forces, or a new force that has a billionth the strength of gravity, for otherwise it would have been captured in experiments already done. This leaves no physical force that could possibly account for psychokinesis.|$|E
5000|$|In physics, {{there are}} four {{conventionally}} accepted fundamental forces or interactions that {{form the basis of}} all known interactions in nature: the gravitational, electromagnetic, strong <b>nuclear,</b> and <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> Some speculative theories have proposed an additional fundamental fifth force to explain various anomalous observations that do not fit existing theories. The characteristics of this fifth force depend on the theory being advanced. Most postulate a force of roughly the strength of gravity (i.e. it is much weaker than electromagnetism or the <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces)</b> and to have a range of anywhere from less than a millimeter to cosmological scales.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the early}} work on five {{dimensional}} space was {{in an attempt to}} develop a theory that unifies the four fundamental forces in nature: strong and <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces,</b> gravity and electromagnetism. German mathematician Theodor Kaluza and Swedish physicist Oskar Klein independently developed the Kaluza-Klein theory in 1921, which used the fifth dimension to unify gravity with electromagnetic force. Although their approaches were later found to be at least partially inaccurate, the concept provided a basis for further research over the past century.|$|R
50|$|Kakalios {{explained}} that the intrinsic field has basis in reality {{in that it is}} a representation of a collection of the electromagnetic, and strong and <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> Kakalios {{explained that}} if a being were able to manipulate matter, such a being would have complete control over these three forces; hence, the 'intrinsic field' would exist. Kakalios also explained while it is unlikely, Doctor Manhattan's teleportation abilities could seemingly be achieved through quantum tunnelling, should Doctor Manhattan have control over his probability wave functions.|$|R
25|$|The next part in Guth's path {{came when}} he heard a lecture by Steven Weinberg in early 1979. Weinberg talked in two lectures about the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) that had been {{developed}} since 1974, and how it could explain the huge amount of matter in the universe compared to the amount of antimatter. The GUT explained all the fundamental forces known in science except for gravity. It established that in very hot conditions, such as those after the Big Bang, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> were united to form one force. Weinberg also was the one who emphasized the idea that the universe goes through phase transitions, similar to the phases of matter, when going from high energy to low energy. Weinberg’s discussion of why matter is so dominant over anti-matter showed Guth how precise calculations about particles could be obtained by studying the first few seconds of the universe.|$|E
500|$|There are two [...] "nuclear forces", {{which today}} are usually {{described}} as interactions {{that take place}} in quantum theories of particle physics. The strong nuclear force is the force responsible for the structural integrity of atomic nuclei while the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is responsible for the decay of certain nucleons into leptons and other types of hadrons.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of writing, quasars had been only {{recently}} discovered and were not well understood. [...] In the story Lamont suggests that quasars are in fact parts of galaxies that have undergone sudden increase in {{the strength of the}} strong nuclear force, resulting in an explosion of fusion energy. [...] It is not certain if Asimov took into account the nature of solar fusion, where the primary reaction rate is governed by the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> transforming protons into neutrons, while the strong force governs the amount of energy released during reactions.|$|E
5|$|Initially, many {{physicists}} {{hoped that}} by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, {{it might be}} possible to construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world.

2500|$|Gauge {{invariance}} is {{an important}} property of modern particle theories such as the Standard Model, partly due to its success {{in other areas of}} fundamental physics such as electromagnetism and the strong interaction (quantum chromodynamics).

2500|$|Some {{applications}} of the anthropic principle have been criticized as an argument by lack of imagination, for tacitly assuming that carbon compounds and water are the only possible chemistry of life (sometimes called [...] "carbon chauvinism", see also alternative biochemistry). The range of fundamental physical constants consistent with the evolution of carbon-based life may also be wider than those who advocate a fine tuned universe have argued. For instance, Harnik et al. propose a weakless universe in which the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is eliminated. They show that this has no {{significant effect on the}} other fundamental interactions, provided some adjustments are made in how those interactions work. However, if some of the fine-tuned details of our universe were violated, that would rule out complex structures of any kind—stars, planets, galaxies, etc.|$|E
2500|$|The {{defining}} {{property of}} the quarks is that they carry color charge, and hence, interact via the strong interaction. A phenomenon called color confinement results in quarks being very strongly bound to one another, forming color-neutral composite particles (hadrons) containing either a quark and an antiquark (mesons) or three quarks (baryons). The familiar proton and neutron are the two baryons having the smallest mass. Quarks also carry electric charge and weak isospin. Hence, they interact with other fermions both electromagnetically and via the weak interaction. [...] The remaining six fermions do not carry color charge and are called leptons. The three neutrinos do not carry electric charge either, so their motion is directly influenced only by the <b>weak</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> which makes them notoriously difficult to detect. However, by virtue of carrying an electric charge, the electron, muon, and tau all interact electromagnetically.|$|E
