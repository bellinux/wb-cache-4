25|$|In {{order to}} avoid bloodshed“, I advise you to spare your {{soldiers}} not force us to fight, {{and go back to}} where you bad and evil strangers were and leave us alone: we will resolutely and fiercely defend this place and fight you to death for the land of our ancestors and for the welfare of our future generations. Have pity on people and cease to destroy them: we did not give life to anyone nor do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> take it away from others: but because you shall not send your soldiers to a certain death, since we are not to surrender the fortress without a fierce and bitter resistance.|$|E
500|$|Subsequently, {{when the}} Soviet Union faced harsh {{words from the}} Western world over its civil liberties problems, it {{employed}} the phrase as a common retort. In a 1930s argument with black student Pierre Kalmek, Bolshevik politician Dmitry Manuilsky emphasized that in America [...] "whites have the privilege to lynch Negroes, but Negroes {{do not have the}} privilege to lynch whites." [...] He called this a form of white chauvinism, and further stressed this asking: [...] "Do we have a difference here between the salaries of Negro and white workers? Do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> lynch Negro citizens?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Lambert, as usual, entered {{to soothe}} and heal. [...] "Viola's {{been very good}} about meeting Mr. Pratt's friends, Tony. We've hardly been out to dinner since we came here, and it really seems {{to me as if}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to go out to-night." ...|$|R
500|$|USPS {{investigators}} {{decided to}} send him {{a letter from a}} fictitious organization, the [...] "American Hedonist Society", which supposedly sought to lobby for [...] "the right to read what we desire, the right to discuss similar interests with those who share our philosophy, and finally that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> seek pleasure without restrictions being placed on us by outdated puritan morality." [...] Included was a questionnaire attempting to gauge the respondent's interest in various paraphilias, including pedophilia and ephebophilia. Jacobson indicated an [...] "above average" [...] interest in the latter, especially between males, but also stated he was opposed to the former. The USPS decided he was not a promising target and left him alone.|$|E
2500|$|Sontag {{writes that}} the {{convenience}} of modern photography has created an overabundance of visual material, and [...] "just about everything has been photographed". This has altered our expectations of what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> view, want to view or should view. [...] "In teaching us a new visual code, photographs alter and enlarge our notion of what is worth looking at and what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> observe" [...] and has changed our [...] "viewing ethics". Photographs have increased our access to knowledge and experiences of history and faraway places, but the images may replace direct experience and limit reality. She also states that photography desensitizes its audience to horrific human experiences, and children are exposed to experiences before they are ready for them.|$|E
2500|$|More vigils and gatherings {{were held}} in Canada to show support to France and condemn terrorism. Many cities had notable [...] "Je suis Charlie" [...] gatherings, {{including}} Calgary, Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto. In Calgary, {{there was a strong}} anti-terrorism sentiment. [...] "We're against terrorism and want to show them that they won't win the battle. It's horrible everything that happened, but they won't win," [...] commented one demonstrator. [...] "It's not only against the French journalists or the French people, it's against freedom – everyone, all over the world, is concerned at what's happening." [...] In Montreal, despite a temperature of , over 1,000 people gathered chanting [...] "Liberty!" [...] and [...] "Charlie!" [...] outside of the city's French Consulate. Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre was among the gatherers and proclaimed, [...] "Today, we are all French!" [...] He confirmed the city's full support for the people of France and called for strong support regarding freedom, stating that [...] "We have a duty to protect our freedom of expression. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> say what we have to say." ...|$|E

5000|$|Producer Tom Wilkinson said [...] "Here at {{last was}} a special effects story that had originality, pace and a big idea. <b>The</b> waiting <b>has</b> been worthwhile. <b>We</b> {{wanted to make sure}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> {{combination}} of leading actors and <b>the</b> <b>right</b> technical skills because those will be the real making - or unmaking- of the movie." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 13 May Powell {{said the}} task force was sent [...] "to repossess the Falkland Islands, to restore British {{administration}} of the islands {{and to ensure that}} the decisive factor in the future of the islands should be the wishes of the inhabitants" [...] but the Foreign Secretary (Francis Pym) desired an [...] "interim agreement": [...] "So far as I understand that interim agreement, it is in breach, if not in contradiction, of each of the three objects with which {{the task force}} was dispatched to the South Atlantic. There was to be a complete and supervised withdrawal of Argentine forces... matched by corresponding withdrawal of British forces. There is no withdrawal of British force that 'corresponds' to the withdrawal from the territory of the islands of those who have unlawfully occupied them. We {{have a right to be}} there; those are our waters, the territory is ours and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> sail the oceans with our fleets whenever we think fit. So the whole notion of a 'corresponding withdrawal', a withdrawal of the only force which can possibly restore the position, which can possibly ensure any of the objectives which have been talked about on either side of the House, is in contradiction of the determination to repossess the Falklands".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Babbu di a Patria" [...] (father of Corsica), as Pasquale Paoli was nicknamed by the Corsican Independentists, {{wrote in}} his Letters [...] the {{following}} message in 1768 against the French invaders: [...] "We (Corsicans) are Italians by birth and feelings, {{but first of all}} we feel Italian by language, roots, customs, traditions and all the Italians are all brothers for History and for God.... As Corsicans {{we do not want to}} be slaves nor [...] "rebels" [...] and as Italians <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be treated like all the other Italian brothers.... Either we'll be free or we'll be nothing.... Either we'll win or we'll die (against the French) with our weapons in our hands.... The war against France is [...] just and holy as the name of God is holy and just, and here on our mountains will appear for all Italy the sun of liberty." [...] ("Siamo còrsi per nascita e sentimento ma prima di tutto ci sentiamo italiani per lingua, origini, costumi, tradizioni e gli italiani sono tutti fratelli e solidali di fronte alla storia e di fronte a Dio… Come còrsi non vogliamo essere né schiavi né [...] "ribelli" [...] e come italiani abbiamo il diritto di trattare da pari con gli altri fratelli d’Italia… O saremo liberi o non saremo niente… O vinceremo con l’onore o soccomberemo (contro i francesi) con le armi in mano... La guerra con la Francia è giusta e santa come santo e giusto è il nome di Dio, e qui sui nostri monti spunterà per l’Italia il sole della libertà…") ...|$|E

[...] "We came here on {{important}} business, and presented our papers--all in proper order--on demand. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to expect decent treatment, as respectable American citizens engaged in humanitarian work; yet this--this--man," [...] pointing an accusing finger at the colonel, [...] "ordered us detained--arrested!--and kept our papers." ...|$|R

5000|$|There were {{clashes between}} {{indigenous}} Australians and white settlers during settlement. Robert von Steiglitz stated {{in his journal}} [...] "… it may be questioned by some feather-bed philanthropist whether <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to take <b>the</b> country from the blacks but I believe the general rule is that if people cultivate or graze <b>the</b> land they <b>have</b> a claim to it.

5000|$|When Tony Basgallop was in Los Angeles, he {{understood}} <b>the</b> importance of <b>having</b> a plot {{which could be}} reduced {{to three or four}} sentences.

He commented that [...] "the key to writing and casting What Remains has been in ensuring that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> chemistry between <b>the</b> characters".|$|R
60|$|I have, I trust, clearly {{shown that}} by the Berlin Treaty of 1885 the State was formed on certain {{conditions}}, and that these conditions as affecting both trade and the natives have not been fulfilled. Therefore <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> interfere. Apart from the Treaty this right might be claimed on the general grounds of humanity, as has been done more than once with Turkey.|$|E
60|$|It appears, therefore, that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> {{be content}} with the picture which hangs in the town hall of the seaport of St Malo. If it does not show us Cartier as he was,--and we have no {{absolute}} proof in the {{one or the other}} direction,--at least it shows us Cartier as he might well have been, with precisely the face and bearing which the hero-worshipper would read into the character of such a discoverer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't that enough? God {{seemed to}} think it was, {{in the case of}} the first murderer, who killed his brother. All that he did to Cain was to set a mark on him. But we have not felt sure that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> do this. We let God mark him, and He has done it with this man in the sorrow of his face. I was rather glad you, couldn't see him, my dear. It is an awful face." ...|$|E
50|$|Technical {{costs are}} related to {{software}} development costs and hardware costs. “Do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> people to create the tool?” “Do we need new equipment to support expanded software roles?” This last question is an important type. The team must inquire into whether the newest automated tools will add sufficient processing power to shift some of the burden from the user to the system {{in order to save}} people time.|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{after the}} venture into Boston town, and {{the taking of}} Job Lord as prisoner, it was allowed that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to be {{regularly}} enrolled, and to-day, when we are making ready to give the king another slap in the face, there is no company of soldiers in the encampment who are seemingly held in higher esteem by our commanders, than the Minute Boys of Boston.|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] I replied, [...] "it didn't {{convince}} them, but it jarred {{them not}} a little. In their report they admitted this much. They said, 'We {{do not believe}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> explain these things by the aid of insulting assumptions.' (By this they meant to acquit the psychic of fraud.) 'We think, on the contrary, that these experiments {{have to do with}} phenomena of an unknown nature, and we confess that {{we do not know what}} the conditions are that are required to produce them.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I sure {{do count}} myself {{one of the}} Minute Boys, lad, and shall do so till our little muss with the king {{has come to an}} end, leaving us colonists {{on the top of the}} heap. But say, Luke Wright, this last trick over which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> do a good bit of crowing, has been a close shave. Unless {{everything}} had worked according to our desires, we would have been undone, and I'm thinking the shadow of the gallows was dark over us in that hour when I set off for the Bridewell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{both these}} factors," [...] the Bishop {{reminded}} them, [...] "we have had very frequent hints from our friends, the neutrals. Let {{me tell you}} all what I think. I think that those terms are as much as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> expect, even if our armies had reached the Rhine. It is possible that we might obtain some slight modifications, if we continued the war, but would those modifications be worth {{the loss of a}} few more hundred thousands of human lives, of a few more months of this hideous, pagan slaughter and defilement of God's beautiful world?" ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{the visit}} of Jim Anaya, UN Special Rapporteur on <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Indigenous Peoples, Coyaha speaker Tracie Revis gave a speech {{defining}} the importance of federal recognition and acknowledged a declaration by the United Nations on <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Indigenous People that states [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of self-determination and by virtue of that right- we may freely determine our political status and freely pursue our economic, social and cultural development." ...|$|R
