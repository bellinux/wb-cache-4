5|$|Stroheim wrote {{a highly}} {{detailed}} 300-page script that contained camera movements, composition and tint cues. Among {{the changes that}} he made to Norris's novel was giving McTeague the first name of John and omitting Norris's anti-Semitism. McTeague had been filmed once before as Life's <b>Whirlpool,</b> a five-reel short by William A. Brady's World Pictures, starring Broadway star Holbrook Blinn as McTeague, which had been released in 1916. Film critics disliked this version and Stroheim later criticized Blinn's performance. According to film historian Kevin Brownlow, Life's <b>Whirlpool</b> was also shot on location in Death Valley.|$|E

50|$|Recurring <b>whirlpools</b> {{known as}} the Naruto <b>whirlpools</b> are located below the bridge, caused by tidal {{currents}} between the Seto Inland Sea and the Pacific Ocean passing over undersea ridges under the Span, causing very strong eddy currents, some of which make large, deep <b>whirlpools.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Naruto <b>whirlpools</b> (Naruto no Uzushio) are tidal <b>whirlpools</b> in the Naruto Strait, {{a channel}} between Naruto in Tokushima and Awaji Island in Hyōgo, Japan.|$|R
50|$|Large <b>whirlpools</b> can be {{produced}} by ocean tides in certain straits or bays. Examples are Charybdis of classical mythology in the Straits of Messina, Italy; the Naruto <b>whirlpools</b> of Nankaido, Japan; and the Maelstrom at Lofoten, Norway.|$|R
5|$|Sandcastle Suites is a {{hotel at}} the northernmost {{part of the}} {{peninsula}} that contains 187 suites. It has Wi-Fi in the lobby and guest suites, an outdoor heated pool and <b>whirlpool,</b> beach access, tennis courts, a shuttle to both Cedar Point and Cedar Point Shores, and two restaurants ‒ the Breakwater Cafe and the Sand Bar.|$|E
5|$|Lighthouse Point {{contains}} 64 cottages and 40 {{cabins and}} is located {{along the west}} bank of the peninsula. The centerpiece of Lighthouse Point is the Cedar Point Light, which was built in 1862 and is the oldest existing structure on the peninsula. It has an outdoor pool and outdoor <b>whirlpool</b> spa, a shuffleboard court, a game room, and shuttle service.|$|E
5|$|The Niagara Parkway {{begins at}} Fort Erie in the south. It passes through several villages {{along the river}} before passing through the tourist {{district}} of Niagara Falls. North of the city it provides access to several attractions, including the <b>Whirlpool</b> Rapids, Butterfly Conservatory, and Brock's Monument at Queenston Heights. The route ends at Fort George, southeast of the urban centre of Niagara-on-the-Lake.|$|E
50|$|In oceans, in narrow straits, with fast flowing water, <b>whirlpools</b> are {{normally}} caused by tides; {{there are few}} stories of large ships ever being sucked into such a maelstrom, although smaller craft are in danger. Smaller <b>whirlpools</b> also appear {{at the base of}} many waterfalls and can also be observed downstream from manmade structures such as weirs and dams. In the case of powerful waterfalls, like Niagara Falls, these <b>whirlpools</b> can be quite strong.|$|R
5000|$|The {{stream in}} the channel of the Lower Tunguska {{sometimes}} forms <b>whirlpools.</b> They originate downstream of cliffs which channels {{flow to the}} opposite shore. These <b>whirlpools</b> can reach depths to 100 m and occur most often during high-water periods in early summer.|$|R
50|$|Minamiawaji is {{connected}} to the south with the island of Shikoku by the Onaruto Bridge. The area is famous for the Naruto <b>whirlpools,</b> which form when the changing tidal currents are forced through the Naruto Strait. Tourists can view the <b>whirlpools</b> from the bridge or numerous commercial boats.|$|R
5|$|Arnold's Marsh and {{the other}} lagoons nearest the beach are salty due to the {{percolation}} of seawater through the shingle bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm sand or submerged vegetation, and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including starlet sea anemone, lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, the mysid shrimps Paramysis nouveli and Neomysis integer, lagoon cockle, the bug Orthotylus rubidus and spire snail. Little <b>whirlpool</b> ramshorn snail {{has been found in}} a freshwater channel. Rare beetles associated with these coastal environments include yellow pogonus, Bembidion ephippium and Tachys scutellaris. These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the Pogonus species, and even here it is localised and hard to find.|$|E
5|$|His {{social and}} {{political}} activities resulted in a diminished literary output. He wrote a new historical novel, Na polu chwały (On the Field of Glory), that was meant {{as the beginning of}} a new trilogy; it was, however, criticized as being a lesser version of his original Trilogy, and was never continued. Similarly, his contemporary novel Wiry <b>Whirlpool</b> (novel), 1910, which sought to criticize some of Sienkiewicz's political opponents, received a mostly polemical and politicized response. His 1910 novel for young people, W pustyni i w puszczy (In Desert and Wilderness), serialized in Kurier Warszawski (The Warsaw Courier), finishing in 1911, was much better received and became widely popular among children and young adults.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, after {{receiving}} {{approval from the}} government, the Parks Commission began to expropriate land {{along the length of}} the river. The broadened strip of land was used to construct a new paved parkway, which was opened in segments. The new parkway was ornamental and designed to be aesthetically pleasing, a prime consideration of road construction at that time. The section south of the falls was completed first, opening in 1912. It was extended north to the <b>Whirlpool</b> Rapids, incorporating the existing River Road, by 1915. The section between the rapids and Queenston was opened between 1921 and 1923. Finally, the remaining section between Queenston and Niagara-on-the-Lake opened in 1931, completing the present parkway.|$|E

5|$|Legend has it {{that the}} Cailleach was tired from a long day herding deer. Atop Ben Cruachan she fell asleep on her watch and a well she was tending overflowed, running down from the {{highlands}} and flooding the valleys below, forming first a river and then the loch. The overflowing well is a common motif in local Gaelic creation tales - as seen in the goddess Boann's similar creation of the River Boyne in Ireland. Other connections to the region include her above-mentioned strong ties with the fierce <b>whirlpool</b> in the Gulf of Corryvreckan.|$|E
5|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of galaxies have been catalogued, {{but only a few}} have well-established names, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, the <b>Whirlpool</b> Galaxy, and the Sombrero Galaxy. Astronomers work with numbers from certain catalogues, such as the Messier catalogue, the NGC (New General Catalogue), the IC (Index Catalogue), the CGCG (Catalogue of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies), the MCG (Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies) and UGC (Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies). All of the well-known galaxies appear in {{one or more of these}} catalogues but each time under a different number.|$|E
5|$|Triton trades {{himself for}} Ariel, {{enabling}} Ursula to steal his crown and enabling her to claim his trident, a fascination which angers Ariel, {{who will not}} allow Ursula to destroy merfolk and humans. In the battle that follows, Ariel is trapped {{at the bottom of}} a <b>whirlpool.</b> Before Ursula can destroy her, Eric kills Ursula by ramming a derelict ship's splintered prow through her. After Ursula dies, her spell is broken, and King Triton and the merfolk are transformed back to normal merpeople. At the end of the film, after King Triton uses his magical trident to transform her into a human, Ariel leaves the sea to live in the human world, and she and Eric marry and live happily ever after.|$|E

5|$|After sinking Majestic, Hersing {{took his}} {{submarine}} to refuel at a Turkish port before attempting the dangerous route through the Dardanelles to Constantinople. While transiting the straits, U-21 was nearly {{pulled into a}} <b>whirlpool</b> but the Germans managed to escape. After arriving in the Ottoman capital, the crew were given a large welcoming ceremony attended by Enver Pasha. U-21 required significant maintenance, and so the crew was given a month of shore leave while the repairs were carried out. Once the repair work was finished, U-21 sortied through the Dardanelles for another patrol. Hersing spotted the Allied munitions ship Carthage, which he sank with a single torpedo. Later on the patrol, a lookout on an Allied trawler spotted U-21s periscope; the Germans had to crash dive to escape from being rammed, but doing so brought them into a minefield. One mine exploded off the U-boat's stern but it caused no significant damage, and U-21 was able to withdraw to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Gill Creek and NY61 {{continue}} to run parallel {{for one more}} block before they separate ahead of Pine Avenue, once known as NY62A and now designated as US62 Business. The intersection between Pine and Hyde Park Boulevard marks the southwestern limits of Hyde Park, {{one of the largest}} parks {{in the vicinity of the}} city. For the next dozen blocks, NY61 acts as the divider between the residential neighborhoods of downtown Niagara Falls and the open spaces of Hyde Park, passing Sal Maglie Stadium as it heads north. At Linwood Avenue, the homes return to both sides of NY61 as it approaches Porter Road, which carries NY182. While Porter Road ends here, NY182 turns north, joining NY61 for two blocks to Ontario Avenue, where NY182 turns west toward the <b>Whirlpool</b> Rapids Bridge.|$|E
5|$|At Main Street, Niles Avenue ends, and M-63 joins Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) on Main Street {{into and}} through the {{downtown}} business district. The two highways continue together running concurrently to Ship and Port streets. These two streets form a one-way pair running east to carry BLI-94 to and from a separate bridge over the St. Joseph River. M-63 continues along Main Street across the river into Benton Harbor, Michigan where it follows the Lake Michigan shoreline along a short expressway segment. The trunkline exits Benton Harbor near {{the headquarters of the}} <b>Whirlpool</b> Corporation. North of town, the highway provides access to many lakeshore properties north of Benton Harbor at it continues northeasterly along the shoreline to the community of Lake Michigan Beach. When the highway meets Hagar Shore Road, M-63 turns east along that roadway to an interchange with I-196/US31. The shoreline roadway continues northeast as A-2 (Blue Star Highway) while M-63 terminates at an interchange with I-196/US31. This northernmost segment of the highway had the lowest AADT measurement in 2009 when calculated by MDOT at 2,855vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Mammalian {{fertility}} {{analysis is}} an important industrial issue because of the selection for breeding. This is one reason, beside fundamental interest, for which many studies analyse the individual motion of the spermatozoon (Gaffney et al. 2011). On the other hand, more recent reviews suggest that neither individual motion indicators or molecular markers can be clearly correlated to fertility (Kastelic and Thundathil 2008; Nathali and Turek 2011). This is why the industry still uses the scoring of sperm motility from the observation of semen sessile drop with a phase-contrast microscope. This observation of pure semen displays wave motion associated with millions of sperm moving together in circular waves and <b>whirlpools.</b> The moving speed, deformation and size of <b>whirlpools</b> were ranked and scored. Similar collective movements have also been observed in different biological suspensions above a certain concentration (Sokolov et al. 2007). But until today, {{there has been no}} clear analysis of the origin of the observed <b>whirlpools</b> dynamics in semen. In this article, we provide new insights on the origin of <b>whirlpools.</b> As the sessile drops do not permit a careful control of the micro-hydrodynamic boundary conditions associated with surface tension variations, we investigate collective effects in controlled rectangular cells confined span wise with 20 and 100 mm depth. We mainly analyse the influence of the confinement and the concentration on the appearance of <b>whirlpools...</b>|$|R

5|$|NY104 begins {{near the}} Rainbow Bridge at the {{intersection}} of First Street and Niagara Street (NY384) in downtown Niagara Falls. The Seaway Trail crosses NY384 and follows NY104 north on First Street for one block to the Niagara Scenic Parkway, where the byway and NY104 veer onto Main Street. NY104 follows Main Street through the city's largely commercial west side and intersects the northern or eastern terminus for US62 (Ferry Avenue and Walnut Avenue) and US62 Business (Pine Avenue). North of US62 Business, the area becomes more residential as NY104 meets NY182 southeast of the <b>Whirlpool</b> Rapids Bridge. To the north, NY104's name changes to Lewiston Road as it passes the south campus of Niagara University. Near the northern extent of the campus, NY104 intersects the western terminus of NY31, here named College Avenue. At the city limits, NY104 meets the northbound Robert Moses State Parkway by way of a half-interchange. The portion of NY104 between Third Street and the Lewiston town line is maintained by the city of Niagara Falls, and is the only part of NY104 that is not maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation.|$|E
5|$|While the inceptive noir, Stranger on the Third Floor, was a B picture {{directed}} by a virtual unknown, {{many of the}} films noir still remembered were A-list productions by well-known film makers. Debuting as a director with The Maltese Falcon (1941), John Huston followed with Key Largo (1948) and The Asphalt Jungle (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several Alfred Hitchcock thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Notorious (1946), Strangers on a Train (1951) and The Wrong Man (1956). Otto Preminger's success with Laura (1944) made his name and helped demonstrate noir's adaptability to a high-gloss 20th Century-Fox presentation. Among Hollywood's most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include Fallen Angel (1945), <b>Whirlpool</b> (1949), Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) (all for Fox) and Angel Face (1952). A half-decade after Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend, Billy Wilder made Sunset Boulevard (1950) and Ace in the Hole (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media. In a Lonely Place (1950) was Nicholas Ray's breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, They Live by Night (1948) and On Dangerous Ground (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream.|$|E
5|$|After finding {{most of the}} Melodies, Ninten is harassed at a karaoke bar by Teddy, {{the boss}} of a local gang. Teddy surrenders after losing to Ninten in a duel, and joins Ninten's party {{with the intent to}} avenge the deaths of his parents, who were killed at Holy Loly Mountain. Lloyd stays behind. In a cottage at the base of Holy Loly Mountain, Ana pulls Ninten aside and asks him to be with her always. The two dance and profess their mutual love. When about to leave, the party is {{attacked}} by a powerful robot that knocks out the entire party. Lloyd arrives with a tank and destroys the robot, but accidentally attacks the party and critically wounds Teddy, so Lloyd rejoins the party. They take a boat out on Holy Loly Lake and a <b>whirlpool</b> pulls them into an underwater laboratory where they find a robot who claims to have been built by George to protect Ninten. When the laboratory floods, they leave for the mountain and the robot helps them ascend. On the way, they find a cave with human prisoners including Ana's mother. They need to defeat the Mother Ship to free the prisoners. Another robot (implied to be an upgraded version of the one fought at the cabin) attacks at the summit, and George's robot self-destructs to destroy it, leaving behind the seventh melody. After learning this melody, the party is warped to Magicant, where Ninten sings the melodies he had learned to Queen Mary. She recalls the rest of the song and reminisces about an alien named Gyiyg that she loved as her own child. Queen Mary reveals that she is George's wife, Maria, and vanishes. Magicant, a mirage created by her conscience, vanishes with her.|$|E
40|$|Thirty-seven {{samples were}} taken from the water, step access and air/water {{interface}} surfaces of 10 commercial <b>whirlpools</b> in Delaware and Madison Counties, Indiana between September and March of 1986 - 1988. Dermatophytes were isolated from 19 of the samples, representing 51 %. At least three species of the yeast genus Candid. were isolated from 13 (35 %) of these samples. Fifty-eight percent of all dermatophytes isolated were found in male-only <b>whirlpools,</b> as were nearly 62 % of all Candida species. Isolated dermatophytes included Trichophyton rubrum, T. menta,grophytes, T. tonsurans, T. verrucosum, Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum nanum, and one Trichophvton species. <b>Whirlpools</b> were grouped based on similarity of fungi isolated from each facility. Male <b>whirlpools</b> sorted into one group, except for one that clustered with female facilities. Coliform bacteria were found in 43 % of all samples, and blue-green fluorescent pseudomonads were found in 54 % of all samples.
