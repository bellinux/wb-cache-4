30|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{vibration}} of washing machines is a challenging issue to be considered. The vibration of the washing machine is mainly due to the unbalanced mass of clothes distributed in the <b>washing</b> <b>drum.</b> This occurs most frequently in the spin-drying stage, because the drum spins at a relatively high speed causing the clothes to be pressed against the inner wall of the spin drum, and these can become a large unbalanced mass {{until the end of the}} stage. Particularly, in a front-loaded washing machine (drum-type washing machine), the unbalanced mass of clothes easily occurs and very severe due to the effect of gravity. The vibration of the washing machine is transferred to the floor causing noises, unpleasant feeling for humans, and failure of the machine.|$|E

30|$|There {{are many}} {{researches}} on vibration control of washing machines {{which can be}} classified into two main approaches. The first approach {{is based on the}} control of the tub balance to eliminate the source of vibration [1, 2]. In this approach, one type of dynamic balancer is used to self-balance the tub dynamics. A typical dynamic balancer is the hydraulic balancer containing salt water, which is attached to the upper rim of the basket. The liquid in the balancer moves to the opposite side of unbalance automatically due to the inherent nature of fluids when the rotational speed is higher than the critical speed of the spinning drum [1]. Another dynamic balancer that counteracts vibrations is to use two balancing masses. In this method, two balancing masses move along the rim of the basket. The rotation plane of the balancing masses can be easily chosen to be wherever judged suitable, always targeting at the reduction of the induced moments [2]. It is proved that the vibration of the washing machine can be significantly reduced by using a dynamic balancer. However, the complicated structure, high cost of manufacturing, and maintenance are a big obstacle for the wide application of this approach. In the second approach, the vibration of the washing machine is suppressed based on damping control of a suspension system [3]. It is noted that during the spinning process, the washing machine usually experiences the first resonance at quite low frequency, around 100 to 200  rpm. This results from the resonance of the <b>washing</b> <b>drum</b> due to the unbalanced mass. When the rotating speed exceeds 1, 000  rpm, the side and rear panels of the frame may experience resonances which cause noises and vibration transferred to the floor. If a passive damper is used to reduce the vibration of the drum at low frequency, it will cause the vibration of the washing machine at high frequencies more severe. The reason is that more excitation force from the drum is transferred to the frame via the passive damper. Therefore, in order to effectively reduce the vibration of the washing machine at low frequency while the vibration of the machine at high frequencies is insignificantly affected, a semi-active suspension system such as a magneto-rheological (MR) damper should be employed.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MIng (Computer and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The work {{presented}} {{within this}} dissertation focusses {{on the development}} of affinite element method (FEM) model for the microwave absorption and heat transfer within a microwave combination washer dryer (MCWD). FEM will be used to aid in the implementation of more advanced fluid dynamics such as laminar or turbulent flow, that may be present within the system. The intended use of the model is to aid a South African based company {{in the development of a}} control system for the MCWD. The model development presented focusses on the washing cycle of the MCWD and will therefore not take into account the drying cycle of the system. The target of the microwave heating within the model will be distilled water as the dielectric constant of water is a know quantity. Various literature sources on microwave absorption and heat transfer models can be found, but none specific to the topic of the combination washer dryer. By reviewing literature from various sources, the finite element method was selected as the modelling technique and the COMSOL® software package was selected as the tool for developing the model. A model for the MCWD will be developed within the COMSOL® environment which in turn implements FEM as a technique to solve the model. The model development is broken into nine stages. Stage one start by modelling the heat transfer within the <b>washing</b> <b>drum.</b> Each consecutive stage expands the model by adding features or model domains. Model verification takes place in parallel to the development by verifying each stage before moving to the next stage. The stage eight and nine models, which represent a full three dimensional model of the system, are selected to be validated as the final models. Stage eight models the system without an enclosure and makes use of convective cooling boundary conditions on the boundary of the air enclosed within the system enclosure. Stage stage nine models the system with the aluminium enclosure of the system and also implements convective cooling boundary conditions on the outer boundary of the aluminium. The boundary between the enclosed air and aluminium enclosure is implemented as a normal convective heat transfer boundary between a gas and solid. Data capturing is done using the dSpace® platform. Sensors to log the microwave power and system temperature are selected and optimal placement of the sensors is evaluated. The capturing platform is interfaced to the sensors by an in-house developed signal conditioning board. Model validation is completed by comparing the response of the model to the practical system. Numerous simulations are completed to select the optimal configuration of the model that provides the optimal response. The stage eight model was found to be more accurate then the stage nine model with respect to the difference between the simulated and expected response over the whole domain of the transient temperature response. A further method implemented to easily compare the results of various simulations is by comparing the average absolute temperature of the response over the whole domain of the transient response. The average absolute temperature is calculated by taking absolute difference between the expected results and the model response at each time step within the response domain and then to average the absolute difference. This enables the comparison of two responses using two values. Needles to say this method should not be used alone and should be used in conjunction with a comparison over the full response domain. Use of the average absolute temperature difference is aimed at filtering the results from a selection of results which warrants a more in depth investigation. Using a comparison of the average absolute temperature difference of the target in the 500 W model, it was found that their respective values are 2 : 92 °C and 11 : 36 °C. The stage eight model computation time was far less than the stage nine model and is therefore recommended for further development. The final conclusion was made that the stage eight model represents the system fairly accurately at this stage and warrants further development by expanding the model to account for the drying cycle of the MCWD. The term fairy accurate is used to describe the results as further improvement of the model is definitely possible with regards to the accuracy of the transient response of the system. Further improvement of the model response may be possible by implementing a smaller mesh size or launching an in depth study on the effect of the various material thermal properties on the response of the system during various stages. For instance below a certain temperature the response closely represents the expected response and above that temperature the response various greatly from the expected response. Future work on the model include, to change the target from distilled water to an actual representation of the textiles intended to be washed within the MCWD. This will require a study into how the various parameters such as the density and dielectric constant, of the heterogeneous mixtures of textiles and water, can be combined for use into the model. As a next step in the expansion of the model, the model can be configured to account for the drying cycle of the system which will require the model to account for the phase changes that the water will undergo.

40|$|Auto-{{balancing}} or {{active control}} balancing can be efficient solutions for high speed rotors with changing out-of-balance loads like washing machines in spin-drying mode. In the LoWash EU project, Vibratec {{is in charge}} to design, to build and to validate a balancing system for reducing the vibrations at high spin-drying speeds. The system is based on two trolleys rolling in a ring linked to the drum. The trolley shape allows a ring cross section optimization and they are equipped with a mechanism for escaping the disadvantage encountered at low speeds by similar devices. Analytical and multi-body models are first made for understanding the mechanisms, highlighting the driving parameters and drawing the final design of a first prototype which is inserted in a <b>washing</b> machine <b>drum.</b> Different tests are carried out for different initial unbalances and different rotation speeds: the residual unbalance is measured {{by means of a}} set of accelerometers mounted on the tub, while the mobile masses behaviour is observed by means of a large aperture swift camera.

40|$|With recent {{pressure}} {{to reduce the}} environmental impact of leather production, research has been focused on the development of an alternative depilation method, as the conventional method for depilation contributes up to 60 % of the total pollution produced. Contaminated salted ovine pelts stored at LASRA were easily depilated when <b>drum</b> <b>washed,</b> and the resultant leather was of good quality. The pelts were visibly contaminated with microorganisms, and it was thought that these may be secreting enzymes that loosened the wool fibre without damaging key structural skin components. Identification of the enzyme or enzymes was thus of interest. The microorganism/s responsible for the secretion of the depilation enzyme/s were isolated and identified through sequencing the 16 S/ 18 S ribosomal RNA genes. Depilation, using the crude secretome solutions, was then assessed using fresh ovine skin as well as SACPIC, a micro scale staining method used to assess skin structure. Unfortunately, none of the secretomes from either a single or a combination of the microorganisms isolated, had depilation activity. The secretome of W. ichthyophaga, a xerophilic filamentous fungus, which was consistently isolated from the contaminated pelts, was chosen to be characterised using proteomic methods. 1 D SDS-PAGE gel/CHIP separation of the proteins in the secretome showed it contained mainly glycosidases, with no lipases, esterases, or proteases identified. Some of the proteins identified had suggested roles in resistance to osmotic pressure, while the remaining proteins were intracellular. Overall, 21 proteins were identified. A purification procedure involving AEX and SEC was successfully developed for the isolation of one of the glycosidases from the secretome. The resultant purified fractions formed a doublet band when analysed by SDS-PAGE. The reason for this remains unknown, but was shown not to be due to an impurity or heterodimerisation. The purified glycosidase was identifed as belonging to the GH 3 family by mass spectrometry. It was found to have a pH optimum of pH 6. 0, was optimally active at 10 % NaCl, and was itself glycosylated. The glycosidase was able to hydrolyse both a- and ß- linked glycosidic bonds in di- and polysaccharides.

40|$|Last {{year the}} Sahelian {{countries}} again {{fell victim to}} attacks by locusts. This time the desert locust populations (Schistocerca gregaria) - devastated by massive doses of insecticide and by cold and drought - posed little threat, but the various grasshoppers, in particular the Senegal grasshopper (Oedalus senegalensis) - which benefited from the plentiful rains - soon took its place. They arrived just at harvest time and caused ten times more damage than their near relatives did in the previous year. To control these pests thousands of litres of insecticides (700, 000 litres of concentrate over 14. 5 million hectares in 1988) were applied over the affected regions. As a result, locust specialists and environmental lobbyists often found themselves in conflict over the type of product which should be used. To limit {{the damage to the}} environment, it is essential that the most efficient, yet least harmful, chemical should be used and that the area of use should be strictly controlled. Use of dieldrin prohibited For nearly 30 years dieldrin has been used successfully to prevent locust swarms developing in their breeding areas. As a persistent chemical, {{it can be used to}} treat strips of land where the locusts can be poisoned. Dieldrin has other advantages, not least that it is cheap and can be stored easily, even in hot climates. But two years ago, when locusts swarms reached worrying proportions, ecologists began to protest strongly against the use of dieldrin on the grounds that it was dangerous to men and animals. For more selective treatment in a desert terrain, where the larvae hatch prior to flight, spraying with a less persistent chemical may be considered preferable. But such chemicals are only effective for a few days, and the chemical must be reapplied if it has not totally eliminated the danger of infestation. The results of this are higher costs, more work and complete destruction of all insect life in the treated areas. However, in agricultural and pasture land these organo-phosphorus chemicals have the great advantage that they leave a residue that is less toxic to the human population. They are efficient: they kill the locusts in 24 hours and can be the swift and effective answer to a swarm of locusts, but because they lack the persistence of dieldrin, they cannot be used as a preventative treatment. The same applies to pyrethroids, which are the least harmful of all insecticides, and which are used in built-up areas. Growth regulator brings hope Scientists who have been searching for a new form of chemical control which will combine the advantages of dieldrin and organophosphorus - persistent yet safe to the environment - have developed a new product which seems to bring some hope. The new product is a growth regulator which disrupts the development of the larvae when they eat treated vegetation. It is a persistent chemical which poses no danger to vertebrates and can be used for barrier spraying. It is effective against both desert locusts and grasshoppers and can be applied without risk of damage to agricultural land. However, more field trials are necessary before this material can be mass produced and marketed. Keep a watchful eye on the environment While new products are being developed, the environmental effects of massive and repeated insecticidal treatment of currently available chemicals have been the subject of close scrutiny in recent years. Several studies have been undertaken, by the Norwegians in Mali, and in Senegal by a Dutch French multi-disciplinary team, who are trying to gauge exactly the effects on fauna and human beings. One of the findings so far is that Fenitrothion is toxic to birds. But to evaluate the long-term effects of the less residual chemicals used today is extremely difficult. Their effects are subtle and hard to detect, especially in the early stages of experimentation. One thing is certain, however: a stricter use of insecticides would allow doses to be reduced and damage to the environment to be limited. Another danger is that although pesticide containers are highly dangerous they are often reused for various domestic and other purposes and the users rarely take any safety measures or <b>wash</b> out the <b>drums</b> to get rid of all the poisonous residue. Finally, there are skill large stocks of diel drin stored in the Sahel. These cannot be used since the chemical is now banned in most Sahelian countries. What will happen to them? A register has been compiled of these stocks but funding agencies (especially the Americans) are still seeking ways of getting rid of them. For more details, contact: CIRAD/PRIFAS - BP 5053 34032 Montpellier cedex - FRANCELast year the Sahelian countries again fell victim to attacks by locusts. This time the desert locust populations (Schistocerca gregaria) - devastated by massive doses of insecticide and by cold and drought - posed little threat, but the various [...] ...|$|R
