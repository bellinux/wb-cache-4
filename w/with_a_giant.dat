The ancient Greeks honored the phallus and celebrated phallic festivals. The Greco-Roman deity Priapus was worshiped as a god of fertility, depicted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> phallus in numerous public architectural pieces.|$|E

5|$|At the Acme factory, Doom {{reveals his}} plot to destroy Toontown <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> machine loaded with dip {{to build a}} freeway, the only way past Toontown since Cloverleaf has bought out Los Angeles' tram system. Roger unsuccessfully {{attempts}} to save Jessica, and the couple is tied onto a hook {{in front of the}} machine's hose. Valiant then performs a comedic vaudeville act, causing the weasels to die of laughter; Valiant kicks their leader, Smart Ass, into the machine's Dip vat, killing him instantly. Valiant then fights Doom, who is eventually flattened by a steamroller, but survives. Eddie is shocked when Doom reveals that he is the toon who killed Teddy. Valiant uses a toon mallet with a spring-loaded boxing glove and fires it at a switch that causes the machine to empty its dip onto Doom, dissolving him.|$|E
5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E

He learns that the man in the picture was extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> oversized penis. Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E

5|$|The duo finally {{returns to}} Omnitopia and finds Ruffleberg, who {{explains}} everything. He and his butler Carltron once engaged in chess matches. Ruffleberg outfitted {{him with an}} intelligence chip {{to make him a}} more challenging opponent, but the upgrade backfired by making Carltron more malevolent. He sabotaged the transporter to Evermore and designed the hostile beasts roaming the game. With Ruffleberg's help, the boy and his canine companion break into Carltron's room. The area is guarded by android clones of the boy and his dog, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> mecha version of Carltron. At the last moment, Ruffleberg appears and deactivates Carltron, who promptly freezes in place.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} a young lawyer being fed up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> law firm and bolting away to a less lucrative but more {{satisfying}} career is shared with The Associate. The theme of a lawsuit against a giant corporation appeared in The Runaway Jury, but in the present book, the corporation is vindicated and proven to have been unjustly maligned (at least on the specific drug which {{is the subject of}} the lawsuit) and the mass tort lawyers are seen as greedy and unscrupulous, ultimately bolting and leaving the protagonist's tiny Chicago firm in the lurch.|$|E

5|$|During the series' fifty-year history {{only a few}} of {{the films}} have {{remained}} substantially true to their source material; Dr. No has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, but there are a few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> squid, and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a centipede; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a bauxite mine instead of a guano quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt NASA space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating reactor coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book. Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.|$|E
5|$|The first, iconic uniforms the Raptors wore back in 1995 were {{extraordinarily}} busy, as they featured {{black and}} white tears as pin stripes, edgy asymmetric lettering, a raptor claw {{on one side of}} the shorts, a raptor biting the ‘T’ of the ‘TR’ franchise acronym on the other side, and were rounded up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant,</b> aggressive-looking raptor dribbling a basketball (as depicted on the franchise logo) in the middle of the jersey. The Raptors unveiled new jerseys in 1999−00, launching a unique road jersey which had a purple front and a black back. In 2003−04, the Raptors introduced a solid red alternate that would become the main road jersey in 2006−07 onward, as purple was dropped from the team's colour scheme. From 2008−09 through 2014−15, the Raptors unveiled their alternate black road uniforms, which were actually worn as often as the primary red ones.|$|E
5|$|With massive {{radio and}} video play, Blink-182 played to larger crowds {{when they began}} touring in support of Enema of the State. The Loserkids Tour {{commenced}} {{in the autumn of}} 1999 and was the band's first arena tour. The band was forced to postpone remaining dates of a spring European tour in 2000 when both DeLonge and Barker came down with strep throat. The band played to sold-out audiences and performed worldwide during the summer of 2000 on The Mark, Tom and Travis Show Tour. The tour was staged as a drive-in movie, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> retro billboard suspended from the ceiling, and films were projected on the screen behind the band– including vintage gay porn as a joke. The tour {{was one of the most}} anticipated rock tours of the season and the band headed out on the road with Bad Religion and Fenix TX. Barker broke one of his fingers during an altercation with two men who kept flirting with his girlfriend in Ohio, and Damon Delapaz, guitarist of Fenix TX, stepped in on drums for Barker. Hoppus recalled an overwhelming emotional feeling when the band sold out the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles.|$|E
