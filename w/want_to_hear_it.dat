I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and makes me <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E

500|$|... "Until the Whole World Hears" [...] {{is a song}} by Christian {{rock band}} Casting Crowns. Written by Mark Hall, Bernie Herms, Jason McArthur and Roger Glidewell and {{produced}} by Mark A. Miller, it was released as a digital download on August 20, 2009 and to Christian radio on August 29, 2009 as the lead single from the band's 2009 album of the same title. Musically, Until the Whole World Hears is an arena rock song with a crunchy guitar lick accompanied by blasting guitar chords and the [...] "throaty growl" [...] of Mark Hall's vocals. Lyrically, it revolves around speaking the truth into a culture that doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> Part of the chorus references the Biblical character of John the Baptist.|$|E

500|$|Spin {{journalist}} Charles Aaron positively {{reviewed the}} song and joked: [...] "this exquisitely crafted, heart-pumping l-u-v song has been droning in the produce department of my grocery store {{for about a year}} now, but I'd just like to go on record as saying that if it ever stops, I'll really be heartbroken." [...] Bob McCann, author of Encyclopedia of African American actresses in film and television (2010), considered it [...] "simply one of the most haunting R records ever made", while Robert Christgau named it [...] "miraculous" [...] and explained [...] "the miracle being that it's by Diane Warren and you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> again." [...] About.com reviewer Mark Edward Nero named it one of the best R break-up songs and considered it Braxton's [...] "finest moment". He further commented, [...] "damn, this song is so sad it can make people cry for hours at a time." [...] In 1997, [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] won a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{admitted}} that the chorus of the song is triumphant. Chris Norris of Blender wrote that the song [...] "evokes both early-'80s dance giants the S.O.S. Band and early-'80s dance giant Madonna." [...] Matt Zabosek of The Chicago Maroon wrote: [...] "...'Get Together' is probably the best, but it's hard not to feel that Madonna's computerized voice is a cheat (perhaps to cover for the high notes she can no longer reach?)" [...] Diego Costa of The UWM Post in review of the song, wrote: [...] "In this one-step-up-from-lounge-track, Madonna is a teen again, wondering {{if there is such}} a thing as love at first sight. But in the end, as a wise woman, she realizes that whether it exists or not, she doesn't care, since 'all is just an illusion.' Yeah, we heard it all before, she will even admit it in the following track, but it doesn't mean we don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> again." [...] In 2007, the song was nominated in the category of Best Dance Recording at the 49th Grammy Awards but lost to Justin Timberlake's 2006 single [...] "SexyBack".|$|E
500|$|McEntire {{signed with}} MCA Nashville Records in 1984 and {{released}} her seventh studio album, Just a Little Love. Harold Shedd was originally the album's producer; however, McEntire rejected his suggestions towards country pop arrangements. It was instead produced by Norro Wilson, although the album {{still had a}} distinguishable country pop sound. Dissatisfied with the album's sound, she went to MCA president, Jimmy Bowen, who told McEntire to find material that was best-suited to her liking. Instead of finding new material, she found previously recorded country hits from her own record collection, which was then recorded for the album. The album's material included songs originally released as singles by Ray Price ("Don't You Believe Her", [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>It</b> from You"), Carl Smith ("Before I Met You"), Faron Young ("He's Only Everything") and Connie Smith ("You've Got Me [...] ). The album spawned two number-one singles: [...] "How Blue" [...] and [...] "Somebody Should Leave". It was given positive reviews from critics, with Billboard praising McEntire as [...] "the finest woman country singer since Kitty Wells" [...] and Rolling Stone critics honoring her {{as one of their}} Top 5 favorite country artists. Upon its release, My Kind of Country became her highest-peaking album on the Top Country Albums chart, reaching No. 13. The album also included instruments such as a fiddle and pedal steel guitar, and was aimed more towards a traditional country sound. McEntire was later praised as a [...] "new traditionalist", along with Ricky Skaggs, George Strait, and Randy Travis. That year, she won the Country Music Association Awards' Female Vocalist of the Year, her first major industry award. The album was certified Gold.|$|E

500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E

It’s a symptom of some kind of broader social resistance to this message. People, they don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> Because they’ve got a kid or a sibling or a cousin or something or a nephew playing the sport, and they still want to close their eyes and block their ears." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kindred {{reveals the}} {{repressed}} trauma slavery caused in America’s collective memory of history. In {{an interview on}} 1985, Butler suggested that this trauma partly comes from attempts to forget America's dark past: [...] "I think most people don’t know or don’t realize that at least 10 million blacks were killed just {{on the way to}} this country, just during the middle passage....They don’t really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> partly because it makes whites feel guilty." [...] In a later interview with Randall Kenan, Butler explained how debilitating this trauma has been for Americans, especially for African Americans, as symbolized by the loss of her protagonist’s left arm: [...] "I couldn’t really let [...] come all the way back. I couldn’t let her return to what she was, I couldn’t let her come back whole and , I think, really symbolizes her not coming back whole. Antebellum slavery didn’t leave people quite whole." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the 2009 Reading Festival, Radiohead did {{not perform}} [...] "Creep" [...] again until 2016, when they {{performed}} it several times on tour for their ninth studio album, A Moon Shaped Pool. After a fan spent the majority of a concert shouting for it, the band decided to play it to [...] "see what the reaction is, {{just to see how}} it feels.'" [...] O'Brien said of the song in 2017: [...] "It's nice to play for the right reasons. People like it and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> We do err towards not playing it because you don't want it to feel like show business. But we started throwing it in last year." [...] In the same interview, Yorke said: [...] "It can be cool sometimes, but other times I want to stop halfway through and be like, 'Nah, this isn't happening.'" [...] Later that year, the band performed the song during the encore of their headline performance at the Glastonbury Festival.|$|E
2500|$|Ramadan denies {{contacts}} with terrorists or other Islamic fundamentalists and {{the charges of}} anti-Semitism and double talk, attributing the charges to misinterpretation and an unfamiliarity with his writings. He stated: [...] "I have often been accused of this 'double discourse', and {{to those who say}} it, I say – bring the evidence. I am quite clear in what I say. The problem is that many people don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it,</b> particularly in the media. Most of the stories about me are completely untrue: journalists simply repeat black propaganda from the internet without any corroboration, and it just confirms what they want to believe. Words are used out of context. There is double-talk, yes, but there is also double-hearing. That is what I want to challenge." [...] In answer to criticism of his response to 11 September, Ramadan replied that two days after the attacks he had published an open letter, exhorting Muslims to condemn the attacks and the attackers, and not to [...] "hide behind conspiracy theories." [...] and that less than two weeks after the attacks he had stated that [...] "The probability [...] is large, but some questions remain unanswered. ... But whoever they are, Bin Laden or others, it is necessary to find them and that they be judged", and that the interview had been conducted before any evidence was publicly available.|$|E
