25|$|Rodion's {{political}} case resurfaced during polemics {{launched by}} the Romanian antisemites and the antisemitic fascists, down {{to the end of}} World War II. Poet and Premier Octavian Goga outlined his self-declared hatred for the Jews and call for discriminatory policies in his political tracts, but, unusually in this context, stated that he held no such grudge against either Rodion or Ronetti Roman. According to Radu Cosașu, Rodion's failure to integrate announced the similar drama of 1930s Jewish writer Mihail Sebastian, <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> perceived as Romanian but was in return vilified by the far right. In 1941, the authoritarian regime of Ion Antonescu published a directory of Jewish Romanian authors, living or deceased, whose work was officially banned: Steuerman was included, under the erroneous spelling Steverman.|$|E
25|$|The New Theatre {{movement}} {{started in}} America {{in the late}} 1920s.

When New Theatre groups were formed in Australia (beginning mainly as Worker's arts groups) they continued using agit prop in their plays. They were also committed to developing the highest possible theatrical standards as well as to introduce it to the Australian people by infusing theatre into cultural groups in all industries, organisations and districts.

For members of the royal family, Thánh Tông had them hire the poor to cultivate their land and thus created a social reform.|$|E

25|$|James Livingston was a 15th-century cleric from East Lothian in {{south-eastern}} Scotland. Born at {{an unknown}} {{date in the}} 15th century, he was a son of the Laird of Saltcoats.

After the death of Thomas Lauder, Livingston was chosen as his successor as Bishop of Dunkeld. Although Livingston's appointment was contested at Rome by Thomas Spens, Bishop of Aberdeen, <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> translated to Dunkeld, Livingston was consecrated on 30 June 1476.

25|$|In the meantime, Charlotte had an {{idea that}} would place all the {{advantages}} on her side. On advice from her father and friends, she thought {{that she and her}} sisters had the intellectual capacity to create a school for young girls in the parsonage where their Sunday School classes took place. It was agreed to offer the future pupils the opportunity of correctly learning modern languages and that preparation for this should be done abroad, which led to a further decision. Among the possibilities Paris and Lille were considered, but were rejected due to aversion to the French. Indeed, the French revolution and the Napoleonic wars had not been forgotten by the Tory spirited and deeply conservative girls. On the recommendation of a pastor based in Brussels, <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of help, Belgium was chosen, where they could also study German, and music.

25|$|Lucrezia Borgia {{was born}} at Subiaco, near Rome. Her mother was Vannozza dei Cattanei, one of the mistresses of Lucrezia's father, Rodrigo Borgia (Pope Alexander VI). Lucrezia Borgia's {{education}} was entrusted to Adriana Orsini de Milan, a close confidant of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia (Pope Alexander VI) during her early life. Her education would primarily {{take place in the}} Piazza Pizzo de Merlo, a building adjacent to her fathers residence. Her education is common for a woman of her social stature, but uncommon for someone of her gender. Unlike educated women of her time her ascension came from within the sphere of intellectuals in court and close relatives. For most women <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> educated, convents were the primary source for knowledge. Her upbringing would differentiate to others due to the inclusion of Humanities, which the Catholic Church at the time considered detrimental to the foundations of piety and obedience. This education would be successful in teaching Lucrezia; Spanish, Catalan, Italian, French, and some dominance of Latin and Greek. She would also become proficient in the lute, poetry, and oration. The biggest testament is her capability in administration, as later on in life she would take care of Vatican City correspondence and governance of Ferrara.|$|E

He encouraged and supported other translators, as well. In 1845, he published The Poets and Poetry of Europe, an 800-page compilation of translations made by other writers, including many by his friend and colleague Cornelius Conway Felton. Longfellow intended the anthology [...] "to bring together, into a compact and convenient form, as large an amount as possible of those English translations which are scattered through many volumes, and are not accessible to the general reader". In honor of his role with translations, Harvard established the Longfellow Institute in 1994, dedicated to literature written in the United States in languages other than English.|$|E
