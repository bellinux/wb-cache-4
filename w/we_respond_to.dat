5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. <b>We</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how <b>we</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E

2500|$|Francis {{has been}} in the {{forefront}} of insisting on the importance of helping refugees. His suggestion “to not raise walls but bridges" [...] was widely interpreted by the media as addressed to President Trump, and repeated by Francis with regards to Trump's immigration policy. [...] Francis has said that “to speak properly of our own rights, we need to broaden our perspective and to hear the plea of other peoples and other regions than those of our own country” (EG 190). More broadly he is concerned that [...] "a globalization of indifference has developed; ... the culture of prosperity deadens us; ... those lives stunted for lack of opportunity seem a mere spectacle; they fail to move us" [...] (EG 54).He suggests that we should find Jesus in others, in their faces, voices, pleas – redoubling our efforts to live in fraternity (EG 90). Lay ministries must go beyond serving our own community and show real commitment to transform every aspect of life in society with Jesus' values (EG 94). Only in this way can <b>we</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the evangelical mandate that we have God's love in us, if we do not refuse help to those in need (1 Jn 3:17 in EG 187).|$|E
60|$|And {{with the}} human {{imagination}} all these elementary instincts, of the flesh, of curiosity, of self-assertion, become only the basal substance of a huge elaborate edifice of secondary motive and intention.

Our pride turns {{this way and that}} as <b>we</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> new notes in the world about us. We are arenas for a conflict between suggestions flung in from all sources, from the most diverse and essentially incompatible sources. We live long hours and days in a kind of dream, negligent of self-interest, our elementary passions in abeyance, among these derivative things.|$|E

50|$|Fitting the {{response}} to the recipient. Another aspect of qualitative fit is what counts subjectively, for the recipient, as a response in-kind. When <b>we</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> people who have benefited us, it seems perverse to give them things they do not regard as benefits. The general principle here is that, other things equal, a return of good for good received will require giving something that will actually be appreciated as good by the recipient - at least eventually. Similarly for the negative side. When <b>we</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> bad things, reciprocity presumably requires a return that the recipient regards as a bad thing.|$|E
