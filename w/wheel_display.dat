50|$|Different size meters {{indicate}} different {{resolutions of}} the reading. One {{rotation of the}} sweep hand may be equivalent to 10 gallons or to 1,000 gallons (1 to 100 ft.3, 0.1 to 10 m3). If one rotation of the hand represents 10 gallons, the meter has a 10-gallon sweep. Sometimes the last number(s) of the <b>wheel</b> <b>display</b> are non-rotating or printed on the dial face. The fixed zero number(s) are represented by {{the position of the}} rotating sweep hand. For example, if one rotation of the hand is 10 gallons, the sweep hand is on 7, and the <b>wheel</b> <b>display</b> shows 123456 plus a fixed zero, the actual total usage would be 1,234,567 gallons.|$|E
40|$|In most mammals, daily rhythms in {{physiology}} {{are driven}} by a circadian timing system composed of a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and peripheral oscillators in most body cells. The SCN clock, which is phase-entrained by light–dark cycles, is thought to synchronize subsidiary oscillators in peripheral tissues, mainly by driving cyclic feeding behavior. Here, we examined the expression of circadian clock genes in the SCN and the liver of the common vole Microtus arvalis, a rodent with ultradian activity and feeding rhythms. In these animals, clock-gene mRNAs accumulate with high circadian amplitudes in the SCN but are present at nearly constant levels in the liver. Interestingly, high-amplitude circadian liver gene expression can be elicited by subjecting voles to a circadian feeding regimen. Moreover, voles with access to a running <b>wheel</b> <b>display</b> a composite pattern of circadian and ultradian behavior, which correlates with low-amplitude circadian gene expression in the liver. Our data indicate that, in M. arvalis, the amplitude of circadian liver gene expression depends on the contribution of circadian and ultradian components in activity and feeding rhythms. ...|$|E

A wrong answer changes a green wedge to red, or if all the wedges were already red, eliminates the player.|$|R
5000|$|In Malta, Catherine {{wheels are}} a {{traditional}} fixture during every village 'festa'. Some villages even hold competitions {{on the eve}} of the parish feast, while others display the vast work of one firework factory. Entrants display a variety of moving shapes and include various colours year after year as the technology progresses. These displays are only a small part of the firework catalogue planned throughout the week preceding the feast and on the feast day itself. The Catherine <b>wheel</b> <b>displays</b> typically end with the burning of what is called 'the carpet': the largest Catherine <b>wheel</b> in the <b>display</b> on the night.|$|R

Its head somewhat resembles Hello Kitty, and various parts of the robot retain a car-like motif, with the dashboard and steering <b>wheel</b> <b>displayed</b> on the waist, while wheels axle details are visible on the limbs. At first it could only transform into human size then later grow into a larger form (similar to the transformation sequence of Ultraman). The Radiacar Robo can only retain this form for one minute.|$|R

50|$|Four of {{the known}} {{machines}} have inner wheels of complements, which were used to enter the first operand in a subtraction. They are mounted {{at the center of}} each spoked metal wheel and turn with it. The <b>wheel</b> <b>displayed</b> in the picture above has an inner wheel of complements but the numbers written on it are barely visible. On a decimal machine, the digits 0 through 9 are carved clockwise, with each digit positioned between two spokes so that the operator can directly inscribe its value in the window of complements by positioning his stylus in between them and turning the wheel clockwise {{all the way to the}} stop lever. The marks on two adjacent spokes flank the digit 0 inscribed on this wheel.|$|R

60|$|Then {{she rode}} away, and George joined Edgar. He {{felt that he}} had been given a warning. On {{reaching}} home, he harnessed a team and drove off to a sloo to haul in hay, but while he worked he cast anxious glances at the clouds. They rolled on above him in an endless procession, opening out to emit a passing blaze of sunshine, and closing in again. The horses were restless, he could hardly get them to stand; the grasses stirred and rustled in a curious manner; and even the little gophers that scurried away from the wagon <b>wheels</b> <b>displayed</b> an unusual and feverish activity. Yet there was not a drop of rain, and the man toiled on in savage impatience, wondering whether he must once more resign himself to see the promised deluge pass away.|$|R

25|$|The {{principle}} of the clock (input <b>wheels</b> and <b>display</b> <b>wheels</b> added to a clock like mechanism) for a direct entry calculating machine couldn't be implemented to create a fully effective calculating machine without additional innovation with the technological capabilities of the 17th century. because their gears would jam when a carry had to be moved several places along the accumulator. The only 17th century calculating clocks that have survived to this day {{do not have a}} machine wide carry mechanism and therefore cannot be called fully effective mechanical calculators. A much more successful calculating clock was built by the Italian Giovanni Poleni in the 18th century and was a two-motion calculating clock (the numbers are inscribed first and then they are processed).|$|R
