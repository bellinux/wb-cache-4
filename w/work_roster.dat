To {{ensure that}} {{effective}} management development and training {{is incorporated in}} managerial training programmes, {{it is imperative that}} an analysis is undertaken to ascertain what skill gaps exist. The aim {{of the study was to}} survey the management expertise of Radiographers in management positions. Reference was made to identify specific skill gaps, and skill gap opportunities. The study also intended to determine whether specific trends existed in certain sectors of the public, private and mining health sector. The first part of the study consisted of a postal questionnaire. A total of two hundred and fifteen Radiographers in management positions from the public, private and mining hospitals in the Gauteng, Limpopo and Mpumalanga regions of South Africa were chosen for the study. The sample population was then contacted telephonically before the postal questionnaire commenced. An outline of what the research entailed was explained to each participant. The results were statistically analysed from a total of sixty-three technically correct questionnaires received. The findings were summarised by means of using descriptive statistics. Statistical analysis of the received data validated that management, interpersonal and leadership skills were shown to be lacking in all three sectors. These skills, according to all of the three sectors, required both reinforcing and developing. Skills of least importance which did not require reinforcing or developing included <b>work</b> <b>roster</b> strategy, recruitment strategy and tendering skills. The results obtained from the postal questionnaire were re-tested by means of a structured interview involving thirty Radiographers in management positions from the same regions to that of the postal questionnaire. Once the data had been compiled, descriptive statistics were again employed to summarise the findings. Participants expressed an interest in developing managerial skills relating to laws and regulations, conflict resolution, interpersonal skills and financial management. The findings of the research supported and acknowledged that, in order for competent managers and leaders to be trained and developed in the field of Radiography, a planned and purposeful approach should be adopted where skills gaps are analysed and focused upon...|$|E

40|$|Population centres in Northern Australia {{concentrate}} {{along the}} coast line (the cities of Darwin and Broome {{in the west and}} Cairns and Townsville in the east), while the inland region exhibits small villages/towns scattered across space. However, the inland area is also rich in mineral resources. Given the small sized populations in the inland regions, local labour markets are too thin for the extractive industries to rely on finding qualified personnel. To meet their human resources requirements, the extractive industries have to draw workers from the dense labour markets in the coastal cities and subsequently develop fly‐in/fly‐out arrangements to interested city workers. Notwithstanding the attractive remuneration packages that the extractive industries offer, they struggle to meet their human resources needs through recruitment from city workers interested in fly‐in/fly-out work in the extractive industry. In light of these recruitment difficulties, the extractive industry's retention policies are of crucial importance. This paper will focus on the drivers of worker induced job separation. We exploit a unique data set of nearly 500 workers who (1) reside in either Cairns or Townsville (we surveyed fly‐in/fly‐out workers both at Cairns and Townsville Airport), (2) work elsewhere in Australia in the extractive industries and industries associated with the extractive industries (mainly construction) and (3) commute to work by plane. The written survey was conducted over a four week period in October / November 2012. Besides a comprehensive set of demographic information, we collected information about their job (including type of contract, occupation, <b>work</b> <b>roster,</b> shift length and remuneration levels), educational background, their work experience (in and outside the extractive industries and as a fly‐in/fly‐out worker), quality of onsite accommodation, and their actual and desired intensity of social interaction with family and friends, while both at home and at work. Furthermore we asked to rate the percent chance they would voluntarily leave their current job within the next 12 months, which we use as an indicator of the likelihood of worker induced job separation. The findings from this paper are especially relevant to human resources departments of mining companies and policy makers attempting to create city hubs for fly‐in/fly‐out workers...|$|E

40|$|Aim - To {{identify}} {{and explore the}} relationships between stages of the rostering process and the robustness of the <b>worked</b> <b>roster.</b> Background - Once published, a nurse roster is often subject to many changes. However, post-approval changes and their implications are rarely examined. Consequently, {{there is little evidence}} to determine whether a ‘worked’ roster was safe, efficient or fair. Electronic rostering systems provide greater transparency of the rostering process allowing postapproval changes to be examined more thoroughly. Design - Using quantitative data, this study compares the outcomes from different stages of the roster process with the shifts breaking roster rules. Methods - This study covered the period November 2009 –January 2013 and included forty-two roster periods from fifteen wards. For each of the rosters, data specifying the type of shift assignment (request, manual and automatic) and number of shifts changed after approval (response variables) were captured. Linear regression analysis was then used to {{identify and}} explore the relationships between these response variables and the number of shifts breaking rules. Findings - Roster robustness is unaffected by the number of staff requests, Yet, how shifts are assigned before approval and the number of changes postapproval have a marked effect on the robustness of the roster. Conclusions - Roster ‘robustness’ is determined by the quality of the approved roster and subsequent postapproval demand- and supply-driven changes. Despite evidence that e-rostering can improve roster robustness, many Ward Managers prefer to roster manually. On some wards, rosters are approved, regardless of the number of rule breakages occurring. </p...|$|R
40|$|Families {{in remote}} mining towns {{constitute}} a specific sociological group living under unique geographical and sociocultural circumstances. Isolation {{from friends and}} relatives and limited resources and opportunities for family members of mine workers {{are some of the}} distinct disadvantages of these towns. Decades ago it was observed {{that a large number of}} women in new and remote mining towns suffered from neurotic problems. In contemporary times there is a deficit of knowledge about the mental health of women in remote mining towns. However, there are certain indicators of significant mental distress among women living in these particular environments. Deriving from a review of literature, this paper explores various mining work-related issues and sociocultural settings and processes within remote mining towns that could possibly exert coercive pressures on the psychological health of female partners of mine workers and their relationship well-being. The paper suggests that work schedules and preponderance of men in mining jobs help promote a patriarchal culture within the community and the family; thereby marginalising women to a secondary status. Limited opportunities and resources within the community isolate women to domestic lives; while atypical <b>work</b> <b>rosters</b> associated with mining employment could negatively impact on the relationship well-being of couples. The paper recommends that an inquiry into psychiatric well-being among women of remote mining communities needs to consider the sociocultural structure and processes within these communities, and the structural nature of the mining job that could be responsible for role strain-induced stress and mental health problems among these women.

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that perceptions of time pressure are increasing and are particularly acute in households where both parents combine paid work with household and caring responsibilities. What specific strategies do working parents use to 'manage' the three-way juggling act of 'his' job, 'her' job, and family responsibilities, while still finding time for leisure and civic contribution? This question was {{addressed in a}} series of focus groups conducted in NSW and Queensland in 2003 / 2004 that are part of a larger study investigating issues of work/life balance among parents in dual-earner households in Australia. In reviewing the range of strategies used to 'manage' competing demands on parental and family time, our data lend support to Arlie Hochschild's observation in The Time Bind (1997 : 45 - 46) that family time has taken on an 'industrial tone', is succumbing to 'a cult of efficiency previously associated with the workplace', and is linked to Taylor's idea of scientific management. Use of task lists, <b>work</b> <b>rosters</b> and travel itineraries (often displayed on the family fridge), as well as the deliberate scheduling of 'quality' family time and outsourcing of domestic services related to children's leisure activities, family entertainment and food, bear testimony {{to the ways in which}} time is often micro-managed in the interests of efficiency. But with what effect? We question the effectiveness of such strategies in promoting work/life balance in the context of debates about the impact of hurried lifestyles on personal relationships, parental satisfaction, family integration and individual wellbeing.

40|$|Until the 1970 s mining leases {{were issued}} by state governments subject to {{conditions}} that companies build or substantially finance local community infrastructure, including housing, streets, transport, schools, hospitals and recreation facilities.

Shortly after arriving, she was attacked by Cybermancer who was from an alternate future. The real Suzi was put in stasis and placed in Force Works sub-basement and Cybermancer took her place pretending to be her. As she was held in stasis, this Cybermancer soon replaced an absent Century on Force <b>Works</b> <b>roster</b> {{with the help of}} Iron Man, who was under the influence of Immortus (posing as Kang the Conqueror). Suzi was soon found by Amanda Chaney who Iron Man discovered and killed, but not before she managed to call Rachel Carpenter and informed her of Iron Man’s betrayal. After the other members of Force Works defeated Iron Man and Cybermancer they freed Suzi from stasis and introduced her to her possible future self. She had a long conversation with her other self who told her that she also would become like her and she couldn’t do anything to change it. Same time at the tech lab the time portal was suddenly re-opened, and two of the techno-Suzi’s associates came through looking for her-the extremely dangerous and highly evolved Ultron and her mechanoid lover, Wonder Man. Liberating her from her prison, the three foreign entities went in search of the Cybermancer suit, but the real Suzi took it from its storage container in order to keep it out of her wicked twin’s hands. Force Works was told that the alternate time line Ultron, Wonder Man, and the techno-organic Suzi came from was completely destroyed, and Force Works decided that they would try to help them survive on their Earth. The damage was too great, however, because the still opened gateway took back what was originally from that world and claimed the lives of evil Suzi and Ultron. In an attempt to close the portal and stop the destruction, Wonder Man sacrificed himself by diving back into the dimensional doorway. It wasn’t enough to seal it shut, but the real Suzi showed up with the Cybermancer armor and used the costume’s gauntlet to remote control the suit and send it back where it came from to permanently seal the portal.|$|R
