500|$|By the 21st century, Seacole {{was much}} more prominent. Several {{buildings}} and entities, mainly connected with health care, were named after her. In 2005, Boris Johnson (former Mayor of London, then editor of The Spectator) wrote of learning about Seacole from his daughter's school pageant and speculated: [...] "I find myself facing the grim possibility that it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> education that was blinkered." [...] In 2007 Seacole was introduced into the National Curriculum, and her life story is taught at many primary schools in the UK alongside that of Florence Nightingale.|$|E
500|$|Larwood {{was first}} called for full county duty on 20 August 1924, against Northamptonshire, at Trent Bridge. He bowled 26 overs in all, conceded 71 runs {{and took the}} wicket of Vallance Jupp, an {{experienced}} Test all-rounder. His assessment of his performance was negative: [...] "I wasn't ready". Iremonger was much more positive, assuring Larwood that his bowling required only fine tuning. Larwood had also gained {{the support of the}} county captain, Arthur Carr, a powerful personality who decided that the new recruit had the makings of a future Test match bowler. [...] "The {{best way to deal with}} him", Carr said later, [...] "was as if he <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> son". Carr played a major part in encouraging and developing the young bowler's talents, and acted as Larwood's guiding spirit throughout the latter's career.|$|E

500|$|Clayton {{made the}} news in August 1989 {{when he was arrested}} in Dublin for {{carrying}} a small amount of marijuana. However, he avoided conviction by making a large donation to charity, and later commented [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> fault. And I'm sure I was out of my head– emotionally apart from anything else. But it is serious because it is illegal." [...] Clayton has also had alcohol problems, which came to a head during the Zoo TV Tour. On 26 November 1993 he was so hung over that he was unable to play that night's show in Sydney, the dress rehearsal for their [...] Bass duties had to be fulfilled by Clayton's technician Stuart Morgan. After that incident, however, he gave up alcohol. On 26 June 2017, Clayton received the Stevie Ray Vaughan Award at the MusiCares 13th annual MAP Fund Benefit Concert in recognition of his commitment to helping others with addiction recovery.|$|E
500|$|Dick became {{concerned}} {{that no one}} had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood. After Dick criticized an early version of Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles Select TV Guide, the studio sent Dick the Peoples rewrite. Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script and with a 20-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well-known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it. He said, [...] "I saw a segment of Douglas Trumbull's special effects for Blade Runner on the KNBC-TV news. I recognized it immediately. It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> interior world. They caught it perfectly." [...] He also approved of the film's script, saying, [...] "After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other, so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel." [...] The motion picture was dedicated to Dick. Principal photography of Blade Runner began on March 9, 1981, and ended four months later.|$|E

Despite this, Hill won by 115pts with a season's best 6,669. Theisen-Eaton was disappointed with her silver medal saying [...] "I'm disappointed. I went in as the favourite and I didn't compete how I had to to win gold. And that <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> fault. So I am disappointed with it, {{but there are some}} lessons that I have learned from it that hopefully I can take into next year...I mean, I scored 250 points less than I already have this year, and had I just done the same thing I had done already previously this year, it would have got me a gold." ...|$|E

2500|$|Williams married four times. She met {{her first}} husband Leonard Kovner while {{attending}} Los Angeles City College. She later wrote in her autobiography The Million Dollar Mermaid that [...] "he was smart, handsome, dependable...and dull. I respected his intelligence, and his dedication to a future career in medicine. He loved me, or so he said, and even asked me to marry him." [...] They were married in the San Francisco suburb of Los Altos on June 27, 1940. On their split she said [...] "I found, much to my relief, that all I needed for my emotional and personal security <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> resolve and determination. I didn't need a marriage and a ring. I had come to realize all too quickly that Leonard Kovner {{was not a man}} I could ever really love." [...] They divorced on September 12, 1944.|$|E
2500|$|She {{raised her}} three {{children}} with Birley at Pelham cottage. [...] Her eldest son Rupert, who was born on 20 August 1955, studied at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. [...] In 1986, he disappeared {{off the coast of}} Togo in West Africa, where he was presumed drowned. [...] "There really is nothing worse than losing a child – and there is something special about your first-born", she said, adding that, [...] "Because I was so young when Rupert was born ... we were more like good friends than mother and son." [...] Her second son Robin (b. 19 February 1958) is a businessman, whose face was disfigured as a child when he was mauled by a tigress at John Aspinall's private zoo. Having let him go near the pregnant tigress, Lady Annabel said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> fault. I was, am, angry with myself." [...] Her first daughter India Jane (b. 14 January 1961), the granddaughter of society portrait painter Sir Oswald Birley, is an artist.|$|E
