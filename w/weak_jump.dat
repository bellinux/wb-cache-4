In Super Mario Bros. 2, the game describes him as being the strongest and fastest character in the game with 5 out of 5 stars each, but with a <b>weak</b> <b>jumping</b> ability, rated at 2 stars. In Wario's Woods, Toad has the unique ability to run up walls and make strong kicks. Toad is once again given superhuman strength in the game, as {{he is able to}} lift and throw enemies around; however, these abilities have not been seen since this game. In New Super Mario Bros.

40|$|Temperature‐dependent ESR {{spectra of}} O− 2 adsorbed on Ti ions {{supported}} on porous Vycor glass were observed {{over the range}} 4. 2 to 400 [*]°K. These spectra were obtained under normal high vacuum conditions as well as under UHV conditions (P⩽ 10 − 9 Torr) and are very well resolved. It was observed that the line position of the g tensor component that is perpendicular to the internuclear axis of O− 2 remained constant with temperature, whereas the other two components of the g tensor shift in position with temperature, and are accompanied by drastic line shape changes. This observation indicates that the molecular motion of O− 2 on the surface is highly anisotropic, consisting essentially of planar rotation about the axis perpendicular to the internuclear axis of O− 2 and parallel to the normal to the surface. Furthermore, the observation of nonequivalent 17 O hfs of O− 2 suggests that the internuclear axis of O− 2 might be tilted slightly from the surface and/or one oxygen {{is closer to the}} Ti 4 +. The ESR line shapes were simulated for the different possible models: Brownian diffusion, jump diffusion (from <b>weak</b> <b>jump</b> to strong jump), approximate free diffusion, and discrete jump. It was found that the theoretical spectra calculated using the model of <b>weak</b> <b>jump</b> rotational diffusion best fit the observed spectra in the temperature range below 57. 4 [*]°K. However, in the temperature range above 57. 4 [*]°K, although the Brownian diffusion model seems the best among the models used, none of the present models used could successfully reproduce the observed line shapes. The rotational correlation time τR∥ was found to range between 10 − 5 sec (below 14. 5 [*]°K) and 10 − 9 sec (263 [*]°K). The values of τR∥ depend strongly on the model used in the lower temperature range, but were essentially independent of model above 100 [*]°K. The activation energy for rotational diffusion was estimated to be 0. 5 kcal/mole above 100 [*]°K. The line shape below 15 [*]°K is independent of temperature, although the O− 2 spectrum appears to exhibit residual motional effects. This observation suggests that coherent quantum mechanical motion is predominant below 15 [*]°K. This matter is discussed in some detail, and the appropriate theory to investigate quantum effects on the motional dynamics is outlined including possible isotope effects on the motion. Spectral observation of possible interaction between C 2 H 4 and O− 2 on the surface is presented. Also discussed are the techniques for preparing samples with strong well‐resolved signals and for removing the other types of O− 2 signals, which do not show significant temperature‐dependent spectral change...|$|E

40|$|Low scoring {{within the}} paint {{area is the}} biggest issue for the Japan men 2 ̆ 7 s {{national}} basketball team, and therefore {{it is necessary for}} them to acquire a new approach to shooting that would increase the attacking variations for attempting a higher percentage of shots within this area. This study focused on the validity of the floater shot as a new offensive approach for overcoming this problem, and examined its usefulness and mechanism using three-dimensional motion analysis (VICONMX+). Comparison of the floater shot with the jump shot and lay-up shot revealed that the mechanism of the former involved (1) absence of a shooting posture, (2) a low vertical jump involving a slow step, (3) raising the shooting arm in a vertical direction, and (4) a highly arched ball trajectory with a height roughly {{the same as that of}} the top of the backboard. Our examination also revealed that maintaining one 2 ̆ 7 s distance from the defense through a <b>weak</b> <b>jump</b> and retroversion of the trunk, upsetting the timing of the blocking shot through release from a non-stopping motion, and shooting the ball over the hand during the blocking shot through the high-arched ball trajectory by elevating the shooting arm in a vertical direction were useful for achieving a high percentage of shots within the paint area, where the influences of height and selective defense are greater. These results are of relevance to not only the Japan men 2 ̆ 7 s national basketball team but also any team with a smaller stature when considering how to improve the scoring rate within the paint area...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, options {{have been}} the {{preferred}} derivative in Western markets, whereas in Hong Kong and much of Asia, warrants are preferred over options as hedging vehicles. Empirical {{studies have shown that}} the pricing of warrants differs from that of options. These studies examined the value of warrants without determining the underlying process implied by actual warrant prices. Moreover, most research focuses on developed markets like the US or Japan, or on inferring the price of warrants from options prices. This research set out to examine the asset pricing processes underlying exchange-listed options and structured warrants on the Hang Seng Index (HSI). It also aims to examine the effect of warrant-issuers’ credit ratings on pricing differences between HSI Options (HSIO) and HSI Warrants (HSIW). The study addresses several research questions: “Are both continuous and jump components present in the asset pricing processes of HSIO and HSIW?” and “If so, do these components interact over time?”; “Are there differences between the asset pricing processes of HSIO and HSIW?”; “Does the price of HSIW depend on the warrant-issuer?” and “Do issuers’ credit ratings have any effect on the different pricing between HSIO and HSIW?” Hypotheses were developed to investigate these questions. To address the research questions and hypotheses, this study adopts: (a) Carr and Wu’s (2003 b) method of identifying the presence of jump and continuous components in the asset pricing; and (b) Chan and Pinder’s (2000) applied regression analysis test. This test was used to find evidence of different pricing between options and warrants in the Australian market. This research uses data in the Hong Kong market with a sample period from 2009 to 2013. Carr and Wu’s (2003 b) method, was used to create term decay plots for HSIO and HSIW to determine the components in the asset pricing processes of these securities. Then, Chan and Pinder’s (2000) regression analysis method was used to investigate differences in pricing between HSIO and HSIW, and the effect of warrant-issuers’ credit risk on HSIW pricing. To the best of the researcher’s knowledge, this research is the first to determine the process underlying HSIO and HSIW prices by examining the term decay plots of these securities in the Hong Kong market. It contributes to the literature by examining not only a different market but also a different financial product. It therefore extends prior research by enabling the comparison of findings in two different markets and products. Evidence was found (a) of a continuous component and a <b>weak</b> <b>jump</b> component in the asset pricing process of HSIO, broadly consistent with Carr and Wu’s (2003 b) findings for S&P 500 put options on the NYSE, (b) of a purely jump component in the asset pricing process for HSIW, (c) that characteristics of warrantissuers are associated with relative pricing differences between HSIO and HSIW, and (d) that one of these characteristics is the credit risk of the warrant-issuer. Future research could seek to establish a means of investigating further the pricing processes underlying the HSIW. Ideally the methodology would incorporate the role of credit risk, as this study has shown it is a significant factor in HSIW price behaviour. Given the scarcity of literature on structured warrants, this research can help warrantissuers adopt better hedging techniques to reduce risk when issuing warrants. This study potentially assists investors to improve their use of warrants as hedging, arbitraging, investing and speculative vehicles. It is hoped that the findings will expand researchers’ understanding of the components in the asset pricing process of options and warrants. It is also hoped that the thesis will provide insight into the different pricing between options and warrants due to different components in the underlying processes...|$|E

40|$|Small-amplitude elastic {{jumps on}} fluid-filled, axisymmetrically deformed, {{tethered}} elastic tubes are studied. In {{the case of}} elastic jumps across which flow force is conserved, we show that while {{there must be some}} turbulent energy loss for a jump to exist, energy can also be radiated from the jump through a cnoidal wavetrain. If the turbulent energy loss is small, the wavetrain consists of almost solitary waves, while the maximum permissible energy loss corresponds to a transition between uniform flows. Whether the wavetrain occurs up- or down-stream of the jump depends on the elastic properties of the tube wall, the pre-stretch and the mean radius of the tube. By means of the numerical integration of a viscosity-modified Korteweg-de Vries equation, solutions are also obtained for the time development of <b>weak</b> laminar elastic <b>jumps</b> propagating into fluid at rest. The shape of the jump profile depends on the same parameters as govern the profile of a <b>weak</b> turbulent <b>jump.</b> Calculation of these governing parameters using typical work functions suggests that each of the four types of jump profile predicted should be observable.

40|$|We present {{similarity}} {{solutions for}} adiabatic bubbles that are blown by winds having time independent mechanical luminosities {{and that are}} each mass-loaded by the hydrodynamic ablation of distributed clumps. The mass loading is `switched-on' at a specified radius (with free-expansion of the wind interior to this point) and injects mass at a rate per unit volume proportional to M^delta r^lambda where delta = 4 / 3 (1) if the flow is subsonic (supersonic) {{with respect to the}} clumps. In the limit of negligible mass loading a similarity solution found by Dyson (1973) for expansion into a smooth ambient medium is recovered. The presence of mass loading heats the flow, which leads to a reduction in the Mach number of the supersonic freely-expanding flow, and <b>weaker</b> <b>jump</b> conditions across the inner shock. In solutions with large mass loading, it is possible for the wind to connect directly to the contact discontinuity without first passing through an inner shock. For a solution that gives the mass of swept-up ambient gas to be less than the sum of the masses of the wind and ablated material, lambda < - 2. Maximum possible values for the ratio of ablated mass to wind mass occur when mass loading starts very close to the bubble center and when the flow is supersonic with respect to the clumps over the entire bubble radius. The maximum temperature in the bubble often occurs near the onset of mass loading, and in some cases can be many times greater than the post-inner-shock temperature. Our solutions are relevant to eg stellar wind-blown bubbles, galactic winds, etc. This work complements Pittard et al (2001) where it was assumed that clumps were evaporated through conductive energy transport.

A less accurate analogy has been shown to obtain between hydraulic jumps and compression shocks.

This experimental study was primarily concerned with the Mach interactions of hydraulic jumps.

40|$|A {{hydraulic}} jump is {{the transition from}} supercritical to subcritical flow in an open channel flow. Hy-draulic jumps are often observed behind dams and they are also used as an energy-dissipation mechanism in spillways. A {{hydraulic jump}} {{is characterized by the}} upstream Froude number Fr = u√ gh 0, where u is the (uniform) upstream horizontal flow velocity, g is the gravitational constant, and h 0 is the flow depth. Depending on the upstream Froude number, different types of jumps are possible, including undular jumps, and fully developed turbulent jumps [2]. All hy-draulic jumps experience some form of energy loss. While the energy loss in a turbulent hydraulic jump can be attributed to turbulent dissipation, an undular hydraulic jump loses energy due to an increasing number of waves in the downstream part. The present study is concerned with <b>weak</b> hydraulic <b>jumps,</b> where it is assumed that no wave-breaking is taking place. The common explanation for the energy loss in an undular hydraulic jump is that energy is radiated from the jump by an increasing number of oscillations traveling downstream. The energy loss can be computed by an analysis of the conservation equations associated with a jump solution of the shallow-water system ηt + h 0 ux + (uη) x = 0, (1) ut + gηx + uux = 0, (2) where η denotes the deflection of the free surface. As is well known, conservation of mass and momentum across the jump necessitate a loss of energy, and this energy loss can be computed explicitly [3].

40|$|Sediment {{accumulation}} downstream of {{hydraulic jumps}} {{can occur in}} many settings but the architectures of such deposits are poorly documented. Here, three flume runs were {{used to examine the}} influence of sediment grain size and transport rate on the characteristics of hydraulic-jump unit bars. In one of these runs six hydraulic-jump unit bars formed a hydraulic-jump bar complex. In another, the same sediment was supplied more quickly and only two unit bars formed. In the third run with the same sediment supply rate, but different grain size, only one large unit bar formed. All unit bars developed in a similar way but their size and internal architecture differed; they all resulted from a reduction in sediment transport capacity at the transition from supercritical flow to subcritical flow in the hydraulic jump. After initial onset of sedimentation and unit bar formation, generation of subsequent unit bars may be: (i) related to small changes in sediment flux; and (ii) independent of changes in the hydraulic jump. Continued sedimentation caused changes from oscillating to <b>weak</b> hydraulic <b>jumps</b> and hydraulic-jump unit bars formed in both circumstances. The flow of water and suspended sediment becomes shallower over the lee of the bar complex. This leads to flow acceleration and a return to supercritical flow conditions. In turn, a chain of such features can form and generate a chute and pool bed morphology. There is an inherent upper size limit to a hydraulic-jump bar complex due to the changing flow conditions over the growing deposit as the water above it becomes shallower. There is also an amplitude minimum for the development of foresets and subsequent unit bar growth. Hydraulic-jump unit bars have architectures that should be recognizable in the rock record and because their size is constrained by the flow conditions, their identification should be useful for interpreting palaeoenvironment...|$|R

In the moderate Reynolds number regime, we obtain steady undular jumps with a separated bubble underneath the first few undulations. Interestingly, surface tension leads to shortening of wavelength of these undulations. We show that the undulations can be explained using the inviscid theory of Benjamin and Lighthill (Proc. R. Soc.

Ballistics and high-speed cinematography were used to quantify the energy, distance, and take-off angle of the jump at 15, 25, and 35 °C in the locust Locusta migratoria. Allometric analysis across the five juvenile stages at 35 °C reveals that jump distance (D; m) scales with body mass (M; g) according to the power equation D = 0. 35 M 0. 17 ± 0. 08 (95 % CI), jump take-off angle (A; degrees) scales as A = 52. 5 M 0. 00 ± 0. 06, and jump energy (E; mJ per jump) scales as E = 1. 91 M 1. 14 ± 0. 09. Temperature has no significant effect on the exponent of these relationships, and only a modest effect on the elevation, with an overall Q 10 of 1. 08 for jump distance and 1. 09 for jump energy. On average, adults jump 87 % farther and with 74 % more energy than predicted based on juvenile scaling data. The positive allometric scaling of jump distance and jump energy across the juvenile life stages is likely facilitated by the concomitant relative increase in the total length (Lf+t; mm) of the femur and tibia of the hind leg, Lf+t = 34. 9 M 0. 37 ± 0. 02. The <b>weak</b> temperature-dependence of <b>jump</b> performance {{can be traced to the}} maximum tension of the hind femur muscle and the energy storage capacity of the femur's cuticular springs. The disproportionately greater jump energy and jump distance of adults is associated with relatively longer (12 %) legs and a relatively larger (11 %) femur muscle cross-sectional area, which could allow more strain loading into the femur's cuticular springs. Augmented jump performance in volant adult locusts achieves the take-off velocity required to initiate flight. Edward P. Snelling, Christie L. Becker, Roger S. Seymou...|$|R
40|$|Flame bifurcations, extinction, and {{flammable}} {{regions of}} radiative counterflow premixed flames and the planar propagating flames are investigated numerically with general Lewis numbers. New insights and phenomena are presented {{by examining the}} interaction of radiation heat loss, Lewis number effect, and stretch. At a low Lewis number, {{the results show that}} for equivalence ratio lower than the standard flammability limit, radiation extinction limit and stretch extinction limit exist, respectively, at low and high stretch rates. For a higher equivalence ratio, this flame isola opens up and yields two stable flame branches, a normal flame branch, and a weak flame branch. A G-shaped curve showing the limits and flammable regions of these two flame regimes is obtained. The results show that the inferior limit of counterflow flame is lower than the standard limit. At unity Lewis number, the results show that, for equivalence ratio lower than the standard limit, there is also a flame isola with two distinct extinction limits at low and high stretch rates. For equivalence ratio larger than the standard limit, a new flame branch with flame standing far from the stagnation plane emerges on the low stretch rate side of the flame isola. This flame is related to the standard limit with the decrease of fuel concentration and merges with the flame isola when the fuel concentration is larger than a critical value. The extinction curve is also a G-shaped curve and the inferior limit is lower than the standard limit. At Lewis number larger than a critical value, for equivalence ratio near the standard limit, there is only the weakly stretched flame branch with a single stretch extinction limit. With an increase of fuel concentration, a weak flame isola emerges. As the fuel concentration further increases, this weak flame isola merges with the weakly stretched flame branch yielding three kinds of flame regimes. The resulting extinction curve is a K-shaped curve and the inferior limit is equal to the standard limit. The present results show that flame bifurcations and the existence of weak flames are physically intrinsic phenomena of radiative counterflow premixed flames. It is found that the normal flame and the <b>weak</b> flame can <b>jump</b> to each other at their limits. The obtained G and K-shaped curves show a clear relation between the counterflow flame and the planar propagating flame. The occurrence of G 2 ̆ 013 K transition with the increase of Lewis number also gives a good explanation to the physics of the experimental results. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
