5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni {{impacted}} {{the island}} nations of Tuvalu and Fiji, while it also threatened the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of <b>Wallis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Futuna.</b> The {{majority of the}} Tuvaluan islands suffered minor damage from Joni, while in Fiji the system caused a moderate to severe amount of damage. Due {{to the impact of}} this system, the name Joni was subsequently retired, from the list of names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization. This would normally mean that the name would not be used again in the region, however, the name remained on the list and was used during the 2008–09 season.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{being named}} Nancy on February13, a gale warning {{was put in}} place for American Samoa. Later that day, four {{additional}} countries were placed under watches and warnings. A gale watch was declared for Samoa and strong wind warnings were raised in Tuvalu, Tokelau and the Cook Islands. On February14, a tropical cyclone alert was declared for the southern Cook Islands. Additionally, Niue was placed under a strong wind warning. Later that day, <b>Wallis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Futuna</b> were placed under a strong wind warning. On February15, a hurricane warning was issued for the southern Cook Islands as Nancy tracked through the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|As Tam was developing, {{residents}} {{attempted to}} evacuate the island by plane, with the primary target of Fiji. Only a few flights took off before officials closed the airport, stranding numerous passengers. Late on January 11, RSMC Nadi placed Tonga and Futuna under a tropical cyclone alert and also placed Tonga and Wallis under a strong wind warning. Early the next day RSMC Nadi placed northern Tonga under a tropical cyclone gale warning. Later that morning they canceled the tropical cyclone alert for <b>Wallis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Futuna</b> as Tam was not expected to directly affect Futuna anymore. During that afternoon RSMC Nadi placed Niue under a Tropical cyclone alert, as they predicted that Niue {{would be affected by}} Tam within 24 hours. Early on January 13 RSMC Nadi cancelled the tropical cyclone warnings and alerts for Tonga, whilst at the same time placing Niue under a tropical cyclone gale warning, however this gale warning was canceled later that day as Tam moved into the southern ocean.|$|E

5|$|During November 2002, New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research {{predicted}} {{that there would}} be an eastwards shift in activity during the season, with more tropical cyclones than normal expected to the east of the date line, due to well established weak to moderate El Niño conditions. As a result, the island nations of <b>Wallis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Futuna,</b> Niue, Samoa, Tokelau, and the Southern Cook Islands were predicted to experience a higher than average number of tropical cyclones. The Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, Tonga, French Polynesia, New Zealand and the Northern Cook Islands were predicted to experience an average number of tropical cyclones, while Southern Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and New Caledonia were predicted to experience a reduced number of tropical cyclones. In January 2003, NIWA issued an updated outlook, listing the Northern Cook Islands and French Polynesia as areas predicted to experience an above average number of tropical cyclones. In contrast, Vanuatu was predicted to experience below average cyclone activity. The Solomon Islands and Tonga were now predicted to experience a reduced number of tropical cyclones, with all other countries expected to face the same risk as the November outlook.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni was a {{damaging}} {{tropical cyclone}} that impacted the island nations of Tuvalu and Fiji. It was first noted within the South Pacific Convergence Zone {{at the start}} of December 1992, as a shallow tropical depression {{in the vicinity of the}} island nation Tuvalu. Over the next few days the system gradually developed further as it affected Tuvalu, before it was declared to be a tropical cyclone and named Joni by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) during December 7. Over the next couple of days the system intensified further as it was steered south-westwards and posed a threat towards the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of <b>Wallis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Futuna.</b> The system subsequently peaked as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale as it approached the Fijian Islands during December 10. Over the next couple of days the system moved through the Fijian Islands, before it became an extratropical cyclone during December 13. The system was last noted during the next day as it was absorbed by a mid-latitude trough of low pressure to the east of New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|The CFP franc is {{currently}} {{used as a}} euro pegged currency by three French overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, <b>Wallis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Futuna</b> and New Caledonia. The French government has recommended that all three territories decide in favour of adopting the euro. French Polynesia has declared themselves in favour of joining the eurozone. <b>Wallis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Futuna</b> announced a neutral standpoint, that they would support a currency choice similar to what New Caledonia chooses. However, New Caledonia has not yet made any decision, because they first await the fallout of an independence referendum, scheduled {{to be held at}} the latest in November 2018, as this might influence their opinion whether or not to adopt the euro. If the three collectivities decide to adopt the euro, the French government would make an application on their behalf to the European Council, and the switch to the euro could be made after a couple of years. If the collectivities fail to reach a unanimous decision {{about the future of the}} CFP franc, it would be technically possible to implement an individual currency decision for each territory.|$|E
25|$|The {{currency}} {{was initially}} issued in three distinct forms for French Polynesia, New Caledonia and the New Hebrides.

40|$|<b>Wallis,</b> Alofi, <b>and</b> <b>Futuna</b> {{are three}} small {{islands in the}} central Pacific Ocean, {{characterized}} by different reef geomorphologies. Following a request from the local Environment Service, we developed an indicative conservation plan for each island with two objectives: (1) representing 20 % {{of the extent of}} each coral reef habitat within no-take areas while (2) keeping all subsistence fishing grounds open for extraction. The first objective was more ambitious than the current Convention on Biological Diversity (Aichi) targets. We found that both objectives could not be achieved simultaneously and that large compromises are needed. Due to the small size of these islands, and the dependence of local communities on coral reef resources, the fishery objective significantly limited the extent of most habitats available for conservation. The problem is exacerbated if the conservation plan uses larger conservation units and more complex habitat typologies. Our results indicate that international conservation guidelines should be carefully adapted to small Pacific islands and that incentives to make feasible the necessary reductions in available fishing grounds will probably be needed...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} trapping {{and kill}} efficiency, and by-catch rate {{of a new}} reverse-bait trigger rat trap (Ka Mate) with conventional snap traps (Ezeset and Victor), and assessed methods for calculating abundance indices, over 2879 trap nights on <b>Wallis</b> & <b>Futuna</b> <b>and</b> New Caledonia. Ka Mate traps were most effective at killing larger (> 100 g) rats whereas Ezeset traps had the best capture rates of smaller (< 100 g) rodents. Victor mouse traps caught rodents up to 50 g, but were no more efficient than rat traps. Proportions of live captures were similar for Ka Mate and Ezeset traps, but the mass threshold for live rats in Ezeset traps was much {{lower than that of}} the Ka Mate traps. Ka Mate traps had much lower non-target by-catch rates than Ezeset traps in habitats free of land crabs. We developed a new rodent abundance index to standardise results of different trap systems...|$|R
