5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> and purpose of the Act.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} peace with Sviatoslav would not endure, the Byzantine emperor induced the Pecheneg khan Kurya to kill Sviatoslav before he reached Kiev. This was in line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> {{outlined}} by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in De Administrando Imperio of fomenting strife between the Rus' and the Pechenegs. According to the Slavic chronicle, Sveneld attempted to warn Sviatoslav to avoid the Dnieper rapids, but the prince slighted his wise advice and was ambushed and slain by the Pechenegs {{when he tried to}} cross the cataracts near Khortitsa early in 972. The Primary Chronicle reports that his skull was made into a chalice by the Pecheneg khan.|$|E

The policy was subsequently changed to allow appropriate purchases of food and alcohol when entertaining out-of-town guests. Mayor Anderson used his private funds to reimburse the City for expenditures incurred while entertaining visiting mayors.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the ruling, parish schools were closed. A {{shortage}} of teachers led to the closure of a number of state schools as well, in spite of population growth. Parents began to withdraw their children from the state schools, since they were associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> of Russification; students were not allowed to speak Lithuanian among themselves, and a discouraging atmosphere was created by the system of searches, inspections, and spying. Many students were schooled at home or in small secret groups instead, although this practice also resulted in sanctions.|$|E
25|$|In time, {{as the war}} {{continued}} the growing split between German Catholics and the persecuted Polish church facing destruction worried the Vatican and the Pope himself. The annexed parts of Poland covered the dioceses located in Gniezno, Poznań, Chełmno, Katowice, Włocławek, most of Łódź and Płock as well parts of the Warsaw diocese, Łomża, Częstochowa and Kielce. The German authorities in line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> of total Germanisation aimed to completely destroy Catholic Polish church in those locations {{and replace it with}} Catholic German priests and structures. Catholic Polish priests were to be either expelled or exterminated.|$|E

25|$|Germany did {{not respond}} for three days, and {{continued}} its offensive encountering little resistance. The response arrived on 21 February, but the proposed terms were so harsh that even Lenin briefly thought that the Soviet government {{had no choice but}} to fight. But in the end, the committee again voted 7–4 on 23 February 1918; the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on 3 March and ratified on 15 March 1918. Since Trotsky was so closely associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> previously followed by the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, he resigned from his position as Commissar for Foreign Affairs in order to remove a potential obstacle to the new policy.|$|E
25|$|Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 many {{prominent}} {{writers and}} philosophers left the country, including Bunin, Vladimir Nabokov and Nikolay Berdyayev, while {{a new generation}} of talented authors joined together in an effort to create a distinctive working-class culture appropriate for the new Soviet state. In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> of socialist realism. In the late 1950s restrictions on literature were eased, and by the 1970s and 1980s, writers were increasingly ignoring official guidelines. Leading authors of the Soviet era include novelists Yevgeny Zamyatin (emigrated), Ilf and Petrov, Mikhail Bulgakov (censored) and Mikhail Sholokhov, and poets Vladimir Mayakovsky, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, and Andrey Voznesensky.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{previously}} fought wars, which had affected mostly the peripheries {{of the huge}} state, from the mid-17th century onward central Poland was being ravaged by warfare as well. The two Northern Wars turned out particularly destructive. Several massive foreign armies traversed the Commonwealth {{in the course of}} the Second Northern War. The protracted role of the country as a battlefield, the quartering of troops and armies, combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> of exacting contributions and pillage during the Great Northern War, greatly deteriorated the economy of the country which had not yet recovered from the damage incurred two generations earlier. Internal warfare and looting by unpaid Commonwealth troops added to the damage.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. and the Soviet Union {{emerged as}} rival superpowers after World War II. During the Cold War, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. confronted each other {{indirectly}} {{in the arms}} race, the Space Race, proxy wars, and propaganda campaigns. U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War was built around the support of Western Europe and Japan along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> of containment, stopping the spread of communism. The U.S. joined the wars in Korea and Vietnam {{to try to stop}} its spread. In the 1960s, in large part due to the strength of the African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–1968), another wave of social reforms were enacted by enforcing the constitutional rights of voting and freedom of movement to African-Americans and other racial minorities. The Cold War ended when the Soviet Union officially dissolved in 1991, leaving the U.S. as the world's only superpower.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{surviving}} inhabitants left Vilnius, which had an obvious impact on the city's community and its traditions; what before the war was a Polish-Jewish city with a tiny Lithuanian minority was instantly Lithuanized, with Lithuanians becoming the new majority. Many of the remaining Poles were arrested, murdered or sent to gulags or to remote parts of Soviet empire. These events, coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> of Russification and immigration of Poles, Russians, Belarussians from other Soviet republics the during post-war years, giving rise the a significant Russophone minority, and slow but steady emigration of {{the surviving}} Jews to Israel, had a critical influence on the demographic situation {{of the city in}} the 1960s. Vilnius experienced a rapid population upsurge due to inner migration of Lithuanians from the {{other parts of the country}} to the capital.|$|E
25|$|When all {{hereditary}} lines mentioned {{with the}} testament became extinct, Mikolaj Szarlejski inherited {{all the land}} holdings and properties. He {{was the son of}} Mikolaj Bydgoski, Lord castellan of Bydgoszcz and brother of Stibor of Stiboricz. Szarlejski was, {{at the time of the}} death of Stibor of Beckov, the Commander of the Polish forces in Prussia as well as Voivode of Brzesc-Kujawy. Besides this, he was also lord of several regalities and ultimately one of the most powerful and influential lords within Poland. However, Szarlejski supported the Hussites and was undertaking several hostile raids on Hungarian properties and strongholds which was not in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> of the family. Since the land of Ostoja in Slovakia was the primary defense against the Hussites, it would now be in hands of the enemy. In this situation and because Katarina did not marry her Prince of Piast, Emperor Sigismund gave orders to the Hungarian Court to cancel the testament of Stibor of Beckov. The testament was cancelled on 28 March 1435.|$|E
