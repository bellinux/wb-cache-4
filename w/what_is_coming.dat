25|$|An aquifer is a {{groundwater}} {{storage reservoir}} {{in the water}} cycle. While groundwater is a renewable source, reserves replenish relatively slowly. The USGS has performed several studies of the aquifer, to determine <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> in (groundwater recharge from the surface), what is leaving (water pumped out and baseflow to streams), and what the net changes in storage are (rise, fall or no change).|$|E
500|$|Ruby {{is often}} [...] "prepared to be confrontational and abrasive". She {{is often not}} careful in {{situations}} and is unaware of the consequences and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> up in the future. Breeds said she is [...] "idealistic and has high expectations" [...] of herself and is a [...] "very passionate" [...] person, but is flawed by her [...] "outspoken and brash" [...] nature. Breeds said that she can sympathise that she is irrational and silly because she is young.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in Sound City Studios in Los Angeles in 2010 and 2011. On 4 March 2011, the band premièred on its website a new track called [...] "Brick by Brick" [...] with lead vocals by Matt Helders. Helders explained {{that this is not}} a single, just a tease of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> and that is definitely going to be in the fourth album. On 10 March 2011 the band revealed the album is to be called Suck It and See and was released on 6 June 2011.|$|E
60|$|Gwendolen was not astonished: {{she felt}} the more assured that her {{expectations}} of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>were</b> right. Deronda went on without check.|$|R
60|$|Stumpy drew {{forth the}} envelope. I {{anticipated}} <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b>|$|R
60|$|De Brensault nodded sympathetically. He guessed {{pretty well}} <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b>|$|R
500|$|I am in Lewisburg. I am calm, certain in my thoughts, {{and doing}} {{mathematics}} {{most of the}} time. I am kind of [...] "above things," [...] fully aware of what is up. Do not {{worry too much about}} me, though anything might happen. I know, Pete, that you are strong and decent. At first I thought that you should not visit me here. I do not know. With the world in turmoil I now feel that a boy your age should experience <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> his way – fully digest it without getting a [...] "belly ache," [...] so to speak, nor getting off the right track of truth, fact, honesty, fair play, and being above board–never a sneak....|$|E
2500|$|To {{pass the}} time after the awkward incident, Penny {{suggests}} they play a free association game. Alice imagines <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> and immediately tries to quash the suggestions, but Penny shrugs her off and instructs everyone to write down [...] "the first thing that pops into their heads" [...] after she says certain words.|$|E
2500|$|The {{waveforms}} {{allow the}} DJ see <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> {{next in the}} music and how the playback of different files is aligned. The software analyzes music files to identify their tempo and where the beats are. The analyzed information {{can be used by}} the DJ to help manually beatmatch like with vinyl records or the software can automatically synchronize the beats. Digital signal processing algorithms in software allow DJs to adjust the tempo of recordings independently of their pitch (and musical key, a feature known as [...] "keylock". Some software analyzes the loudness of the music for automatic normalization with ReplayGain and detects the musical key. Additionally, DJ software can store cue points, set loops, and apply effects.|$|E
60|$|Miss Trevor {{regarded}} me wickedly, and I knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b>|$|R
60|$|Bostil knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> and {{prepared}} himself. Rapid footsteps sounded without.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it Mr Reilly?" [...] {{asked the}} girl {{somewhat}} stiffly, {{for she had}} a suspicion of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b> A little negro girl in the back kitchen named Buttercup also had a suspicion of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> and stationed herself with intense delight behind the door, {{through a crack in}} which she could both hear and see.|$|R
6000|$|... "O Grandfather," [...] exclaimed Laurence, [...] "it {{makes my}} heart throb to think <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> now. We are to see General Washington himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Elphinspoon," [...] he said, [...] "I think I know <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming.</b> Will {{you wait}} for me here? I shall be back in half an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|Above {{the knob}} {{of their own}} door they found a folded newspaper, and this Victor seized with misgiving. [...] "I wonder <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> next?" [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|The boy knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> and {{immediately}} {{stood up on}} the limb.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they both}} laughed, and Harry looked round {{wondering}} <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> next.|$|R
60|$|Arnold {{sat down}} again, and waited, in {{speechless}} suspense, to hear <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> next.|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't {{you stay}} {{a few minutes}} and talk?" [...] she urged. [...] "I'm so interested. I should like to hear you explain how {{burglary}} is collecting <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Out of {{this face}} emerge banners and horses--O superb! I see <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming,</b> [...] I see the high pioneer-caps, see staves of runners {{clearing}} the way, [...] I hear victorious drums.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does {{he think}} we sleep? Ay, {{he has got}} it himself and would open our eyes to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming!</b> What does he imagine we have been about, since the middle watch was set?" ...|$|E
60|$|Considerably relieved, but {{wondering}} <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> Herbert answered, with boyish frankness, that it was.|$|R
50|$|When Nakanari was killed, {{the general}} opinion {{was that he}} got <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> to him.|$|R
60|$|He was {{interrupted}} suddenly {{at this point}} by Rooney, who saw at once <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... (Shaking his head.) I cannot {{understand}} <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> {{over the}} present generation. Take your daughter, for instance. Ten {{years ago she}} was an earnest, sincere lieutenant of mine in all our little charities.|$|E
6000|$|And so, by {{remembering what}} God HAS been to them, they can face <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming.</b> 'They {{will not be}} afraid of evil tidings,' as David says; 'for their heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Harper’s {{face grew}} {{suddenly}} grim. “Well,” {{he said a}} trifle hoarsely, “I guess we can face <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> {{as well as a}} Spaniard can, and—I’ve got to admit it—nobody could expect any more from any man.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{nodded and}} turned cold {{all over my}} body, for I could guess <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b>|$|R
60|$|I bowed. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> I {{could not}} indeed imagine, unless Ray {{had already made}} the disclosure.|$|R
60|$|Arthur wrung my hand. He was {{apparently}} much relieved, {{and he did}} not know <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Here {{is where}} Dave Porter and his crowd get <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> to them," [...] thought the money-lender's son. It pleased him greatly to think his school might be beaten. Which shows how really mean-spirited Nat was.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sometimes {{experience}} {{seems to}} show that in good Providence a merciful preparation is sent {{not so much to}} lead to anticipations, as to bring the mind into keeping with <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming,</b> and, as it were, attune it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll appear {{all right}} enough!" [...] cried Tom. [...] "Why, Mr. Sheriff, you couldn't beat us {{away with a}} club! We intend {{to see to it}} that every one of those rascals gets <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> to him!" ...|$|E
