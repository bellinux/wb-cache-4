5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, there is a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{ghost of}} Zero (Normand Fauteux) materializes {{at a local}} gay bathhouse. No one can see or hear him, until Zero runs into Burton while Burton is spying on Zero's friend George.

The two strike a deal; Zero agrees to help Burton with his Patient Zero exhibit if Burton finds a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Zero appear.|$|E

5|$|When casting for {{the role}} of Dorothy, Warner Bros. {{declined}} to audition any actresses younger than the age of 30; Jennifer O'Neill's agent, who had developed a fondness for the script, convinced the studio to audition his client, who was only 22 at the time. O'Neill auditioned {{for the role}}, albeit hesitantly, not wanting to perform any nude scenes. O'Neill got the role and Mulligan agreed to find a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the film work without blatant nudity.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar the wrong <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it 5–5. Giggs was next {{up and he}} was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that he thought he would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E
5|$|Rowling {{was left}} in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter. She {{obtained}} an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994. She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University, after completing her first novel while living on state benefits. She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by her brother-in-law), and the Elephant House, wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep. In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in cafés was that taking her baby {{out for a walk}} was the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her fall asleep.|$|E

5|$|Samar {{notices that}} Meera often prays at church. After {{a night of}} wild street dancing, they begin to fall in love. Samar helps Meera face her past, taking her to visit her estranged mother and foster reconciliation. Meera decides to confess to her father about Samar and break her engagement, but when Samar has a {{motorbike}} accident, Meera, believing she {{is the cause of}} his bad luck, prays to God to save his life, swearing never to see him again. Samar recovers and Meera reveals the vow she made. Angry, he leaves her and London altogether, challenging God to keep him alive as he risks his life every day. He believes his death is the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Meera lose her faith in God. He goes to India and enlists in the army, becoming a bomb-disposal expert.|$|E
5|$|The family {{goes to a}} magic-themed restaurant. While there, Marge gets {{drunk on}} Long Island Iced Teas and Bart becomes so fascinated with magic that he buys a magician's kit from the gift shop. On the way home, a {{sturgeon}} falls from the sky (implicitly from the space station Mir) onto the family car's hood, which is severely damaged. Homer and Bart start their magic show as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money, but the act becomes a failure, and Homer leaves Bart to {{do the rest of}} the act on his own. Bart is left out on the street, and people begin giving him money so he can get home on public transportation.|$|E
5|$|The remake takes {{advantage}} of the Wi-Fi feature of the Nintendo DS {{in the form of a}} Mail/Mognet system similar to Final Fantasy IX. Various moogles in the game allow the player to send email to others. Players are also able to send mail to various characters in the game as well as to other players. Side quests can also be unlocked using this system, such as the quest to unlock the Onion Knight. An interruption-save option is also available that lets the player turn off the DS and continue when turning it back on. Like in the original, there is no <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> permanent saves while inside a dungeon.|$|E

5|$|Uematsu {{was born}} in Kōchi, Kōchi Prefecture, Japan. A self-taught musician, he began {{to play the piano}} when he was between the ages of eleven and twelve years old, and he did not take any formal piano lessons. He has an older sister who also played the piano. After graduating from Kanagawa University with a degree in English, Uematsu played the {{keyboard}} in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials. When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a Square employee asked if he would be interested in creating music for some of the titles they were working on. Although he agreed, Uematsu at the time considered it a side job, and he did not think it would become a full-time career. He said it was a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some money on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop.|$|E
5|$|Earp was {{a lifelong}} gambler {{and was always}} looking for a quick <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money. After leaving Tombstone, Earp went to San Francisco, where he reunited with Josephine Earp. She became his common-law wife. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining {{interests}} and a saloon. They left there to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego, California. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons–Sharkey boxing match and called a foul that led many to believe that he fixed the fight. They moved briefly to Yuma, Arizona, before joining the Nome Gold Rush in 1899. In partnership with Charlie Hoxie, they opened a two-story saloon called the Dexter and made an estimated $80,000 (about $2 million in 2017 dollars). Returning to the lower 48, they opened another saloon in Tonopah, Nevada, the site of a new gold find. Around 1911, Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal, California, retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles. Earp made friends among early Western actors in Hollywood and tried to get his story told. He was portrayed in film only once before he died, and very briefly, in the 1923 film Wild Bill Hickok.|$|E
5|$|Kyle, Cartman and Kenny {{surprise}} Stan {{by creating}} a Facebook account for him. Stan protests, but is quickly pressured by family and friends to add them as friends. To his annoyance and frustration, Stan finds people such as Randy, his grandmother and even Wendy confronting him over his supposed disregard for them and judging his real-world friendship solely by his Facebook configuration. Meanwhile, Kyle adds shy nerdy student Kip Drordy (anagram: Dorky Drip) to his thriving friends list out of pity. Kyle's number of Facebook friends rapidly declines when he does this, {{in part due to}} a Mad Friends podcast he finds Cartman has set up in which he berates Kyle for choosing a loser as a friend and asserts nobody will want to hang out with Kyle. Kyle understands this, but, on principle and out of pity, cannot bring himself to delete Kip to please others. Desperate to stem the loss of friends, he asks Cartman for advice. Cartman introduces Kyle to Chatroulette as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> new friends, which fails as most {{of the people on the}} site are either jacking off or showing their genitals, until Cartman finally finds another Jewish kid named Isiah, who agrees to be Kyle's friend, much to Kyle's delight.|$|E

5|$|Over {{much of her}} childhood, Michelena’s parents toured {{with the}} Emma Abbott Grand Opera Company a {{traveling}} theatre company that performed famous operas translated to English for American audiences. Beatriz's father in later life taught music {{and worked as a}} vocal coach and, {{at the time of his}} death, was serving as president of Arrillaga Musical College, San Francisco. Beatriz and her sister Vera were trained by their father in classical voice and drama studies, and they followed in his footsteps by beginning singing careers of their own. Vera first appeared onstage in the Princess Chic Opera company (1901) at 17, taking a leading role in The Man from China (1904). Beatriz, too, performed with Princess Chic in 1901, taking chorus roles suitable for a child of 11. By mid-1904, with Vera busy pursuing her career in New York, Fernando Michelena settled in San Francisco, California to teach voice. There, he raised Beatriz and continued to train her, a soprano, in operatic vocal techniques. He passed his stage experience to his daughter: the way to move as another person, the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> simple but authoritative gestures, and the way to build intensity over the span of a performance. Maria Antonia Field, a Californian writer, would later chronicle her time as a student of Michelena’s father in her book, Five Years of Vocal Study under Fernando Michelena.|$|E
5|$|Stroma's {{population}} fell precipitously {{through the}} first half of the 20th century, leading eventually to the island's final abandonment at the end of the 1950s. There was no single cause that precipitated the collapse of Stroma's population. Living conditions on the island were always basic; there was no running water or electricity, and gas only arrived in the 1950s, which contrasted poorly with the improvements being made on the mainland. The fishing deteriorated after the First World War, and crofting became an increasingly difficult <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a living. The island was relatively overpopulated; by 1901 the population was nearly twice that of sixty years previously, and there was little spare land left for farming. Families of six to eight children were common, but there was simply not enough work for all, so the eldest often left for the mainland or emigrated to Canada or the United States to find work. The lack of a proper harbour meant that the islanders could not make use of larger boats or develop a modern fishery. Young people started moving away to seek better-paying opportunities elsewhere, eventually followed by their parents.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean side. On the east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took two to three hours to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from three to four hours to get on top of Battle Mountain from the valley floor. The turnaround time for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours to go up Battle Mountain and come back down. In some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E
