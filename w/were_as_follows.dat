5|$|The primary {{reasons for}} the Second Settlement <b>were</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, {{he was no longer}} in an {{official}} position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a proconsul. When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary. When he relinquished his annual consulship, he legally lost this power because his proconsular powers applied only to his imperial provinces. Augustus wanted to keep this power.|$|E
