At the time Bennett maintained that this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> term switch, but due to the Broncos' poor form, Hunt returned to fullback for Round 3.

5|$|On August 10, 2012, U.S. Figure Skating {{announced}} that an agreement {{had been reached}} and Lysacek would return to competition at the 2012 Skate America. He withdrew after aggravating a groin injury. On November 20, 2012, Lysacek underwent surgery to repair a torn muscle in his lower abdomen, i.e. a sports hernia, with an expected period of six weeks off the ice. In January 2013, he withdrew from the 2013 U.S. Championships, saying he was healthy but needed an additional three weeks to return to competition form.

5|$|The first {{operations}} in 1940 concerned Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of Britain by the Wehrmacht. The unit was to receive 30 PR Supermarine Spitfire aircraft, specialised and adapted for reconnaissance use. They would {{be capable of}} 1,750 miles round trips. However, just 13 aircraft were available to the unit, and their range limited to 1,300 miles. Eventually, an assortment of Vickers Wellington and Spitfire flights were established. In August 1940, the first PR Spitfires arrived, but teething problems ensured that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time before standardisation was achieved with equipment. In August, Coastal Command flew 193 sorties over the suspected invasion ports in the Netherlands, Belgium and France.|$|E
25|$|The first calls, routine reports {{stating the}} weather as cloudy and overcast, were {{received}} at 2:45 {{and just before}} 5am on July 2. These calls were broken up by static, {{but at this point}} the aircraft <b>would</b> still <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> distance from Howland.|$|R

5|$|After the battle, Spee {{took his}} ships north to Valparaiso. Since Chile was neutral, only three ships could enter the port at a time; Spee took Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, and Nürnberg in {{first on the}} morning of 3 November, leaving Dresden and Leipzig with the colliers at Mas a Fuera. There, Spee's ships could take on coal while he conferred with the Admiralty Staff in Germany to {{determine}} the strength of remaining British forces in the region. The ships remained in the port for only 24 hours, in accordance with the neutrality restrictions, and arrived at Mas a Fuera on 6 November, where they took on more coal from captured British and French steamers. On 10 November, Dresden and Leipzig were detached for a stop in Valparaiso, and five days later, Spee took the rest of the squadron south to St. Quentin Bay in the Gulf of Penas. On 18 November, Dresden and Leipzig met Spee while en route and the squadron reached St. Quentin Bay three days later. There, they took on more coal, since the voyage around Cape Horn <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> one and it was unclear when they would have another opportunity to coal.|$|E

25|$|Barrett had a {{tremendous}} impact on the developing field of social work and on services for women and children. Under her leadership, the NFCM became an established social service organization that provided a wide spectrum of services to women. The mission initiated activities that many now consider essential services for women and children. Florence Crittenton homes pioneered women-oriented policies in the areas of health care, employment for women, and children's rights. The organization campaigned for equality for women and for recognition of women's needs... Despite differences in class and race with most of their clients, FC volunteers tried to emphasize gender identity....

He made only one century, scored for South v North at Leicester in 1836. As a bowler he was fast with a round arm action. With his arm never getting above shoulder height he was obliged to bowl around the wicket. William Caffyn described the field Mynn would bowl to. The wicket keeper would be stood up, as was the custom. There <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> stop on the boundary behind him. There would two slips, one close in and one a fly slip. Point was slightly forward and cover point almost behind him. There would be a short leg and a long leg.

25|$|Manstein took no more {{part in the}} {{planning}} and returned to east Germany. Halder had to revise the plan again, which became Aufmarschanweisung N°4, Fall Gelb. The new plan conformed to Manstein's thinking in that Army Group A would provide {{the main thrust of}} the invasion through the Ardennes in southern Belgium. After crossing the Meuse River between Namur and Sedan, Army Group A would turn north-west towards Amiens, while Army Group B executed a feint attack in the north to lure the Allied armies forward into Belgium and pin them down. The revision was a substantial change in emphasis, in which Halder no longer envisaged a simultaneous secondary attack to the west but made it the main effort (Schwerpunkt). The dash for Abbeville was removed, river crossings were to be forced by infantry and there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> consolidation phase, while a large number of infantry divisions crossed into the bridgeheads. The armoured divisions should then advance together with the infantry divisions, not in an independent operational penetration. Halder rejected the idea of a simultaneous attack to the south to occupy the area that the French would want to use to deploy for a counter-offensive, to defeat the attempt before it began.|$|E
500|$|One of the prosecuting {{team at the}} Guildhall {{observed}} that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time before anyone risked another prosecution against Bottomley: [...] "But he might... grow careless, and then he will fail". [...] Despite the adverse publicity, Bottomley was returned by the electors of Hackney South {{at each of the}} two 1910 general elections; his tactics included recruiting men in boots tipped and heeled with iron, who marched outside his opponent's meetings and rendered the speeches inaudible. In June 1910 he founded the John Bull League, with a mission to promote [...] "commonsense business methods" [...] into government; readers of the magazine could join the League for a shilling (5p) a year. Although still nominally a Liberal, Bottomley had become a trenchant critic of his party, and often aligned himself with the Conservative opposition in attacking Asquith's government.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, after Andhrawala 's [...] {{commercial}} failure, {{its director}} Puri Jagannadh planned a film titled Sri Krishnudu from Surabhi Company starring Chiranjeevi {{in the lead}} role. He later decided that explaining the story to Chiranjeevi, talking him into accepting the role, and filming the movie, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> tiring process. He chose instead to revive the script of Uttam Singh S/O Suryanarayana which he had written during the production of Badri (2000). He approached Pawan Kalyan to play the lead role, but he declined it. Later, he approached Ravi Teja who agreed to play the lead; Nagendra Babu was to produce the film. However, Teja was approached by Cheran, an award winning director, to remake the 2004 Tamil film Autograph in Telugu. Teja was eager {{to be involved in}} the remake as he liked the original very much. As a result, the production Uttam Singh S/O Suryanarayana was temporarily shelved. Jagannadh meanwhile directed and produced 143 (2004). Teja had backed out of participating in it citing scheduling conflicts with other existing commitments. Jagannadh wanted to experiment by casting Sonu Sood in the lead role but this too failed to materialise.|$|E

500|$|Nelson joined Jervis's fleet off Cape St Vincent, and {{reported}} the Spanish movements. Jervis {{decided to give}} battle and the two fleets met on 14 February. Nelson found himself towards {{the rear of the}} British line and realised that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time before he could bring Captain into action. Instead of continuing to follow the line, Nelson disobeyed orders and wore ship, breaking from the line and heading to engage the Spanish van, which consisted of the 112-gun San Josef, the 80-gun San Nicolas and the 130-gun Santísima Trinidad. Captain engaged all three, assisted by [...] which had come to Nelson's aid. After an hour of exchanging broadsides which left both Captain and Culloden badly damaged, Nelson found himself alongside San Nicolas. He led a boarding party across, crying [...] "Westminster Abbey or glorious victory!" [...] and forced her to surrender. San Josef attempted to come to the San Nicolas’s aid, but became entangled with her compatriot and was left immobile. Nelson led his party from the deck of San Nicolas onto San Josef and captured her as well. As night fell, the Spanish fleet broke off and sailed for Cadiz. Four ships had surrendered to the British and two of them were Nelson's.|$|E
500|$|Zahorchak was {{a steady}} {{supporter}} of Rendell's education proposals. However, he maintained {{that he could}} still be an independent voice within the administration, and claimed, [...] "I happen {{to agree with the}} outcomes because I'm in the mix of making determinations of our policy decisions." [...] In addition to Act 72, Zahorchak supported a Rendell proposal to require superintendents and principals in struggling school districts to improve math and reading test scores in order to keep their jobs, an idea that was not embraced by the Pennsylvania Legislature. In 2006, Zahorchak said he supported requiring high-school students to pass exit exams before they could graduate, although he acknowledged implementing such a testing program <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and difficult effort. At the time, the state required students to demonstrate proficiency in math and reading before they could graduate, but allowed local districts to decide whether that should entail passing the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment math and reading tests or alternative tests in the subjects. Zahorchak said, [...] "I think it's a real disservice to graduate a student who's fundamentally not at the standard level." [...] However, Zahorchak also said students should be given alternative ways to demonstrate they are ready for college or the work force besides exams.|$|E
500|$|... "Give Peace a Chance" [...] {{opens with}} Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital's chief of surgery, Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) {{implementing}} a new computerized surgical scheduling system, which is disliked {{by many of}} the hospital's staff. Thereafter, Isaac (Faran Tahir), a hospital lab technician, brings Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) a scan of his tumor, which has been declared inoperable by several other physicians due to its complexity. Isaac asks Shepherd to remove it. Shepherd agrees, but Webber refuses permission for the procedure because of the high risk involved. Shepherd ignores the chief's directions and schedules the surgery. The interns and residents all want the chance to assist due to the rarity of such a tumor, so Shepherd hosts a competition in which the winner gets to join him in the operating room. After seeing Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul) make a mistake, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) is confident that she will win the competition, but loses to Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams). Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is not invited to compete because Shepherd wants her to be his caregiver in what <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> surgery. Knowing that she {{will not be able to}} use the bathroom for the entire procedure, Lexie decides to wear a diaper into the operating room; her courage and dedication impresses Yang.|$|E

Another loss to Re would follow, but D'Agata was able to build a 19-3-2 record with 4 knockouts before challenging for the Italian Bantamweight title. On 27 September 1953, he beat Gianni Zuddas by a disqualification in round nine to earn that belt. After five more wins, he travelled to Tunisia, where he met the future world champion Robert Cohen, losing a ten-round decision.

25|$|No cricket {{had been}} {{reported}} in the infant newspaper industry before 1697 due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which controlled the press until 1696, but reports were beginning to increase by the mid-1720s, though it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very <b>long</b> time indeed before coverage became anything like comprehensive. Early reports tended to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> advertisement for a scheduled match or else a brief discussion of the gambling odds rather than the actual play and it was not until 1726 that players were first mentioned by name in a newspaper report. Match reports were much more common in the 1730s and were beginning to present increased detail, sometimes including the names of patrons and players.

500|$|The episode, {{which was}} {{originally}} titled [...] "Fat Man and Little Boy" [...] (which {{went on to}} be used for the name of a Season 16 episode), was directed by Jim Reardon and written by Donick Cary and Dan Greaney.

Staff writers Cary and Greaney wrote the draft in a couple of days, and it was then rewritten [...] "extensively" [...] with The Simpsons writing staff. Originally, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> scene about how Homer had bought a [...] "pre-Columbian vase" [...] on the Internet, however the scene was ultimately cut from the episode. The episode's title is a reference to the 1944 war film 30 Seconds Over Tokyo. Originally, the staff wanted the title to be [...] "Twenty-two Minutes Over Tokyo", since an episode of The Simpsons is approximately twenty-two minutes long, but they eventually changed it to its current rendition because it “sounds closer to” the title of the film it references. According to Cary, the writers did a lot of research in order to accurately depict the Japanese language for the episode. For example, the three categories in The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show are written in Japanese.|$|E

50|$|Especially {{after the}} Glorious Revolution, {{authorities}} became less sympathetic to workers concerns about {{losing their jobs}} due to innovation. An increasingly influential strand of Mercantalist thought held that introducing labour saving technology would actually reduce unemployment, as it would allow British firms to increase their market share against foreign competition. From the early 18th century workers could no longer rely on support from the authorities against the perceived threat of technological unemployment. They would sometimes take direct action, such as machine breaking, in attempts {{to protect themselves from}} disruptive innovation. Schumpeter notes that as the 18th century progressed, thinkers would raise the alarm about technological unemployment with increasing frequency, with von Justi being a prominent example.
