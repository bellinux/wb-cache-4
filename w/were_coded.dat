5|$|In July 1942 the U-boats {{became aware}} of Coastal Command {{aircraft}} using another innovation – sonobuoys, which were {{thought of as the}} air equivalent of the Navy's ASDIC. A U-boat reported them on 29 July being dropped in the north transit area, and they were thought by the enemy to be devices for preventing U-boats from travelling on the surface. They were, in fact, for detecting submerged U-boats, and were used by No. 210 Squadron RAF, operating Sunderlands. In operational records they <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> High Tea. Most crews were unaware of their existence. The devices stayed in use until 1998, when some wartime crews saw them for the first time. Until then the RAF had kept them secret.|$|E
5|$|As Thompson began porting {{the game}} to the new system, {{he decided not to}} base the code on any of the {{existing}} software for the computer, and instead write his own. As a result, he implemented his own base code libraries for programs to use, including arithmetic packages and graphics subsystems. These initial subsystems <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> in assembly language on the GECOS system and assembled, then the output physically put on punched tapes to be carried over and inserted into the PDP-7. Thompson then wrote an assembler for the PDP-7 to avoid this laborious process. The game ran very slowly on the new machine, causing Thompson to branch out from there to design his own file system based on some ideas by Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday, rooted in their experience with the Multics file system, with which he then ran Space Travel.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the characters and vehicles in the game were built and textured by Nicola Daly and animated by Jeremy Pardon. The main game systems and game code as a whole <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> by John Hodskinson. The game's music is composed by Andy Blythe and Marten Joustra of Swallow Studios. A rearranged version of the original Crash Bandicoot theme by Mutato Muzika's Josh Mancell also appears in the game. The game's sound effects were created by Ron Horwitz, Tom Jaeger, John Robinson, and Harry Woolway of Universal Sound Studios. The game's voice actors were cast and directed by Margaret Tang. Clancy Brown voices the dual role of Doctor Neo Cortex and Uka Uka, while Mel Winkler provides the voice of Aku Aku. Crash and Coco Bandicoot are respectively voiced by Brendan O'Brien and Debi Derryberry. Corey Burton voices the returning villains Doctor N. Gin and Doctor Nefarious Tropy. Kevin Michael Richardson provides the voice of new character Crunch Bandicoot, while the Elementals, consisting of Rok-Ko, Wa-Wa, Py-Ro and Lo-Lo, are voiced by Thomas F. Wilson, R. Lee Ermey, Mark Hamill, and Jess Harnell respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{block is}} the result of Han unification, which was {{somewhat}} controversial in the Far East. Since Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> in the same location, the appearance of a selected glyph could depend on the particular font being used.

30|$|In Fig. 7, {{there are}} four flows. According to EMCC, flow 1 and flow 3 can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> at node 6, while flow 2 and flow 4 can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> at node 9. Besides, flow 1 intersects with flow 2 at node 12. And there are UI(12,flow 1) = { 7 }, UI(12,flow 2) = { 8 }, 11 ∈N(5), 13 ∈N(10). That {{is to say that}} {{condition}} (1) and (2) are not satisfied. According to EMCC, flow 1 and flow 2 cannot <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> at node 12. Nevertheless, flow 1 and flow 2 can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> at node 12 actually, since node 11 and node 13 can get native packet successfully through decoding. Therefore, two flows satisfied with (1) and (2) of EMCC can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> together. But two flows which can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> together at intersecting node might not satisfy the (1) and (2) of EMCC. In other words, if two flows can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> together, it <b>is</b> not necessary that (1) and (2) of EMCC hold, which is sufficient not necessary.|$|R

25|$|The {{results for}} 2001 <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> using the Australian Standard Classification of Cultural and Ethnic Groups (ASCCEG). This {{classification}} {{of cultural and}} ethnic groups {{is based on the}} geographic area in which a group originated or developed; and the similarity of cultural and ethnic groups in terms of social and cultural characteristics. The classification is specific to Australian needs and was developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The classification is based on the self-perceived group identification approach, using a self assessed response to a direct question. This approach measures the extent to which individuals associate with particular cultural or ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|The export range, from 1948 {{were the}} OPS2, OPS3 and OPS4. They also {{featured}} the O600 engine and synchromesh gearbox as introduced, but air brakes were optional. The OPS2 shared the PS2's 17ft 6in wheelbase, although the frames, springs and axles were heavier duty than their home market equivalents, bodies {{could be as}} long as 29ft 3in where laws permitted, the OPS3 was introduced {{at the same time}} as the OPS2 but had a 19ft wheelbase for bodies up to 31ft long. This variant would not have met UK turning circle requirements when the new 30ft length was legalised in 1950. Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), the Irish state transport undertaking uniquely took Tigers of both PS2/13 and OPS3 type, these become the last vehicles of over 300 to be numbered in the P series that had started with Dublin United Transport's first Tiger in 1935. Walter Alexander took some OPS2 coaches as well as PS2s but these are believed to have been a frustrated export order. The OPS4, had a 21ft 6in wheelbase for a bodied length of 35ft, Duple produced a batch of fifteen LOPS4/3 with Park Royal metal frames in 1949 for coach operators in Buenos Aires and a single coach to the same outline for Gibraltar motorways. Production of the 'overseas' Tiger concentrated in the 1950s on the OPS4/5 variant with exposed radiator, O680 engine, air brakes and Pneumocyclic gearbox as standard, the final (post 1967) versions <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> OPS4A/15 following updates in the Titan range and a rationalisation of nomenclature and components. The last Tiger OPS4s were delivered to South African fleets in 1970, some of these were still working at the turn of the century.|$|E

The last level of the game is modeled from the French National Museum of Natural History. Chung explained that when developing levels, he first spends time researching and [...] "learning how things work."

500|$|Former flight {{instructor}} Peter James, {{who had worked}} on Flight Unlimited II, {{assumed the role of}} lead designer. He was largely responsible for Flight Unlimited IIIs lessons, planes and simulated flight instruments. James believed that other flight simulators had holes with regard to realism, and he hoped to create a more accurate experience. Photographs were captured of each plane's real-world counterpart, and construction of the 3D plane models was led by artist Duncan Hsu, a former car modeler at Papyrus Design Group. The flight physics <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> by Kevin Wasserman and involve real-time calculations of force vectors, such as those acting against a plane's yaw, pitch and roll. This system was more advanced than that of Flight Unlimited II, which was also based on force calculations. The physics code was informed by [...] "real aircraft data" [...] and the personal experience of pilots, and each of the planes was flown as research for the game. Because the plane cockpits of previous Flight Unlimited games had been criticized by pilots, the team tried to make Flight Unlimited IIIs cockpits extremely authentic. Kemal Amarasingham recorded the planes' sound effects, which he said involved [...] "risking his life" [...] by standing near jet engines and under wings.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept for}} a movie based on the Bionicle toyline was {{proposed}} as early as 2001, when Bionicle became an unexpected commercial success for Lego: this idea was originally inspired {{by the fact that}} Lego advertised Bionicle {{as if it were a}} movie, and they had received inquiry emails and licensing requests from multiple film studios. Deciding to make the movie while retaining full creative control, Lego began discussing with potential partners, knowing that the film needed to come out while Bionicle was still looming large in the public consciousness. Lego's eventual partner was production entity Create TV & Film. With the initial partnership set up, Lego created some development assets and went round various animation studios to find one that would develop the film. They narrowed it down to two studios, one of which was Creative Capers Entertainment. Creative Capers convinced Lego to employ them after producing a well-received short animated segment featuring Lewa. Creative Caper's three principles, directors Terry Shakespeare and David Molina, and producer Sue Shakespear, all took up their respective roles for the film's production. The deal was reportedly worth $5million. In a later interview, Shakespeare referred to the film's aesthetic as [...] "primary colors that <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> to the areas", saying it had a [...] "younger feel" [...] when compared to its prequel. He also referred to the film as [...] "very intimate, very organic".|$|E
