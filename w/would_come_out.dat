5|$|On October 2011, it was {{announced}} that PlayStation Move support would cover the whole game as part of an update which <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> sometime after Infamous: Festival of Blood was released, along with a new cutscene creation tool for the UGC creator. The update was released on November 2, 2011.|$|E
5|$|DeGeneres began {{negotiating}} with ABC in 1996 to have Morgan come out. When {{word of the}} negotiations got out, DeGeneres found herself {{at the center of}} intense speculation about when she or her character, or both, <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out.</b> With DeGeneres hinting at her and her character's coming out both off-screen and within the show, the rumors were confirmed when the episode went into production in March 1997.|$|E
5|$|Both coaches {{told the}} media that they {{believed}} their respective teams should play far better {{than they did in}} the National semifinal games if they wanted to win the upcoming game. Coach Smith expressed concerns over Georgetown's shooting ability and feared that Floyd <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> shooting very well from the field. In addition, Smith noted that Ewing would play a large factor in the game because his defensive presence in the game limits second chance opportunities for Georgetown's opponents. Ken Rappoport of the Associated Press wrote of how North Carolina was a very disciplined team that takes only high-percentage shots.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Nakayama {{commissioned}} the famed architect Yoshikazu Uchida {{to draw up}} a blueprint for the area. Uchida arranged ten buildings around Oyasama's Residence. A 50-meter boulevard <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the Residence on a north-south axis, along which six school buildings would be lined up. Classrooms and large auditoriums would be built {{at the end of this}} boulevard. The international school and library were to be eventually integrated into this plan. In January 1937, a middle school (now Tenri High School) was built according to Uchida's plan, but as Japan mobilized for the Pacific War the plan had to be temporarily shelved.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year on 10 December 624, with Abu Sufyan at the helm, the Meccans—anxious to avenge their defeat at Badr—raised another force numbering 3,000 {{and set out}} for the Muslim base in Medina. Rather than attacking Medina itself, which was populated by numerous strongholds that would have required long sieges to overcome, they camped on the pastures north of the city, hoping that the Muslims <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> to meet them. According to the early Muslim historian Ibn Ishaq, a number of Meccan women are said to have accompanied Abu Sufyan's army to provide vocal support, including Hind bint Utbah, his wife.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{was being}} {{pressured}} to leave French soil by the interim French government in Paris. If he delayed, he risked becoming {{a prisoner of}} the Bourbons, Prussians or Austrians. The alternative was to surrender to the British and request political asylum. On 10 July Napoleon sent two emissaries, General Anne Jean Marie René Savary and the Comte de Las Cases, out to Bellerophon to meet Maitland and discuss the possibility of allowing Napoleon {{to travel to the}} United States. Maitland was under orders to prevent this, and instead offered to take Napoleon on board his ship and transport him and his retinue to Britain. Further discussions and negotiations took place over the next few days, but with his options running out, Napoleon had decided by 13 July to surrender to the British. On 14 July Maitland was given a letter informing him that Napoleon <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> to Bellerophon the following morning to surrender.|$|E

5|$|Vissi's music rival Despina Vandi {{also became}} less prominent. While the {{supposed}} rivalry {{between the two}} was once a grand topic in the media, with speculation as to who <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> on top, the possible overexposure {{of the story and}} their subsequent absences allowed fellow laïko-pop singer Elena Paparizou, fresh off of the momentum of her 2005 Eurovision win, to ultimately overshadow the two {{during the second half of}} the decade. While reviewing Apagorevmeno, Haris Simvoulidis of Avopolis felt that Vissi appeared to be attempting to catch up to her contemporaries, Paparizou and Peggy Zina. Vissi continued to make music and soon managed to fly back to the top as her follow-up album Apagorevmeno becaume the biggest selling album by a female artist for 2009 and her shows continue to be sold out even today. She was also placed 15th in Forbes list of the most powerful and influential Greece celebrities in 2010. Her time on hiatus in the late 2000s was filmed and used for a reality show called Oso Eho Foni in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The treaty {{called for}} {{meetings}} between the involved parties {{to work out}} the exact territorial and remunerative details. Convened at a small town in the mid-Rhineland, Rastatt, the Congress quickly derailed in a mire of intrigue and diplomatic posturing. The French demanded more territory. The Austrians were reluctant to cede the designated territories. Compounding the Congress's problems, tensions grew between France and most of the First Coalition allies. Ferdinand of Naples refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the Parthenopaean Republic. Encouraged by the French Republic, a republican uprising in the Swiss cantons led to the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation and the establishment of the Helvetic Republic. The French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were planning to start another war. Indeed, the weaker France seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the English discussed this possibility. In mid-spring, the Austrians reached an agreement with Tsar Paul of Russia by which the legendary Alexander Suvorov <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of retirement to assist Austria in Italy with another 60,000 troops.|$|E
25|$|Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel {{said that}} there never were greater days of joy in Israel than the 15th of Av and Yom Kippur.

25|$|A {{possible}} {{benefit of}} sexual coercion that <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> {{in the long}} run is the “good genes” hypothesis. If males can overcome a female’s resistance, then they must possess good genes that would increase the survival, mating success, and ultimately the fitness of her offspring. The hypothesis is that females can use the sexual coercion process to assess the quality of a male.|$|E
25|$|Lotf Ali Khan let the {{reinforcements}} {{arrive to}} Shiraz, expecting {{that as soon}} as the forces of Hajji Ebrahim was strengthened, they <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of Shiraz, and could be overhelmed in open battle. He was correct in his prediction—a battle shortly took place to the west of Shiraz, where Lotf Ali Khan defeated the united forces of Hajji Ebrahim and his Qajar reinforcements. This took place in late 1791, or early 1792.|$|E
25|$|In August 2009, Romário {{announced}} that he <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of retirement to play for America from Rio de Janeiro. He stated that he would play for the club to fulfill his father's wishes. On 25 November 2009, Romário made his comeback. He came on during the 68th minute of the match between America and Artsul, replacing Adriano. Although he didn't score, America won 2–0, which helped the club to win {{the title of the}} Second Division of the Carioca Championship.|$|E

25|$|In his playoff debut, Chris Paul scored 35 points, dished out 10 assists, {{and stole}} the ball 4 times {{to lead the}} Hornets to a {{comeback}} home win against the Mavericks. He would replicate that type of performance in Game 2 with 32 points and 17 assists. Dallas <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> with a dominant Game 3 performance at home after inserting Jason Terry into the starting lineup, but New Orleans would win the final 2 games of the series, keyed by David West in Game 4 and Paul's triple-double in Game 5.|$|E
25|$|Johnson's {{streetcar}} {{fights with}} Hanna {{and his allies}} make a colorful part of Cleveland political folklore. In a time when companies with a monopoly of transport on a route were able to charge five cents for a ride, he made the 'three-cent fare' a cornerstone of his populist philosophy, and later he <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> in favor of complete public ownership. Through the 1890s Johnson gradually divested himself of most of his transit and steel holdings, to devote himself entirely {{to the politics of}} reform. In 1901, pressed on by influential citizens and a public petition, he decided to run for mayor of Cleveland.|$|E
25|$|His {{impressions}} of the Mormons came when Utah was seen by many of his readers back home as rebellious and dangerous as those states in the Confederacy, with which the Union was then involved in the American Civil War. Ludlow encountered frequent snide comments about {{the disintegration of the}} Union, with some Mormons under the impression that with the flood of immigrants to Utah fleeing the draft, and with the decimation of the male population in war time making polygamy seem more practical, the Mormon state <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the war stronger than either side. Ludlow’s opinions were read with interest back East, and would constitute an appendix to the book he would later write about his travels.|$|E

25|$|I was {{initiated}} into a college secret society—a {{couple of hours}} of grotesque and good-humored rodomontade and horseplay, in which I cooperated as {{in a kind of}} pleasant nightmare, confident, even when branded with a red-hot iron or doused head-over heels in boiling oil, that it <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> all right. The neophyte is effectively blindfolded during the proceedings, and at last, still sightless, I was led down flights of steps into a silent crypt, and helped into a coffin, where I was to stay until the Resurrection...Thus it was that just as my father passed from this earth, I was lying in a coffin during my initiation into Delta Kappa Epsilon.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week the Gold Coast recorded their first ever victory during a 134-point annihilation of the Western Jets. The team {{went on to}} record 10 wins in their following 15 matches. The results would see the Gold Coast finish fifth on the ladder and earn them {{a spot in the}} finals. A top of the table clash in the last round saw GCFC blow a crucial double chance for the finals with a loss to the Geelong Falcons. GCFC <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> victorious in their elimination final against the Northern Knights. The dream season came to an end the {{following week}} in the semi finals against the Geelong Falcons. Captain Marc Lock was awarded the club's inaugural best and fairest medal {{at the conclusion of the}} season.|$|E
25|$|The group's {{first tour}} ensued to promote The Tunes of Two Cities, hosted by Penn Jillette. The {{performance}} featured the Residents performing behind a burlap screen, occasionally wearing disguises (such as their iconic eyeball masks), while dancers and actors appeared {{in front of}} painted backdrops used to help illustrate the story. Penn Jillette <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> between songs telling long intentionally pointless stories. The show was designed to appear to fall apart as it progressed: Penn pretended to grow angrier with the crowd, and lighting effects and music would become increasingly chaotic, all building {{up to the point}} where Penn was dragged off stage and returned, handcuffed to a wheelchair, to deliver his last monologue. During one performance, an audience member assaulted Penn while he was handcuffed to the wheelchair.|$|E
