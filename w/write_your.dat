500|$|Recalling the songwriting style {{she used}} {{when she had}} collaborated with RedOne, Porcelain Black said she would enter the studio with an idea she {{had come up with}} on her own at the piano and play it for RedOne. At other times, RedOne would play a beat he had {{constructed}} for her, and she would listen to it and see what vibes emerged from hearing it. Usually, Porcelain Black creates a song title, then forges the song around that. She finds the most difficult songwriting process to be starting with melody, because making the syllables of her lyrics match the melody produces an effect that sounds forced and contrived. When working with RedOne, Porcelain Black said they would construct the melodies together, but all of the song lyrics were written exclusively by her; RedOne did not contribute to her music lyrically while they were working together on her first attempt at a debut album. Lyrically, Porcelain Black writes all of her own songs. On the topic, she has said: [...] "I write all my own stuff. I don't understand artists that don’t write their own songs. I'm thankful for artists like Britney, but I don’t understand how you can’t <b>write</b> <b>your</b> own music. It's such a personal way of expressing yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|Trial by Jury is {{the only}} Gilbert and Sullivan opera played in one act and the only {{theatrical}} work by W. S. Gilbert without spoken dialogue. However, later Gilbert and Sullivan operas retained a number of patterns seen in Trial. [...] For example, all except The Yeomen of the Guard begin with a chorus number. [...] Also, like Trial by Jury, the later operas generally end with a relatively short finale consisting of a chorus number interspersed with short solos by the principal characters. [...] "Comes the broken flower" [...] (part of No.3) {{was the first in}} a string of meditative [...] "Horatian" [...] lyrics, [...] "mingling happiness and sadness, an acceptance and a smiling resignation". [...] These would, from this point forward, allow the characters, in each of the Savoy operas, an introspective scene where they stop and consider life, in contrast to the foolishness of the surrounding scenes. [...] Like both of the tenor's arias in Trial by Jury, tenor arias in later Savoy operas were set in 6/8 time so frequently that Anna Russell, in her 1953 parody, [...] "How to <b>Write</b> <b>Your</b> Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera", exclaimed, [...] "the tenor...according to tradition, must sing an aria in 6/8 time, usually accompanying himself on a stringed instrument". [...] In Trial by Jury hypocrisy is revealed as the characters' motivations are held up to satire, and Gilbert mocks the underlying absurdity of the judicial procedures. [...] As Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther explains, Gilbert combines his criticisms with comic entertainment, which renders them more palatable, {{while at the same time}} underlining their truth: [...] "By laughing at a joke you show that you accept its premise." [...] This too would become characteristic of Gilbert's work.|$|E

[...] In [...] "My name is John Wellington Wells", the title character of The Sorcerer introduces himself as a tradesman of an ironic kind: [...] "a dealer in magic and spells".
