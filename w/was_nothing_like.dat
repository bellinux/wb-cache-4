5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E

The next day Hutchinson reconsidered and rehired Voss Smith, after satisfying himself that Drysdale was a respected artist in Australia.|$|E

Finance Minister Jim Flaherty {{expressed}} sympathy with the protests, citing high unemployment amongst the youth. Comparing Canada to the U.S., he said that unlike the U.S., Canada has a progressive income tax system that favors the vulnerable, and the government has regulated and supervised its financial institutions.|$|E

25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

When she and Lionel were called to visit Lionel's father Wilbur (Ian Mune), Kirsty decided to divorce Lionel, only for the small plane they were in to plummet to the ground. In 1998 the two survived the crash and divorced. Kirsty was horrified when Darryl's twin brother Damien (Mark Ferguson) arrived to the street, however Damien <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> his brother and when he suffered extreme burns in a fire, Kirsty realized she was in love. The two moved to Wellington together {{to be closer to}} Marj.|$|E
25|$|Nova is {{featured}} in the Marvel Zombies edition Dead Days. Unable to overcome his fear and horror of the slaughter occurring around him, Nova fails to act {{in his own defense}} when Spider-Man attacks him. Fortunately for Nova, Daredevil intervenes but is bitten when Nova is too shocked to assist. He and Thor are rescued by the Fantastic Four and united with the other surviving heroes on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. Nova panics further when Nick Fury formulates a desperate last stand defense, citing that this <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> previous global threats; and that the world was as good as dead. Regardless, Nova helps in the battle until he is bitten by Ms. Marvel. As a zombie, he participates in a failed attack on Doctor Doom's castle, {{in an effort to get}} at the humans inside. A zombie version of Nova can be seen in the Marvel Zombies limited series, being shredded by a hail of metal fragments hurled by Magneto.|$|E

[...] It was a simple accident. [...] Kongo was in one part of the double cage, Lulu in another, and between them was a partition of narrow bars. [...] Lulu had Patty Cake in her arms and when Patty reached in between the narrow bars to touch her father, Lulu suddenly pulled her away. [...] But Patty's arm got caught in the narrow bars and broke. [...] It was a freak accident. [...] No one ever realized that those bars were narrow enough to catch that tiny arm.|$|E
500|$|There were {{concerns}} {{in some quarters}} that the American Hathaway was playing a beloved English writer. James McAvoy, who plays Thomas Langlois Lefroy, believed that filming in Ireland made her casting [...] "a bit safer" [...] than if they had shot in England. McAvoy accepted the role because he enjoyed Austen's writings and was eager to work with Jarrold, having collaborated with him previously on the 2002 television production White Teeth. McAvoy first assumed that Becoming Jane would be directly associated with Pride and Prejudice, with his character possessing similarities with Mr. Darcy; the actor soon realised however [...] "that the screenplay <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> Pride and Prejudice. The screenwriter probably speculated {{on some of the}} inspiration for Pride and Prejudice but it is a completely different story." ...|$|E
500|$|Historians have {{expressed}} criticism for Brezhnev and his rule. The scholarly literature dealing {{with him is}} scarce and, {{with the exception of}} the period immediately after his death, overwhelmingly negative. Very little has been written about Brezhnev in English, and even Russian literature. According to Mark Sandle and Edwin Bacon, the authors behind Brezhnev Reconsidered, Brezhnev had attracted little attention from the media due to a consensus of his rule that was formed shortly after his death; literally that his rule was one primarily of stagnation. When Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, initiated perestroika he blamed the degradation of the Soviet economic and political system on Brezhnev, and called his rule the [...] "Era of Stagnation". Gorbachev claimed that Brezhnev followed [...] "a fierce neo-Stalinist line", although in a later statement Gorbachev made assurances that Brezhnev was not as bad as he was made out to be, saying, [...] "Brezhnev <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> the cartoon figure that is made of him now".|$|E

500|$|The Blackening {{was leaked}} {{on to the}} Internet two weeks before its release by an American {{journalist}} who received an advanced copy. Demmel thought it unfortunate, but that it created a [...] "pre-buzz", as did Flynn who thought the buzz <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> the band had before; [...] "There’s internet street buzz vs. record company hype and if the hype matches up to the street buzz, then you’re {{seeing a lot of}} bands selling a lot of records in the first week". The Blackening became Machine Head's highest charting release in the United States, where it entered the Top Rock albums at No. 9, and the Billboard 200 at No. 54 (their highest charting and first week ever), with sales of almost 16,000 copies. This improved on the band's 2004 release, Through the Ashes of Empires, which sold 12,000 units in its first week, and entered the Billboard 200 at No. 88.|$|E
500|$|Brezhnev {{presided over}} the Soviet Union for longer than any other person except Joseph Stalin. He is often criticised for the {{prolonged}} Era of Stagnation, in which fundamental economic problems were ignored and the Soviet political system was allowed to decline. During Mikhail Gorbachev's tenure as leader {{there was an increase}} in criticism of the Brezhnev years, such as claims that Brezhnev followed [...] "a fierce neo-Stalinist line". The Gorbachevian discourse blamed Brezhnev for failing to modernise the country and to change with the times, although in a later statement Gorbachev made assurances that Brezhnev was not as bad as he was made out to be, saying, [...] "Brezhnev <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> the cartoon figure that is made of him now." [...] The intervention in Afghanistan, {{which was one of the}} major decisions of his career, also significantly undermined both the international standing and the internal strength of the Soviet Union. In Brezhnev's defence, it can be said that the Soviet Union reached unprecedented and never-repeated levels of power, prestige, and internal calm under his rule.|$|E
500|$|Rotten Tomatoes reports an 82% {{approval}} rating, {{based on}} 11 reviews. The critical consensus reads, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] is an enjoyable season finale that manages {{to deliver a}} few last minute scares as it ties up loose ends." [...] James Queally from The Star-Ledger commented about the season and its finale, [...] "After a wildly uneven first nine episodes... and two red-hot episodes {{leading up to the}} finale... "Afterbirth" [...] starts out flying high at the way too fast pace that has made American Horror Story an enjoyable ride these past two weeks. But somewhere in the final 30 minutes of this episode, [...] "Afterbirth" [...] turns into a wandering epilogue." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club stated, [...] "Part of the fun of those early episodes – even when I really didn't like them – was that you never quite had a good sense of what the hell kind of show you were watching. The finale sticks us into {{what seems to be a}} pretty basic setup for season two." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Afterbirth" [...] "an exhilarating shocker." [...] Matt Fowler at IGN gave the episode a score eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. He stated, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] was a very odd finale and I'm pretty sure that it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> most of us thought it would be." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Lose My Breath" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, Fred Jerkins, Sean Garrett, LaShawn Daniels and Jay-Z. The {{production}} of the song was handled by Jerkins, Beyoncé, Rowland and Garrett. Record producer Jerkins, who had previously collaborated with the group for [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), had worked on [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] without informing Destiny's Child. Beyoncé and Williams heard the drum instrumentation of the track and they enjoyed it with the latter feeling that the song <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> the mainstream radio sound. They went to their band mate Kelly Rowland presenting the song. Alongside Jerkins, the group asked for help from American rapper Jay-Z who immediately created a chorus including the lines [...] "Can you keep up" [...] without hearing the track. The group took his chorus and wrote the verses and bridge around it. During an interview with Complex, Garrett recalled the time he worked with Williams on the song, saying, [...] "There was so much magic {{going on in the}} studio. We probably recorded all the songs in about a month and every day it was a new song coming out. 'Lose My Breath' was towards {{the latter part of the}} album and that was an amazing song that we felt could not only be big on the radio but big with bands and marching bands. I was on a natural high after that." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{generally}} responded warmly to the episode, {{but some}} felt it compared poorly {{to others in}} the series. David Chater, writing for The Times, felt that [...] "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" [...] was dissimilar from any previous episode of Inside No. 9, but that it was [...] "equally accomplished", while in sister publication The Sunday Times, critics suggested that the change in style showed the writers' versatility. Neela Debnath, writing for The Independent, called [...] "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" [...] a [...] "hilariously dark little half-hour of quintessentially British comedy". Rupert Hawksley, writing for The Daily Telegraph, was more critical. He awarded [...] "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" [...] three out of five stars, saying that [...] "despite a starry cast and a delightful twist and counter-twist, [...] <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> as effective" [...] as [...] "La Couchette" [...] and [...] "The 12 Days of Christine", the previous two episodes of the series. The episode, he claimed, was indicative of a [...] "mid-series lull". The freelance journalist Dan Owen felt the episode was [...] "entertaining fare, but too predictable and clichéd to prove genuinely memorable", awarding it two out of four stars. He, too, said the episode felt like [...] "a mid-series misstep". Shearsmith was unhappy with those who thought the episode a [...] "dud" [...] or a [...] "misfire", confessing that it was his favourite episode of the second series. Pemberton felt {{it was going to be}} difficult to follow [...] "The 12 Days of Christine", but Shearsmith was of the view that the episodes should not be in competition with each other.|$|E
500|$|Faust was {{initially}} hired by Hasbro {{to create a}} pitch bible for the show, allowing her to get additional help with conceptualization. Faust said she was [...] "extremely skeptical" [...] about taking the job at first because she had always found shows based on girls' toys to be boring and unrelatable. My Little Pony {{was one of her}} favorite childhood toys, but she was disappointed that her imagination at the time <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> the animated shows, in which the characters, according to Faust, [...] "just had endless tea parties, giggled over nothing and defeated villains by either sharing with them or crying". With the chance to work on My Little Pony, she hoped to prove that [...] "cartoons for girls don't have to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness". To do this, she incorporated into the design of the characters and the show many elements that contradicted idealized stereotypes of girls, such as diverse personalities, the message that friends can be different and can get into arguments but still be friends, and the idea that girls should not be limited by what others say they can or cannot do. Elements of the characters' personalities and the show's settings were based on her own childhood imagination of the ponies' adventures, in part inspired by the animated shows that her brothers would watch while growing up, such as Transformers and she considered that she was making Friendship Is Magic [...] "for me as an eight-year-old". Faust still aimed for the characters to be [...] "relatable" [...] characters, using stereotypical [...] "icons of girliness" [...] (such as the waif or the bookworm) in order to broaden the appeal of the characters for the young female audience.|$|E
