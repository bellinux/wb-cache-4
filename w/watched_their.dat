This left the final encounter with Ireland, played at Stradey Park in Llanelli, as the deciding match for a Welsh Triple Crown. Despite an unconvincing Welsh display, an enthusiastic crowd of 20,000 <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> country win the game {{and with it the}} title, decided by a single try from Bert Gould.|$|E
5|$|As {{his father}} was playing for the Chicago Blackhawks, Hull's early life was spent in Illinois, and he first played {{organized}} hockey in the Chicago area {{at the age of}} four. He and his brothers often skated with the Black Hawks where they <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> father play. The family moved back to Canada when Bobby signed with the original Winnipeg Jets in 1972. Brett moved to Vancouver with his mother and two youngest siblings shortly before his parents' acrimonious divorce in 1979. Hull was not close to his father following the breakup, though the two spoke periodically.|$|E

5|$|Attendance {{levels at}} Andover's matches reached a {{peak in the}} late 1960s. During the 1969–70 season, home attendances at league matches {{averaged}} over 550, with the largest crowd being the 2,144 people who <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> FA Cup match against local rivals Salisbury. In the years following their promotion to the Southern League, average attendances started to drop until they dipped below the 200 mark during the 1970s. Since then, the average attendance at Andover's matches has remained at approximately 140, although this figure dipped below 100 in the 1999–2000 season following their last relegation from the Southern League. Just three seasons later however, this figure had risen to just under 200 following the club's second consecutive Wessex League championship and successes in cup competitions.|$|E
5|$|Prenton Park {{has seen}} the number of {{supporters}} rise and fall considerably over its hundred-year history. Around 8,000 visitors watched the first game at the stadium on 11 March 1912, as Tranmere beat Lancaster Town 8–0. Early attendances varied from 5,000 to 8,000, though, on Boxing Day 1921, 11,137 supporters came to see Tranmere take on Bolton Wanderers Reserves. Tranmere entered The Football League the next season, and 7,011 <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> first game against Crewe Alexandra F.C.. There was an average of 6,000 in attendance at home games, before the Football League was suspended {{as a result of}} the Second World War.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{breaking}} news, including federal elections, CBC Television may obtain {{the largest number of}} viewers. For instance, after election night 2006, CBC Television took out full-page newspaper ads claiming that 2.2million Canadians <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> coverage, more than any other broadcaster. However, in similar ads, CTV also claimed to be number one, stating there was a CBC audience of only 1.2million.

25|$|Due to its {{relatively}} low income from television and commercial partners, Scottish clubs were {{highly dependent on}} revenues from fans attending matches. More people in Scotland per head of population <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> domestic top-level league than any other European nation. All ten of the clubs that played in the 1998–99 Scottish Premier League also participated in the 2011–12 Scottish Premier League. Nine of those ten clubs recorded lower average attendance. Celtic had a 14% decline in attendance since a peak season of 2000–01, when the club won the domestic treble. Dunfermline, who were newly promoted to the SPL in 2011–12, only saw an increase of 939 in average attendance from the 2010–11 Scottish First Division season. They also attracted a bigger crowd for a Fife derby game in the First Division against Raith Rovers than any game in the SPL.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} redoubts {{were now}} {{in danger of}} falling {{into the hands of}} the oncoming Russians. The battalions of the Ukraine Regiment under Colonel Dudnitsky-Lishin, attacked redoubts Nos.2 and 3, while the Odessa Regiment under Skyuderi advanced on redoubt No.4. The Ottoman forces in these positions, having already <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> compatriots flee the first redoubt and realizing that the British were not coming to their aid, retreated towards Balaclava, pursued by the Cossacks who had little trouble dispatching any stray or isolated men. The few British NCOs could do nothing but spike the guns, rendering them unusable. The Ottoman forces had gained some time for the Allies, but in the end the Turks were forced to abandon the redoubts. By 08:00 the Russians had occupied redoubts 1, 2 and 3, and, considering it too close to the enemy, had razed redoubt No.4.|$|E
25|$|It was {{eventually}} embraced, {{or at least}} accepted, by go-go fans both young and not so young. In a city that considers “swing” go-go the soundtrack of its story, this was no tiny feat. Even old-timers who deny the appeal of bounce beat understand why it exists. The brash style not only changed the way people danced and partied but became the music for {{a new chapter in}} D.C.’s story. If the swing sound carried a generation of Washingtonians through the rough ’70s and ’80s, a time when funk, jazz, and soul was a much-needed salve, bounce grounded them in the ’00s and ’10s, helped them keep their bearings at a time of shifting city demographics, when go-go’s epicenter realigned as the sound of black Washington, at least from the ’70s onward, was pushed to the suburbs. With its pummeling tone and tempo, bounce beat remains a perfect musical metaphor for what young people have experienced as they’ve <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> city be slowly replaced by something unrecognizable.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{achievement of}} Marie Antoinette {{in that period}} was {{the establishment of an}} alliance with Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, the most important lawmaker in the assembly. Like La Fayette, Mirabeau was a liberal aristocrat. He had joined the Third Estate and was not against the monarchy, but wanted to reconcile it with the Revolution. He also wanted to be a minister and was not immune to corruption. On the advice of Mercy, Marie Antoinette opened secret negotiations with him and both agreed to meet privately at the château of Saint-Cloud on 3 July 1790, where the royal family was allowed to spend the summer, free of the radical elements who <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> every move in Paris. At the meeting, Mirabeau was much impressed by the queen, and remarked in a letter to Auguste Marie Raymond d'Arenberg, comte de La Marck, that she was the only man the king had by him: La reine est le seul homme que le roi ait auprès de lui. An agreement was reached turning Mirabeau into one of her political allies: Marie Antoinette promised to pay him 6000 livres per month and one million if he succeeded in his mission to restore the king's authority.|$|E

25|$|The {{most notorious}} {{criminal}} {{of the period}} (aside from the Nazis and their collaborators) was Doctor Marcel Petiot. Petiot purchased a house at 21 rue Le Sueur in the 16th arrondissement, and {{under the name of}} Docteur Eugène, pretended to be the head of a Resistance network that smuggled Jews from France to Argentina. He collected a large advance from his clients and then instructed them to come to his house, bringing their gold, silver and other valuables with them. After they arrived, he brought them to his consulting room, and, convincing them vaccination was required in order to enter Argentina, gave them a lethal intravenous injection, then <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> slow death in an adjacent room through a spyhole in the door. Afterwards, he cut up their bodies, put the pieces in the well, and dissolved them with quicklime. His activities attracted the attention of the Gestapo, which arrested him in 1943, thus allowing him to claim later that he had been a real member of the Resistance. His crimes were discovered after the Liberation in 1944, and he was charged with the murders of twenty-seven persons, tried in 1946, and sentenced to death. He went to the guillotine on May 25, 1946. The gold, silver and other valuables were not found when he was arrested. In search of the treasure, the house was carefully demolished in 1966, but no trace of it was ever found.|$|E
500|$|In religion, birds {{may serve}} as either {{messengers}} or priests and leaders for a deity, {{such as in the}} Cult of Makemake, in which the Tangata manu of Easter Island served as chiefs or as attendants, {{as in the case of}} Hugin and Munin, the two common ravens who whispered news into the ears of the Norse god Odin. In several civilisations of ancient Italy, particularly Etruscan and Roman religion, priests were involved in augury, or interpreting the words of birds while the [...] "auspex" [...] (from which the word [...] "auspicious" [...] is derived) <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> activities to foretell events.|$|E
500|$|John Dudley {{recovered}} {{the post of}} Lord Admiral immediately after the Protector's fall in October 1549, Thomas Seymour having been executed by his brother in March 1549. Dudley passed on the office to Edward Lord Clinton in May 1550, yet never lost his keen interest in maritime affairs. HenryVIII had revolutionised the English navy, mainly in military terms. Dudley encouraged English voyages to far-off coasts, ignoring Spanish threats. He even contemplated a raid on Peru with Sebastian Cabot in 1551. Expeditions to Morocco and the Guinea coast in 1551 and 1552 were actually realised. A planned voyage to China via the Northeast passage under Hugh Willoughby sailed in May 1553—King Edward <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> departure from his window. Northumberland was at the centre of a [...] "maritime revolution", a policy in which, increasingly, the English Crown sponsored long-distance trade directly.|$|E

500|$|Birds {{have been}} seen as spirit {{messengers}} of the gods. In Norse mythology, Hugin and Munin were ravens who whispered news into the ears of the god Odin. In the Etruscan and Roman religions of ancient Italy, priests were involved in augury, interpreting the words of birds while the [...] "auspex" [...] <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> activities to foretell events. In the Inca and Tiwanaku empires of South America, birds are depicted transgressing the boundaries between the earthly and underground spiritual realms. Indigenous peoples of the central Andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds. The mythical chullumpi bird is said to mark the existence of a portal between such worlds, and to transform itself into a llama. Among the Parsees of India and Iran, and among practitioners of Vajrayana Buddhism who believe in the transmigration of souls in Sikkim, Mongolia, Bhutan and Nepal, sky burial has been practised for centuries. In this ritual, corpses are left exposed for griffon vultures to pick clean. The practice is declining, not least because of the loss of most of the vulture population across South Asia to accidental poisoning by the anti-inflammatory veterinary drug diclofenac.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy {{takes place}} in a fantasy world with three large continents. The {{elemental}} powers of this world are determined by the state of four orbs, each governing one of the four classical elements: earth, fire, water, and wind. The world of Final Fantasy is inhabited by numerous races, including Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Mermaids, Dragons, and Robots. Most non-Human races have only one [...] "town" [...] in the game, although individuals are sometimes found in Human towns or other areas as well. Four hundred years {{prior to the start of}} the game, the Lefeinish people, who used the Power of Wind to craft airships and a giant space station (called the Floating Castle in the game), <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> country decline as the Wind Orb went dark. Two hundred years later, violent storms sank a massive shrine that served as the center of an ocean-based civilization, and the Water Orb went dark. The Earth Orb and the Fire Orb followed, plaguing the earth with raging wildfires, and devastating the agricultural town of Melmond as the plains and vegetation decayed. Some time later, the sage Lukahn tells of a prophecy that four Light Warriors will come to save the world in a time of darkness.|$|E
500|$|Thomas {{was one of}} {{a number}} of {{scientists}} who <b>watched</b> <b>their</b> work come to fruition on July 16, 1945, at the Trinity nuclear test. For his work on the project, he received the Medal for Merit from the president Harry S. Truman in 1946. On May 2, 1945, Groves and Thomas agreed that Monsanto would take over the running of the Clinton laboratories at Oak Ridge, Tennessee from July 1, 1945. [...] Thomas brought in some 60 new staff from Dayton to help run the Clinton Laboratories, and he persuaded Eugene Wigner to come from Chicago to work on new reactor designs. Under Wigner, the Laboratories made a pioneering study of Wigner's disease, the swelling and distortion of the graphite used as a moderator in reactors due the neutron bombardment produced in a reactor. Thomas became frustrated with restrictions on spending and the uncertainty about the future of the laboratory. In May 1947, he decided not to renew the contract with the Atomic Energy Commission to operate the Clinton Laboratories on a month-to-month basis while a new operator was found. Union Carbide took over the contract in December 1947. Monsanto was, however, given the contract to operate the new Mound Laboratories in early 1948.|$|E
