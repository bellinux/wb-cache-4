He later attended Christ's College, Finchley, {{from where he}} went to Exeter College at the University of Oxford, reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating with a third class degree. He claims to have only attended two lectures. At Oxford he became editor of and frequent contributor to an underground left-wing student newspaper called Red Herring/Oxford Strumpet, copies of which are archived in the Bodleian Library. His reasons for reading PPE rather than English literature were discussed by Self {{in an interview with}} The Guardian newspaper:I [...] a pretty thorough grounding in the canon, but I certainly didn't want to be involved with criticism. Even then it seemed inimical to what {{it was to be a}} writer, which is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to be.|$|E

60|$|I don't know if {{you know}} that sort of feeling you get on these days round about the end of April and the {{beginning}} of May, when the sky's a light blue, with cotton-wool clouds, and there's a bit of a breeze blowing from the west? Kind of uplifted feeling. Romantic, if you know what I mean. I'm not much of a ladies' man, but on this particular morning {{it seemed to me that}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> was some charming girl to buzz up and ask me to save her from assassins or something. So that it was a bit of an anti-climax when I merely ran into young Bingo Little, looking perfectly foul in a crimson satin tie decorated with horseshoes.|$|E
60|$|This is a {{much better}} place for {{children}} than any I have hitherto seen in these seas. The girls (and sometimes the boys) play a very elaborate kind of hopscotch. The boys play horses exactly as we do in Europe; and have very good fun on stilts, trying to knock each other down, in which they do not often succeed. The children of all ages go to church and are allowed to do what they please, running about the aisles, rolling balls, stealing mamma's bonnet and publicly sitting on it, and at last going to sleep {{in the middle of the}} floor. I forgot to say that the whips to play horses, and the balls to roll about the church--at least I never saw them used elsewhere--grow ready made on trees; which is rough on toy-shops. The whips are so good that I wanted to play horses myself; but no such luck! my hair is grey, and I am a great, big, ugly man. The balls are rather hard, but very light and quite round. When you grow up and become offensively rich, you can charter a ship in the port of London, and have it come back to you entirely loaded with these balls; when you could satisfy your mind as to their character, and give them away when done with to your uncles and aunts. But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to tell you was this: besides the tree-top toys (Hush-a-by, toy-shop, on the tree-top!), I have seen some real made toys, the first hitherto observed in the South Seas.|$|E

6000|$|Startling doubts beset me as I walked restlessly {{backward}} and forward, {{now in the}} anteroom, and now in the corridor outside. It was plain that I had (quite innocently) disturbed the repose of some formidable secrets in Miserrimus Dexter's mind. I confused and wearied my poor brains in trying to guess what the secrets might be. All my ingenuity--as after-events showed me--was wasted on speculations not one of which even approached the truth. I was on surer ground when I arrived at the conclusion that Dexter had really kept every mortal creature out of his confidence. He could never have betrayed such serious signs of disturbance as I had noticed in him, if he had publicly acknowledged at the Trial, or if he had privately communicated to any chosen friend, all that he knew of the tragic and terrible drama acted in the bedchamber at Gleninch. What powerful influence had induced him to close his lips? Had he been silent in mercy to others? or in dread of consequences to himself? Impossible to tell! Could I hope that he would confide to Me what he had kept secret from Justice and Friendship alike? When he knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> of him, would he arm me, {{out of his own}} stores of knowledge, with the weapon that would win me victory in the struggle to come? The chances were against it--there was no denying that. Still the end was worth trying for. The caprice of the moment might yet stand my friend, with such a wayward being as Miserrimus Dexter. My plans and projects were sufficiently strange, sufficiently wide of the ordinary limits of a woman's thoughts and actions, to attract his sympathies. [...] "Who knows," [...] I thought to myself, [...] "if I may not take his confidence by surprise, by simply telling him the truth?" ...|$|E

There was nothing but that wretched, old, mangled {{steamboat}} I was leaning against, while he talked fluently about 'the necessity for every man to get on.' 'And when one comes out here, you conceive, {{it is not to}} gaze at the moon.' Mr. Kurtz was a 'universal genius,' but even a genius would find it easier to work with 'adequate tools--intelligent men.' He did not make bricks--why, there was a physical impossibility in the way--as I was well aware; and if he did secretarial work for the manager, it was because 'no sensible man rejects wantonly the confidence of his superiors.' Did I see it? I saw it. What more did I want? <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> was rivets, by heaven! Rivets. To get on with the work--to stop the hole. Rivets I wanted. There were cases of them down at the coast--cases--piled up--burst--split! You kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that station yard on the hillside. Rivets had rolled into the grove of death. You could fill your pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping down--and there wasn't one rivet to be found where it was wanted. We had plates that would do, but nothing to fasten them with. And every week the messenger, a lone negro, letter-bag on shoulder and staff in hand, left our station for the coast. And several times a week a coast caravan came in with trade goods,--ghastly glazed calico that made you shudder only to look at it, glass beads value about a penny a quart, confounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs. And no rivets. Three carriers could have brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat.|$|E

This I don't mind admitting she did, the day I speak of, {{let me see}} that she feels you've done; but without {{suggesting}} either--not a scrap, please believe--that I should make you any sort of scene about it. Of course in the first place she knows perfectly that anything like a scene would be no use. You couldn't make out even if you wanted," [...] Nanda went on, [...] "that THIS is one. She won't hear us--will she?--smashing the furniture. I didn't think for a while that I could do anything at all, and I worried myself with that idea half to death. Then suddenly it came to me that I could do just what I'm doing now. You said a while ago that we must never be--you and I--anything but frank and natural. That's what I said to myself also--why not? Here I am for you therefore as natural as a cold in your head. I just ask you--I even press you. It's because, as she said, you've practically ceased coming. Of course I know everything changes. It's the law--what is it?--'the great law' of something or other. All sorts of things happen--things come to an end. She has more or less--by his marriage--lost Mitchy. I don't want her to lose everything. Do stick to her. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to say to you--to bring it straight out--is that I don't believe you thoroughly know how awfully she likes you. I hope my saying such a thing doesn't affect you as 'immodest.' One never knows--but I don't much care if it does. I suppose it WOULD be immodest if I were to say that I verily believe she's in love with you. Not, for that matter, that father would mind--he wouldn't mind, as he says, a tuppenny rap. So"--she extraordinarily kept it up--"you're welcome to any good the information may have for you: though that, I dare say, does sound hideous. No matter--if I produce any effect on you. That's the only thing I want. When I think of her downstairs there so often nowadays practically alone I feel as if I could scarcely bear it. She's so fearfully young." ...|$|E

50|$|About the industry, she said: <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to do was}} write lyrics for songs.

500|$|The book {{notes the}} artist's {{reluctance}} {{to be interviewed}} or engage with the public, and quotes him as saying: [...] "It's {{very hard for me}} to relate to people asking questions that are not only boring but don't {{have anything to do with}} my life ... It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are."
