5|$|One scene {{right before}} Riddler and Two-face team up {{featured}} a little conversation with Dick and Bruce {{in the gym}} of the manor. This <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> Dick suddenly has martial arts training. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|This {{meant that}} his pyramid {{was out of}} the {{alignment}} formed by the preceding ones, limited its size and constrained the layout of his mortuary complex. This <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why,</b> despite having enjoyed one of the longest reigns of the Fifth Dynasty, Nyuserre's pyramid was smaller than that of his father and closer in size to that of his grandfather Sahure.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Robert had a falling out with Stephen in {{the last months of}} the king's reign– Stephen died in October 1154. Stephen besieged Drax Castle in the summer of 1154, which had earlier been given to Robert's nephew Robert. The younger Robert may have objected to giving up his castle to the previous owners and the elder Robert may have taken offence at these events. This <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> Robert does not appear on Stephen's charters after the Lincoln charter of 1154, but this theory is just speculation by one of Robert's biographers. Robert was replaced as chancellor by Becket shortly after Henry II's coronation on 19 December 1154 and before January 1155.|$|E
50|$|The seesaw {{mechanism}} is appealing because it <b>would</b> naturally <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the observed neutrino masses are so small. However, if the neutrinos are Majorana then they violate {{the conservation of}} lepton number and even of B − L.|$|R
25|$|It {{also sought}} to take some blame away from Tinsley, because {{he may have been}} {{suffering}} from a form of epilepsy which affected his short term memory, which they argued <b>would</b> have <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> he might have simply not been aware of the waiting local train.|$|R
50|$|Several {{epigenetic}} {{models of}} autism have been proposed. These are {{suggested by the}} occurrence of autism in individuals with fragile X syndrome, which arises from epigenetic mutations, and with Rett syndrome, which involves epigenetic regulatory factors. An epigenetic model <b>would</b> help <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> standard genetic screening strategies have so much difficulty with autism.|$|R
5|$|One {{sequence}} came directly {{after the}} casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He {{shows up at}} the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of {{this idea}} point out that moralists during Bosch's era {{believed}} that it was woman'sultimately Eve'stemptation that drew men into a life of lechery and sin. This <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the women in the center panel are very much among the active participants in bringing about the Fall. At the time, the power of femininity was often rendered by showing a female surrounded by a circle of males. A late 15th-century engraving by Israhel van Meckenem shows a group of men prancing ecstatically around a female figure. The Master of the Banderoles's 1460 work the Pool of Youth similarly shows a group of females standing in a space surrounded by admiring figures.|$|E
5|$|Several {{different}} {{estimates for the}} size of the Persian fleet are given. Thucydides says that there was a fleet of 200 Phoenician ships, and is generally considered the most reliable source. Plutarch gives numbers of 350 from Ephorus and 600 from Phanodemus. Furthermore, Plutarch says that the Persian fleet was awaiting 80 Phoenician ships sailing from Cyprus. Although Thucydides's account is generally to be favoured, there may an element of truth in Plutarch's assertion that the Persians were awaiting further reinforcements; this <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> Cimon was able to launch a pre-emptive assault on them. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for {{the size of the}} Persian land army. However, the number of Persian marines accompanying the fleet was presumably in the same range as the number of Greek marines (c. 5,000), since the Persian ships carried the same complement of troops. Plutarch quotes Ephorus as saying that Tithraustes was commander of the royal fleet, and Pherendatis of the infantry, but says that Callisthenes named Ariomandes as overall commander.|$|E
25|$|An {{idea that}} avoids these {{shortcomings}} {{is that the}} Scandinavians might have practiced selective procreation leading to a shortage of women, and that the Vikings main motive for emigration was to acquire wives, although this <b>would</b> not <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the Vikings chose to settle in other countries rather than bringing the women back with them to Scandinavia.|$|R
50|$|A {{study on}} hybrid mice which {{investigated}} the possible causes for hybrid growth disorders revealed gene imprinting {{to have a}} major effect. The study also showed that the growth disorder most commonly affected the heterozygous sex, as expected by Haldane's rule. This <b>would</b> also <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> hybrid growth disorders often appear to affect one sex more than the other.|$|R

25|$|Research {{published}} in 2009 shows {{a much higher}} density of stream channels than formerly believed. Regions on Mars with the most valleys are comparable to what is found on Earth. The research team developed a computer program to identify valleys by searching in topographical data for U-shaped structures. The large extent of valley networks found strongly supports rain on the planet in the past. The global pattern of the Martian valleys {{could be explained by}} a big northern ocean. A large ocean in the northern hemisphere <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> there is a southern limit to valley networks: the southernmost regions of Mars, farthest from the water reservoir, would get little rainfall and would develop no valleys. Similarly, the lack of rainfall <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> Martian valleys become shallower from north to south.|$|E
25|$|The League of Nations {{estimated}} {{a million}} dead, but {{the list of}} refugees in the Caucasus and Russian Armenia who were not from Ottoman Empire was not clearly defined, {{which suggests that the}} list of 400,000 to 420,000 Ottoman Armenians may have included Armenians who were not really Ottoman Armenian. This <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> other estimates projected the casualties over the million given by the League.|$|E
25|$|Seedlings {{would have}} little change of {{surviving}} in a normal dry season; establishment probably requires several consecutive seasons of good rain. The combination of a bushfire followed by several seasons of cyclonic storms probably only occurs every few hundred years, suggesting that opportunities for seedling recruitment are extremely rare. This <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the entire population appears to be over two hundred years old.|$|E
40|$|Congresswoman, <b>would</b> you <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> a Miami man, who you {{lobbied for}} {{to keep out}} of prison, bought your {{daughter}} a $ 50, 000 car?” “There’s a simple explanation!” “Well?” “I just told you… there’s a simple explanation! End of interview!” An editorial cartoon by Ed Gamble, the cartoon references Congresswoman Corrine Brown and the press. Box: 7 Folder: 4 [URL]...|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Richard Walker, an {{endocrine}} physiologist at the University of South Florida College of Medicine, {{said that}} Brooke's body was not developing as a coordinated unit but as independent parts that {{were out of}} synchronization. She was never diagnosed with any known genetic disorder or chromosomal abnormality that <b>would</b> help <b>explain</b> <b>why.</b> Her telomeres seemed to be shortening at the normal rate.|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] Tallente interrupted, [...] "one {{never knows}} {{what one is}} up against {{when you are in}} the {{opposite}} camp, Miller. <b>Would</b> you mind <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> you have sought me out in this singular fashion?" ...|$|R
25|$|The {{official}} website for Helen Hayes shows {{a number of}} programs that she did for NBC Blue during this time, including a Eugene O'Neill play cycle in August 1937, two different dramatic series of her own in 1935–1936 (one sponsored by General Foods), and an appearance on a Blue series in 1940, one which brought famous people who <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> a particular book has been their favorite.|$|E
25|$|An {{interior}} vortex of {{this type}} <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> no frequency jumps occur. Since the excess fluid in the cavity must be discharged, the jet lateral movement must be considerably larger than that found in the edge tone; this is likely {{the reason for the}} high level sound. The flow over the edge results in an applied force and a dipole-like sound field. The characteristic speed must be U the jet exit speed. The characteristic dimension must be D, the cavity diameter.|$|E
25|$|A {{board of}} inquiry {{was set up}} to {{investigate}} the crash. It concluded 'the most probable cause of the crash was a criminal act of sabotage perpetrated in the aircraft'. It also suggested that poisonous gases were released which incapacitated the passengers and crew, which <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> no Mayday signal was given. There was also speculation into other facts involving the details of the investigation. A flight recorder (black box) was not located after the crash and previous C-130 aircraft did have them installed.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{unfinished}} {{parts of the}} painting, such as the cloak of the missing Virgin, would have required quantities of the expensive lapis lazuli blue. If this was in short supply, {{it could be that}} this would have held up completion of the painting, which may <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> it was unfinished. However, even if this were so, it <b>would</b> not <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the artist could not have completed the many other parts of the painting that did not require any blue.|$|R
5000|$|A continuationist <b>would</b> {{disagree}} and <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> a non-canonical oral prophecy, {{even though}} it is inspired by God, is nevertheless fallible. The question of fallibility of noncanonical prophecies is dealt in the section [...] "Disputes concerning the verification of prophecies".|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the CrCL tearing is multifactorial (having many causes) and we don’t yet have a clear picture as to why it occurs. Obesity, conformation, {{inflammatory}} conditions of the joint and genetics are all included under the multifactorial umbrella. Genetic factors are undoubtedly important, which <b>would</b> help <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> certain breeds are predisposed, including Labrador and Golden Retrievers, Mastiffs, Rottweilers, Boxers, Staffordshire Terriers, West Highland White Terriers and Newfoundland dogs.|$|R
25|$|The next oldest {{piece of}} adinkra textile was sent in 1825 from the Elmina Castle {{to the royal}} cabinet of curiosities in The Hague, in {{response}} to an assignment from Major F. Last, who was appointed temporary Commander of Dutch Gold Coast. He probably had the cloth commissioned for William I of the Netherlands, which <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the Coat of arms of the Netherlands is in the centre. The other motifs are typical of the older adinkras. It is now on display in the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden.|$|E
25|$|In Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony, it is {{said that}} 10,000 years ago, there were eight {{families}} (or species) of fairies. It is possible that Centaurs and Trolls used to live not underground but above ground, and were recruited by the fairies for the war against the Mud People (the term used by fairies to address humans). This would explain the links between many animals these two species have, and <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> they don't have magic. Centaurs are also cousins of unicorns, so they couldn't be in the fairy family without the unicorns. The fairies, however, are mostly humanoid.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the clay}} soil {{is not very}} fertile, the high {{rainfall}} and warm weather mean that the island is densely forested throughout. Native plants include the world's southernmost dense forest of podocarps (southern conifers) and hardwoods such as rātā and kāmahi in the lowland areas with mānuka shrubland at higher elevations. The trees {{are thought to have}} become established here since the last ice age from seeds brought across the strait by seabirds, which <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the beech trees that are so common in New Zealand, but whose seeds are dispersed by the wind rather than birds, are not found on Stewart Island.|$|E
5000|$|Later {{that night}} back at home, he is {{hit on the}} head by the same [...] "piece of the sky" [...] — {{only to find out}} {{that it is not a}} piece of the sky, but a device which blends into the {{background}} (which <b>would</b> thereby <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> Chicken Little was unable to find it last time). He calls his friends over to help figure out what it is.|$|R
2500|$|However, it {{is known}} from experiments—most {{prominently}} from observed neutrino oscillations—that neutrinos do in fact have some very small mass, probably less than [...] This implies the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model. The currently most favoured extension is the so-called seesaw mechanism, which <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> both <b>why</b> the left-handed neutrinos are so light compared to the corresponding charged leptons, and why {{we have not yet}} seen any right-handed neutrinos.|$|R
50|$|Three men {{who worked}} at a ranch in British Columbia were murdered with an axe. Thomas Turcotte, a work-hand at the ranch, claimed to have found {{the bodies of the}} three men but denied killing them. He went to the police to tell them to send someone to the ranch, but he <b>would</b> not <b>explain</b> <b>why,</b> even at the insistence of the police. When the bodies were found Turcotte was charged with murder.|$|R
25|$|Limited {{research}} suggests that genetic factors may also be important. Some scholars recently argued {{that the decision to}} vote in the United States has very strong heritability, using twin studies of validated turnout in Los Angeles and self-reported turnout in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to establish that. They suggest that genetics could help to explain why parental turnout is such a strong predictor of voting in young people, and also why voting appears to be habitual. Further, they suggest, if there is an innate predisposition to vote or abstain, this <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> past voting behavior is such a good predictor of future voter reaction.|$|E
25|$|The other {{explanation}} relies on mass transfer between two stars {{born in a}} binary star system. The more massive of the two stars in the system will evolve first and as it expands, will overflow its Roche lobe. Mass will quickly transfer from the initially more massive companion on to the less massive and like the collision hypothesis, <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> there would be main-sequence stars more massive than other stars in the cluster which have already evolved off of the main sequence. Observations of blue stragglers have found that some have significantly less carbon and oxygen in their photospheres than is typical, which is evidence of their outer material having been dredged up from {{the interior of a}} companion.|$|E
25|$|William Maloney, who was {{a medical}} doctor, wrote in his 1936 book The Forged Casement Diaries of the {{whispering}} campaign in 1916 performed as a contagious disease infecting people with doubt and confusion and this is recognized by Casement's biographers. This being the case, Casement's prosecutor, Lord Chancellor (Smith), showed the diaries to Michael Collins in 1922 with the same purpose and knowing from personal experience that, once infected, Collins would inevitably transmit the infection to his government colleagues in Dublin, only one of whom allegedly had ever met Casement. Collins' uncertainty {{would have been enough}} to dissuade others from pursuing such a distasteful matter. But this <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> senior officials of the Irish State have always remained ambivalent with regard to the enduring controversy over the authenticity of these highly incriminating documents.|$|E
25|$|From Zamboanga, {{some members}} of this people adopted an {{exclusively}} seaborne culture and spread outwards in the 10th century towards Basilan, Sulu, Borneo, and Sulawesi. They arrived in Borneo in the 11th century. This hypothesis is currently the most widely accepted among specialists studying the Austronesian peoples. This <b>would</b> also <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> even boat-dwelling Sama-Bajau still practice agricultural rituals, despite being exclusively fishermen. Linguistic evidence further points to Borneo as the ultimate origin of the proto-Sama-Bajau people.|$|R
50|$|After {{studying}} the ambiguous number blocks for hours, the discovery is made that these fragments are compatible DNA strands {{which have been}} recovered from different worlds all over the galaxy. The crew eventually {{believe that they have}} discovered an embedded genetic pattern that is constant throughout many different species, and it is speculated that this was left by an early race that pre-dates all other known civilizations. This <b>would</b> ultimately <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> so many races are humanoid.|$|R
