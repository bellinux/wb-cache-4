[...] "We did our job with the guys there on the ground, and as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> out is when I felt the jet get hit. It was pretty obvious — it was loud... I lost all hydraulics instantaneously, and the jet rolled left and pointed toward the ground, which was an uncomfortable feeling over Baghdad. It didn't respond to any of my control inputs." [...] She tried several procedures to get the aircraft under control, none of which worked; last, she put the plane into manual reversion, meaning she was flying the aircraft without hydraulics. The aircraft immediately responded. [...] "The jet started climbing away from the ground, which was a good feeling {{because there was no}} way I wanted to eject over Baghdad." [...] With some technical advice from her flight leader, Lieutenant Colonel Turner, she flew the injured plane for an hour back to the air base. [...] "The jet was performing exceptionally well. I had {{no doubt in my mind}} I was going to land that airplane." [...] Landing was tricky: [...] "When you lose all the hydraulics, you don't have speed brakes, you don't have brakes, and you don't have steering." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes,--we {{both went}} there right away from St. Louis. When {{we got up}} to St. Louis <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> with them other fellows. Nobody meant to disturb you; but Ferdy got drunk, and would go and have a spree, as he called it." ...|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> again, {{and as we}} went side by side I told him what our mission was, and how that, if it failed, all the lives that had been lost that day would have been lost in vain.|$|E
