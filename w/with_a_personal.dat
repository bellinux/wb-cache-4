As <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> foul, until the penalty time expires, no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short. The player (or a replacement) is allowed to reenter the game once the time in the penalty box is over and the team is thus once again at full strength.|$|E

Frequently expressing the view that stage presentation could not do justice to Shakespeare's plays, Hazlitt nevertheless also found certain plays eminently actable, and he frequently admired the performances of certain actors, particularly Edmund Kean.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakar visited Ottoman Turkey {{during his}} European tour in 1866, {{where he met}} Sultan Abdülaziz. The Sultan {{presented}} Ruggyyah Hanum, a Circassian princess to Abu Bakar as a gift.

5|$|After {{watching}} a dinosaur show at an arena in Springfield, Lisa discovers {{one of her}} favorite authors, T. R. Francis, working there in a dinosaur costume. The woman reveals to a shocked Lisa that she is just an actress the book publishing company used for the jacket photos, and that T. R. Francis is a complete fabrication. She further reveals that all popular young-adult book series were never each written by a single author with any inspiration, they are conceived by book publishing executives through market research and the use of multiple ghostwriters, just to make more money. When Homer finds out about this, he decides to get rich by group-writing a fantasy novel. He recruits a team consisting of Bart, Principal Skinner, Patty Bouvier, Moe Szyslak, and Professor Frink, all of whom have personal attributes or experiences that will help with writing the book: Skinner knows what teens like, Patty is a fantasy fiction fan, Moe has already published some children's books, and Frink has a computer. Lisa is shocked to find that they are group-writing a book, as she knows the only reason one would do that is to gain money. To show that what they are doing is wrong, she decides to write a novel on her own <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> story that readers will connect with.|$|E

5|$|Operation Summer '95 {{failed to}} achieve its goal of {{relieving}} Bihać by drawing substantial RSK forces and the VRS {{away from the city}} to contain the HV/HVO advance. The RSK 2nd Guards Brigade was ordered to move from Bihać to Bosansko Grahovo, and it remained in the Knin area until the beginning of the following HV offensive, Operation Storm, on 4 August. The capture of Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč by the HV and the HVO, their achievement of favourable positions to attack Knin and a large-scale HV mobilization in preparation for Operation Storm caused the RSK to shift its focus from Bihać. On 30 July, RSK civilian and military leaders, Milan Martić and General Mile Mrkšić, met <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> representative of Secretary-General of the United Nations Yasushi Akashi and agreed upon a plan to withdraw from Bihać to prevent the expected Croatian offensive. Days later, the area captured in Operation Summer '95 was used as a staging area for the 4th and the 7th Guards Brigades' advance into Knin in Operation Storm. The VRS 2nd Krajina Corps tried to retake Bosansko Grahovo on the night of 1112 August. Their advance from the direction of Drvar broke through the HV's reserve infantry left to garrison the area and reached the outskirts of the town, but was beaten back by two HV Guards battalions.|$|E
