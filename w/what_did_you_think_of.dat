500|$|Casting for Desperate Housewives {{began in}} February 2004. Director Charles McDougall {{reported}} seeing around 150 [...] "very good and determined women" [...] audition {{for the four}} leads. Eva Longoria was the first actor cast in a lead role, landing the role of Gabrielle Solis, a materialistic ex-model, after two auditions. Longoria, an unknown soap opera actress at the time, stated that prior to her audition, she had not read the entire script. She recounted, [...] "Marc Cherry asks, 'So <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the script?' like the whole thing. And I said, 'Well I didn’t read the script. I only read my part.' And Marc Cherry goes, 'I knew you were Gabrielle at that moment because {{it was such a}} Gabrielle thing to say.'" [...] Roselyn Sánchez also auditioned for the role. Teri Hatcher was cast in the role of Susan Mayer, a single mother looking for love, after a second audition for ABC network executives. Cherry commended Hatcher's audition, calling it [...] "the best audition I've ever seen in network [...]" [...] Actors originally considered for the role include Courteney Cox, Calista Flockhart, Mary-Louise Parker, and Sela Ward. Julia Louis-Dreyfus also expressed interest in the role, but network executives felt she was not right for the part.|$|E
