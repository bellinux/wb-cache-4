5|$|Bessell, {{anxious to}} be of service to his party's highest-profile figure, flew to Dublin in April 1965. He found that Josiffe was being advised by a {{sympathetic}} Jesuit priest, Father Sweetman, who believed {{that at least some}} of Josiffe's allegations might be true; otherwise, he asked Bessell, <b>why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> flown all the way from London to deal with them? Bessell warned Josiffe of the consequences of attempting to blackmail a public figure, but in a more conciliatory vein promised to help recover the missing luggage and insurance card. He also hinted at the possibility of an equestrian job in America. Bessell's intervention appeared to contain the problem, particularly as Josiffe's suitcase was recovered shortly afterwards—although, according to Josiffe, letters implicating Thorpe had been removed. For most of the following two years Josiffe remained largely quiescent in Ireland, attempting to establish himself in various careers; part of this time was spent in a monastery. It was during this period that he formally adopted the name of Scott.|$|E
500|$|On January 25, 1994, the Chandlers' {{lawsuit was}} {{settled out of}} court with $15,331,250 to be held in a trust fund for Jordan, $1.5 million for each of his parents and the family's lawyer slated to receive $5 million for a total of {{approximately}} $23 million (although another source showed Feldman was to receive $3 million based on a September 1993 retainer, for a total of $21 million). According to a motion passed to Judge Melville in 2004, leading up to the 2005 trial, Evan Chandler himself is the one who initiated the settlement with Jackson's insurer. [...] Jackson's insurance company [...] "negotiated and paid the settlement, over the protests of Mr. Jackson and his personal legal counsel" [...] and was [...] "the source of the settlement amounts"; as noted in a 2005 memorandum in People v. Jackson. It also noted [...] "an insurance carrier has the right to settle claims covered by insurance where it decides settlement is expedient and the insured may not interfere with nor prevent such settlements", as established by a number of precedents in California. Defeating the right would involve convincing a court with the power to overrule the precedent that the earlier decision was either wrongly decided or more often, 'clearly' wrong (depending on the criteria of the court) or the court must be convinced to distinguish the case. That is, to make the ruling narrower than that in the precedent due to some difference in facts between the current and precedent case, while still supporting the result reached in the earlier case. In 2004, Jackson's attorney Thomas Mesereau in People v. Jackson said [...] "People who intended to earn millions of dollars from his record and music promotions did not want negative publicity from these lawsuits interfering with their profits. Michael Jackson now regrets making these payments. These settlements were entered into with one primary condition – that condition was that Mr. Jackson never admitted any wrongdoing. Mr. Jackson always denied doing anything wrong...Mr. Jackson now realizes the advice he received was wrong." [...] Jackson explained <b>why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> tried to settle: [...] "I wanted to go on with my life. Too many people had already been hurt. I want to make records. I want to sing. I want to perform again...It's my talent. My hard work. My life. My decision." [...] He also wanted to avoid a [...] "media circus".|$|E
2500|$|... "There was {{no basis}} here for {{criminal}} proceedings against Wright, {{but he had}} been publicly condemned as the man on whom the guilt chiefly lay, and that was a reputation that he was unlikely ever to live down. He retired to obscurity in Adelaide, leaving behind him still a slight, persistent mystery: <b>why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> really delayed? [...] Was it only because {{he wanted to make sure}} of his salary? [...] Was it because he did not want to leave his wife and family and the comforts of the settled districts? [...] Was it merely that he was stupid, lazy and indifferent: a man too mean-spirited to think of anyone but himself? [...] Or was it just possible that he was the victim of that same fated chain of errors that had bedevilled the expedition from the beginning? These were questions that would never be fully answered." ...|$|E

"If the Manitou so well {{loves the}} Indians, <b>why</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> {{permitted}} the pale-faces {{to take away}} their hunting-grounds? <b>Why</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> made the red man poor, and the white man rich?

6000|$|... "Oh! how nice! Where <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been? What <b>has</b> <b>he</b> seen? <b>Why</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> {{been away}} so long? How jolly!" [...] were the various {{expressions}} {{with which the}} news was received.|$|R
6000|$|Questions {{formed in}} Lane's mind, {{questions}} that seemed put by a dawning significance. <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> heard the cry for help? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> found the boat? Why had the drowning man {{proved to be}} one of two men on earth he hated, one of the two men whom he wanted to kill? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> drifted into the rapids? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> come safely through a vortex of death?

6000|$|<b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> never [...] "brought her up," [...] never exacted {{obedience}} from her, {{never even}} tried to influence her? It {{could not have been}} mere weakness. She stole a sidelong glance at the tired, lined face with its steel-blue eyes. She had never seen them other than calm, but they must have been able to flash. <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> always been so just and kind and patient with her? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> never scolded her and bullied her and teased her? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> let her go away, leaving him lonely in his empty, voiceless house? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> never made any claim upon her? The idea came to her as an inspiration. At least, it would ease her conscience. [...] "Why don't you let Arthur live here," [...] she said, [...] "instead of going back to his lodgings? It would be company for you." ...|$|E

60|$|The end! And {{it seemed}} to him now that life had never begun for him, never! It was as if his soul had been cramped and his eyes bandaged from the hour of his birth. <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> lived such a life? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> {{submitted}} to things, blundered into things? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> never insisted on the things he thought beautiful and the things he desired, never sought them, fought for them, taken any risk for them, died rather than abandon them? They were the things that mattered. Safety did not matter. A living did not matter unless there were things to live for....|$|E
60|$|<b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> {{allowed himself}} to be so cowed on that morning? That was Mr. Greenwood's thought.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Twas thus {{that he now}} {{thought of}} her, thus that he spoke of her to himself out loud, now that he could wander alone, with no eye to watch him, no ear to hear him. And yet he loved her with a strong love, with a mad passion such as he had never felt before. Much as he blamed her, {{thoroughly}} as he despised her for being so venal; yet he blamed, nay, scorned, himself more vehemently in that he had let this plausible knave with his silken words rob from him the only treasure worth his having. <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> not toiled? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> not {{made a name for}} himself? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> not built a throne on which his lady-love might sit and shine before the world? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm as fond of Ralph as ever," [...] Isabel answered. [...] "But <b>why</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> come to Rome?" [...] The {{declaration}} {{was very}} gentle, the question a little sharp.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{it was a}} {{likeness}} only," [...] she said, [...] "why did {{he leave}} us so abruptly, <b>why</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> left this place at a moment's notice to avoid us?" ...|$|R

60|$|But {{then the}} {{happiness}} {{which might have}} accrued to him from this source was dashed by his thoughts of Marian Leslie. <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> thrown himself {{in the way of}} that syren? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> left Mount Pleasant at all? He knew that on his return to Spanish Town his first work would be to visit Shandy Hall; and yet he felt that of all places in the island, Shandy Hall was the last which he ought to visit.|$|E
60|$|Then Hereward rose again, {{and without}} an openly {{insulting}} word, poured forth his scorn and rage upon Osbiorn. <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> not kept {{to the agreement}} which he and Countess Gyda had made with him through Tosti's sons? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> wasted time and men from Dover to Norwich, instead of coming straight into the fens, and marching inland to succor Morcar and Edwin? Osbiorn had ruined the plan, and he only, if it was ruined.|$|E

6000|$|... 'But <b>why</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> bolted? When he {{threatened}} to kill you did he give any reason?' There was too much talk about Harold. It made him angry; so he answered in an offhand way: ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Now, <b>why</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> {{grown so}} tender {{of his men}} of a sudden?" [...] said Hugh to me; for Fulke had no name for mercy to his men. Plunder he gave them, but pity, none.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not wrong}} him at all. <b>Why</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> {{answered}} every offer I {{have made him}} with so much insolence as to {{make it impossible for}} me to put myself into further communion with him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|What perplexed him was {{his recent}} remorse and {{tenderness}} for Miriam. Now {{he was back}} in her atmosphere all that had vanished, and the old feeling of helpless antagonism returned. He surveyed the piled furniture, the economically managed carpet, the unpleasing pictures on the wall. <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> felt remorse? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> entertained this illusion of a helpless woman crying aloud in the pitiless darkness for him? He peered into the unfathomable mysteries of the heart, and ducked back to a smaller issue. Was he feeble? ...|$|E
60|$|A shadow lay dark in {{the chiefs}} lined face. <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> not done a million other things? Why, indeed! He did not answer the irate director.|$|E
60|$|It {{was after}} nine o'clock {{when he left}} the shop. The night was cold and gloomy. He entered the Park by the first gate and walked along under the gaunt trees. He walked through the bleak alleys where they had walked four years before. She seemed to be near him in the darkness. At moments he seemed to feel her voice touch his ear, her hand touch his. He stood still to listen. <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> {{withheld}} life from her? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> sentenced her to death? He felt his moral nature falling to pieces.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now tell me," [...] he continued, [...] "what is {{the matter}} with Morrison, and <b>why</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> sent for me, and, if you will pardon my saying so, why is he here instead of in his own rooms?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Why won't Sam Krupnik {{allow his}} mother to enter his bedroom? <b>Why</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> started calling his toy box The Lab? And why does he carry a Ziplock bag in his pocket at all times? What's the big secret? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pritchard is {{a clever}} man, generally," [...] she remarked, [...] "diabolically clever. <b>Why</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> told you all this, I wonder? <b>He</b> must <b>have</b> known {{that you would}} {{probably}} repeat it to me. Why {{does he want to}} show me his hand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And there, aloof, yet {{persistently}} with her, moving {{wherever she}} moved, was the Will Ladislaw {{who was a}} changed belief exhausted of hope, a detected illusion--no, a living man towards whom there could not yet struggle any wail of regretful pity, from the midst of scorn and indignation and jealous offended pride. The fire of Dorothea's anger was not easily spent, and it flamed out in fitful returns of spurning reproach. <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> come obtruding his life into hers, hers {{that might have been}} whole enough without him? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> brought his cheap regard and his lip-born words to her who had nothing paltry to give in exchange? He knew that he was deluding her--wished, in the very moment of farewell, to make her believe that he gave her the whole price of her heart, and knew that he had spent it half before. <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> not stayed among the crowd of whom she asked nothing--but only prayed that they might be less contemptible? ...|$|E
60|$|But of what avail {{were such}} regrets as these? He must take {{things as they}} were now, and see that, in dealing with them, he {{allowed himself to be}} carried away neither by pride nor cowardice. And if the worst should come to the worst, then let him face it like a man! There was a certain manliness about him which showed itself perhaps as {{strongly}} in his own self-condemnation as in any other part of his conduct at this time. Judging of himself, as though he were standing outside himself and looking on to another man's work, he pointed out to himself his own shortcomings. If it were all to be done again he thought that he could avoid this bump against the rocks on one side, and that terribly shattering blow on the other. There was much that he was ashamed of,-- many a little act which recurred to him vividly in this solitary hour as a thing to be repented of with inner sackcloth and ashes. But never once, not for a moment, did it occur to him that he should repent of the fraud in which his whole life had been passed. No idea ever crossed his mind {{of what might have been}} the result had he lived the life of an honest man. Though he was inquiring into himself as closely as he could, he never even told himself that he had been dishonest. Fraud and dishonesty had been the very principle of his life, and had so become a part of his blood and bones that even in this extremity of his misery he made no question within himself as to his right judgment in regard to them. Not to cheat, not to be a scoundrel, not to live more luxuriously than others by cheating more brilliantly, was a condition of things to which his mind had never turned itself. In that respect he accused himself of no want of judgment. But <b>why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he,</b> so unrighteous himself, not made friends to himself of the Mammon of unrighteousness? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> not conciliated Lord Mayors? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> trod upon all the corns of all his neighbours? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> been insolent at the India Office? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> trusted any man as he had trusted Cohenlupe? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> not stuck to Abchurch Lane instead of going into Parliament? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> called down unnecessary notice on his head by entertaining the Emperor of China? It was too late now, and he must bear it; but these were the things that had ruined him.|$|E
6000|$|I was interested. John Stumpy had intimately that he {{intended}} to have an interview with Duncan Woodward's father, and if this was so, <b>why</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> not taken advantage of the opportunity thus offered? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't?" [...] {{returned}} Mrs. Baxter. [...] "Bless your innocent heart! Why was he so keen to hunt {{me up at}} first, shadowing {{my friends}} and all that, and <b>why</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> dropped it now he knows I'm here, if he didn't know where Spencer was?" ...|$|R
