5|$|Theobald {{called a}} church council at London in June 1160, which dealt partly {{with the issues}} of the papal schism; his health was poor and he had to be taken to the council in a litter. A further cause of {{distress}} to Theobald was <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the ingratitude of Becket, who did not visit the ailing archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{came from}} a privileged Anglo-Irish background, Synge's {{writings}} are mainly concerned with the world of the Roman Catholic peasants of rural Ireland and with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the essential paganism of their world view. Synge developed Hodgkin's disease, a metastatic cancer that was then untreatable. He died several weeks short of his 38th birthday as he was trying to complete his last play, Deirdre of the Sorrows.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{successful}} defense against calls for his removal, Powell continued speaking against <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> violations of constitutional rights. In 1864, he condemned General Order No. 11, an edict of Ulysses S. Grant that barred Jews from the Department of Tennessee, which included regions of Kentucky. In the same speech, he rebuked federal military {{interference with the}} elections in Kentucky. In 1864, he opposed a constitutional amendment aimed at freeing the slaves.|$|E
50|$|On one occasion, while {{relaxing}} by a hotel {{swimming pool}} in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Vassallo's father asked his sons {{to compete against}} some girls that were swimming laps in the pool. The father was impressed with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> and <b>as</b> soon as he returned to Ponce he enrolled them in a local swimming team.|$|R
5000|$|Kuprin {{started writing}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> {{a short story}} in Odessa {{in the autumn of}} 1910. [...] "One of these days I'm going to send Blumenberg a little piece, called The Garnet Bracelet," [...] he {{informed}} friend V.S.Klestov in a letter dated September 29. But the story, getting larger and larger, took three months to be completed.|$|R
50|$|Marmont {{then took}} upon himself a {{political}} role, seeking to halt <b>what</b> <b>he</b> now <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> a pointless prolonging {{of a war}} which France would now assuredly lose. Marmont contacted the Allies and reached a secret agreement with them. As the Allies closed on Montmartre, Marmont—together with marshals Mortier and Moncey—marched to {{a position where they}} were quickly surrounded by Allied troops and then surrendered their forces, as had been agreed.|$|R
5|$|In 2002 Boris Nemtsov, former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia who {{was then}} an elected member of the State Duma {{and leader of the}} Union of Rightist Forces, paid a visit to Bukovsky in Cambridge. He wanted to discuss the {{strategy}} of the Russian opposition. It was imperative, Bukovsky told Nemtsov, that Russian liberals adopt an uncompromising stand toward <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the authoritarian government of President Vladimir Putin.|$|E
5|$|In a {{book titled}} Militarism U.S.A. (1970), Shoup and Donovan {{elaborated}} their criticisms. Shoup said the country was seeking military solutions to issues that could be resolved politically. He accused military leaders of propagating the war for their own career advancement, and accused the veterans group Veterans of Foreign Wars of propagandizing for the armed forces establishment. Shoup blamed the American education system for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> discouraging independent thought and stressing obedience.|$|E
5|$|In the end, King {{was forced}} to impose {{overseas}} conscription after {{the failure of the}} voluntary recruitment campaign, but the war ended soon after and his government survived unscathed. The conscription crisis however, hardened the animosity between King and his naval minister. Macdonald, disillusioned by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the chicanery and ruthlessness of national politics, longed to return to Nova Scotia. After King called an election for June 11, 1945, Macdonald resigned from the federal cabinet.|$|E
60|$|His letters {{throughout}} his foreign travels are more copious than ever, but are chiefly minute descriptions of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> such <b>as</b> would weary the reader {{who does not}} want a guide-book even full of individuality. Yet they cannot be passed by without noticing how he fulfilled the duty of study and endeavour at appreciation which everyone owes to great works of art, instead of turning aside with shallow conceit if he do not enter into them at first sight.|$|R
5000|$|Abe {{is quoted}} as saying [...] "I feel however that Karate {{nowadays}} is centered only on winning competitions and that everybody trains towards this end. This is far from the truth. I believe that the true purpose of Karate lies in daily training with a goal to develop a strong mind and body and furthermore to contribute to society in general." [...] Abe established the JSKA to realize <b>what</b> <b>he</b> himself <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the true Karate purpose.|$|R
25|$|The {{conflict}} between what Bob had become, and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> himself <b>as,</b> {{led him to}} be impulsively inclined to follow the lead set by the more headstrong Terry, who led them recklessly into one scrape after another. Bob usually blamed his drinking, heavy smoking, poor diet and reckless behaviour on Terry, a view Audrey and Thelma only too willingly agreed with. This may have been true in part, but actually Bob needed little persuasion to stay out drinking with Terry or to behave accordingly.|$|R
5|$|Stephen {{was furious}} over <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> {{potentially}} precedent-setting papal interference in his royal authority, and initially {{refused to allow}} Murdac into England. When Theobald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, went to consult with the Pope on the matter against Stephen's wishes, the King refused to allow him back into England either, and seized his estates. Stephen also cut his links to the Cistercian order, and turned instead to the Cluniacs, of which Henry was a member.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Stillman's run was {{a turning}} point. Prior to this battle, Black Hawk had not been {{committed}} to war. Now he determined to avenge <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the treacherous killing of his warriors under a flag of truce. After Stillman's defeat, American leaders like President Jackson and Secretary of War Lewis Cass would not consider a diplomatic solution; they wanted a resounding victory over Black Hawk {{to serve as an}} example to other Native Americans who might consider similar uprisings.|$|E
5|$|The {{theology}} of Huldrych Zwingli {{was based on}} the Bible, taking scripture as the inspired word of God and placing its authority higher than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> human sources such as the ecumenical councils and the church fathers. He also recognised the human element within the inspiration noting the differences in the canonical gospels. Zwinglianism is the Reformed confession based on the Second Helvetic Confession promulgated by Zwingli's successor Heinrich Bullinger in the 1560s.|$|E
5000|$|The Atlantid or North-Atlantid, as {{described}} by Eickstedt and Lundman, is recognised as having a pigmentation between the Nordic and Atlanto-Mediterranid stock of the Mediterranean. While the pigmentation of the eyes is light, the hair in contrast is dark brown. The Atlantid is essentially a [...] "Nordic-Mediterranean" [...] blend, a term appearing {{in the literature of}} Earnest Hooton, but can differ in its exact gradient of pigmentation. Although usually recognised as intermediate between Nordic and Mediterranean, Deniker discussed <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> occasionally <b>as</b> stronger Nordic or Mediterranean gradients.|$|R
50|$|Like his predcessor Jan Laski, he was {{a leader}} of the {{national}} anti-Habsburg party. A conservative, he actively opposed Jews (especially in Sochaczew) and Protestants (issuing an edict against them on January 13, 1557), and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> a <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the rampant apostasy in Poland. He once threatened a conference held by Sigismund II Augustus. He called a Synod in Łowicz in 1556AD and a conference of bishops in Warsaw.On December 7, 1550 in Wawel Cathedral, he crowned Queen Barbara Radziwiłł and on July 30, 1555 performed her wedding there. He also crowned Catherine of Habsburg, Sigismund's second wife.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1970s, Dogançay {{embarked}} on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> then <b>as</b> his secondary project: photographing urban walls {{all over the}} globe. These photographs - which Dogançay called [...] "Walls of the World" [...] - are an archive of our time and the seeds for his paintings, which in and by themselves are also documentary of the era in which we live. The focus of his [...] "encyclopedic" [...] approach was exclusively directed towards the structures, signs, symbols and images humans leave on walls. This was not {{due to lack of}} originality, but because it is here where he found the entire range of the human condition in a single motif, without any cultural, racial, political, geographical, or stylistic, limitations. Dogançay himself got to the heart of his exploration by stating: ...|$|R
5|$|After Fan {{was forced}} to step down from his office, Wang Anshi (1021–1086) became Chancellor of the {{imperial}} court. With the backing of Emperor Shenzong (1067–1085), Wang Anshi severely criticized the educational system and state bureaucracy. Seeking to resolve <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> state corruption and negligence, Wang implemented a series of reforms called the New Policies. These involved land value tax reform, the establishment of several government monopolies, the support of local militias, {{and the creation of}} higher standards for the Imperial examination to make it more practical for men skilled in statecraft to pass.|$|E
5|$|For his {{services}} during the war, he was welcomed back to America {{with a large}} parade down Broadway in New York, along with other honors. Schwarzkopf led a highly publicized homecoming parade in Washington, D.C., on June 8, 1991, where he was greeted by Bush amid thousands of onlookers. His accomplishments were praised in a manner much differently from commanders who returned from the Vietnam and Korean Wars. He became an instant national celebrity {{and the source of}} great curiosity by the general public. He was quick to award praise and medals to the troops, part of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> restoring pride in the U.S. armed forces after the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|From the Goebbels Diaries, {{researchers}} {{learned that}} Riefenstahl had been friendly with Joseph Goebbels {{and his wife}} Magda, attending the opera with them and going to his parties. Riefenstahl maintained that Goebbels was upset when she rejected his advances and was jealous of her influence on Hitler, seeing her as an internal threat. She therefore insisted his diary entries could not be trusted. By later accounts, Goebbels thought highly of Riefenstahl's filmmaking but was angered with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> her overspending on the Nazi-provided filmmaking budgets.|$|E
5000|$|Based {{upon his}} newfound {{understanding}} of the Bible, Thomas was rebaptised (a second and final time) in 1847 and the groups of [...] and individuals who shared his beliefs continued to grow. In 1848 the movement became international when he travelled to England in order to preach <b>what</b> <b>he</b> now <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the true gospel message. Upon his return to America Dr Thomas moved from Richmond, Virginia, to New York City and began to preach there. He {{made a point of}} speaking to the Jewish community because Dr Thomas had come to believe that Christianity did not replace the Law of Moses but rather fulfilled it. He believed that Christians must, though faith and baptism, become the [...] "seed" [...] (or, [...] "descendent") of Abraham.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the words}} of an American scholar, {{notwithstanding}} its efforts in actual resettlement, the issue evaded by the Cardoso government was precisely that of contesting the hitherto ruling mode of agricultural development: concentrated, mechanized, latifundia-friendly commodity production - {{as well as the}} larger injustices produced by it. In his own words, what Cardoso could not stomach about the MST was <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> not <b>as</b> a struggle for land reform, but against the capitalist system as such. Therefore the fact that Cardoso's administration tried to set on its feet various [...] "alternative", tamer social movements which were supposed to pressure for land reform on purely negotiated terms, such as the Movement of Landless Producers (Movimento dos Agricultores Sem Terra, or MAST), organized on a local basis in the São Paulo State, around the trade union central Syndical Social Democracy, or SDS.|$|R
60|$|In truth, Wilding {{was amazed}} at <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> and said <b>as</b> much to Trenchard. So pessimistic had been his outlook that he had almost {{expected}} to find the rebellion snuffed out {{by the time they}} reached Lyme-of-the-King. What had the authorities been about that they had permitted Monmouth to come ashore, or had Vallancey's information been wrong in the matter of the numbers that accompanied the Protestant Champion? Wilding's red coat attracted some attention. In the dusk its colour was almost all that could be discerned of it.|$|R
5|$|Göring spent The Hardest Day at Karinhall {{with two}} of his top fighter pilots, Werner Mölders and Adolf Galland. He was decorating them with the Combined Pilots-Observation Badge in Gold with Diamonds after they had {{achieved}} much success in recent weeks. However, Göring took the opportunity to berate them over bomber losses and in particular, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> <b>as</b> a lack of aggression in the Jagdwaffe. This criticism was not received well by the two men. Göring moved to quickly reconcile with them by ordering their promotion to Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) in command of their respective Geschwader (Wings). Göring felt a younger generation of combat leaders would help motivate the force. They were dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Seattle {{lost in the}} 2-legged 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League quarter finals by an {{aggregate}} score of 7–3 to Santos Laguna. The Sounders advanced to the finals of the Open Cup where they were defeated by Sporting Kansas City after penalty kicks. Schmid was furious over <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> a controversial call that handed Kansas City the victory. The team finished the regular season with a 15–8–11 record {{to make the playoffs}} where they advanced past Real Salt Lake to reach the conference championship series against the Galaxy. The team played defensive and suffered a 3–0 blowout in the first leg. They won on the return leg but lost on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|In his {{writings}} Aflaq had been stridently {{in favor of}} free speech and other human rights and aid for the lower classes. During the Military Committee's gradual take over of power in Syria, Aflaq rallied against <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> {{the establishment of a}} military dictatorship, instead of the democracy for which Aflaq had planned. These ideals were never realized by the governments that used his ideology. Most scholars see the Assad government in Syria and Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq to have only employed Aflaq's ideology as a pretense for dictatorship.|$|E
5000|$|The Gulf Atlantic Diocese origin {{goes back}} to the {{founding}} of the Anglican Alliance, which took place at the third diocesan chapter of the American Anglican Council, in November 2001, having Stephen Jecko, Bishop of Florida, as the main proponent. His main purposes were stated as to enforce <b>what</b> <b>he</b> and others <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> [...] "orthodox Anglican belief" [...] against [...] "liberal innovations" [...] in the Episcopal Church. The Episcopal Diocese of Florida was then one of the main proponents of this claimed orthodoxy among the Episcopalian dioceses.|$|R
60|$|There were so {{many men}} on the ground, however--for just then a third engine dashed up {{to the scene of}} conflagration--that it was {{difficult}} for the excited boy to appreciate fully <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw.</b> <b>He</b> got <b>as</b> close to the engine, however, as the policemen would allow him, and observed that a fire-plug had been already opened, and over it had been placed a canvas cistern of about a yard long by eighteen inches broad, stretched on an iron frame. The cistern was filled with water to overflowing, and the first engine had placed its suction-pipe in it, while {{from the front of the}} engine extended the leathern hose that conveyed the water to the burning house.|$|R
5000|$|Chided by {{associates}} {{who said}} he would write an epitaph and not a newspaper, Clum was inspired to call his new publication The Tombstone Epitaph. Setting a tone followed by several subsequent owners and editors, Clum sang Tombstone's praises when <b>he</b> launched <b>what</b> <b>he</b> initially <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> a mining journal. As mayor of Tombstone and publisher of its Republican paper (the rival Italic Nugget provided the Democratic counterpoint), Clum was among the group of townspeople who supported the Earp brothers as they attempted to enforce {{law and order in}} Tombstone in the early 1880s. Tensions between the factions—the Earps and the [...] "cowboys" [...] -- escalated to a violent showdown near the O.K. Corral in 1881. In an explosion of gunfire, the Earps and their eclectic friend, Doc Holliday, killed three young cowboys—Frank and Tom McClaury and Billy Clanton. Personal, professional and political disagreements found their outlet on that cold October afternoon, producing an event that continues to inspire historical research and debate.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Dunstan became {{well known for}} his {{campaign}} {{against the death penalty}} being imposed on Max Stuart, who was convicted of rape and murder of a small girl. He harried Playford aggressively over the matter, creating an uproar over <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> an unfair process. Playford eventually relented, and appeared shaken thereafter; the event was seen as {{a turning point in the}} LCL's decline, and Labor gained momentum. During Labor's time in opposition, Dunstan was prominent in securing some reforms in Aboriginal rights, and was at the forefront of Labor abandoning the White Australia Policy.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{opposed the}} {{military}} escalation {{in response to}} {{events such as the}} Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs invasion, but his strongest opposition was to U.S. involvement in South Vietnam. His opposition grew in strength after he retired from the military in 1963; he was hostile to both the strategy of the conflict and the excessive influence of corporations and military officials upon foreign policy. His high-profile criticism later spread to include the military industrial complex and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> a pervasive militarism in American culture. Historians consider Shoup's statements opposing the war to be among the most pointed and high-profile leveled by a veteran against the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{continued}} his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy {{and on the}} classification of legitimate authority into three types– rational-legal, traditional and charismatic– of which the rational-legal (through bureaucracy) is the dominant one in the modern world. In these works Weber described <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> society's movement towards rationalisation. Similarly, rationalisation {{could be seen in}} the economy, with the development of highly rational and calculating capitalism. Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors setting the European West apart {{from the rest of the}} world. Rationalisation relied on deep changes in ethics, religion, psychology and culture; changes that first took place in the Western civilisation.|$|E
2500|$|He made it aboard {{safely and}} later commented: [...] "Fortunately {{the men in}} charge were taken up with {{something}} else and did not pay much attention. Besides, it was dark, and so {{they would not have}} seen who was a man and who a woman." [...] From his vantage point in the lifeboat, only [...] away from the sinking ship, he heard the cries of those still aboard and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> described as [...] "extraordinary sounds", seemingly four distinct explosions, when the ship broke up. <b>He</b> described <b>what</b> <b>he</b> heard and <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> Titanic went under: ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Ignatieff, [...] "what Saddam Hussein {{had done}} to the Kurds and the Shia" [...] in Iraq was {{sufficient}} justification for the invasion. His {{support for the war}} began to wane as time passed. [...] "I supported an administration whose intentions I didn't trust," [...] he averred, [...] "believing that the consequences would repay the gamble. Now I realize that intentions do shape consequences." [...] He eventually recanted his support for the war entirely. In a 2007 New York Times Magazine article, he wrote: [...] "The unfolding catastrophe in Iraq has condemned the political judgment of a president, but it has also condemned the judgment of many others, myself included, who as commentators supported the invasion." [...] Ignatieff partly interpreted <b>what</b> <b>he</b> now <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> his particular errors of judgment, by presenting them as typical of academics and intellectuals in general, whom he characterised as [...] "generalizing and interpreting particular facts as instances of some big idea". In politics, by contrast, [...] "Specifics matter more than generalities". Samuel Moyn, Harvard University historian of human rights and humanitarian intervention, asserts that Ignatieff is among those whose who [...] "soiled their reputations" [...] through their defence of the Iraq war, and labelled his later public apology [...] "embarrassingly vacuous." ...|$|R
5000|$|At President Roosevelt's request, he {{accompanied}} U.S. Vice-President Henry A. Wallace on {{a mission}} to Siberia, China, and Mongolia in 1944 for the U.S. Office of War Information. The trip had been arranged by Lauchlin Currie, who recommended to FDR that Lattimore accompany Wallace. During this visit, which overlapped the D-Day landings, Wallace and his delegates stayed 25 days in Siberia and were given a tour of the Soviet Union's Magadan concentration camp at Kolyma. In a travelogue for National Geographic, Lattimore described <b>what</b> little <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> a combination of the Hudson's Bay Company and the Tennessee Valley Authority, remarking on how strong and well-fed the inmates were and ascribing to camp commandant Ivan Nikishov [...] "a trained and sensitive interest in art and music and also a deep sense of civic responsibility". In a letter written to the New Statesman in 1968, Lattimore justified himself by arguing his role had not been one to [...] "snoop on his hosts." [...] (In contrast, camp commander Naftaly Frenkel explained: [...] "We have to squeeze everything out of a prisoner {{in the first three months}} — after that we don't need him anymore." [...] The system of hard labor and minimal or no food reduced most prisoners to helpless [...] "goners" [...] (dokhodyaga, in Russian). Conditions varied depending on the state of the country.) ...|$|R
