25|$|The retinue of a besieged castle usually {{consisted}} {{of only a}} few able-bodied men. If the siege was foreseen, the castle's peacetime complement of three to twenty men could be doubled or tripled. And in an emergency, at least the higher ranks could take refuge in the main tower. A castle was only regarded as conquered when the bergfried had fallen. This could take some weeks. During this time the attacker had to continue to feed and pay his men. Sometimes, therefore, the mercenaries of the besieger just ran away or even turned against their commander, if they had to <b>wait</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> for success.|$|E

25|$|Still {{trailing}} 3–0 {{and having}} only one hit {{to show for}} their outing so far, the New York bats came alive {{in the bottom of}} the sixth against Hurst. After recording the first out, pinch hitter Lee Mazzilli and Mookie Wilson recorded back to back hits and Tim Teufel drew a walk to load the bases. Keith Hernandez singled to drive in Mazzilli and Wilson, and Gary Carter followed with a liner to right that Evans dove to try to catch but could not come up with. Pinch runner Wally Backman, who came in to run for Teufel, scored the tying run but Hernandez, who had to wait and see if the ball was going to be caught by Evans, got a late jump and was thrown out as Evans was able to relay the throw to Spike Owen. Hernandez got into an argument with right field umpire Dale Ford, claiming that his delay in ruling on Evans' play caused him to <b>wait</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> before advancing. With two outs, Hurst faced Darryl Strawberry and retired him.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the 2014 reissue of Harrison's Apple catalogue, for Classic Rock, Paul Trynka {{writes that}} Living in the Material Word [...] "sparkles with many gems", and adds: [...] "but it's the more {{restrained}} tracks – Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Long,</b> Who Can See It – that entrance: gorgeous pop songs, {{all the more}} forceful for their restraint." [...] Writing for PopMatters, Scot Elingburg pairs the song with [...] "Be Here Now" [...] as [...] "would-be hits" [...] from Material World that [...] "offer {{much more than just}} Harrison's Hindu-inspired teachings; they also offer up the chance for larger dialogue within music." [...] Nick DeRiso, co-founder of the music website Something Else!, includes [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] among the highlights of Harrison's solo career on Apple Records, and terms it [...] " [...] masterpiece of coiled anticipation".|$|E
500|$|On the track, California Chrome has {{the ability}} to use {{tactical}} speed at nearly any point in a race. Early in his career, he tended to be slow out of the starting gate; if he had to <b>wait</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> for the start, he sometimes expressed anxiety by rocking from side to side, preventing him from being oriented straight forward when the gate opened. He overcame this problem {{by the end of the}} 2014 season and learned to break quickly. [...] When outside and in the clear, he usually won. He originally did not run well on the inside or in close quarters; two of his worst finishes were in races where he had the number one post position, and his fourth-place performance in the Belmont Stakes was attributed to both his injury at the start and the number two draw. However, as an older horse, he won both a 2016 prep race at Meydan Racecourse and the Pacific Classic from the number one post.|$|E

On March 18, Madonna taped her appearance. While taping [...] "Dolls and Dolls", Madonna recalled {{the first time she}} made her way on the set, the studio audience [...] "cheered so hard" [...] that she had to make her entrance all over again. [...] "I had to <b>wait</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to say my first line, so we had to do it over." [...] Madonna's role in the show made it her episodic television series debut. Her decision to do the show was due to her being a [...] "big fan". In an interview with the entertainment news program Access Hollywood, the singer revealed that her manager gave her tapes of the show to watch. She liked the show and called it [...] "hysterical" [...] with [...] "really good writing". She most enjoyed actress Megan Mullally's character Karen, and said she would do the show if her scenes were with her.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the 2006 reissue of Living in the Material World for Q magazine, Tom Doyle {{included}} {{it among}} the album's best three tracks and wrote: [...] "the introspective moods of The Light That Has Lighted The World and Who Can See It, with their ornate instrumentation and weepy vocals, are lovely things." [...] Former Mojo editor Mat Snow describes Material World as [...] "a treat for the ears" [...] and, while conceding Harrison's limitations as a singer compared with Lennon and McCartney, he writes that Harrison [...] "worked hard to ensure the choruses of... 'Who Can See It' caught the ear with their deep and delicious emotion". In his review of the 2014 reissue of Harrison's Apple catalogue, for Classic Rock, Paul Trynka refers to Material Word as an album that [...] "sparkles with many gems"; of these, he adds, [...] "it's the more restrained tracks – Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Long,</b> Who Can See It – that entrance: gorgeous pop songs, all the more forceful for their restraint." [...] New Zealand Herald journalist Graham Reid writes of Harrison [...] "sound battered by recent events and the Beatle legacy" [...] on [...] "Who Can See It", yet he cites the song as a [...] "standout" [...] on an album that [...] "can be very moving".|$|E
2500|$|The show's pilot {{episode is}} told almost entirely in retroversions to three {{different}} time frames. According to Nick Wauters, the show's creator, later episodes would use flashbacks more {{to develop the}} characters. [...] "There will be big reveals and big clues in each episode," [...] he said, promising that viewers {{would not have to}} <b>wait</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> for answers to questions raised. After the pilot aired, he and executive producer Steve Stark answered some viewer questions on their Twitter feeds, one being the fate of the plane used in the assassination attempt, which ended up disappearing through a portal before it could crash. The characters also have Twitter feeds, and one had a blog, truthseeker5314.com, which would reveal additional information. The last two episodes before and all episodes following the show's hiatus no longer featured flashbacks. Cast member Blair Underwood said regarding the removal of the flashbacks, [...] "We had been jumping around a lot and doing flashbacks and that was confusing to people," [...] and [...] "So when we come back, that device is done with! We are now telling the story straight through so people can track it and follow it easier." ...|$|E
