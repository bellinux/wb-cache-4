5|$|Several {{additional}} performers {{were selected}} over this fifty contestant limit; one being Briony, {{who had been}} rejected initially due to nerves hampering her performance, but who returned for a second chance and was allowed in by Ian. A further four, whom the panel had rejected, <b>were</b> <b>contacted</b> by Lloyd Webber himself as he personally believed them to be potential Marias.|$|E
5|$|In {{the scenes}} where the Sherpas were speaking, the show staff {{went to great}} lengths to find translations. Originally, the {{producers}} of the film adaption of the book Into Thin Air <b>were</b> <b>contacted</b> to help. The film producers were shocked at the trouble the Simpsons staff were going to, and replied that they had simply made up translations in the film. The staff then had to consult various experts by telephone.|$|E
5|$|Canada's Wonderland's first {{interactive}} dark {{ride was}} Scooby-Doo's Haunted Mansion (renamed Boo Blasters on Boo Hill after Cedar Fair's {{purchase of the}} park), which opened in 2000. It was designed by Sally Corporation and relies entirely on physical sets and theming rather than projected animations, and uses basic, moving props. About four years later, park management began discussing {{the addition of a}} new attraction inside Wonder Mountain. The technology available at the time meant the cost of building a more advanced dark ride was too expensive for a regional amusement park. In 2011, as technology improved and the costs decreased, the park started planning a second interactive dark ride. Several companies <b>were</b> <b>contacted</b> to design the audio-visual portion of the future ride; park management chose Triotech to do so.|$|E

5|$|While Cipriano {{worked on}} the piece, he and his editors, Jonathan Neumann and Pulitzer Prize winner Robert Rosenthal, <b>were</b> <b>contacted</b> by Tierney. Tierney accused Ralph Cipriano of using {{inaccurate}} facts, trespassing and creating a protest at the Archdiocese's vacation home in Ventnor City, New Jersey, all of which Cipriano denies. Cipriano says that Tierney indicated to {{him that it was}} the Archdiocese that had gotten him removed from the religion reporter position, a position Cipriano says he thought he left on his own. Also according to Cipriano, Tierney indicated that if Cipriano was involved in any story about the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, Tierney would start a public relations campaign to ruin Cipriano and The Philadelphia Inquirer, a charge that Tierney denies.|$|E
5|$|After {{playing for}} more than 16 hours per week, the group <b>were</b> <b>contacted</b> by Allan Williams, who wanted {{them to go to}} Hamburg. Derry and the Seniors were {{successful}} there, and Williams wanted an additional group. As Storm and the group were committed to Butlins, they turned Williams' offer down (as did Gerry and the Pacemakers) so Williams sent the Beatles to Hamburg instead. After the summer season ended in early October 1960, Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day alternating with The Beatles. Storm and The Hurricanes were later presented with a special certificate by Bruno Koschmider (the owner of the Kaiserkeller) for their performances.|$|E
5|$|Although 1 ATF {{was well}} placed {{to deny the}} communists the use of its AO, it was {{increasingly}} obvious {{that there was little}} role for the SAS. Indeed, the heavy presence of Viet Cong prevented them from operating normally, and the first attempt to insert a patrol was called off due to the presence of hostile forces {{in the vicinity of the}} landing zone; two Viet Cong were subsequently killed and the patrol was extracted after only 30 minutes. A second attempt lasted only fifteen minutes longer, and they were also extracted following a brief contact. Finally, two patrols were joined together in an effort to provide more protection, and on 29 January they patrolled out from 7 RAR battalion headquarters. After only 30 minutes the Australians encountered a small party of Viet Cong; however, they tried again two hours later but were detected. The following day they tried for a third time and <b>were</b> <b>contacted.</b> Unable to operate effectively, the SAS patrols were withdrawn and returned to Nui Dat on 1 February.|$|E

5|$|News of {{the rescue}} was {{released}} to the public on February 2. The feat was celebrated by MacArthur's soldiers, Allied correspondents, and the American public, as the raid had touched an emotional chord among Americans concerned about the fate of the defenders of Bataan and Corregidor. Family members of the POWs <b>were</b> <b>contacted</b> by telegram to inform them {{of the rescue}}. News of the raid was broadcast on numerous radio outlets and newspaper front pages. The Rangers and POWs were interviewed to describe the conditions of the camp, as well as the events of the raid. The enthusiasm over the raid was later overshadowed by other Pacific events, including the Battle for Iwo Jima and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The raid was soon followed by additional successful raids, such as the raid of Santo Tomas Civilian Internment Camp on February3, the raid of Bilibid Prison on February4, and the raid at Los Baños on February23.|$|E
5|$|For the English {{winter of}} 1930–31, Lee took on {{positions}} at both St. Andrew's College and Rhodes University, both in Grahamstown in South Africa. The MCC were touring that winter, and suffered heavily with injuries and illness. No fewer than seven players were missing at various stages, and the England captain, Percy Chapman, requested that Lee be excused from his coaching duties {{to join up}} with the touring party. Having believed he had secured this permission, {{he made his first}} appearance against Natal, scoring 14 runs in his only innings. He played in three further tour matches, twice making scores in the forties, but not reaching a half-century during the tour. His only Test appearance came in the fourth Test between England and South Africa. Lee opened the innings alongside Bob Wyatt and scored 18 and 1 in his two innings of the match, which finished a draw. During the match, the MCC <b>were</b> <b>contacted</b> by one of the schools he had been coaching at, which claimed that Lee had broken his contract by leaving without permission. Lee argued vehemently against these claims, citing the fact that the sportsmaster at the school had told Jack White that he had permission to leave, but the MCC were unmoved, and refused to issue Lee his England cap and blazer until he had apologised. Lee felt he had no need to apologise, and never received either cap or blazer, though small compensation {{came in the form of}} an England touring tie, which Jack Hobbs gave to him.|$|E

25|$|When in 1965 the Charvet heirs {{sought to}} sell the firm, they <b>were</b> <b>contacted</b> by an American buyer. The French government, knowing Charvet had been {{for a long time}} General de Gaulle's shirtmaker, grew concerned.

In November, the band supported Job for a Cowboy on a tour in Europe. The Kingdom Come EP was released independently in October 2011.|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{clinical trial}} {{in which the}} serum anti-phenolic glycolipid (anti-PGL- 1) antibodies were analysed in household contacts (HHC) of patients with leprosy as an adjunct early leprosy diagnostic marker was conducted. The families of 83 patients underwent clinical examination and serum anti-PGL 1 measurement using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of 320 HHC, 98 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of lepromatous leprosy (LL), 80 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of borderline lepromatous (BL), 28 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of borderline (BB) leprosy, 54 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of borderline tuberculoid (BT), 40 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of tuberculoid (TT) and 20 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of indeterminate (I) leprosy. Consanguinity with the patients was determined for 232 (72. 5 %) HHC. Of those 232 contacts, 183 had linear consanguinity. Forty-nine HHC had collateral consanguinity. Fifty-eight contacts (18. 1 %) tested positive for anti-PGL 1 antibodies. The number of seropositive contacts based on the clinical forms of the index case was 17 (29. 3 %) for LL, 15 (25. 9 %) for BL, one (1. 7 %) for BB, 14 (24. 1 %) for BT, three (5. 2 %) for TT and eight (13. 7 %) for I. At the one year follow-up, two (3. 4 %) of these seropositive contacts had developed BT leprosy. The {{results of the present}} study indicate that the serum anti-PGL- 1 IgM antibody may be useful for evaluating antigen exposure and as a tool for an early leprosy diagnosis in HHC.

25|$|According to {{an article}} {{published}} in American Psychologist in 2007, the original story of Genovese's murder was exaggerated by the media. Specifically, there were not 38 eyewitnesses, the police <b>were</b> <b>contacted</b> at least once during the attack, and many of the bystanders who overheard the attack could not actually see the event. The authors of the article suggest that the story continues to be misrepresented in social psychology textbooks because it functions as a parable and serves as a dramatic example for students.|$|E
