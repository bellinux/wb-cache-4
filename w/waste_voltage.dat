40|$|Like {{any other}} {{industry}}, apparel industry too tries to minimize their product cost by reducing production <b>waste.</b> <b>Voltage</b> fluctuations and power failures {{are two of}} the most concerning factors affecting the production. Even though these voltage fluctuations & voltage failures affect different kinds of looms at different degrees, its effect on the weaving looms which manufacture elastics is severe. As a narrow fabric elastic manufacturer it has been faced difficulties in minimizing the number of joints in the fabric (tape), which is a direct consequence of the same. There are no research papers or commercial devices found to minimize the fabric joints in case of voltage dips or short period voltage interruptions. The significance of the proposed system is its ability to sense the voltage dips/sags or interruption with the fast AC to DC converter and take decisions intelligently to suit the situation prevailed, e. g. whether to let the machine run or stop depending on the time elapsed. The brain of the controller 0 " isa ' [...] peripheral interface controller (PIC) and is programmed as assembly language. MPLAB Software compiles assembly to hex codes and the required sequence of signals is generated from PIC. This signal is sent to control unit of the loom via the DPDT relay to hold down the control. switches to perform the controller operations of the looms within a 3 second period during the short-time voltage variations such as interruptions and dips. Numerous other applications are possible with this system in other industries too. One is in the rubber extruder and another is mixing mill in manufacturing rubber tires...|$|E
40|$|For neural cell {{stimulation}} {{there is}} a need of a high supply voltage up to 18 V. However because the stimulation is not every time the same, sometimes there is only a need for lower supply voltage. The supply voltage should be variable so that loss of energy due to the <b>wasted</b> supply <b>voltage</b> headroom is minimized. In {{order to be able to}} cover this stimulation voltage range the converter needs to convert the 3. 3 V battery voltage up to a variable output voltage with a maximum voltage of 18 V. This needs to be done with a power efficiency of at least 80 %. Also the converter must not be sensitive to input/output variations and temperature changes. In this work the boost converter topology is selected and is designed with a new current sensing technique. Also the controller circuit is designed so that the converter works always in the discontinuous current mode. For this controller circuit an efficient capacitor based voltage measurement circuit is designed. Everything is designed at transistor level to be implemented in the 0, 35 Ã¬m High Voltage I 3 T 25 technology of On Semiconductor. The working principle is illustrated with circuit simulations.

40|$|A circuit {{topology}} {{has been}} designed to guarantee the output of intrinsically safe power for the operation of electrical devices in a hazardous environment. This design uses a MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor) as a switch to connect and disconnect power to a load. A test current is provided through a separate path to the load for monitoring by a comparator against a preset threshold level. The circuit is configured so that the test current will detect a fault in the load and open the switch before the main current can respond. The main current passes through the switch and then an inductor. When a fault occurs in the load, the current through the inductor cannot change immediately, but the voltage drops immediately to safe levels. The comparator detects this drop and opens the switch before the current in the inductor has a chance to respond. This circuit protects both the current and voltage from exceeding safe levels. Typically, this type of protection is accomplished by a fuse or a circuit breaker, but in order for a fuse or a circuit breaker to blow or trip, the current must exceed the safe levels momentarily, which may be just enough time to ignite anything in a hazardous environment. To prevent this from happening, a fuse is typically current-limited by the addition of the resistor to keep the current within safe levels while the fuse reacts. The use of a resistor is acceptable for non-battery applications where the <b>wasted</b> energy and <b>voltage</b> drop across the resistor can be tolerated. The use of the switch and inductor minimizes the wasted energy. For example, a circuit runs from a 3. 6 -V battery that must be current-limited to 200 mA. If the circuit normally draws 10 mA, then an 18 -ohm resistor would drop 180 mV during normal operation, while a typical switch (0. 02 ohm) and inductor (0. 97 ohm) would only drop 9. 9 mV. From a power standpoint, the current-limiting resistor protection circuit wastes about 18 times more power than the switch and the inductor configuration. In the fault condition, both the resistor and the inductor react immediately. The resistor reacts by allowing more current to flow and dropping the voltage. Initially, the inductor reacts by dropping the voltage, and then by not allowing the current to change. When the comparator detects the drop in voltage, it opens the switch, thus preventing any further current flow. The inductor alone is not sufficient protection, because after the voltage drop has settled, the inductor would then allow the current to change, in this example, the current would be 3. 7 A. In the fault condition, the resistor is flowing 200 mA until the fuse blows (anywhere from 1 ms to 100 s), while the switch and inductor combination is flowing about 2 A test current while monitoring for the fault to be corrected. Finally, as an additional safety feature, the circuit can be configured to hold the switch opened until both the load and source are disconnected...|$|R
