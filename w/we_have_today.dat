25|$|Rashi wrote {{commentaries on}} all the books of Tanakh except Chronicles I & II. Scholars believe that the {{commentary}} which appears under Rashi's name in those books was compiled by the students of Rabbi Saadiah of the Rhine, who incorporated material from Rashi's yeshiva.

25|$|Two {{subspecies}} of F. vesca were identified: F. sylvestris alba and F. sylvestris semperflorens. The {{introduction of}} F. virginiana from Eastern North America to Europe in the 17th century {{is an important}} part of history because this species gave rise to the modern strawberry. The new species gradually spread through the continent and did not become completely appreciated until the end of the 18th century. When a French excursion journeyed to Chile in 1712, it introduced the strawberry plant with female flowers that resulted in the common strawberry that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
25|$|The tittle (dot) on {{the letter}} {{i of the}} Latin {{alphabet}} originated as a diacritic to clearly distinguish i from the minims (downstrokes) of adjacent letters. It {{first appeared in the}} 11th century in the sequence ii (as in ingeníí), then spread to i adjacent to m, n, u, and finally to all lowercase is. The j, originally a variant of i, inherited the tittle. The shape of the diacritic developed from initially resembling today's acute accent to a long flourish by the 15th century. With the advent of Roman type it was reduced to the round dot <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Jewish scriptures were {{translated}} into Greek {{in the two}} centuries immediately before the birth of Christ. The Greek version of these books is called the Septuagint. The Jewish Bible in Hebrew is called the Masoretic text (meaning passing down after a Hebrew word Masorah; for Jewish scholars and rabbis curated and commented on the text). The Greek (Septuagint) version of Ezekiel differs considerably from the Hebrew (Masoretic) version – it is shorter and possibly represents an early interpretation of the book <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>today</b> (according to the masoretic tradition) – while other ancient manuscript fragments differ from both.|$|E

25|$|At {{one time}} it was a common belief that fairy {{folklore}} evolved from folk memories of a prehistoric race. It was suggested that newcomers drove out the original inhabitants, and the memories of this defeated, hidden people developed into the fairy beliefs <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>today.</b> Proponents of this theory claimed to find support in the tradition of cold iron as a charm against the fairies, which was viewed as a cultural memory of invaders with iron weapons displacing inhabitants who had only flint and were therefore easily defeated. Some 19th-century archaeologists thought they had found underground rooms in the Orkney islands resembling the Elfland in Childe Rowland. However the idea of a fallen vanquished race in hiding has fallen out of favour with scholars.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of Todd County's {{original}} European settlement, the forested areas of the Long Prairie River watershed were substantial. The Marshner Pre-European Settlement Vegetation Map shows that 65.5% of the area was covered {{by a variety of}} hardwoods and pines. The first commercial logging began about 1866 and continued through the mid-1890s. Eagle, Moran, Fish Trap, and Turtle creeks were all large enough, at that time, to power mills and float logs to the Long Prairie River where they joined other log rafts {{on their way to the}} Crow Wing and to the Mississippi. As most of the trees were harvested, the sandy soils in these areas were left unprotected, increasing erosion, and gradually filling the streams with sediment. The result is the very much smaller streams <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>today.</b> The 1990s Land Use map shows only 21% of the area forested, much restored due to reforestation plantings, and over 60% of the area as cultivated, hay, pasture or grassland.|$|E
25|$|When {{we think}} of {{interactivity}} and its meaning, we assume {{that it is only}} prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does not allow us to see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming. Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>today</b> and {{there is no longer a}} limit to what we can do with our creativity.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} an {{automated}} defibrillator was first conceived by Dr. Arch Diack, a surgeon in Portland, Oregon. His prototype, literally assembled in a basement, utilized a unique defibrillatory pathway – tongue to chest. There was a breath detector {{that was a}} safeguard to prevent shocking breathing persons. The electrode was essentially a rate counter, far cruder than today’s sophisticated VF detectors. The production model weighed 35pounds and gave verbal instructions. It was an idea ahead of its time. Most people viewed it as a curiosity. By the late 1980s, however, other manufacturers entered the field leading to the automated external defibrillators (AEDs) <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>today.</b> Current AEDs, like regular defibrillators, use electrode pads attached to the chest. AEDs are programmed to guide the operator (with a series of voice prompts) through the procedure. The pads once attached automatically detect the type of heart rhythm and if VF is present the AED instructs the operator to press a button (usually flashing red) to shock the patient. From EMT defibrillation with AEDs, there was a natural and logical progression to first responder defibrillation (AEDs used by police or security personnel), next widespread Public Access Defibrillation (AEDs used by lay persons in public locations such as airports, schools, exercise facilities, etc.) and finally home AED including the opportunity to purchase AEDs over the counter without a prescription.|$|E
