50|$|Lees {{was born}} in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester. Fellow Twisted <b>Wheel</b> <b>rocker</b> Jonny Brown was {{originally}} in a band called 'The Children' with Rick; however, the band failed and the two school friends decided to form another band called Twisted Wheel. After meeting at Leeds Festival one year, the band was completed as they found their drummer Adam Clarke.|$|E
50|$|A few {{aggressive}} skate frames (most {{notably the}} Rollerblade Switch Frame) are {{designed so that}} there are two big outer wheels, and two small inner <b>wheels,</b> <b>rockered</b> so that they all touch the ground. This gives the benefits of a flat setup, while giving the rollerblader more space to grind on the H-block between the wheels.|$|R
25|$|Nearly all mice {{now have}} an {{integrated}} input primarily intended for scrolling on top, usually a single-axis digital <b>wheel</b> or <b>rocker</b> switch which can also be depressed {{to act as a}} third button. Though less common, many mice instead have two-axis inputs such as a tiltable wheel, trackball, or touchpad.|$|R
5000|$|Some artistic skaters use inline skates. Skates {{designed}} for inline artistic skating have leather boots (as ice and quad figure skates do), and usually have <b>rockered</b> <b>wheels</b> and a toe stop or toe [...] "pic". <b>Rockered</b> <b>wheels</b> (wheels which are arranged at different heights {{so that the}} baseline of the wheels forms a curve instead of a flat line) are more suitable to skate the curved [...] "edges" [...] which are typical of artistic skating than un-rockered inline wheels are.|$|R
50|$|For 1960, the Park Lane saw a minor styling update {{distinguished}} by new taillamps, rear fender skirts, 5 chrome accent bars {{ahead of the}} rear <b>wheel</b> openings, wide <b>rocker</b> panel moldings, {{and the addition of}} a padded dashboard.|$|R
25|$|American Motors was {{evaluating}} the Pacer as compact personal luxury model with the Crown Pacer concept {{car that was}} first shown at the 1978 Chicago Auto Show. Finished in all white with a white interior, the Crown Pacer included numerous features such as a large inbuilt sun roof, real wire <b>wheels,</b> full <b>rocker</b> panel bright trim, as well as color matched integrated flexible front and fear fascia and bumper covers with black rubber guards and impact (nerf) strips.|$|R
25|$|The revised GS debuted at Monterey Car Week in August 2015. Changes {{include a}} GS 200t variant {{equipped}} with the 2.0-liter 8AR-FTS turbocharged engine to replace the GS 250, and an update to the 3.5-liter V6, now upgraded to 2GR-FKS specification. that uses the Atkinson cycle and features founded on the previous 2GR-FSE motor. Additional changes include revised exterior elements (including front and rear trim, exterior lighting, <b>wheels,</b> and <b>rocker</b> panels), new active safety features, and a revised infotainment system.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, Ford {{offered the}} Highway Pilot Speed Control Option, with {{steering}} <b>wheel</b> pad mounted <b>rocker</b> switches, on its Thunderbird. Uniquely, the Thunderbird also lightly applied {{the brakes and}} illuminated the stop lamps when the Retard was continuously depressed with the cruise control on, but not engaged.|$|R
40|$|The Rocker-Bogie Mobility {{system was}} {{designed}} to be used at slow speeds. It is capable of overcoming obstacles that are on the order of the size of a wheel. However, when surmounting a sizable obstacle, the vehicles motion effectively stops while the front wheel climbs the obstacle. When operating at low speed (greater than 10 cm/second), dynamic shocks are minimized when this happens. For many future planetary missions, rovers will have to operate at human level speeds (~ 1 m/second). Shocks resulting from the impact of the front wheel against an obstacle could damage the payload or the vehicle. This paper describes a method of driving a rocker-bogie vehicle so that it can effectively step over most obstacles rather than impacting and climbing over them. Most of the benefits of this method can be achieved without any mechanical modification to existing designs – only a change in control strategy. Some mechanical changes are suggested to gather the maximum benefit and to greatly increase the effective operational speed of future rovers. The Rocker-Bogie System: One of the major shortcomings of current planetary rovers is that they are slow. In {{order to be able to}} overcome significantly rough terrain (i. e., obstacles more than a few percent of wheel radius) without significant risk of flipping the vehicle or damaging the suspension, these robots move slowly and climb over the obstacles by having wheels lift each piece of the suspension over the obstacle one portion at a time. NASA’s currently favored design, the rocker-bogie [1, 2], uses a two <b>wheeled</b> <b>rocker</b> arm on a passive pivot attached to a main bogie that is connected differentially to the main bogie on the other side (see Figure 1). The body of the rover is attache...|$|R
50|$|All models used a transversely-mounted {{four-cylinder engine}} driving the front wheels. All four wheels are {{pushed to the}} corners of the body to improve handling. The styling of the car, like that of the Volkswagen New Beetle, is a retro design that is {{deliberately}} reminiscent of the original Mini. The retro styling retains other classic Mini touches such as contrasting roof colours, optional bonnet stripes, optional rally lights, and black trim around the <b>wheel</b> arches and <b>rocker</b> panels that mimic the wide wheel flares found on many classic Minis.|$|R
2500|$|The Gremlin X {{version was}} added in 1976 as a {{separate}} model rather than an optional package. The X models included VAM's larger [...] I6, a 6000 RPM tachometer, sports steering wheel, 7.00X14 radial tires, Hurst linkage with T-shaped shifter for the manual transmissions, courtesy lights on parcel shelf, heater, power steering, tinted windshield, bright molding package (drip rails, <b>wheel</b> arches, <b>rocker</b> panels), <b>wheel</b> trim rings, and an in-house two-color rally stripe that was unique to the Mexican market. The 1976 VAM Gremlin X also came with an interior featuring the [...] "Navajo" [...] pattern cloth upholstery that was optional on AMC's Pacer DL models built for the Canadian and U.S. markets. The base VAM Gremlin now also included luxurious seating with a center armrest that was never available in the U.S. models. Due to the debut of the Gremlin X and its sportier focus, the base Gremlin switched back to the standard column-mounted shifters for either transmission, but keeping the individual seat configuration. Both versions included revised gauges with a 160km/h speedometer, new side panel designs, longer folding sun visors, and a styled round dome light lens. Sales for 1976 increased to over 6,000 units.|$|R
50|$|Most {{freestyle}} slalomers use inline skates {{although some}} use quad skates. Those who use inline skates {{tend to use}} a full <b>rocker</b> <b>wheel</b> configuration, however there are variations of the rockers which are used. Some skaters prefer to use a 'full hi-lo' rocker, which means the largest wheel is the second in from the back, with the smallest at the front. A short frame (230-245 mm)is used {{to give them the}} maximum possible maneuverability. The inline skates are very tight with a very strong cuff, to give sustaining ankle support. Popular skates used to include the FSK skate range by Salomon, now unavailable, the market is now dominated arguably by Seba skates, formed by a world class slalom skater, and other brands such as Powerslide and RollerBlade.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} analysis {{mechanism of}} multi-wheel corresponding driven and steady driven of lunar rover with 6 <b>wheels</b> and <b>rocker</b> bogie {{based on its}} characterization of mechanical configuration and based on principle of traditional multi-wheels driven, using the CAN bus, we construct a distributed motion control network as a kernel of whole control system of rover. The bus network motion control unit adopts uniform interface, uniform hardware body and this unit has characteristics of modularization, easy to reconfiguration and high integration. The distributed motion control system based on this unit can decrease the complexity of wiring of robot and improve flexibility of programming of main computer of rover. Using wheel operation modes, motion performance of rover is analyzed in 3 different driving modes on smooth and rough terrain. According to the mechanical configuration of rover, operations modes of wheel and principle of speed matching of wheels, we presents a adaptive coordinated control algorithm of multi-wheels independent driven on rough terrain. Through the experiments of obstacle overcoming, climbing, moving on cross-hill in soft soil and spot turning, it shows this rover has good transportation performance, the distributed motion control system base CAN bus has a good performance and high reliability and the adaptive coordinated control algorithm is validity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- A {{system that}} enables {{continuous}} slip compensation for a Mars rover has been designed, implemented, and field-tested. This system {{is composed of}} several components that allow the rover to accurately and continuously follow a designated path, compensate for slippage, and reach intended goals in high-slip environments. These components include: visual odometry, vehicle kinematics, a Kalman filter pose estimator, and a slip compensation/path follower. Visual odometry tracks distinctive scene features in stereo imagery to estimate rover motion between successively acquired stereo image pairs. The vehicle kinematics for a rocker-bogie suspension system estimates motion by measuring <b>wheel</b> rates, and <b>rocker,</b> bogie, and steering angles. The Kalman filter merges data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and visual odometry.

5000|$|The {{third year}} of production, 1969, brought several new {{additions}} to the Cougar lineup. A convertible model was now available in either standard and XR-7 trim. The grille switched from vertical bars to horizontal bars. Tail lights still spanned the entire rear {{of the car and}} retained vertical chrome dividers, but were now concave rather than convex. Body sides now featured a prominent line that swept downward from the nose to just ahead of the rear wheel wells. A new performance package appeared. The GT, XR-7G, and 7.0-L GT-E were discontinued, but the 390 and 428 V8s remained. The 302 engines were dropped, except for the [...] "Boss" [...] version, available only with the Eliminator package. The new standard Cougar engine was a 250-horsepower 351 Windsor. A [...] 351 Windsor V8 was also added to the engine lineup. The Eliminator performance package appeared for the first time. A 351 cuin L four-barrel Windsor V8 was standard, with the 390 four-barrel V8, the 428CJ, and the Boss 302 available as options. The Eliminator also featured a blacked-out grille, special side stripes, front and rear spoilers, an optional Ram Air induction system, a full gauge package including tachometer, upgraded [...] "Decor" [...] interior trim, special high-back bucket seats, rally wheels, raised white letter tires, and a performance-tuned suspension and handling package. It also came in vibrant colors, such as white, bright blue metallic, competition orange, and bright yellow. Only two Cougars were produced with the Boss 429 V8 as factory drag cars for [...] "Fast Eddie" [...] Schartman and [...] "Dyno" [...] Don Nicholson. A 1969-only package was the Cougar Sports Special that included unique pin striping, [...] "turbine" [...] style <b>wheel</b> covers, and <b>rocker</b> panel moldings with simulated side scoops. Décor interior and performance suspension were available for the Sports Special, as were any of the optional Cougar engines, other than the Boss 302. No badges or decals denoted the Sports Special option on either the interior or exterior.|$|R
