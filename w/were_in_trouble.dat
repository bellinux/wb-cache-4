5|$|Toshack had a {{moderately}} successful Third Test, in which England elected to bat first. England lost two early wickets, and when Toshack came on, Jack Crapp repeatedly defended {{a sequence of}} deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. As the hosts <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> they played cautiously and Toshack's first five overs were all maidens. Crapp then hit Toshack to Sid Barnes at short leg, but the catch was dropped. However, Crapp did not capitalise as Toshack conceded only eight runs in a sequence of eight overs.|$|E
5|$|Victoria then batted. Illingworth made 22 of his team's 144 {{after they}} fell to 6/100. They {{were forced to}} follow on, having conceded a 248-run lead in their first innings. Victoria {{had to try to}} stave off defeat and they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> when Illingworth came in to bat, partnering captain Bill Lawry after wicket-keeper Ray Jordon was out with the score at 6/193. Illingworth scored his highest {{first-class}} score of 47, putting on a partnership of 87 runs with Lawry before he was dismissed with the score at 7/280. Victoria were 8/286 at the end of play, just 38 runs ahead, as the match ended in a draw.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{batted in}} a {{restrained}} manner, while Bradman attacked. The Australian captain was 31 and his deputy 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 1/63. Bradman did {{the majority of}} the scoring during the closing stages of the afternoon, adding 31 in a partnership of 50. On the third morning, play resumed in hot and humid conditions. In the second over delivered by Dick Pollard, the bowler made the second ball lift unexpectedly. Hassett was unable {{to get out of the}} way and edged the ball to Jack Crapp for 13. Bradman was out in the same over and Australia <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> at 3/68, but they recovered after a middle-order counterattack took them to 458 early on the fourth day. Hassett then caught Bedser during England's second innings.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opening}} match of the 1931–32 season, which was against Queensland, New South Wales <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> Gilbert famously knocked the bat out of Donald Bradman's hand, before {{removing}} {{him for a}} duck. Gilbert cut down the New South Wales top order with a spell of 3/12 and forced Alan Kippax to retire hurt after hitting him in the upper body. Fingleton {{was going to be}} twelfth man before Archie Jackson—who was to die of tuberculosis just over a year later—collapsed just {{before the start of the}} match. Undeterred, Stan McCabe came in and counterattacked; Fingleton assisted him with a stubborn 93 and featured in a 195-run fourth wicket partnership. New South Wales reached 432 and won by an innings.|$|E
5|$|On {{the return}} to Australia, the team stopped on the Indian subcontinent to play their first Tests on Pakistani and Indian soil respectively. In a short tour, the four Tests were the only fixtures. Harvey failed to pass double figures in a one off Test against Pakistan in Karachi, the first between the two countries. Moving to India, he scored 140 in the drawn Second Test in Bombay, scoring runs all around the ground. Due to {{injuries}} and illness {{to many of the}} bowlers, the Australians were unable to dismiss their hosts twice. In the final match, Australia <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> after taking a 41-run first innings lead. In the second innings they were struggling on a sticky wicket caused by flooding, but made 69 out of 9/189 in the low-scoring Third Test in Calcutta to help Australia to a 2–0 series win. He ended with 253 runs at 63.25 for the series. His performances on the subcontinent were marked by his aggressive footwork in moving down to meet the pitch of the ball. After seven months away, the Australians returned home.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{reassembled}} at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia replaced Brownwho {{had scored}} 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings with the all rounder Loxton, {{who had made}} an unbeaten 47 against Surrey and 159 not out against Gloucestershire. England made 363 after electing to bat. On the second day, Australia <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> when Hassett came in at 2/13. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before the latter was beaten in flight by Jack Young. Aiming to break Young's restrictive leg side bowling, Hassett charged down the pitch and lofted a drive for four. However, in attempting a similar lofted drive over cover, he mishit the ball, which was caught by Cyril Washbrook at wide mid-off. This left Australia at 3/82 and they eventually made 221 to avoid the follow on by eight runs.|$|E

5|$|In reply, Australia <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> at 7/208 when Johnston came to {{the crease}} to join Lindwall, with five more runs needed to avoid the follow on. As Sid Barnes was unable to bat due to injury, Australia were {{effectively}} eight wickets down. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow-on before Bedser removed both. Johnston was reprieved in his brief innings when he edged a delivery from Dick Pollard {{in the direction of}} Edrich at first slip, but Evans dived across, trying to catch the ball at full stretch in his right hand. The wicket-keeper could not hold onto the ball, and the resulting deflection further to the right wrong-footed Edrich, who was moving the other way, and it went past him. From second slip, Jack Crapp dived left behind Edrich but the ball landed a few centimetres beyond his fingers. However, in the next over Bedser, Johnston edged the ball in the same manner and Crapp caught the ball easily. Johnston was out for three as Australia ended with 221 to narrowly avoid the follow on by eight runs. He was wicketless in the second innings, taking 0/34 as England declared at 3/174 and set Australia 317 for victory on the last day after the fourth day was completely washed out by rain. The match ended in a draw with Australia at 1/92, after many rain interruptions.|$|E
5|$|Davidson {{returned}} to a full workload as he helped Australia take a 1–0 series lead in the Second Test in Melbourne. He scored 35 in the first innings of 348, before taking 6/53 in the West Indies' reply of 181. He removed Joe Solomon, before removing the established batsmen Seymour Nurse and Kanhai to trigger a collapse. This allowed Benaud to enforce the follow on. Davidson took a further 2/51 in the second innings {{to set up a}} seven wicket victory. The teams moved to Sydney for the next Test, where Davidson's unhappy experiences on his home ground continued. The West Indies batted first and made 339; Davidson took 5/80, including Smith, Kanhai and Sobers. Davidson made 16 as Australia replied with 202 and <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> when Meckiff was forced off the field early in the tourists' second innings with injury. Davidson lifted and removed Hunte, Kanhai and Sobers for single figures with the new ball. However, he too was forced off with a hamstring tear. With Australia two men down, the West Indies recovered to 326 and set the hosts 464 for victory, which would have required a world record fourth innings score. Davidson managed only one as Australia lost by 222 runs. He had not had a Test win in Sydney in three attempts, the only Australian ground where he had not played in a victory. After missing the Fourth Test because of a month on the sidelines to recuperate from the hamstring tear, he returned for the Fifth Test with the series level at 1–1. He took match figures of 6/173, including five wickets with late swing in the second innings to help Australia secure the victory. Davidson scored 28 and 12 as Benaud's men stumbled in the run-chase before scraping home by two wickets.|$|E

25|$|In reply the Minor Counties made 261 with Tommie Burton taking 6/55.

25|$|New Zealand won the toss, electing to bat, resting Daniel Vettori, Jamie How and Michael Mason who all {{played in}} the first ODI, as they had already won the series. New Zealand <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> early, with Lou Vincent and Nathan Astle both being {{dismissed}} before the side reached double figures. Despite 90 from Scott Styris, New Zealand failure at creating partnerships left them all out on 233. Dwayne Smith picked up 5-45.|$|E
25|$|Although Kapugedera showed huge {{potential}} in both {{one day and}} Test cricket, with some mature innings, his overall inconsistency lead to him being dropped from both teams. However, after the 2007 Cricket World Cup he began to stabilise his position in the one day team, and in 2008 some good performances cemented his position in the number 4 position. This included a 95 against West Indies when Sri Lanka <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> and in the 2008 Asia Cup.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{dismissed}} the English tail with little resistance, bowling out the visitors for 255. Pietersen added only one boundary to his overnight score and top-scored with 71. Johnson claimed his third five-wicket haul of the series, taking 5/63. In reply, Australia struggled, stumbling to 5/112. Rogers made 61 but holed out to mid-off and the hosts <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> {{at the end}} of the day at 9/164. Haddin remained unbeaten on 43 and Anderson and Broad both captured three wickets.|$|E

In an all-African affair reduced to a 25-over game, Zimbabwe posted a highly competitive 192/4 (Houghton 71, Jack Heron 50) which Kenya never got anywhere near, making just 72/4 to lose by 120 runs.|$|E
25|$|Mathews {{became an}} {{important}} member in Sri Lanka One Day team during the Sri Lanka tour of Australia in 2010/11. At the first match, on 3 November 2010, Mathews scored a magnificent match winning 77* runs with a partnership with Lasith Malinga, who also scored his only half-century. Sri Lanka <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> when he come into the crease, but finally won the match. In this match, Mathews along with Malinga, recorded the highest ninth wicket partnership in ODI history by scoring 132 runs for the ninth wicket.|$|E
25|$|Not {{content with}} {{creating}} a large first innings lead, the Australian's {{were determined to}} make the most of the remaining overs of the day, and set about the English top order. Two minutes into the English innings, Terry Alderman again bamboozled Graham Gooch with the inswinging yorker, trapping him LBW for a third ball duck. Kim Barnett followed a few overs later for 3, caught off the bowling of Alderman, and Chris Broad was clean bowled by Geoff Lawson for 20. At stumps on day 3, England <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> at 58 for 3, Gower and Gatting the not out batsmen.|$|E
