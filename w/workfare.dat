5|$|A September 1999 {{report from}} Baird's {{ministry}} showed that 10,600 <b>workfare</b> placements {{had been created}} {{in the first six}} months of 1999, a figure which the Toronto Star observed was significantly lower than that which had been predicted by the government. Baird indicated that he would continue with the <b>workfare</b> program, and that the proportion of welfare recipients on <b>workfare</b> would be increased from 15% to 30%.|$|E
5|$|Baird's first {{press conference}} as a cabinet {{minister}} {{was held in}} July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government's record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls. Baird told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of <b>workfare,</b> and used this figure {{to argue that the}} government's policy was a success. At the time, he lacked information on the number of <b>workfare</b> recipients who actually found jobs, and he also did not account for 40% of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list. A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of <b>workfare</b> in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|The {{theoretical}} concerns surrounding throffers {{have been}} practically applied concerning <b>workfare</b> programmes. In such systems, individuals receiving social welfare have their aid decreased if they refuse {{the offer of}} work or education. Robert Goodin criticised <b>workfare</b> programmes which presented throffers to individuals receiving welfare, and was responded to by Daniel Shapiro, who found his objections unconvincing. Several writers have also observed that throffers presented to people convicted of crimes, particularly sex offenders, can result in more lenient sentences if they accept medical treatment. Other examples are offered by psychiatrist Julio Arboleda-Flórez, who presents concerns about throffers in community psychiatry, and management expert John J. Clancey, who talks about throffers in employment.|$|E
5|$|Baird joined Premier Harris's cabinet on June 17, 1999, as Minister of Community and Social Services, {{where he}} became {{responsible}} for implementing and expanding Ontario's <b>workfare</b> program. As one of Harris's few bilingual ministers, he was also named as Minister responsible for Francophone Affairs.|$|E
5|$|Shapiro {{responds}} to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the <b>workfare</b> throffer. In state-sponsored (see welfare state) <b>workfare</b> systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by {{a refusal to}} accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a <b>workfare</b> system exist. In either system, recipients of welfare may also turn {{to family and friends}} for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments take responsibility for their lives. If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, then they will typically find their economic situation worsened. Unconditional state welfare does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be no worse off if they refused to work. As unconditional welfare does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable {{to determine whether or not}} people are willing to take responsibility for their lives.|$|E
5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that <b>workfare</b> placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E
25|$|<b>Workfare</b> is {{a scheme}} where {{participation}} in activities {{is a requirement}} for obtaining social benefits. <b>Workfare</b> schemes may not cover all of the unemployed, and may not offer the same income as a full-time minimum wage job.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom {{considered}} the forced labour prohibition in Caitlin Reilly and Jamieson Wilson v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, where it {{ruled that the}} Department for Work and Pensions' <b>workfare</b> policy under which the unemployed work {{in return for their}} benefit payments were not forced labour but were nevertheless legally flawed.|$|E
500|$|Conceptual {{thinking}} about throffers is practically applied in considerations of conditional aid, such as {{is used in}} <b>workfare</b> systems. For philosopher and political theorist Gertrude Ezorsky, the denial of welfare when subjects refuse work {{is the epitome of}} a throffer. Conditional welfare is also labelled a throffer by political philosopher Robert Goodin. In the words of Daniel Shapiro, also a political philosopher, the offer aspect of <b>workfare</b> is seen in the [...] "benefits one receives if one learns new skills, gets a job, alters destructive behaviors and the like", while the threat aspect is executed with [...] "the elimination or reduction of aid, if the person does not, after a certain period of time, accept the offer". For Goodin, the moral questionability of the threat aspect of a throffer is generally mitigated by the attractiveness of the offer aspect. In this way, <b>workfare</b> can represent a [...] "genuine" [...] throffer, but only when a person receiving welfare payments does not need the payments to survive, and so possesses a genuine choice as to whether to accept the throffer. When, however, an individual would be unable to survive if he or she stopped receiving welfare payments, there is no genuine choice; the individual is, for Goodin, unable to refuse the throffer. This cancels out the morally mitigating factor usually possessed by a throffer. This is presented as an argument against <b>workfare,</b> and Goodin anticipates that advocates would respond paternalistically by claiming that, regardless of issues of freedom, the individual in question would benefit from taking part in the work or education offered.|$|E
500|$|For Ivar Lødemel and Heather Trickey, {{editors of}} An Offer You Can't Refuse': <b>Workfare</b> in International Perspective, <b>workfare</b> programmes' {{reliance}} on compulsion makes them throffers. Citing the Danish model as a particular example, the pair argue that <b>workfare</b> {{involves the use}} of compulsory offers; while the work or education is presented as an offer, because recipients of welfare are dependent upon the help they would lose if they refuse the offer, they effectively have no choice. The compulsive aspect reveals that at least some recipients of welfare, in the eyes of policy makers, require coercion before they will accept offers of work. Neither the chance of paid work nor participation in labour schemes are, alone, enough to encourage some to freely accept the offers they receive. Such compulsion serves to reintegrate people into the labour market, and serves as a kind of [...] "new paternalism". The authors are concerned about this compulsion, and present several arguments against it which are possible or have been utilised in the literature: Firstly, it impacts the rights of those against whom it is used. This may make it objectionable in and of itself, or it may result in undesirable outcomes. Secondly, {{it can be argued that}} benefits must be unconditional in order to act as a genuine safety net. Thirdly, compulsion undermines consumer feedback, and so no differentiation can be made between good and poor programmes presented to those receiving welfare. Fourthly, such coercion may contribute to a culture of resistance among those receiving welfare.|$|E

500|$|Thompson {{was elected}} Governor of Wisconsin in 1986. [...] He was re-elected three times.

[...] Thompson also successfully backed a school voucher program. [...] Near {{the end of}} his governorship, Thompson implemented BadgerCare, which provided health coverage for children ineligible for Medicaid. [...] As governor, Thompson vetoed bills frequently and often exercised the line-item veto. [...] None of his vetoes were overturned. [...] Thompson served as chairman of the National Governors Association from 1995 to 1996. [...] He was considered as a potential running mate for Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole in 1996, but was passed over for Jack Kemp. [...] Thompson left as governor during his fourth term in 2001 to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services in the George W. Bush administration.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1995 {{election}}, Harris catapulted {{his party}} from third place to an election victory, {{running on a}} libertarian platform known as the [...] "Common Sense Revolution" [...] that highlighted a number of [...] "wedge issues" [...] and promised significant tax cuts, cuts to welfare, the introduction of <b>workfare,</b> and a 30% reduction in provincial income taxes.

2500|$|In the United States, Third Way adherents embrace fiscal {{conservatism}} to {{a greater}} extent than traditional social liberals, and advocate some replacement of welfare with <b>workfare,</b> and sometimes have a stronger preference for market solutions to traditional problems (as in pollution markets), while rejecting pure laissez-faire economics and other libertarian positions. The Third Way style of governing was firmly adopted and partly redefined during the administration of President Bill Clinton. With respect to U.S. presidents, the term [...] "Third Way" [...] was introduced by political scientist Stephen Skowronek, who wrote The Politics Presidents Make (1993, 1997;) [...] Third Way presidents [...] "undermine the opposition by borrowing policies from it in an effort to seize the middle and with it to achieve political dominance. Think of Nixon's economic policies, which were a continuation of Johnson's [...] "Great Society"; Clinton's welfare reform and support of capital punishment; and Obama's pragmatic centrism, reflected in his embrace, albeit very recent, of entitlements reform.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the {{original}} wall was constructed {{under the direction of}} James [...] "Jimmy" [...] Cunningham, a master stonemason who spent 32 years on the project until his death. Cunningham continued supervising construction into his last days despite being ill, and on at least one occasion, went to check the seawall's progress still wearing pajamas. He died on 29 September 1963, long before the wall was finished, but remains the one most associated with the project, and a commemorative plaque can be found near Siwash Rock, also where his ashes were scattered. In contrast to the continuity during Cunningham's oversight of the project, construction of the seawall was intermittent, owing to the short-term funding commitments of the civic and federal governments. The first 4,000 feet was completed between 1914 and 1916. A series of storms threatened the foreshore near Second Beach during the war, when water flooded the patch of land between the beach and Lost Lagoon. In 1920, the wall served as a <b>workfare</b> project for 2,300 unemployed men (the largest number of workers at any one time), and by 1939, 8,000 more feet of the wall was finished. Another 9,100 feet was built between 1950 and 1957, and the final 2,500 feet was not taken on until 1968. On 26 September 1971, the last block, completing {{the original}} vision of the seawall, was tapped into place by H. H. Stevens, who also helped initiate the project in 1914 as a Member of Parliament ...|$|E
