40|$|Oil and gas {{development}} in the southern San Joaquin Valley of California is extensive and has impacted natural habitats for sensitive species. The effects of this habitat loss and degradation on these species are not well understood. Our objective was to determine habitat characteristics, wildlife community composition, and species abundance relative {{to the level of}} oilfield {{development in}} saltbush scrub habitat. Sixteen study sites were identified with 4 each in areas with high (> 100 <b>well</b> <b>pads),</b> medium (11 – 50 <b>well</b> <b>pads),</b> low (1 – 10 <b>well</b> <b>pads),</b> and no (0 <b>well</b> <b>pads)</b> oil field development, as measured by numbers of <b>well</b> <b>pads</b> with active oil production and the proportion of habitat disturbed. Surveys were conducted from March 2008 to May 2010 to assess the abundance and diversity of herbaceous plants, shrubs, birds, reptiles, and small and medium-sized mammals. As oilfield development and associated habitat disturbance increased, herbaceous plant cover and shrub abundance decreased while herbaceous plant diversity increased, largely due to colonization by non-native species. Among animals, generalist lizard, bird, and mammal species increased, as did non-endemic species particularly birds. Conversely, some endemic species, including several special status species, declined or were not detected as the level of oilfield development increased. Ecological community composition remains largely intact at low levels of oilfield development, but is profoundly altered at higher levels with some effects apparent at moderate levels. Best management practices such as spatially consolidating facilities, limiting road construction, and controlling non-native plants could reduce ecological impacts from oilfield activities in saltbush scrub habitat...|$|R

40|$|Development and {{extraction}} of {{resources such as}} oil and gas has directly and indirectly reduced available habitat to wildlife through changes in behavior and resource use. To assess how elk (Cervus elaphus) and deer (Odocoileus spp.) were spatially distributed relative to roads and coal-bed natural gas <b>well</b> <b>pads,</b> we collected pellet group data during 2 summers in south-central Colorado. We used generalized linear mixed models to assess the relative probability of use of elk and deer in relation to roads and <b>well</b> <b>pads.</b> We found relative probability of use was positively associated with distance from roads, indicating greater use of areas farther away from roads.

40|$|Emissions of {{nitrogen}} oxides (NOx = NO + NO 2) in the United States (U.

However, increasing NOx emissions from emerging industries, such as unconventional natural gas (UNG) extraction, could potentially offset gains in stationary source emission reductions in shale gas producing regions of the U.

S. has seen dramatic increases {{in the development of}} wells over the past ten years, and it is currently unknown whether NOx emissions from UNG extraction are having an effect on ecosystems or air quality. In our study, modeling, experimental, and field studies were used to investigate the influence of Marcellus Shale UNG extraction activities on local and regional fluctuations in N emissions, ambient concentrations, and deposition fluxes. In one study, we determined that federal deposition monitoring networks do not effectively capture regional <b>well</b> <b>pad</b> NOx emissions, despite the high <b>well</b> <b>pad</b> density areas of northeastern and southwestern Pennsylvania where NOx emissions densities can reach 21 kg NOx ha- 1 year- 1.

40|$|Shale gas is a {{hydrocarbon}} in impermeable shale rock up to 3. 5 km {{below the}} earth surface, requiring hydraulic fracturing, an ‘unconventional’ technique to stimulate production. This {{study sought to}} explore the accurate greenhouse gas impact of shale gas exploitation. Emissions from a producing conventional <b>well</b> <b>pad</b> are analogous to an unconventional <b>well</b> <b>pad</b> in production. Methane emissions were measured at three key sites; the KM 5 conventional <b>well</b> <b>pad,</b> Knapton generation station and a rural crop farm control site, Cranford Farm. 288 hours of methane measurements were conducted using a Picarro Ring Down Spectrometer, which recorded methane concentration at 1 hertz. A Gull wind sonic was also used to record wind speed and direction. Therefore a flux could be calculated for two natural gas infrastructure sites for comparison. The control site had an average methane concentration of 1. 93 ppm, which was higher than the 1. 91 ppm CH 4 average at the KM 5 <b>well</b> <b>pad</b> but {{lower than that of}} Knapton which was 2. 01 ppm. The average calculated CH 4 flux at KM 5 was 24. 29 kg CH 4 /year, 3 % of the average flux from Knapton, which was calculated as 847. 91 kg CH 4 /year. These annual methane emissions are the equivalent of 3 sheep and 7 dairy cows respectively. Under highest case calculations, methane emissions from these sites equate to emission factors of 0. 0077 % for KM 5 and 0. 082 % for Knapton. From literature analysis, pre-production emissions from shale gas exploitation will be higher from a) excess energy required for horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing and b) methane emissions from well completion. The extent to which it has a larger environmental impact than conventional gas is dependent on the use of REC (reduced emissions completions), which can reduce well completion methane emissions by over 90 %. Over longer terms, the Climate Change Act (2008) requires an 80 % reduction in GHG emissions from 1990 levels, which will require CCS implementation nationally regardless of shale gas exploitation...|$|E
40|$|Emissions of methane, non-methane {{hydrocarbons}} (NMHC), {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) at 27 natural gas well pads, 11 non-well locations in oil and gas fields, and 7 hydrocarbon-bearing outcrops in eastern Utah between 2013 and 2016 were measured using a dynamic flux chamber (DFC) in effort {{to answer the following}} questions: What effect does the development of oil and gas have on the observed air quality (increased ozone, CO 2, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and/or methane emissions) in northeastern Utah? What percentage of these gases is due to natural background emissions, and what percentage is due to oil and gas development in the region? Methane emissions were the focus of this study, but emissions of other compounds were also measured to better understand the sources and characteristics of emissions. Background methane fluxes were all (mg) meter (m) - 2 hour (h) - 1. Methane emissions from <b>well</b> <b>pad</b> soils were commonly higher closer to the wellhead, though exceptions existed. Methane fluxes from <b>well</b> <b>pad</b> soils ranged from - 5. 6 to 70, 000 mg m- 2 h- 1. Based on analysis of NMHC emissions data, emissions from 68 % of the sampled <b>well</b> <b>pad</b> soils were due to leaks of raw natural gas, whereas the remaining emissions were likely from a combination of raw gas leaks, liquid hydrocarbon spills, and/or methanogenic processes. CO 2 emissions were higher than methane emissions 92 % of the time at well sites, possibly due to CO 2 in natural gas, and/or CO 2 emitted from bacterial decomposition of soil organic matter and/or fossil hydrocarbons. Total combustible soil gas concentrations were measured at 21 wells. In summer 2015, soil properties were also analyzed to better understand well leakage.
