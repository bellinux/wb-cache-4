50|$|An RDS-TMC {{receiver}} is {{a special}} FM radio tuner that can decode TMC data. Satellite TMC receivers use a dedicated data channel that is broadcast as part of much larger broadcast digital audio channels.

The look-up tables must be implemented in a service-specific database mapped to geographic routes and intersections.

50|$|SHORAN, which {{operates}} at 300 MHz, requires an airborne AN/APN-3 set and two AN/CPN-2 or 2A ground stations. The {{equipment on board}} the aircraft includes a transmitter, a receiver, an operator's console and a K-1A model bombing computer. The transmitter sends pulses {{to one of the}} ground stations and the system calculates the range in statute miles by clocking the elapsed time between transmitter pulse and the returned signal. The system was intended for use in navigation, but it became obvious that it would work well for blind targeting during bombing runs in poor visibility. The setup made up of the K-1A bombing computer combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> was the first SHORAN. The SHORAN system is designed so that as the aircraft faces the target, the low-frequency station should be on the left, and the high-frequency station is on the right. This allows the computer to triangulate the two stations and the target.|$|E
5000|$|The Alpine Electronics DVD-based {{navigation}} system was integrated with an 8-inch LCD display and a multi-use Interface Dial, which could move up, down, {{left and right}} like a mouse, turn like a knob, scroll through preset menus, and click when pushed {{to act as a}} selector button. Unlike many in-car {{navigation system}}s, the Alpine DVD-based navigation unit allowed the driver to change destinations and routes [...] "on the fly" [...] while driving, rather than being locked out unless the car was in Park. The tightly integrated voice recognition system worked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> and could recognize spoken city and street names. Also unique at the time was two-way communication via AcuraLink satellite communication. Using a facility of XM Radio service, the system could send a variety of messages to the car, including service appointment reminders (appointments first made via Internet) or important messages such as recall notices. The use of OnStar was carried over from the previous generation RL. Use of digital/analog trimode (two digital bands and one analog band) technology allowed the 2005 RL OnStar technology to survive the planned 2007 phase-out of the analog OnStar to fully digital OnStar service.|$|E

5000|$|The Rafale's {{ground attack}} {{capability}} is heavily reliant upon sensory targeting pods, such as Thales Optronics's Reco New Generation/Areos reconnaissance pod and Damocles electro-optical/laser designation pod. Together, these systems provide targeting information, enable tactical reconnaissance missions, and are {{integrated with the}} Rafale's IMA architecture to provide analysed data feeds to friendly units and ground stations, {{as well as to}} the pilot. Damocles provides targeting information to the various armaments carried by the Rafale and is directly integrated with the Rafale's VHF/UHF secure radio to communicate target information with other aircraft. It also performs other key functions such as aerial optical surveillance and is integrated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> as a FLIR. The Damocles designation pod were described as [...] "lacking competitiveness" [...] when compared to rivals such as the Sniper and LITENING pods; so work began on an upgraded pod, designated Damocles XF, with additional sensors and added ability to transmit live video feeds. A new Thales targeting pod, the Talios, was officially unveiled at the 2014 Farnborough Air Show and is expected to be integrated on the Rafale by 2018. Thales' Areos reconnaissance pod is an all-weather, night-and-day-capable reconnaissance system employed on the Rafale, and provides a significantly improved reconnaissance capability over preceding platforms. Areos has been designed to perform reconnaissance under various mission profiles and condition, using multiple day/night sensors and its own independent communications datalinks.|$|E

The steering wheel also has a tilt feature and radio controls, including Ford SYNC buttons, allowing the driver to press the button and use voice commands to activate the system, which became standard on Eddie Bauer, Limited, and King Ranch.

40|$|Abstract— To {{investigate}} {{effects of}} navigation systems on traffic safety, a literature search, a damages database analysis, a user survey and an instrumented car study were conducted. This paper presents the instrumented car study {{to investigate the}} effects of a navigation system on driving behavior and on workload. Participants drove to an assigned destination in an area where they were unfamiliar, using either conventional navigation aids (maps, route planner prints, etc.) or a TomTom navigation system. The instrumented vehicle registered detailed information on driving behavior such as distance driven (in kilometers and duration), number of turns, number of stops, speed, acceleration, deceleration, and time headway. The results showed that the destination was reached more quickly and with fewer kilometers when driving <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> than with conventional aids. The velocity on a straight road and during turning maneuvers was somewhat higher <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> compared to conventional navigation aids.
