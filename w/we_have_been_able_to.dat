An unfortunate in-stance of this kind happened on Wednesday last at the locks on the 9th section. A strongly constructed boat ran her bow against a gondola loaded with flour, and so much injured her as to render it necessary to transship the load. But no damage was done to the cargo.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principal}} {{event of}} the golden jubilee of Indian independence was President K. R.

[...] The following morning, Prime Minister I. K. Gujral, addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort, said: When Gandhiji dreamt of India's future, he had said that the country will attain the real freedom only on the day when a Dalit would become the President of this country. This is our great fortune that today on the eve of golden jubilee of independence, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fulfil this dream of Gandhiji. In the person of Shri K. R.

It is a matter of further happiness that the President has a very high place among the intellectuals of this country.

2500|$|Heinrich Lissauer {{shared his}} ideas about agnosia after Wernicke and Kussmaul. In 1890, he theorized {{that there were}} two ways in which object {{recognition}} impairment could occur. [...] One way in which impairment could occur was if there was damage to early perceptual processing or if there was damage to the actual object representation. [...] If the actual object representation was damaged, this would not allow the object to be stored in visual memory, and therefore the individual {{would not be able to}} recognize the object. [...] During the time of Wernicke, Kussmaul and Lissauer there was little known about the cerebral cortex.

2500|$|The {{first five}} Governors of New South Wales {{realised}} {{the urgent need}} to encourage free settlers, but the British government remained largely indifferent.

At present this settlement only affords one person that I can employ in cultivating the lands..." [...] It {{was not until the}} 1820s that numbers of free settlers began to arrive and government schemes began to be introduced to encourage free settlers.
