5|$|Owing to the {{scarcity}} of evidence dating to Unas' reign, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little about his activities. Existing trade relations with foreign countries and cities, in particular Byblos, seem to have continued during Unas' time on the throne. Reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex show two large seagoing ships coming back from an expedition to the Levantine coast with Syro-Canaanite men, who were either the boat crews or slaves. Another relief depicts a military campaign, Egyptians armed with bows and daggers attacking Canaanite nomads called the Shasu. Similar reliefs {{have been found in}} preceding pyramid complexes, such as that of Sahure, and they may thus be standard themes rather than depictions of actual events. Other sources tend to confirm the accuracy of these depictions; however, for example the autobiography of Weni relates many punitive raids against Canaanite nomads in the early Sixth Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|The only dated {{works by}} Lübeck are two cantatas {{composed}} in Stade in November 1693, both {{commissioned by the}} Swedish administration in Stade in memory of Ulrike Eleonora of Denmark. Aside from these pieces, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little about the composer's activities at Stade. His reputation as organist, organ consultant and teacher grew steadily, and finally landed him the position at St. Nikolai in Hamburg in 1702; he was succeeded in Stade by his son, Peter Paul (16801732). Hamburg was already {{one of the largest}} cities in Germany and had a long organ tradition associated first with pupils of Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck: Heinrich Scheidemann, Jacob Praetorius, and others. A number of other important composers worked in Hamburg in the late 17th century: among them Matthias Weckmann, who helped organize the concert life of the city, and the aforementioned Reincken, one of the most celebrated organists of his time. However, by the time of Lübeck's arrival, only Reincken was still alive, and the musical life of the city, as well as its economic position, was in a slow decline. In 1720 Johann Sebastian Bach applied for a post at the Jacobikirche, but withdrew the application after acquainting himself with the local circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Octavian {{returned}} to Rome {{two years after}} defeating Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium. With Mark Antony's defeat, no one remained to oppose Octavian. Decades of war had taken a terrible toll on the People of Rome. The political situation was unstable, {{and there was a}} constant threat of renewed warfare. Octavian's arrival alone caused a wave of optimism to ripple throughout Italy. As soon as he arrived, he began addressing the problems that were plaguing Rome. He declared a general amnesty for the former supporters of his enemies, and provided land for over 120,000 former soldiers. As soon as these reforms had been implemented, the price of land began to rise and trade was revived. Octavian's popularity soon reached new heights, which ultimately gave him the support he needed to implement his reforms. When Octavian deposed Mark Antony in 32 BC, he resigned his position as triumvir, but was probably vested with powers similar to those that he had given up. In 29 BC, another alteration was made to his legal status, of which <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little. We know that it involved the granting to Octavian of Consular imperium (command authority), and thus control over the army and the provinces. This alteration probably also gave him the authority to take a census.|$|E

500|$|Until {{at least}} the eighteenth century, shamanism was {{at the core of}} Manchu spiritual life and {{differentiated}} Manchus from Han Chinese even as Manchu Bannermen garrisoned in various Chinese cities were adopting many aspects of the Chinese lifestyle. In 1747 the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–1796) commissioned the publication of a [...] "Shamanic Code" [...] to revive and regulate shamanic practices, which he feared were becoming lost. He had it distributed to Bannermen to guide their practice, but <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little about the effect of this policy. Mongols and Han Chinese were forbidden to attend shamanic ceremonies. Partly because of their secret aspect, these rituals attracted the curiosity of Beijing dwellers and visitors to the Qing capital.

500|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson {{says that}} [...] "there seems ample {{indication}} that Gefjon represents {{one aspect of}} a once powerful goddess of the north, the figure representing in Scandinavian myths as either Frigg, the wife of Odin, or Freyja, sister of fertility god Freyr. Freyja, desired by gods, giants and dwarves alike, acted as dispenser of bounty and inspirer of sexual love {{between men and women}} like the Greek Aphrodite." [...] In addition, Davidson says that [...] "as Axel Olrik (1901) pointed out long ago, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little about Gefion, and it is possible that she can be identified with Frigg or Freyja" [...] and not only does the Prose Edda associate her with an afterlife realm of the dead, [...] "in Lokasenna, Loki claims that Gefion was given a jewel by a lover, traditions that would fit in very well with what we know of Freyja." ...|$|E

[...] While he acknowledged that his view was heresy, Lê Duẩn insisted that Vietnam was in a unique situation; [...] "It seems that no country so far in history has been in a situation such as ours. We must lead the peasantry and agriculture immediately to socialism, without waiting for a developed industry, though <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> well that without the strong impact of industry, agriculture cannot achieve large-scale production and new relations of agriculture cannot be consolidated... To proceed from small-scale production to large-scale production is a new one." [...] According to Lê Duẩn the key to socialism was not mechanisation and industrialisation, but a new division of labour. He also believed that cooperatives {{did not need to be}} autarkic, but rather [...] "organically connected, through the process of production itself, with other cooperatives and with the state economic sector." [...] Vietnam could achieve this through state intervention and control. He saw the economy as one whole directed by the state and not many parts intertwined.|$|E

2500|$|Historians {{have noted}} that in the year 1035, a cartulaire (a ledger of church or monastery {{property}} titles) from the Abbey of Saint-Chaffre in the Haute-Loire, makes mention of an obscure castellum Gradignanum.

2500|$|It {{is often}} possible, however, to make precise and {{accurate}} {{statements about the}} likelihood of a future state in a chaotic system. [...] If a (possibly chaotic) dynamical system has an attractor, then there exists a probability measure that gives the long-run proportion of time spent by the system in the various regions of the attractor. [...] In the case of the logistic map with parameter [...] and an initial state in , the attractor is also the interval [...] and the probability measure corresponds to the beta distribution with parameters [...] and [...] Specifically, the invariant measure is [...] [...] Unpredictability is not randomness, but in some circumstances looks very much like it. [...] Hence, and fortunately, even if <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little about the initial state of the logistic map (or some other chaotic system), we can still say something about the distribution of states arbitrarily far into the future, and use this knowledge to inform decisions based {{on the state of the}} system.|$|E

I did not say what I thought, which is that for thirty years I have had the experience of how many lies Prince Bismarck's diplomatic agents (with some exceptions) have written him, and therefore I usually disbelieve what they write completely, unless I know them to be honest and trustworthy men.

2500|$|Thomas Cromwell {{had another}} daughter, Jane (c.1535 – 1580) whose early {{life is a}} {{complete}} mystery. According to Hilary Mantel, [...] "Cromwell had an illegitimate daughter, and beyond {{the fact that she}} existed, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little about her. She comes briefly into the records, in an incredibly obscure way – she’s in the archives of the county of Chester." [...] Jane married William Hough (c.1527 – 1585), of Leighton in Wirrall, Cheshire, around 1550. William Hough was the son of Richard Hough (1505 – 1573/4) who was employed by Thomas Cromwell from 1534 to 1540 as his agent in Chester. It is unknown what role Thomas and Gregory Cromwell played in her life. However, it would be safe to say that, after her marriage, Jane did not share her father's religious beliefs. Jane and her husband William Hough were staunch Catholics who, together with their daughter, Alice, her husband, William Whitmore and their children, all {{came to the attention of}} the authorities as recusant Catholics in the reign of Elizabeth I.|$|E

2500|$|The Use and {{application}} of maxims is clearly a location where the principles of Irish law could be recorded. Any number of maxims may be found within the Early Irish Laws and perhaps {{the reason why we}} are unable to derive a coherent theory of law from them is because there are a great many different topics. Some do seem to represent a legal theory, such as the maxim in Bechbretha that [...] "no-one is obliged to give something to another for nothing" [...] and that in Bretha Crólige that [...] "the misdeed of the guilty should not affect the innocent". These maxims do say more than one might think since legal systems often have problems balancing the interests of all. The majority of maxims, however, treat with more specific problems. The main problem, however, with our understanding of maxims is that while one law text tells us that they were used as a basis of judgment we know little else about them; we do not even know how exactly maxims could be used for judgment. A further complication is that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little about the origin of maxims (or even what the jurists thought was the origin) and similarly we do not know whether jurists were introducing new maxims regularly or whether all maxims were supposed to be from time immemorial.|$|E
