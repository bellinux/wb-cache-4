Who am I? <b>Where</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> going? What {{does it all}} mean? Much of the album is suffused with sarcasm: right from the disaffected ennui of the title track to the stroppiness of 'Nobody Knows Me', Madonna is kicking against the claustrophobic effect of celebrity worship." ...|$|E

Ice-T states that [...] "I knew we didn't want to form an R group. [...] <b>Where</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> gonna get the rage and the anger to attack something with that?

Jon Peters {{reworked}} the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst {{to create a}} [...] model of the cathedral. This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: [...] "Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, 'Why am I walking up all these stairs? <b>Where</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> going?' 'We'll talk about it {{when you get to}} the top!' I had to tell him that I didn't know." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{second season}} of Dusty, which {{featured}} her rendition of [...] "Get Ready" [...] and her UK No.13 hit, [...] "I'll Try Anything", was broadcast in 1967. It attracted a healthy audience but the series {{did not keep}} up with changes in pop music. The comparatively progressive album <b>Where</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> Going? (October 1967) attempted to redress this by containing a [...] "jazzy", orchestrated version of [...] "Sunny" [...] and Jacques Brel's [...] "If You Go Away". Though it was critically appreciated, it did not sell well in the US – it reached the top40 in the UK. In November 1968, a similar fate befell Dusty... Definitely, which was not issued in the US, it reached the UK top30. Her choice of material ranged from the rolling [...] "Ain't No Sun Since You've Been Gone" [...] to the aching emotion of [...] "I Think It's Gonna Rain Today". In that same year, Springfield had a UK No.4 hit, [...] "I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten", which was written by Clive Westlake. Its flipside, [...] "No Stranger Am I", was co-written by Norma Tanega and Norma Kutzer. By late 1966, Springfield was in a domestic relationship with Tanega – a US-born singer-songwriter who had a UK Top30 hit with the novelty song, [...] "Walkin' My Cat Named Dog". Springfield's ITV series It Must Be Dusty was broadcast in May and June 1968, episode six featured a duet performance of [...] "Mockingbird" [...] with singer-guitarist Jimi Hendrix fronting his band, The Experience.|$|E
