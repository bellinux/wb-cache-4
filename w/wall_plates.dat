25|$|It is {{possible}} for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal wire racks {{can be part of}} the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior <b>wall</b> <b>plates</b> with perforating holes which allow light and air into the oven, and allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.|$|E
2500|$|Adult S. balanoides {{grow up to}} [...] in diameter, and are sessile, living {{attached}} to rocks and other solid substrates. They have six greyish <b>wall</b> <b>plates</b> surrounding a diamond-shaped operculum. The base of the shell is membranous in Semibalanus, unlike other barnacles which have calcified bases. When the tide rises to cover the barnacles, the operculum opens, and feathery cirri (modified thoracic appendages) are extended into the water to filter food from the seawater. When the tide falls, the operculum closes again to prevent desiccation; the reduction from the primitive condition of eight <b>wall</b> <b>plates</b> to six is believed to decrease water loss even further by {{reducing the number of}} sutures through which water can escape.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the behavior and}} the modes of failure of cold-formed steel <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> system subjected to different load position. An experimental investigation was conducted on a full scale <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> system. Load was applied at the mid span of the <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> and the system was tested to failure. The behavior of the system was observed and the data collected was used to calibrate a numerical model for parametric study. To study the effect of load position on the system, a concentrate force was applied at different positions on the <b>wall</b> <b>plate.</b> Different failure modes and capacities were observed as the load {{moved away from the}} mid span of the <b>wall</b> <b>plate.</b> The system had the highest capacity when load was applied at the support and the lowest ultimate capacity when load was applied at the mid span of the <b>wall</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} tests on cold-formed steel (CFS) <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> system {{subjected}} to uplift force at the mid span of the <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> is presented. The aim {{of the study was}} to study the behaviour and identify the modes of failure of CFS <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> system. Two parameters were considered in these studies: 1) different dimension of U-bracket at the supports and 2) different sizes of lipped C-channel. The lipped C-channels used were C 07508, C 07512 and C 10012. The dimensions of the connecting plate's leg were 50 x 35 mm and 50 x 60 mm respectively, where 25 mm clearance was provided to the connections for specimens with clearance. Results show that specimens with and without clearance experienced the same mode of failure. Failure began with the yielding of the connectors followed by distortional buckling of the <b>wall</b> <b>plate.</b> However, when C 075 sections were used as <b>wall</b> <b>plate,</b> the system behaved differently. There was a large deformation in the <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> and failure began in the distortional buckling of the <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> followed by bearing of the connecting plates at the supports (U-bracket). The ultimate strength of the system also decreased dramatically when C 075 sections were used...|$|R
