5000|$|John Thomson was <b>warehousekeeper</b> to the Charitable Corporation, but {{participated in}} a {{fraudulent}} scheme that deproved it of the bulk of its assets.|$|E
50|$|A {{little while}} after Thomson became <b>warehousekeeper,</b> {{several of those}} {{involved}} in the management of the Corporation started speculating in shares on a very large scale. This seems to have begun because Grant owed money to Thomson, and both he and Burroughs had debts to Robinson from earlier stockjobbing. The Partnership of Five consisted of Sir Alexander Grant, William Burroughs, William Squire, George Robinson, and John Thomson. In October 1727, they began to buy the Corporation's shares, this all being handled by Robinson who was a stockbroker in Exchange Alley. They then heard of lead mines in Scotland belonging to Sir Robert Sutton and others, whose sale they proposed to the York Buildings Company. They bought shares in it, and those shares rose in value.|$|E
5000|$|According to the {{subsequent}} {{report of a}} House of Commons Committee, little business was done until 1725, when a new committee (Board of Directors) was appointed in October 1725, consisting of Sir Robert Sutton, Sir John Meres, Sir Fisher Tench, Dennis Bond, Archibald Grant (later Bt), and others. They proceeded to appoint officers, including John Thomson as <b>warehousekeeper</b> and Mr Clarke as surveyor in November 1725. Following a deficiency at the Spring Garden warehouse, the surveyor was required to report weekly to the Committee concerning pledges at the Fenchurch Street warehouse, but Thomson the warehouse keeper instead procured his dismissal in May 1726. [...] William Burroughs joined the Committee in March 1727, and William Aislabie and Hon. Walter Molesworth in December 1729. Assistants were also appointed from 1726, including William Squire, George Jackson and John Torriano (disqualified from office in 1729).|$|E
5000|$|The company {{published}} a pamphlet in 1719, setting out its practice. The procedure {{was that a}} borrower took goods {{to one of the}} corporation's warehouses and signed a bill of sale. The warehouse keeper valued the pledge and he and an assistant signed a certificate. This was passed to the bookkeeper for entering in the corporation's accounts, and then to the cashier who paid the borrower his loan. Both the warehouse keeper and the cashier were required to give security, and there were surveyors of warehouses to act as a check on the <b>warehousekeepers.</b> Furthermore, the books were signed every night. Unredeemed pledges could be sold after a year. The borrower had not only to pay lawful interest (five percent) but also fees of a similar amount, so that the company was actually receiving considerably more than [...] "lawful interest". [...] These systems should have been sufficient to prevent fraud, but in the late 1720s, compliance with the procedure became lax, opening the way to fraud on a massive scale.|$|R

In contrast to value added tax, they are mainly specific taxes, i. e. expressed as a monetary amount per quantity of the product. The most commonly applied excise duties are those on alcoholic beverages, manufactured tobacco products and energy products (motor fuels and heating fuels, such as petrol and gasoline, electricity, natural gas, coal and coke). The basic principles applicable to all products subject to excise duties have been laid down in Council Directive 92 / 12 /EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products. Products subject to excise duties are generally produced, and can afterwards be held under duty suspension, in tax warehouses. The establishment and operation of tax warehouses is subject to the authorization of the Member States. They should respect the principles laid down in Commission Recommendation 2000 / 789 /EC of 29 November 2000 setting out guidelines for the authorisation of <b>warehousekeepers</b> under Council Directive 92 / 12 /EEC in relation to products subject to excise duty. The products can be sent under [...] ...|$|R
