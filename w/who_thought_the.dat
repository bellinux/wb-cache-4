5|$|Veronica Nicholson, {{a friend}} with {{connections}} in the publishing trade, persuaded David to continue writing, with the aim that she write a book. She showed some of David's work to Anne Scott-James, {{the editor of the}} British magazine Harper's Bazaar, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> writing showed a widely travelled person with an independent mind. She offered David a contract, and David's work began appearing in the publication from March 1949.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's success {{continued}} in the NFL in 1950, silencing skeptics <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> team stood out {{only because of the}} poor quality of competition in the AAFC. After beating the defending NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles in {{the first game of the}} season, the Browns advanced to the championship game, where they beat the Los Angeles Rams 30–28 on a last-second Lou Groza field goal. Speedie had 548 receiving yards during the season and was selected for the NFL's first-ever Pro Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Charles faced a {{political}} storm over his brother James, a Catholic, being {{next in line}} to the throne. The prospect of a Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (previously Baron Ashley {{and a member of}} the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Shaftesbury's power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced the Exclusion Bill, which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the line of succession. Some even sought to confer the Crown on the Protestant Duke of Monmouth, the eldest of Charles's illegitimate children. The Abhorrers—those <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Exclusion Bill was abhorrent—were named Tories (after a term for dispossessed Irish Catholic bandits), while the Petitioners—those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of the Exclusion Bill—were called Whigs (after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians).|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched {{the idea that there}} should be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode had a lot of potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Toyah began a {{relationship}} with Spider Nugent (Martin Hancock) in 1999, which lasted until Hancock's departure in July 2000. The following year, the character {{was the focus of}} one of Coronation Streets most controversial storylines, which saw her beaten and raped by Phil Simmonds (Jack Deam). The storyline marked the first time in forty years that the show had included a rape. The storyline was criticised by some former Coronation Street cast members, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> producers were using the subject of rape to boost ratings. Taylor decided to leave the show in July 2002 and her character departed on-screen the following year on 5 February 2003. Toyah was well received by critics and Taylor received the Best Young Actor accolade at the Inside Soap Awards and Best Dramatic Performance at The British Soap Awards.|$|E

5|$|Writing for PC Gamer, Leif Johnson complimented {{the variety}} of {{multiplayer}} game modes available. This sentiment was shared by other reviewers <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> multiplayer offering was considerably more diverse than what was typically available in most RTS games. Numerous critics regarded Blitz to be the standout multiplayer mode, however they were still apprehensive about its shortcomings. GamesRadar reviewer Robert Zak called Blitz the most forward-thinking area of Halo Wars 2, in contrast {{to other parts of}} the game which he thought were formulaic. Other writers agreed that the mode was an interesting twist on RTS and enjoyed playing it. While Blitz card packs could be earned through playing the game, both Bratt and Rignall still expressed disappointment about the inclusion of microtransactions for purchasing card packs. Johnson and Stapleton suspected that winning games in Blitz may be too reliant on the luck of the draw. Consequently, Stapleton thought the mode was unsuitable for competitive multiplayer but felt that the randomness and card mechanics worked well in the Firefight variant.|$|E
25|$|However, Aristotle in {{the fourth}} century BCE criticized the ideas of Philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation. He {{established}} the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that rotated about the earth. This was accepted by most of those who came after, in particular Claudius Ptolemy (2nd century CE), <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> earth would be devastated by gales if it rotated.|$|E
25|$|Bourguiba, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Destour and its {{leadership}} to be obstacles to his ambitions, decided {{to resign from}} the party on September 9. He soon learned from this experience. The success obtained thanks to popular violent uprisings shows the failure of Destourians' favorite methods, consisting of petitions and telegrams. Only violence by determined groups could lead the Residence {{to step back and}} negotiate political solutions. That would be his guideline until 1956.|$|E

25|$|In 1908, {{to augment}} the family's meagre income, Alice {{accepted}} {{a job in the}} chorus of the Christmas pantomime at Brixton Theatre. A child who could sing and dance was needed to round out the troupe, and Alice volunteered her daughter. While working in the production Alice heard of Italia Conti, who taught dance, elocution and the rudiments of acting.

25|$|In {{their first}} year of medical work at Hsiang-Ya, Greene noted the {{challenge}} in interacting with the local staff. He was also met with opposition from Changsha townspeople <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> foreigner to be a bad omen, a possible cause of the flooding and the Cholera outbreak that were affecting their town. Due to a new policy of aiding only Chinese-administered programs, the Rockefeller Foundation withdrew funding from Greene's medical work, and the Hsiang-Ya hospital was closed for the summer of 1924.|$|E
25|$|New Plymouth {{was laid}} out over 550 acres (2.2km²), with {{additional}} rural sections proposed along the coast beyond Waitara, covering a total of 68,500 acres (274km²). By year’s end his map of the town showed 2267 sections ready for selection by settlers, with streets, squares, hospitals, schools and parks surrounded by boulevards that separated the town from the suburban districts. For decades, however, Carrington would come under attack from settlers <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> location of New Plymouth had been poorly chosen {{because of the lack}} of a natural harbour.|$|E

Lewis wrote back, appearing to support the younger Krieg's views, although he did point out that the views of the author {{may not be the best}} guidance, and that perhaps it would not matter what order they were read in.|$|E
25|$|The Czech coup, the PCF's failed {{policy of}} {{sabotage}} and the Marshall Plan's likely passage were all beginning to sway French public opinion. 70% of French people now believed the U.S. {{would do more}} than any other country to help France, compared to 7% <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> USSR would do more. Despite French concern about Germany, it was becoming increasingly clear that the Soviet threat was greater than the German. France would still seek an advantageous power position vis-à-vis Germany, but it was becoming reconciled to the prospect of a rehabilitated Germany as part of postwar Europe.|$|E
25|$|Hart grew up {{in central}} Tasmania with an older brother, Lance and two younger sisters, Gayle and Cheryl. He gravitated toward sports, in {{particular}} Australian football, which upset his mother, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> game too rough. Hart was educated at Clarence High School and participated in football and athletics. He played as a rover in the Tasmanian under-15 schoolboys team before his growth spurt, and held a junior high-jumping record for about 20 years. Playing on the ball helped develop his ground skills, but {{he was able to}} exert greater presence on the field after his growth spurt.|$|E

25|$|In 1531, {{primarily}} {{as a result of}} the innovative suggestion of Thomas Cranmer, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> King's position in the divorce would be strengthened by obtaining favourable opinions from the various universities in England and abroad, Henry VIII sent Dr. Bell, together with the bishop of Lincoln and Foxe, to deliver a letter that he had personally drafted and to canvass Oxford, for a favourable opinion concerning the King's cause; of which they successfully secured despite the danger, being pelted with stones by the popish opposition, together while overcoming the strong resistance from the junior members of convocation.|$|E
25|$|On 21 August 1911, the {{painting}} was stolen from the Louvre. The theft was not discovered until the next day, when painter Louis Béroud walked into the museum {{and went to the}} Salon Carré where the Mona Lisa had been on display for five years, only to find four iron pegs on the wall. Béroud contacted the head of the guards, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> painting was being photographed for promotional purposes. A few hours later, Béroud checked back with the Section Chief of the Louvre who confirmed that the Mona Lisa was not with the photographers. The Louvre was closed for an entire week during the investigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{revolution}} that replaced the monarchy of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi with Islamism and Khomeini {{rather than with}} another leader and ideology, is credited {{in part to the}} spread of the Shia version of the Islamic revival that opposed Westernization and saw Ayatollah Khomeini as {{following in the footsteps of}} the Shi'a Imam Husayn ibn Ali and the Shah in the role of Husayn's foe, the hated tyrant Yazid I. Other factors include the underestimation of Khomeini's Islamist movement by both the Shah's reign – who considered them a minor threat compared to the Marxists and Islamic socialists – and by the secularist, opponents of the government – <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Khomeinists could be sidelined.|$|E
