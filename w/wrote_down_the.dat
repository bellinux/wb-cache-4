5|$|At {{some time}} between his {{coronation}} and his death, Darius left a tri-lingual monumental relief on Mount Behistun, {{which was written}} in Elamite, Old Persian and Babylonian. The inscription begins with a brief autobiography including his ancestry and lineage. To aid the presentation of his ancestry, Darius <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> sequence of events that occurred {{after the death of}} Cyrus the Great. Darius mentions several times that he is the rightful king by the grace of Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian god. In addition, further texts and monuments from Persepolis have been found, as well as a clay tablet containing an Old Persian cuneiform of Darius from Gherla, Romania (Harmatta) and a letter from Darius to Gadates, preserved in a Greek text of the Roman period.|$|E
5|$|The classic view of Domitian {{is usually}} negative, {{since most of}} the antique sources were related to the Senatorial or aristocratic class, with which Domitian had {{notoriously}} difficult relations. Furthermore, contemporary historians such as Pliny the Younger, Tacitus and Suetonius all <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> information on his reign after it had ended, and his memory had been condemned to oblivion. The work of Domitian's court poets Martial and Statius constitutes virtually the only literary evidence concurrent with his reign. Perhaps as unsurprising as the attitude of post-Domitianic historians, the poems of Martial and Statius are highly adulatory, praising Domitian's achievements as equalling those of the gods.|$|E

40|$|In {{mathematical}} instruction, {{problem solving}} {{in a real}} life is usually actualized in form of word problems. In fact however the student’s ability in word problems is very poor. The low of student ability is shown {{with the number of}} errors they made. Hence error analysis needs to do to know where the students make mistakes. The method {{that can be used to}} analyze student’s errors is Newman’s Error Analysis (NEA). There are five steps in Newman’s Error Analysis Method, they are: reading, comprehension, transformation, process skill, and encoding. This study is aimed to describe: (1) errors that very often done by students in solving word problems, and (2) forms of error done by students in solving word problems. The study is a quantitative descriptive research. The study was implemented to students of SMP Muhammadiyah 06 DAU Malang grade of VIII-A. The data collection used test and interview. The data analysis used descriptive analysis to the forms of student’s error. While the simple statistical analysis is used to level of errors made by students in solving word problems in Newman’s prompt. The result of study shown that errors which very often done by students in solving word problems placed in encoding step. The errors in reading step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> meaning of word/phrase unproperly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> meaning of word/phrase that is not very clear, give meaning of word/phrase incompletely, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> meaning of word/phrase at all. The errors in comprehension step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> given components incorrectly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> given components briefly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> given and asked components incompletely, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> given and asked components at all. The errors in transformation step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> method unproperly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> method incompletely, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> method at all. The errors in process skill step are: doing computation in wrong method, doing errors in computation, doing misconception, not continuing the procedure of solution, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> procedure of solution. The errors in encoding step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding incorrectly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding in properer unit, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding properly, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding at al...|$|R

Baruch remained true to the teachings and ideals of the great prophet, although like his master he was at times almost overwhelmed with despondency. While Jeremiah was in hiding to avoid the wrath of King Jehoakim, he commanded Baruch to read his prophecies of warning to the people gathered in the Temple in Jerusalem on a day of fasting. The task was both difficult and dangerous, but Baruch performed it without flinching and it was probably on this occasion that the prophet gave him the personal message.|$|E
