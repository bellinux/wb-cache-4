Production of castings from standard kinds of nodular cast irons is quite good managed, but manufacturing of mark GJS 400 - 18 LT with excellent strength and plastic properties by minus temperatures is complicated, because it reacts very sensitively on the changing of melting conditions and metallurgical treatment.

The sensor housing extends outside the spacecraft body to have a field of view (FOV) without interference from other components on the spacecraft panels.

Furthermore, conductive white paint (UPI WHITE LT 48) is painted on a part of sensor housing surface opposite to the sun to enhance heat radiation into space.

40|$|The Pulse Echo (PE) {{technique}} {{is a widely}} used ultrasonic non destructive testing technique to test materials by analyzing ultrasound echoes reflected from flaws and discontinuities. In conventional PE technique, called contact type PE, an ultrasonic transducer is in constant contact <b>with</b> a <b>test</b> <b>piece,</b> transmitting and receiving ultrasonic signals from the test specimen. The inherent shortcomings of PE are the need for; uniform couplant conditions, the ultrasonic transducer to remain in contact <b>with</b> the <b>test</b> object throughout the scan and a limitation to scan regular surfaced objects only. This paper provides for extending a system initially developed for contact type PE, to perform Immersion Testing (IT) which is a contactless pulse-echo inspection method with the probe and <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> separated by a predetermined volume of water of certain thickness. A computer controlled 3 -axis transducer position manipulator (motion frame) is constructed for assistance in conducting automated tests. The efficacy of immersion testing relies on the precise control of the motion of transducer. The existing immersion type motion controllers along with dedicated data acquisition and analysis system are quite expensive and are beyond the affordability of smaller ultrasonic labs.

In some applications, the relationship between the signals and the material parameters is simple and straightforward. An analytic mathematical function can be easily constructed and solved to describe the interaction. The inverse function also can be readily determined to transform the measured data into the desired information. In some cases, such as defect characterizations, the interaction between the sensing field and the test object is often too complicated for such an approach. Advanced signal analysis techniques with complex assumptions, approximations, and computations are required to interpret the signals. Such an intricate approach is frequently time consuming and beyond general comprehension.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{experimental and}} computational investigations {{on the high}} temperature mechanical behaviour of two single crystal (SC) nickel-base superalloys, SC CM 186 LC (or CM 186 SX) and CMSX- 4. The main objective of the research is to investigate the mechanical behaviour of CM 186 SX under combined cyclic thermal and mechanical loading. A review of worldwide activities on thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) testing was completed. Coated and uncoated hollow <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> of CM 186 SX {{were used in the}} experimental programme. The TMF cycles applied were in-phase (IP), out-of-phase (OP) and counter-clockwise diamond cycles. Different ratios (R) of the minimum to maximum mechanical strain were applied within total strain ranges between 0. 25 % and 1. 0 %. The experimental results showed that, when compared <b>with</b> uncoated <b>test</b> <b>pieces,</b> there was a reduction in life caused by the use of coating, especially in OP cycle tests. The OP cycle was also found to be more damaging than the in-phase cycle for the different R-ratios investigated. Metallographic observation provided useful information on the features of crack initiation and fracture behaviour of the <b>test</b> <b>pieces.</b> There was also a significant influence on the behaviour of the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> due to variation in the wall thickness of the <b>test</b> <b>piece.</b> This was later confirmed by metallographic observation and 3 -D finite element (FE) analyses of the <b>test</b> <b>piece.</b> Finite element simulations of existing high temperature isothermal tensile and low cycle fatigue tests of CMSX- 4 and CM 186 SX were performed using an elastic-creep material model. The same exercise was also performed for the TMF tests. The objective was to assess and validate the predictive capabilities of the material model under varying load and temperature conditions at high temperatures. The FE results showed that the elastic-creep material model was able to predict mechanical behaviour of the materials investigated at high temperatures when creep deformation was dominant. For TMF tests, the prediction was satisfactory provided there was no low temperature plasticity.

This paper focuses on (a) distribution of samples of Nimonic 90, (b) {{the establishment of a}} protocol for testing and reporting results, and (c) the analysis of the results. Participants in the inter-comparison exercise comprised eight inner-circle partners who primarily used <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> which were all manufactured at the same workshop, albeit of three different <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> geometries, and ten outer-circle participants who manufactured their own <b>test</b> <b>pieces,</b> of their own in-house geometry. Each participant undertook three repeat in-phase (IP) tests and three repeat out-of-phase (OP) tests. The tests were conducted at temperatures cycling between 400 C and 850 C, with a strain range selected to give a failure life of approximately 1000 cycles, resulting in a stress range of up to 1000 MPa. The testing conditions were chosen following a preliminary evaluation of critical testing parameters. Results from solid circular and solid flat <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> geometries, together <b>with</b> hollow tubular <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> have been compared. The influence of temperature measurement using different types of temperature sensors has also been investigated. In-house repeatability has been assessed, together with inter-laboratory reproducibility. The results have been correlated with modulus and thermal expansion data for individual tests. Initially, the largest contribution to scatter in the results was attributed to human errors in reporting the results, compounded by computer assisted ¿cut-and-paste¿ errors. Once these obvious discrepancies had been corrected, it was possible to use the data sets to point to some recommendations regarding testing procedures that can be incorporated into the Code of Testing Practice [Ha¨hner P et al.

All the three <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> made of stainless steel wires with the same wire diameter (d = 0. 14 mm) were sintered after woven.

Garret Engine {{is a type of}} air {{breathing}} engine. It comes under the category of Turboprop engines of Gas turbine engine. As separate shafts are used for propeller and turbine, this aids them to rotate at different RPM. A torsion shaft is used to transmit the torque from main shaft to propeller shaft. Torsion shaft is used to give a deflection which is also used to measure the torque of the engine. This torsion shaft is internally connected with the main power transmission shaft and its other end is coupled to a coupler shaft with engagement of its internal splines to the external splines of coupler shaft. Further this coupler connects to the gearing system and transmits power to the propeller shaft. Due to Continues variable load over internal splines, it is subjected to high rate of wear and tear.
