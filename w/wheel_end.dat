50|$|An S-cam {{is part of}} a {{braking system}} used in heavy {{vehicles}} such as trucks and wheeled machinery. It consists of a shaft, usually around 4 to 25 inches long, turned at one end by means of an air-powered brake booster and lever with an 'S' shaped cam at the <b>wheel</b> <b>end.</b> Turning the shaft pushes the brake shoes against the drum, producing friction.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{arrangement is}} to use long coupling rods, running horizontally. A large vertical movement at the <b>wheel</b> <b>end</b> gives rise to only a small horizontal movement at the jackshaft drive. For a diesel-mechanical locomotive this can be compensated for by horizontally compliant mounting of the transmission. The heavy engine is carried over the drive wheels for adhesion weight, but the relatively lightweight gearbox can be mounted at one end, beyond the coupled wheelbase. A final drive casing is also narrow enough to mount between the frames, allowing it to be mounted low down and level with the driving axles.|$|E

2500|$|In {{engineering}} terms, [...] "four-wheel drive" [...] designates {{a vehicle}} with power delivered to four <b>wheel</b> <b>ends</b> spread over {{at least two}} axles. The term 4×4 (pronounced four by four) was in use to describe North American military four-wheel-drive vehicles {{as early as the}} 1940s, with the first number indicating the number of <b>wheel</b> <b>ends</b> on a vehicle and the second indicating the number of driven wheels.|$|R
40|$|This {{proof-of-concept}} {{research was}} performed to explore the feasibility of using real-world braking data from commercial motor vehicles to make a diagnosis of brake condition {{similar to that of}} the performance-based brake tester (PBBT). This was done by determining the relationship between pressure and brake force (P-BF), compensating for the gross vehicle weight (GVW). The nature of this P-BF relationship (e. g., low braking force for a given brake application pressure) may indicate brake system problems. In order to determine the relationship between brake force and brake application pressure, a few key parameters of duty cycle information were collected. Because braking events are often brief, spanning only a few seconds, a sample rate of 10 Hz was needed. The algorithm under development required brake application pressure and speed (from which deceleration was calculated). Accurate weight estimation was also needed to properly derive the braking force from the deceleration. In order to ensure that braking force was the predominant factor in deceleration for the segments of data used in analysis, the data was screened for grade as well. Also, the analysis needed to be based on pressures above the crack pressure. The crack pressure is the pressure below which the individual brakes are not applied due the nature of the mechanical system. This value, which may vary somewhat from one <b>wheel</b> <b>end</b> to another, is approximately 10 psi. Therefore, only pressures 15 psi and above were used in the analysis. The Department of Energy s Medium Truck Duty Cycle research has indicated that under the real-world circumstances of the test vehicle brake pressures of up to approximately 30 psi can be expected. Several different types of data were collected during the testing task of this project. Constant-pressure stopping tests were conducted at several combinations of brake application pressure (15, 20, 25, and 30 psi), load conditions (moderately and fully laden), and speeds (20 and 30 mph). Data was collected at 10 Hz. Standard and stepped-pressure performance-based brake tests with brake pressure transducers were performed for each loading condition. The stepped-pressure test included the constant-pressure intervals of brake application at 15, 20, 25, and 30 psi. The PBBT data files included 10 Hz streaming data collected during the testing of each axle. Two weeks of real-world duty cycle (driving and braking) data was also collected at 10 Hz. Initial analysis of the data revealed that the data collected in the field (i. e., day-to-day operations) provided the same information as that obtained from the controlled tests. Analysis of the data collected revealed a strong linear relationship between brake application pressure and deceleration for given GVWs. As anticipated, initial speed was not found to be a significant factor in the deceleration-pressure relationship, unlike GVW. The positive results obtained from this proof of concept test point to the need for further research to expand this concept. A second phase should include testing over a wider range of speeds and include medium brake application pressures in addition to the low pressures tested in this research. Testing on multiple vehicles would also be of value. This future phase should involve testing to determine how degradation of braking performance affects the pressure-deceleration relationship...|$|E

Traditionally, these weights have been made of lead; {{it is estimated that}} up to 500,000 pounds of lead, having fallen off car <b>wheels,</b> <b>ended</b> up in the environment. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, worldwide these total more than 20,000 tonnes of lead annually, and therefore the use of less-toxic materials is encouraged. In Europe, lead weights have been banned since 2005; in the US, some states have also banned them. Alternatives are weights made of lead alloys that include zinc or copper, or weights that are altogether lead-free.|$|R
