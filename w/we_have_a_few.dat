25|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Iran by Muslim Arabs, Peroz III, son of Yazdegerd III, escaped {{along with a few}} Persian nobles and took refuge in the Chinese imperial court. Both Peroz and his son Narsieh (Chinese neh-shie) were given high titles at the Chinese court. On at least two occasions, the last possibly in 670, Chinese troops were sent with Peroz in order to restore him to the Sassanid throne with mixed results, one possibly ending in a short rule of Peroz in Sakastan, from which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> remaining numismatic evidences. Narsieh later attained the position of a commander of the Chinese imperial guards, and his descendants lived in China as respected princes. The sister of the Sassanian Prince Peroz III was married into the imperial court, which allowed Sassanian refugees fleeing from the Arab conquest to settle in China. The Emperor of China at this time was Emperor Gaozong of Tang.|$|E

Who knows how many people have been sacrificed on the battlefields and in the prisons ? Now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> cases of illness and death: it's nothing! ...|$|E
2500|$|... nerves are {{stretched}} like a wire; the simplest outing becomes a huge challenge – I {{have to have}} Angela's arm to support me most days... my balance {{or lack of it}} is probably my biggest problem. My blessings are my memories and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> very loyal friends who help us through the bad days... Financially all's well. Thank goodness my wife, who holds nothing of the past over my head, is constantly at my side. Real love never dies. We share a sense of humour which at times is vital. If I have a philosophy it is that life doesn't put everything your way. It takes a little back. I strive to remember the ups rather than the downs. I {{have a lot of time}} with my thoughts these days and sometimes they hurt so much I can hardly bear it. However, my friends always associate me with the song: [...] "When You're Smiling..." [...] lt isn't always easy but I'm trying to live up to it.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes;--exactly; no doubt;--but I {{thought that}} perhaps we might better {{understand}} each other if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words of quiet conversation upon the subject. I believe you know the steps that I have--" ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} during their appearance at Rock in Rio in September 2017, Noodles and Holland {{talked about the}} new Offspring album, with the former commenting, [...] "We've got a few songs already done. We wanna do a couple more, and we definitely want to get something out soon. Our fans have waited long enough, I think, so we wanna get something in their hands that they can listen to and hold, and put in their ears." [...] Holland added that the album will [...] "for sure" [...] be released in 2018. In an October 2017 interview, however, Holland said, [...] "I think I want to do like an EP. It's kind of what people are doing these days and it makes for less time in between stuff. It has been five years for us so <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> songs together and I'm hoping to get something out by early next year." [...] In the same month, bassist Greg K. mentioned a possible 2018 release date for the new Offspring album, and revealed {{that one of the}} reasons for the album's slow progress is because they have been working on songs here and there. He also stated that the band is no hurry to finish the album.|$|E

6000|$|... "I wish <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more {{officers}} {{trained to}} {{this sort of}} warfare," [...] General Wolfe said. [...] "Send him on board the Sutherland tomorrow. I have some service which he is well fitted to carry out." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Maybough pursued: [...] "We receive on Thursdays, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> friends {{coming in}} to-morrow afternoon, {{and we should}} be very glad to see you, if you have nothing better." ...|$|E

60|$|Before this happened, however, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> brief {{intervals}} of modified dripping. During one of these, {{in which the}} rain all but ceased for a forenoon, I resolved {{to go out into}} one of the mountain gorges for a ramble alone. My host lent me his double barrel--one barrel being for shot, the other rifled.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{must have}} an {{agreement}} to that effect," [...] said Rachel, [...] "or we must go back to Ireland. I must have the agreement before Christmas, or we shall go back. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> pounds which will take us away." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, indeed, Larry," [...] agreed Walter, who {{was furious}} {{at what he}} saw. [...] "I wish <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> squadrons of Sarsfield's horse here.

Whatever happens, we must not get into any brawl. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mission to perform, and must not think of ourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|Watts laughed good-naturedly. [...] "Listen, Harris. You {{know as well}} as I do that's a lot of poppycock. They're no more plants {{than you}} or I. They just don't want to work, that's all.

5000|$|In recent years, Brown {{claims to}} have rethought this approach. Talking about the team's second {{appearance}} on Hard Knocks, Brown stated, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> different team now than <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years ago. <b>We</b> want the public to see them.

5000|$|At {{its peak}} in the mid-1980s, People sold about 250,000 copies a week and was the fourth biggest-selling weekly {{magazine}} in Australia. Then editor David Naylor said women were 30 per cent of the magazine's audience: [...] "They liked doing the giant crossword on the train, and the stories were fun. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> nipples {{but it was all}} very wholesome and non-threatening." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Thank you, but we {{have enough}} {{for two or three}} days. When that is gone, we will give you some money to buy more; for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> rupees with us, as we knew it might be some time before {{we should be able to}} kill a tiger." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE SECRETARY. If {{anyone should}} {{come before the}} time dont take any notice.

5000|$|Following a fourth-place finish, Logano {{said that}} he, unfortunately, [...] "didn’t win and that’s {{what we wanted}} to do. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> good runs and made an {{adjustment}} that just took it out of the track {{and by the time we}} got it back we lost too much track position. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> bad pit stop under green and lost more there, so it was too little, too late. We couldn’t redeem ourselves after a couple mistakes.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For all that, I wish <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more of them.

I believe I'd forgive that old villain on the spot if he turned up with any sort of explanation that I could in decency accept.' ...|$|R
