25|$|The Ghana Empire {{may have}} been an {{established}} kingdom as early as the 4th century AD, founded among the Soninke by Dinge Cisse. Ghana was first mentioned by Arab geographer Al-Farazi in the late 8th century. Ghana was inhabited by urban dwellers and rural farmers. The urban dwellers were the administrators of the empire, who were Muslims, and the Ghana (king), who practiced traditional religion. Two towns existed, one where the Muslim administrators and Berber-Arabs lived, which was connected by a stone-paved road to the king's residence. The rural dwellers lived in villages, which joined together into broader polities that pledged loyalty to the Ghana. The Ghana was viewed as divine, and his physical well-being reflected on the <b>whole</b> <b>society.</b> Ghana converted to Islam around 1050, after conquering Aoudaghost.|$|E
25|$|From the October Revolution onward, Lenin {{had used}} {{repression}} against perceived {{enemies of the}} Bolsheviks as a systematic method of instilling fear and facilitating social control, especially during the campaign {{commonly referred to as}} the Red Terror. This policy continued and intensified under Stalin, periods of heightened repression including the deportation of kulaks who opposed collectivization, and a severe famine in Ukraine. A distinctive feature of the Great Purge was that, for the first time, members of the ruling party were included on a massive scale as victims of the repression. Due to the scale of the terror, the substantial victims of the purges were Communist Party members and office-holders. The purge of the Party was accompanied by the purge of the <b>whole</b> <b>society.</b> The following events are used for the demarcation of the period.|$|E

Since then the Bengali speaking community were divided into two parts – the East and the West Bengal. It turns into the smashing of the millennium-old culture and unity of Bengali nation. Moreover, the existence of language became a great question just after the creation of Pakistan. The West-Pakistan ruling government tried to impose Urdu as the principal language on the Bengali people. But the <b>whole</b> <b>society</b> reacted strongly. This leaves a permanent impression on Bengali literature. In this tumultuous era, Syed Waliullah's Lalsalu (1948) was published. It was the foremost successful novel, both from art and reality points of view. Later Syed Waliullah translated it in English by the name Tree Without Roots. Mahbub-ul Alam wrote Mofijon, also published in 1948.|$|E
25|$|In another {{empirical}} study, Chaudhry (2009) investigated {{factors affecting}} rural poverty in Southern Punjab (Pakistan), and {{he concluded that}} alleviation of poverty is possible by lowering the household size and dependency ratio, improving education, increasing female labor participation. He employed Logit regression models and used primary source of data from the project area of Asian Development Bank for estimation. Results indicate that as dependency level and household size increase the probability of being poor increases too. Education has the significant inverse relationship with poverty because it provides employment opportunities and rejects poverty. The inclusion of trained and education women workforce will not only ensure women's welfare, it will also increase the overall productivity of the workforce due to more competitiveness. Hence, the developmental and feminist economists {{argue that it is}} desirable for the government to allocate more resources towards women's education, as it is going to benefit the <b>whole</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
25|$|Japan's society prepares {{its people}} to work {{primarily}} {{for the good of}} the <b>whole</b> <b>society</b> rather than just the individual, and the salaryman is a part of that. Salarymen are expected to work long hours, additional overtime, to participate in after-work leisure activities such as drinking and visiting hostess bars with colleagues, and to value work over all else. The salaryman typically enters a company after graduating college and stays with that corporation his whole career. Other popular notions surrounding salarymen include karōshi, or death from overwork. In conservative Japanese culture, becoming a salaryman is the expected career choice for young men and those who do not take this career path are regarded as living with a stigma and less prestige. On the other hand, the word salaryman is sometimes used with derogatory connotation for his total dependence on his employer and lack of individuality.|$|E

25|$|At Tibur and Falerii their sacerdos was a male, called pontifex sacrarius, {{fact that}} {{has been seen as}} a proof of the {{relevance}} of the goddess to the <b>whole</b> <b>society.</b> In both towns she was known as Curitis, the spearholder, an armed protectress. The martial aspect of these Junos is conspicuous, quite as that of fecundity and regality: the first two look strictly interconnected: fertility guaranteed the survival of the community, peaceful and armed. Iuno Curitis is also the tutelary goddess of the curiae and of the new brides, whose hair was combed with the spear called caelibataris hasta as in Rome. In her annual rites at Falerii youths and maiden clad in white bore in procession gifts to the goddess whose image was escorted by her priestesses. The idea of purity and virginity is stressed in Ovid's description. A she goat is sacrificed to her after a ritual hunting. She is then the patroness of the young soldiers and of brides.|$|E
500|$|The Raft of the Medusa {{was first}} {{shown at the}} 1819 Paris Salon, under the title Scène de Naufrage (Shipwreck Scene), {{although}} its real subject would have been unmistakable for contemporary viewers. The exhibition was sponsored by Louis XVIII and featured nearly 1,300 paintings, 208 sculptures and numerous other engravings and architectural designs. Géricault's canvas was the star at the exhibition: [...] "It strikes and attracts all eyes" [...] (Le Journal de Paris). Louis XVIII visited {{three days before the}} opening and said: [...] "", or [...] "Monsieur Géricault, you've painted a shipwreck, but it's not one for you". The critics were divided: the horror and [...] "terribilità" [...] of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a [...] "pile of corpses", whose realism they considered {{a far cry from the}} [...] "ideal beauty" [...] represented by Girodet's Pygmalion and Galatea, which triumphed the same year. Géricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? Marie-Philippe Coupin de la Couperie, a French painter and contemporary of Géricault, provided one answer: [...] "Monsieur Géricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel." [...] The painting had fervent admirers too, including French writer and art critic Auguste Jal, who praised its political theme, its liberal position–its advancement of the negro and critique of ultra-royalism–and its modernity. The historian Jules Michelet approved: [...] "our <b>whole</b> <b>society</b> is aboard the raft of the Medusa".|$|E
