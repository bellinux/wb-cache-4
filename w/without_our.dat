25|$|Von Hartmann {{called his}} {{philosophy}} a transcendental realism, because {{in it he}} professed to reach by means of induction from the broadest possible basis of experience a knowledge of that which lies beyond experience. A certain portion of consciousness, namely perception, begins, changes and ends <b>without</b> <b>our</b> consent and often in direct opposition to our desires. Perception, then, cannot be adequately explained from the ego alone, {{and the existence of}} things outside experience must be posited. Moreover, since they act upon consciousness and do so in different ways at different times, they must have those qualities assigned to them which would make such action possible. Causality is thus made the link that connects the subjective world of ideas with the objective world of things.|$|E

500|$|Xenophon {{advised that}} {{male and female}} slaves should be lodged separately, that [...] "…nor {{children}} born and bred by our domestics <b>without</b> <b>our</b> knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad." [...] The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so {{it may have been}} cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.|$|E

500|$|Neild's adventures {{had seen}} him lose respect in his {{political}} career, and he was now openly mocked in the Senate chamber, becoming something of a joke. He introduced a number of bills in his remaining {{five years in the}} Senate, all of which lapsed. He spoke in support of Muslim camel drivers and opposed military training for boys, and continued to oppose elements of the White Australia policy, raising concerns about Australian-born children of Kanaka labourers: [...] "They will have difficulties enough in front of them in a country that is so rampantly strong on the white Australia policy <b>without</b> <b>our</b> making their case worse." [...] Neild was defeated at the 1910 election.|$|E
500|$|Pächt {{described}} {{the work in}} terms of an [...] "interior illusion", noting {{the manner in which the}} viewer's eye falls across the nave, the crossing, but [...] "only then, [...] looking through and over the rood screen, the choir." [...] From this Pächt views the perspective as deliberately lacking cohesion, as [...] "the relationship between the parts of the building is not shown in full... The transition from foreground to background is ingeniously masked by the figure of the Madonna herself, who obscures the crossing pier; the middle ground is practically eliminated and our eye crosses over it <b>without</b> <b>our</b> becoming aware of it." [...] The illusion is enhanced by the use of colour to suggest light: the interior is dim and in shadow while the unseen exterior seems bathed in bright light.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Congressman Tom McClintock {{introduced}} HR 1668, the [...] "Save Our Water Act", which [...] "amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) {{to suspend}} during droughts {{the application of}} the ESA to water releases from water storage facilities by federal and state agencies in a navigable river basin." [...] McClintock specifically cited the release of [...] from New Melones Lake over several weeks in spring 2015, when New Melones Lake was approaching its lowest level on record since the 1992 drought. That year, very few fish had returned to the Stanislaus to spawn; in an editorial for MyMotherLode, Mark Truppner wrote: [...] "Biologists estimate that it will affect the offspring of about 29 steelhead trout in the Stanislaus River – a few hundred smolts [...] almost all of which will be eaten by predators long before they reach the ocean.

500|$|Kateřina's health {{gradually}} worsened and in {{the spring}} of 1859 failed completely. Homeward bound, she died at Dresden on 19April 1859. Smetana wrote that she had died [...] "gently, <b>without</b> <b>our</b> knowing anything until the quiet drew my attention to her." [...] After placing Žofie with Kateřina's mother, Smetana spent time with Liszt in Weimar, where he was introduced to the music of the comic opera Der Barbier von Bagdad, by Liszt's pupil Peter Cornelius. This work would influence Smetana's own later career as an opera composer. Later that year he stayed with his younger brother Karel, {{and fell in love with}} Karel's sister-in-law Barbora (Bettina) Ferdinandiová, sixteen years his junior. He proposed marriage, and having secured her promise returned to Gothenburg for the 1859–60 winter. The marriage took place the following year, on 10July 1860, after which Smetana and his new wife returned to Sweden for a final season. This culminated in April 1861 with a piano performance in Stockholm, attended by the Swedish royal family. The couple's first daughter, Zdeňka, was born in September 1861.|$|E
500|$|A {{reporter}} for E4's official website described Mercedes saying [...] "She's no angel but the Village {{would be far}} less entertaining <b>without</b> <b>our</b> Mercedes. This glamorous McQueen can't seem to keep herself out of trouble – {{more often than not}} due to her tendency to hop into bed with those she shouldn't!" [...] They later said Mercedes is invincible, as [...] "no matter evils she perpetrates, somehow she still manages to come out smelling of roses". Hollyoaks international broadcaster BBC America has described Mercedes stating: [...] "Cocky, confident, and mean with a right hook, Mercedes McQueen isn't afraid of anyone, especially not a man. She knows what effects her assets have on the opposite sex, and she always gets what she wants". What's on TV described her as the [...] "man-eater of the McQueen clan" [...] who will not [...] "take any nonsense" [...] and is not [...] "shy {{when it comes to a}} scrap!" [...] Digital Spy described Mercedes as [...] "known for her fiery temper and sharp tongue". Mercedes has also been described as [...] "mouthy", a [...] "minx", a [...] "bitchy maneater", [...] "feisty", [...] "troubled", [...] "gorgeous", a [...] "sultry siren" [...] and [...] "spirited" [...] by various media sources.|$|E
500|$|Aware that Imperial {{troops had}} {{breached}} the Schellenberg's defences Marlborough launched a third assault. This time the attackers formed a broader front, requiring d'Arco's men to spread their fire, thus reducing the deadly {{effectiveness of their}} musketry and grenades. But the defenders, including la Colonie, (unaware that the Imperialists had penetrated their left flank, and that d'Arco had retreated to Donauwörth), were still confident {{in their ability to}} repel the enemy– [...] "We remained steady at our post; our fire was regular as ever, and kept our opponents in check." [...] It was not long, however, before the Franco-Bavarian forces fighting on the hill became conscious of Baden's infantry approaching {{from the direction of the}} town. Many of the officers, including de la Colonie, initially thought that the advancing troops were reinforcements from DuBordet's garrison in Donauwörth, but it soon became apparent that they were in fact Baden's troops. [...] "They [...] arrived within gunshot of our flank about 7:30 in the evening, <b>without</b> <b>our</b> being aware of the possibility of such a thing." [...] Wrote de la Colonie. [...] "So occupied were we in defence of our own particular post..." [...] After establishing themselves at the summit of the Heights on the Allied right, Baden's men now fired upon the surprised defenders of the Schellenberg, compelling them to re-align in order to meet this unexpected threat. Consequently, Marlborough's assaulting troops on the Allied left, supported by a fresh echelon of dismounted English dragoons, were able to scramble over the now weakly defended breastwork and push the defenders back to the crown of the hill. The enemy at last fell into confusion.|$|E
