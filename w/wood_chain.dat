This study investigated the influence of sawn <b>wood</b> commodity <b>chain</b> profile on its performance. Data were collected from the production and distribution chain of 35 production units selected randomly. Production batches comprising of at least fifteen logs each were used at each unit to collect data on volume recovery factor, value addition and revenue distribution between participants in the unit’s distribution chain. One-way multivariate analysis of variance was used to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in performance parameters between the sawn <b>wood</b> commodity <b>chain</b> channels. Results revealed a significant multivariate effect (p< 0. 05) for channel of operation on performance thus rejecting the null hypothesis. Univariate ANOVA showed significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the channels on all the three performance parameters.

Consequently, the ambrosia beetles Trypodendron domesticum L. and T. signatum (Fabricius) (Coleoptera, Scolytidae) initiated outbreaks and, in 2000 and 2001, they heavily contributed to the depreciation of nearly 1, 600, 000 m 3 of stem volume (to upper limit girth of 22 cm) in the natural regions of “Ardenne” and “Belgian Lorraine”. Because of the lack of biogeographical data on both insects, of their conspicuous aggressiveness towards apparently healthy trees and of the economic importance of the beech <b>wood</b> <b>chain</b> in Belgium, a large-scale survey was undertaken in 2001, in order to outline the range of both ambrosia beetles in Wallonia.

However, <b>wood</b> <b>chain</b> management in these contexts differs from the traditional schemes due to the limits imposed by terrain morphology, both for the operation planning aspects and the hardware requirements. In fact, forest organizational and technical problems require a wider strategic and detailed level of planning to reach the level of productivity of forest operation techniques applied on flatlands. In particular, a perfect knowledge of forest inventories improves long-term management sustainability and efficiency allowing {{a better understanding of}} forest ecosystems.

Recent interest in producing energy from wood has raised questions about how a vibrant wood-energy market will impact the traditional southern <b>wood</b> supply <b>chain.</b> By using a survey of consulting foresters, this study examined how harvest tract size, forest ownership, and forest industry structure have changed within the U. S. South and how foresters expect the wood-energy market to impact the <b>wood</b> supply <b>chain</b> in the future. Results indicate that there are currently inadequate markets for timber as a result of expanded timber supply and reduced forest products industry capacity. Only 12 % of respondents reported having sold timber to an energy facility, although 98 % of respondents report their clients are willing to sell to an energy facility. In addition, 89 % of respondents believe that a vibrant wood-energy market will provide an additional market for timber and will not displace forest products industry capacity. This study found excess logging capacity as evidenced by frequent mill quotas; however, an aging logging workforce and tight credit markets make logging capacity uncertain in the long term as the U. S. economy rebounds from recession and wood-energy demand increases. The percentage of respondents reporting an average harvest tract size over 16  ha (40  ac) decreased from 95 % in 1999, to 70 % in 2009, and only 47 % predict an average harvest tract size over 16  ha (40  ac) in 2019.

The analysis of the recent policies outlined by the Japanese Government to develop the forest sector can be very interesting, since the Italian forest sector faces similar problems and potentials. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present the main policies contained in the “Forest and Forestry Revitalization Plan”, developed in 2009 as a part of the national Plan for the development of a New Growth Strategy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project is to compare the chains of importing wood or torrefied wood from Russia to the Amer power plant, from the harvesting in the forest to the generation of electricity. Both chains will use gasification before burning in the power plant itself. In order to compare these chains a few items have been selected to compare these chains on. In random order there are politics, economics, social acceptance and technical aspects. The wood in the <b>wood</b> <b>chain</b> is transported as logs because the other logical option chips is very expensive to transport and also {{needs a lot of}} treatment to be handled adequately. The basic idea behind this project is to produce sustainable energy. Based on the current figures it is concluded that the import of torrefied wood is favourable over logged wood with respect to finances and energy balance. On sustainability no conclusive data has been found to support the claim that torrefaction is better on that subject. Politics and social acceptance show no difference towards either one of the options. Forestry has been investigated and relevant figures have been found. Most figures are nearly equal for both cases because the amount of trees needed for both chains only differs about 7 % in favour of torrefaction. The difference in energy represented by the trees {{in this part of the}} chain accounts for the use of energy used by torrefaction.

Appropriate technology for industrial application is on the market, but the measurement algorithms for internal wood features are not commonly agreed by all stakeholders of the <b>wood</b> <b>chain.</b> However, it is known that inner log features affect the type and quality of products. For numerous applications ring width {{is one of the most}} important parameter as it is closely related to wood density. For this investigation, Norway spruce logs of various ring width were scanned on a 2 D (two-plane-) scanner at industrial speed and on a purposed-built wood computer tomograph. The computer tomograph was used both to reconstruct the logs by using 900 planes, and to simulate discrete tomography on two planes similar to the industrial scanner. Ring width of Norway spruce was derived from 3 -dimensional images generated by computer tomography (CT) and compared to results on the annual ring width gained from the fast industrial two source x-ray scanner. A problem arising in these studies was a large number of “local ” missing values along the length of a log due to wood heterogeneity. Wood features can be detected and measured to a high precision for all points. Thus a combination of 2 -D scanners with CT provides the possibility to match information from industrial scanning speed with high scanning resolution.

40|$|Requests {{of energy}} {{reduction}} and efficiency {{has contributed to}} improve environmental aspects in construction. It has also —mainly for the insulat-ing materials used—raised a new issue: the environmental sustainability of building materials and products. Assessment of the environmental impact produced by any human activity is, in general, very complex and nowadays very debated. It involves a local and global scale, the biosphere — in which humans {{are not the only}} protagonists — and all valuation methods must be considered. The build-ing sector in particular consumes a significant amount of resources, both when producing components and in construction. Construction uses large amount of energy for heating, releases as much pollutant emissions and form massive volumes of mixed waste after demolition. The use of wood in construction meets the main objectives for achieving sustainable development. This is possible through ecological forest man-agement combined with the low environmental impact of products made from wood. Wood is the only renewable resource in building materials. It possesses the capacity to be repaired, reused, efficiently recycled and recovered as fuel {{at the end of its}} life cycle. The contribution of this study is to quantitatively calculate and qualita-tively exam the environmental impacts —positive and negative— produced by the use of wood based components in structures. The focus is specifically insulating wood wool cement boards. The environmental sustainability assessment was combined with a technological analysis in order to verify the thermal performance of the insulation boards and the suitability of structural wood harvested from the Alps forests. The environmental assessment was performed through a life cycle analy-sis and developed according to ISO 14040 standard series, with an environmental product declaration oriented approach. The impact analy-sis was done in the specific software SimaPro 7. 3, including the uncertainty analyses. For the classification and characterization two dif-ferent life cycle impact assessment methods were used.

40|$|The {{requirements}} {{on the environmental}} and health compatibility of materials for interiors increase more and more within the last few years. Formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds (VOC), easy volatile and heavy volatile compounds (VOC and SVOC) respectively {{are part of the}} most significant pollutions of the indoor air of buildings. Certain VOC cause smell nuisances. Wood-based panels are important materials for the manufacture of buildings, furniture and other products. All wood products emit small amounts of formaldehyde. The formaldehyde release caused by formaldehyde-based adhesives, paints and coatings is of much more significance. The quantity of formaldehyde released from wood-based panels depends on a number of exogenous (e. g. atmospheric moisture, temperature, number of air exchanges) and endogenous factors (e. g. wood species, waste material, type of resin, conditions of manufacture, post-treatment of the board). The formaldehyde emissions of wood-based panels vary between very small values just above the values of untreated wood particles, if bonded with diisocyanate adhesives or phenolformaldehyde resins, and values in the range of emission class E 1 and above, if bonded with urea-formaldehyde resins. The formaldehyde emissions by UF-resins can be reduced e. g. by formaldehyde-binding agents (scavengers) such as urea, ammonium compounds, melamine or resorcinol. Challenges for the wood-based industries are the reclassification of formaldehyde by the World Health Organisation advisory board IARC as carcinogenic to humans and the trials of different European state, to regulate the emissions of building products. There has been much progress in reduction of formaldehyde emissions of wood-based panels and other wood products during recent years. The release of volatile organic compounds (VOC) concerns especially wood-based panels and other wood products. The VOC emission of wood-based panels is infuenced in particular by the wood (e. g. monoterpenes from softwood), by the type of resin (e. g. acetic acid release in alkaline medium), board manufacture (pressing conditions), post-treatment of board and utilization conditions. Different national and international commitees entered into the question of the evaluation of VOC emissions of building products. In Germany the Committee for Health-related Evaluation of Building Products (Ausschuss für die gesundheitliche Bewertung von Bauprodukten - AgBB) has elaborated test criteria and as a result develops an assessment scheme for VOC and SVOC emissions from floor coverings and from adhesives for same. The scheme sets healts-related quality standards for the future manufacture of building products for interiors and it shall support the development of particularly low-emission products. As for the homologation of floor coverings, which have to fulfil the {{requirements on}} the low-flammability, in view of the building supervision the emission tests for formaldehyde, VOC and SVOC are compulsory now. It hs to e expected that the assessment scheme elaborated by the AgBB will be expanded on other building pruducts in the near future. The release of formaldehyde and VOC from wood flakes and wood-based panels, most important test methods regarding the formaldehye and VOC emissions of wood-based panels, the VOC and formaldehyde regulations in Europe are presented in the paper. The implementation of fair regulations taking into consideration the natural origin and composition of wood is a question needing the full commitment of the forest and <b>wood</b> <b>chain...</b>|$|E
