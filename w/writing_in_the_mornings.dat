25|$|To {{build the}} first part of Tor House, a small, two story cottage, Jeffers hired a local builder, Michael Murphy. He worked with Murphy, and in this short, {{informal}} apprenticeship, he learned the art of stonemasonry. He continued adding on to Tor House throughout his life, <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> and working on the house in the afternoon. Many of his poems reflect the influence of stone and building on his life.|$|E

50|$|Episodes were {{typically}} <b>written</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> filmed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon, and shown the same evening without much editing being done. This {{added to the}} impromptu humor of the show.|$|R
50|$|An avid bicyclist, Hudson had <b>the</b> {{habit of}} <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> and then taking a ten-mile bike ride along <b>the</b> Sammamish River <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon. Her {{love of the}} {{outdoors}} extended to hiking, swimming and canoeing.|$|R
50|$|Combining law and theatre came {{naturally}} for {{he believed}} that watching an audience's reaction to his plays helped him to judge the character of witnesses <b>in</b> court.Bell would <b>write</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> before going to court or his law offices.|$|R
60|$|The hour of {{twilight}} was approaching, and {{the family}} were preparing for their daily walk. Their simple repast was finished, and Venetia held the verses which her father had <b>written</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> and which he had presented to her.|$|R
5000|$|Village People cowboy Randy Jones recalled, [...] "The Monday after Thanksgiving (1977), {{we signed}} {{contracts}} and the Tuesday after, {{we were in}} studio recording [...] "Macho Man," [...] with Victor Willis' handwritten lyrics that were <b>written</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> with egg stains and coffee rings on it. Everything was happening that quickly." ...|$|R
50|$|Nordhoff, {{who would}} <b>write</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> and spend <b>the</b> afternoons fishing, once {{explained}} {{how he and}} James Hall worked together. They initially drew up charts of all the characters, then would dole out the chapters to each other. For their joint works they each {{made an effort to}} <b>write</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other's style so as to achieve a reasonably smooth narrative.|$|R
50|$|Even {{while on}} her annual cruise around the world, Hibbert {{maintained}} her discipline. She <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings,</b> played chess <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoons, and joined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shipboard entertainments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evenings. She preferred {{to work on}} her Victoria Holt novels while on board the cruise ship {{because they did not}} require as much research or fact-checking at a library.|$|R
60|$|June 9.--I <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> {{set out for}} a walk {{at twelve}} o'clock as far as Mr. Cadell's. I found him hesitating about his views, and {{undecided}} about the Number plan. He thinks the first plan answers so much beyond expectation it is a pity to interfere with it, and talks of re-engraving the plates. This would be touchy, but nothing is resolved on.|$|R
5000|$|December 3, 1846: Patrick Breen's diary: [...] "Snowed {{a little}} last night; bright and cloudy at {{intervals}} all night.

50|$|EXAMINATION TIME-TABLEAll {{papers in}} each diet of <b>the</b> {{examination}} are <b>written</b> <b>in</b> their sequential order, two papers per examination day.

50|$|Krueger {{prefers to}} <b>write</b> early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> Rising at 5.30 am, {{he goes to}} the nearby St. Clair Broiler, where he drinks coffee and <b>writes</b> {{longhand}} <b>in</b> wirebound notebooks.|$|R
5000|$|Konigsburg {{took the}} new {{direction}} after {{the family moved}} to Port Chester in Greater New York (1962), where she continued art lessons and joined the Art Students League. She began to <b>write</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> when her third child started school. Her first-published story Jennifer, Hecate was inspired by Laurie's experience as a new girl in Port Chester. Mixed-Up Files was inspired by her children's complaints about a picnic with many amenities of home; she inferred that if they ever ran away [...] "they would certainly never consider any place less elegant than the Metropolitan Museum of Art." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've told Uncle Ben {{that you}} might help him here after school hours," [...] said the master, taking him aside. [...] "You may {{therefore}} omit your <b>writing</b> exercise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and do it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon." ...|$|R
60|$|August 24.--Corrected proofs and <b>wrote</b> letters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> Began {{a review}} upon Monteath's Planter for Lockhart.[25] Other matters at a stand. A drive down to Mertoun, and engaged to dine there on Sunday first. This {{consumed}} the day.|$|R
6000|$|Strether again, for a moment, said nothing; {{he turned}} his eyes away, and they lost themselves, through <b>the</b> open window, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dusky outer air. [...] "I shall learn from the Bank here where they're now having their letters, and my last word, which I shall <b>write</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and which they're expecting as my ultimatum, will so {{immediately}} reach them." [...] The light of his plural pronoun was sufficiently reflected in his companion's face as he again met it; and he completed his demonstration. He pursued indeed as if for himself. [...] "Of course I've first to justify what I shall do." ...|$|R
60|$|June 3.--The ugly {{symptoms}} still continue. Dr. Ross {{does not}} make much of it, and I think he is apt to look grave.[330] I <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> Dr. Macintosh Mackay came to breakfast, and brought a Gaelic book, which he has published--the Poetry of Rob Donn--some of which seems pretty as he explained it. Court kept me till near two, and then home comes I. Afternoon and evening was spent as usual. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> evening Dr. Ross ordered me to be cupped, an operation which I only knew from its being practised by that eminent medical practitioner the barber of Bagdad. It is not painful; and, I think, resembles a giant twisting about your flesh between his finger and thumb.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> {{and went}} at one o'clock {{to a meeting}} of country gentlemen, about {{bringing}} the direct road from London down by Jedburgh, {{said to be the}} nearest line by fifty miles. It is proposed the pleasant men of Teviotdale should pay, not only their own share,--that is, the expense of making the road through our own country, but also the expense of making the road under <b>the</b> Ellsdon Trust <b>in</b> Northumberland, where <b>the</b> English would positively do nothing. I stated this to the meeting as an act of Quixotry. If it be an advantage, which, unless to individuals, may be doubted, it is equally one to Northumberland as to Roxburgh, therefore I am clear that we should go [...] "acquals." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Cornerstone" [...] {{is a song}} by the English indie {{rock band}} Arctic Monkeys, {{released}} as the second single from their third album Humbug. It was released on 16 November 2009. Like the previous single [...] "Crying Lightning", the vinyl was made available in Oxfam shops. Alex Turner told Uncut magazine that he wrote this song, [...] "one morning, quite quickly." [...] He added: [...] "There's {{something to be said}} for <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> At other points <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day you're a bit more defensive. I saw it as a challenge to <b>write</b> something <b>in</b> a major key, but that wasn't cheesy." [...] It was originally <b>written</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> key of A Major. In October 2013 it was sampled by the rapper Dom Kennedy for the song [...] "Pleeze" [...] on his album Get Home Safely.|$|R
60|$|March 16.--Pleasant days make short Journals, and I {{have little}} to say to-day. I <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> at Woodstock; walked from one till four; was down at Huntly Burn and paid my respects to the ladies. The spring seems promising, and {{everything}} in great order. Visited Will Straiton's widow, who squeezed out among many tears a petition for a house. I do not think I shall let her have one, as she has a bad temper, but I will help her otherwise; she is greedy besides, as was the defunct philosopher William. In {{a year or two}} I shall have on the toft field a gallant show of extensive woodland, sweeping over the hill, and its boundaries carefully concealed. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> evening, after dinner, read Mrs. Charlotte Smith's novel of Desmond[224]--decidedly the worst of her compositions.|$|R

60|$|Owen Ford <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings.</b> <b>The</b> afternoons were {{generally}} spent in some merry outing with the Blythes. Leslie often went, too, for Captain Jim {{took charge of}} Dick frequently, in order to set her free. They went boating on the harbor and up the three pretty rivers that flowed into it; they had clambakes on the bar and mussel-bakes on the rocks; they picked strawberries on the sand-dunes; they went out cod-fishing with Captain Jim; they shot plover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shore fields and wild ducks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cove--at least, <b>the</b> men did. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> evenings they rambled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low-lying, daisied, shore fields under a golden moon, or they sat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> living room at the little house where often the coolness of the sea breeze justified a driftwood fire, and talked of the thousand and one things which happy, eager, clever young people can find to talk about.|$|R
500|$|Osbourne {{initially}} {{set out to}} form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury, and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had {{a change}} of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. [...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd <b>write</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} Gypsy?" [...] she said; and {{she made}} a cooing, kissing little noise up at the bird, who responded drowsily. [...] "Poor old Gypsum! Well, he sha'n't be disturbed. Yes, it's Gyp's delight, and Colonel Woodburn likes to <b>write</b> here <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> Think of us having a real live author <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house! And Miss Woodburn: I'm so glad you've seen her! They're Southern people." ...|$|R
5000|$|He began {{going to}} the diner {{when he was in}} his 30s and had to make time for <b>writing</b> early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> before going to work at the University of Minnesota. He {{continues}} the habit, and today has his [...] "own" [...] booth there. In return for his loyalty, the restaurant has hosted book launches for Krueger. At one of them, the staff wore T-shirts emblazoned with [...] "A nice place to visit. A great place to die." ...|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, he {{attended}} the creative writing program at Boston University where he worked with National Book Award recipient Ha Jin. While working on his novel, he taught writing at Boston University. He <b>wrote</b> till six <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and taught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoons and evenings.|$|R
50|$|In 1900 he {{was made}} editor for Gazette. In 1902 he became {{managing}} editor of the Daily News which would become the News-Press. According to St. Joseph newspaper lore at one point he would <b>write</b> an article <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> Gazette and then refute it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon News.|$|R
60|$|March 13, [Abbotsford].--I <b>wrote</b> {{a little}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and sent off some copy. We came off from Edinburgh at ten o'clock, {{and got to}} Abbotsford by four, where {{everything}} looks unusually advanced; the birds singing and the hedges budding, and all other prospects of spring too premature to be rejoiced in.|$|R
5000|$|From {{adolescence}} {{he developed}} a passion for jazz, gathering all the information he could about jazz musicians and listening to jazz songs wherever he could. In his notebooks he copied books, chronicles, interviews and news from specialty magazines. His aunt later recalled, [...] "In high school music was his only preoccupation. He wasted nights <b>writing.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> he would wake up with great difficulty to go to school." [...] Some of the notebooks ended up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possessions of important Romanian musicians, such as Radu Maltopol, Cristian Colan and Johnny Răducanu, being the only possible source for ready information about jazz at the time. Chiriac wrote press articles as well as liner notes for <b>the</b> Jazz collection. <b>In</b> 1965 he published a study of jazz <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magazine Secolul XX; a year later, he wrote the preface for the Romanian edition of Louis Armstrong's My Life in New Orleans. He was {{a founding member of}} the European Jazz Federation in 1967. According to the minutes, he described the difficult conditions of Romanian jazz musicians at the time and accepted the idea of a federation under UNESCO protection. He said the federation should focus on creating a jazz academy, a bureau for international concerts and a centre where audio and TV recordings could be exchanged.|$|R
50|$|Teams of 6 {{students}} (maximum, {{though only}} 5 can compete {{in any given}} round) compete. The competition has 4 oral rounds of 30 questions each and a <b>written</b> round <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of <b>the</b> competition day. The written round has 50 questions. The top 8 scoring teams of each grade level move into <b>the</b> elimination rounds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon. The quarter-final and semi-final rounds are oral rounds, and they are head-to-head single elimination rounds. Eventually, two teams are escorted onto a stage for the championship round. The winner {{of this part of}} the two-team competition wins the contest for that grade level.|$|R
40|$|George Osborne and Eric Pickles <b>write</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> FT this <b>morning</b> {{defending}} their planning reforms.

25|$|Frost {{attended}} Harvard University from 1897 to 1899, {{but he left}} voluntarily due to illness. Shortly {{before his}} death, Frost's grandfather purchased a farm for Robert and Elinor in Derry, New Hampshire; Frost worked the farm for nine years while <b>writing</b> early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> and producing many of the poems that would later become famous. Ultimately his farming proved unsuccessful and {{he returned to the}} field of education as an English teacher at New Hampshire's Pinkerton Academy from 1906 to 1911, then at the New Hampshire Normal School (now Plymouth State University) in Plymouth, New Hampshire.|$|R
50|$|Yoon {{worked as}} a {{programmer}} for investment management firms for twenty years before the publication of her first book. She was inspired to write her debut novel, Everything, Everything, {{after the birth of}} her biracial daughter. Yoon wanted to write a book that reflected her child on the pages. Her first-time mother worries about protecting her baby from danger gave her the idea to write a story about a 17-year-old girl who needed the same level of protection. It took Yoon three years to write <b>the</b> book, <b>writing</b> early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> while working full-time and raising her infant daughter. Her husband, Korean American graphic designer David Yoon, drew the illustrations.|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR MALLESON,--I am {{sincerely}} grieved {{that you}} begin to feel the effect of overwork; but as {{this is the first}} warning you have had, and as you are wise enough to obey it, I trust that the three months' rest will restore you all your usual powers on the conditions of using them with discretion, and not rising to <b>write</b> at two <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|R
