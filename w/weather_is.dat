5|$|Weather, {{seen from}} an anthropological perspective, is {{something}} all humans {{in the world}} constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what <b>weather</b> <b>is,</b> what makes it change, the effect it has on humans in different situations, etc. Therefore, <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> something people often communicate about.|$|E

5|$|Copenhagen {{is in the}} {{oceanic climate}} zone (Köppen: Cfb ). Its <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> subject to {{low-pressure}} systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While snowfall occurs mainly from late December to early March, there can also be rain, with average temperatures around the freezing point.|$|E

5000|$|Conflicting {{statements}} {{regarding the}} <b>weather</b> conditions <b>were</b> released. Stormy <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> initially {{cited as a}} possible cause of the crash, however it was later confirmed that the <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> good. Minister of Transportation Ignasius Jonan stated that bad <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> {{not the cause of}} the crash. Data from local Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics acknowledged that the weather {{at the time of the}} crash was sunny. The crew of another aircraft landing prior to the crash also reported conditions at the time as [...] "good".|$|R

5|$|The {{crown of}} the South Tower {{contains}} {{a band of}} 25 LED floodlights that remain lit all night. Each LED light consumes little energy and has a lifetime of 40,000 hours. These lights are used to signal the weather, just like {{the lights on the}} John Hancock Tower in Boston. The crown glows red if warmer <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> in the forecast. A blue crown signifies that cold <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> expected soon. Green means that there is at least a 50 percent chance of rain. Amber indicates that the weather will remain unchanged. This is the San Francisco Bay Area's first weather beacon. The crown began lighting up on December 8, 2008.|$|E

50|$|Universal <b>Weather</b> <b>was</b> {{founded in}} Dallas, Texas in 1959 by Tom Evans, a former United States Air Force officer and meteorologist. Universal <b>Weather</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} based out of Dallas Love Field in Dallas, Texas {{and was the}} first company to provide customized weather forecasting for business aviation. The company moved to Houston, Texas a year later. For its first ten years Universal <b>Weather</b> <b>was</b> only involved in weather forecasting. New services were added gradually as the business aviation industry grew.|$|R

5|$|<b>Weather</b> <b>is</b> {{a chaotic}} {{system that is}} readily {{modified}} by small changes to the environment, so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days. Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.|$|E
5|$|A {{major part}} of modern weather {{forecasting}} is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> expected. This is done to protect life and property. Some {{of the most commonly}} known of severe weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning, as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus is in {{the humid}} {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen: Dfb) and the <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> influenced by low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May, warmer summer months from June to August, frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months, often with snow and frost, from December to March. The city centre experiences the same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.|$|E

5|$|As autumn approaches, Teran takes {{advantage}} of Sea Mither's exhaustion to break free, and conflict between the two starts again. The power struggles cause the weather to change with darkening skies and howling winds. This time, Teran triumphs in the conflict termed the Gore vellye. Control {{of the ocean and}} <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> returned to Teran and Sea Mither is forced to leave. No details are given as to where she spends the winter, but during the storms caused by Teran the fishermen were consoled that Sea Mither would return refreshed and powerful in the spring, to again oust Teran from his malevolent grip over the seas.|$|E
5|$|Centers {{of surface}} high- and {{low-pressure}} {{areas that are}} found within closed isobars on a surface weather analysis are the absolute maxima and minima in the pressure field, and can tell a user in a glance what the general <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> in their vicinity. Weather maps in English-speaking countries will depict their highs as Hs and lows as Ls, while Spanish-speaking countries will depict their highs as As and lows as Bs.|$|E
5|$|Generally, the {{convective}} outlook boundaries or lines – general thunderstorms (light green), marginal (dark green), slight (yellow), enhanced (orange), moderate (red) {{and high}} (purple) – will be continued as an arrow or line not filled with color if the risk area enters another country (Canada or Mexico) or across waters beyond the United States coastline. This {{indicates that the}} risk for severe <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> also valid in that general area {{of the other side}} of the border or oceanic boundary.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) {{increased}} {{its efforts to}} train storm spotters to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) spotters, storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but when the <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E

5|$|Mesoscale {{discussions are}} issued to provide {{information}} on certain individual regions where severe <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> becoming a threat and states whether a watch is likely and details thereof, particularly concerning conditions conducive {{for the development of}} severe thunderstorms in the short term, as well as situations of isolated severe weather when watches are not necessary. Watches are issued when forecasters are confident that severe weather will occur, and usually precede the onset of severe weather by one hour, although this sometimes varies depending on certain atmospheric conditions that may inhibit or accelerate convective development.|$|E
