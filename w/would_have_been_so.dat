5|$|Although Jordan {{himself had}} promised {{only a single}} book, {{according}} to Sanderson neither Jordan's widow nor Doherty believed he could achieve this. Sanderson claimed {{that he could not}} do the story and characters justice with a single volume, so a split was inevitable. The decision was made to split the final book into three separate volumes, rather than two, so that a reasonably sized and unfractured volume could be released at the promised November 2009 date. Sanderson has stated that had the book remained as a single volume, {{it would not have been}} able to be released before November 2011, and likely <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> large (around 2,000 pages) that it would be unpublishable.|$|E
5|$|David Ignatius, a {{columnist}} for the Washington Post {{and the author of the}} book Body of Lies, opined that the CIA had become careless out of desperation. According to Ignatius, it would be obvious that the CIA <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> eager to acquire knowledge about the location of Osama bin Laden that it would take every available opportunity to get information. Shoshana Bryen, a U.S. security expert, said that the bombing would make Israel and the U.S. wary in their future dealings with Jordan.|$|E
25|$|Certain grand unified {{theories}} {{predict the}} existence of monopoles which, unlike elementary particles, are solitons (localized energy packets). The initial results of using these models to estimate the number of monopoles created in the big bang contradicted cosmological observations—the monopoles <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> plentiful and massive {{that they would have}} long since halted the expansion of the universe. However, the idea of inflation (for which this problem served as a partial motivation) was successful in solving this problem, creating models in which monopoles existed but were rare enough to be consistent with current observations.|$|E

500|$|Reacting to {{the renewed}} {{interest}} in the books, Bannon wrote in the 2002 introduction to Odd Girl Out that she was shocked {{to find out that}} her characters were not only remembered but that they were archetypes among the lesbian community. The books are frequently on required reading lists for Women's and LGBT studies college courses. Bannon often admits to being surprised by this, explaining that she had no such aspirations when she was writing Odd Girl Out: [...] "If I had known, it might well have resulted in a much more polished product, but one that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> cautious and self-conscious as to be entirely forgettable. It would never—my best guess—have had the vibrant life it has now." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{positively}} received, with many praising Jones's {{performance as the}} TARDIS. The Guardian Dan Martin said: [...] "With so many wild ideas at play, this <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> easy to get wrong...yet in every sense it was pitched perfectly". He praised Suranne Jones in particular, saying she was [...] "electrifying throughout". Martin later rated it the third best episode of the series, though the finale {{was not included in}} the list. The A.V. Club gave the episode a score of [...] "A", saying it was a [...] "pretty terrific ...a brisk, scary, inventive adventure filled with clever concepts and witty dialogue. And a lot of heart when in the way it deals with an important relationship rarely addressed on the series". He admired the cleverness of the [...] "Idris/TARDIS" [...] characterisation and found the relationship [...] "quite touching". Gavin Fuller of The Telegraph praised the acting of Smith, Jones, and Sheen, and called the episode [...] "hugely enjoyable". Neela Debnath of The Independent praised Gaiman for mixing [...] "romance, tragedy and horror, managing to strike a balance while telling a simple story", though she criticised the frequent deaths of Rory.|$|E
500|$|Back in Nigeria, Achebe {{set to work}} {{revising}} {{and editing}} his novel (now titled Things Fall Apart, after {{a line in the}} poem [...] "The Second Coming" [...] by W. B. Yeats). He cut away the second and third sections of the book, leaving only the story of a yam farmer named Okonkwo who lives during the colonization of Nigeria. He added sections, improved various chapters, and restructured the prose. By 1957, he had sculpted it to his liking, and took advantage of an advertisement offering a typing service. He sent his only copy of his handwritten manuscript (along with the ₤22 fee) to the London company. After he waited several months without receiving any communication from the typing service, Achebe began to worry. His boss at the NBS, Angela Beattie, was going to London for her annual leave; he asked her to visit the company. She did, and angrily demanded to know why the manuscript was lying ignored {{in the corner of the}} office. The company quickly sent a typed copy to Achebe. Beattie's intervention was crucial for his ability to continue as a writer. Had the novel been lost, he later said, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> discouraged that I would probably have given up altogether." ...|$|E

2500|$|The postwar Robertson Panel cited foo fighter reports, {{noting that}} their {{behavior}} {{did not appear}} to be threatening, and mentioned possible explanations, for instance that they were electrostatic phenomena similar to St. Elmo's fire, electromagnetic phenomena, or simply reflections of light from ice crystals. The Panel's report suggested that [...] "If the term [...] "flying saucers" [...] had been popular in 1943–1945, these objects <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> labeled." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{possible}} that Grey's antipathy towards the Canterbury Association led him to appoint Campbell in order to frustrate the plans of the Colonists and delay the settlement of claims and the issuing of pasturage licences. Certainly Campbell, and George Grey's appointment of him as Commissioner, were strongly criticized by the press and prominent colonists. The Lyttelton Times and the Daily Southern Cross published articles stating:"There never was a more unfortunate or more offensive appointment than that of Col. Campbell... he was considered by all who {{came in contact with}} him to be wholly incompetent to discharge the duties of any responsible station... there could hardly have been found another man whose presence within this settlement, as an official, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> offensive to its inhabitants." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the three}} {{instances}} of the wife-sister motif in (a) [...] (b) [...] and (c) [...] Speiser {{argued that in}} a work by a single author, these three cases would present serious contradictions: [...] Abraham would have learned nothing from his narrow escape in Egypt, and so tried the same ruse in Gerar; and Abimelech <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> little sobered by his perilous experience with Abraham and Sarah that he fell into the identical trap with Isaac and Rebekah. [...] Speiser concluded (on independent grounds) that the Jahwist was responsible for incidents (a) and (c), while the Elohist was responsible for incident (b). [...] If the Elohist had been merely an annotator of the Jahwist, however, the Elohist would still have seen the contradictions for Abimelech, a man of whom the Elohist clearly approved. [...] Speiser concluded that the Jahwist and the Elohist therefore must have worked independently.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, {{the long}} {{march of the}} fourth column under General Abercromby went {{completely}} unopposed. He reached Hoorn without mishap and managed to surprise the weak garrison at this city. Hoorn was occupied and briefly the locals displayed the colours of the stadtholder. The planned march south [...] from Hoorn, which {{was the point of}} the entire manoeuvre, as it would have enabled Abercromby to turn the right flank of the Franco-Batavian army, proved impossible because of the obstacles the defenders had prepared (This explains why Abercromby had not encountered opposition on his march to Hoorn). After the retreat of the other columns Abercromby received orders to evacuate Hoorn and likewise go back to his starting position. The citizens of Hoorn quickly took down their orange flags again. Abercromby's work had therefore been completely in vain, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> even if the attack on the right wing had been successful. His route was simply too circuitous to be successful. A more direct route might have offered a better chance of success.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the song}} [...] "Take Me on the Floor", the girls state that they [...] "want to kiss a girl". Lisa states [...] "Yeah, there's a sexual {{undertone}} to that song, {{but when we}} were writing it we were thinking about having fun, going to a club, being on the dancefloor. You can interpret it how you like." [...] Jessica stated: It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> easy {{to have made a}} record just like the first, with unison voices on the verse and chorus. It worked for us on the first record; it became a trademark sound. Not degrading it, we loved it, but at some point you have to grow as an artist or you get stuck. According to Lisa: We made that record [...] two years ago. It would be so dated to do it again. I feel we're staying current but staying ourselves. It was a natural progression. We wanted a challenge, to take it somewhere new. People had become used to our sound. Other artists released that sound using songs we'd written. We get asked, [...] "Did you get pushed into this sound?" [...] We were doing the pushing! ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} well-received critically. Vincent Eldefors of Tartarean Desire stated [...] "ever since I first heard my first Opeth song [...] "To Bid You Farewell"... {{they have been}} among my {{favorite}} bands". [...] "Dan Swanö helped record this epic piece", said John Chedsey of Satan Stole My Teddybear in his review, and also mentioned that [...] "generally the songs flow well from one part to the next, though individual songs are not immediately noticeable. The twin guitars work well with each other, creating some great melodies in the guitars, and often lasping into very tasteful acoustic moods. In my opinion, it's difficult to write on guitar intricate songs that fully involve the listener, but Opeth manages to keep your attention." [...] Murat Batmaz of Sea of Tranquility wrote that [...] "the melodies, both on this song [...] and the entire album, are immortal." [...] He also wrote, [...] "Though I prefer their current lineup, I don't believe Morningrise <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> amazing without Johan De Farfalla and Anders Nordin adding their touches. They both incorporate subtle jazz harmonies in their playing enriching the psychedelic passages on the album." [...] He was also impressed with the guitar riffs, saying [...] "it is almost shocking how many godlike riffs Opeth are using in their songs. They literally employ tens of changing riff patterns and incomparable melodies on a single track, with which other bands could more than likely write two full albums" [...] and claimed that the song [...] "Black Rose Immortal" [...] is a [...] "magnum opus".|$|E
