5|$|Detailed {{planning}} and orders for Operation Trio were finalised {{at a conference}} in Ljubljana on 28–29 March 1942. Laxa, General Mario Roatta (the commander of the Italian Second Army), and General der Artillerie Paul Bader (the commander of German forces in the NDH) negotiated a compromise permitting temporary non-political agreements to be concluded with the Herzegovinian Chetniks, led by Dobroslav Jevđević, but not with any of the Bosnian Chetnik groups, whose leaders were Petar Baćović in the area of Foča and Jezdimir Dangić, who <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> with the Serb collaborationist Milan Nedić.|$|E
5|$|Frederick of Prussia's {{invasion}} of Saxony in August 1756 began a Third Silesian War and sparked the wider Seven Years' War. Empress Maria Theresa and Kaunitz wished {{to exit the}} war with possession of Silesia. Austria <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> with France and Russia, Great Britain with Prussia and Portugal. Giving Austria huge subsidies came back to haunt France. It could not bolster defences in New France; the British easily captured Louisbourg in 1758, {{and went on to}} conquer all of New France.|$|E
5|$|Georges Dumézil {{theorized that}} Víðarr {{represents}} a cosmic figure from an archetype {{derived from the}} Proto-Indo-Europeans. Dumézil stated that he <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> with both vertical space, due to his placement of {{his foot on the}} wolf's lower jaw and his hand on the wolf's upper jaw, and horizontal space, due to his wide step and strong shoe, and that, by killing the wolf, Víðarr keeps the wolf from destroying the cosmos, and the cosmos can thereafter be restored after the destruction resulting from Ragnarök.|$|E

5|$|He also {{promoted}} {{the creation of}} schools for women, where they would learn about weaving, as well as reading. However, he did not aim to generate intellectual women, but just to prevent ignorance and laziness, and have them learn things valuable for daily living. Being a strong Catholic himself, he <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> with the Catholic perspective that rejected mixed-sex education, in contrast with Protestantism.|$|E
5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his future <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is {{noteworthy}} that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom {{they wanted to see}} continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E
5|$|In Egypt {{the temple}} of Amun-Re at Karnak {{has been the subject}} of much study. Evaluation of the site, taking into account the change over time of the {{obliquity}} of the ecliptic show that the Great Temple <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> on the rising of the midwinter sun.

He opposed the {{governor}} Elías Adre, who <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> with left-wing Peronism. After the 1976 Argentine coup d'état, he left politics and worked in a law firm with his brother.|$|E
5|$|The Tang {{campaign}} against Kucha {{was a military}} campaign led by the Tang Dynasty general Ashina She'er against the Tarim Basin oasis state of Kucha in Xinjiang, which <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> with the Western Turkic Khaganate. The campaign began in 648 and ended on 19 January 649, after the surrender of the Kuchan forces following a forty-day siege in Aksu. Kuchean soldiers tried to recapture the kingdom {{with the assistance of}} the Western Turkic Khaganate, but were defeated by the Tang army.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} a few road {{modifications}} on the Sheet Harbour {{side of the bridge}} {{as a result of the}} new bridge. Trunk 7 <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> with what was Riverside Drive, which is now nonexistent. Church Point Road and Pool Road were slightly modified. The access road to Sheet Harbour Consolidated School and Duncan MacMillan High School was slightly modified. Sprott Lane, a minor loop, was extended along a part of the old Trunk 7 for a few households.|$|E
50|$|Sequenced RNA, such as {{expressed}} sequence tags and full-length mRNAs, can <b>be</b> <b>aligned</b> to a sequenced genome to find {{where there are}} genes and get information about alternative splicing and RNA editing. Sequence alignment is {{also a part of}} genome assembly, where sequences <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> to find overlap so that contigs (long stretches of sequence) can be formed. Another use is SNP analysis, where sequences from different individuals <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> to find single basepairs that are often different in a population.|$|R
50|$|According to {{ordinary}} quantum theory, {{it is not}} possible to measure the spin or polarization of a particle directly; instead, the component in one direction is measured; the outcome from a single particle may be 1, meaning that the particle <b>is</b> <b>aligned</b> with the measuring apparatus, or −1, meaning that it <b>is</b> <b>aligned</b> the opposite way. For an ensemble of particles, if we expect the particles to <b>be</b> <b>aligned,</b> the results <b>are</b> all 1. If we expect them to <b>be</b> <b>aligned</b> oppositely, the results are all −1. For other alignments, we expect some results to be 1 and some to be −1 with a probability that depends on the expected alignment. For a full explanation of this, see the Stern-Gerlach experiment.|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of its closure, the stadium {{consisted}} of four separate all-seater stands; the pitch <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> north-south, with the North Bank Stand (formerly the Laundry End) and South Stand (popularly known as the Clock End) at the ends of the field. The East and West Stands ran alongside the pitch and are two of the few examples of British football stands designed in the Art Deco style. The East Stand incorporated the club's offices and was well known for its marble halls (though the floors were actually terrazzo) which are often cited in media depictions of the stadium, and the facade that faces onto Avenell Road. The East Stand is considered architecturally significant enough to have been designated a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|Between 1927 and 1953, Route 83 {{was a part}} of Route 49, which {{originally}} ran {{south of}} Millville along Route 47 between Millville and South Dennis and along the entire length of Route 83. In 1953, the route became Route 83 when Route 49 was realigned to follow what was then Route 47 between Millville and Tuckahoe and Route 47 <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> to follow Route S49 between South Dennis and Wildwood. In 2007, the state completed reconstruction of the intersection with Route 47 to include a traffic signal. A school bus accident has prompted the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) to install a traffic signal at the Y intersection of Route 83 and US 9.|$|E
5|$|During this {{stint in}} Florida, LeDuc made a scripted turn from face to heel. Garvin claimed that LeDuc <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> with heel manager Sonny King, but LeDuc denied the claim. Garvin then showed video footage {{to prove that}} LeDuc had secret {{dealings}} with King. LeDuc responded by attacking Garvin {{in front of the}} crowd, solidifying a heel turn for LeDuc. In a storyline several months later, LeDuc and King Curtis Iaukea attacked Buddy Rogers, a veteran then working as a face. The injuries Rogers received were said to be so severe that he was forced to retire, although, in reality, Rogers had simply moved to another wrestling promotion.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2008 WWE Draft, Kelly {{was moved}} to the Raw brand on July 7. Kelly had her debut match as part of the brand that same night, teaming with Mickie James to defeat Layla and Jillian Hall. She quickly became {{involved}} in a feud with Beth Phoenix, facing her on multiple occasions in both singles and tag team matches with a variety of opponents, including Mickie James and Candice Michelle. During this time, Phoenix <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> with Jillian Hall, and in late September, Kelly transitioned into a feud with Hall. At Survivor Series in November, Kelly was part of the victorious Raw Diva team which defeated the SmackDown Divas in a five-on-five elimination match; she eliminated Victoria, before being eliminated by Maryse. The following month at Armageddon, Kelly teamed with Maria, Michelle McCool and Mickie James in a winning effort against Jillian Hall, Maryse, Victoria and Natalya.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Tang Shengzhi aligned {{himself with}} {{northern}} warlords against the warlord controlling Guangdong, who <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> with the Kuomintang. Peng conducted skirmishes along the Hunan-Guangdong border for nine months, but reorganized his battalion along pro-Kuomintang political lines in 1925. In late 1925 Chiang Kai-shek established the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) {{and led the}} Kuomintang {{to take control of}} Guangdong. Tang then aligned himself with Chiang and joined him in the Northern Expedition, an effort to unify China by defeating the northern warlords. The Hunanese army was reorganized, and Peng was promoted to the rank of major. When Wu Peifu invaded Hunan and occupied Changsha, Chiang sent the NRA to Hunan, beginning the Northern Expedition. Peng's forces then joined the Kuomintang, though Peng never joined the party as a formal member. It wasn't until after Peng joined the Kuomintang, in 1925, that he first heard of the Communist Party.|$|E
5|$|In September 1973, he {{returned}} to Algiers to attend the Fourth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Various NAM members were critical of Castro's attendance, claiming that Cuba <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> to the Warsaw Pact and therefore should not be at the conference. At the conference he publicly broke off relations with Israel, citing its government's {{close relationship with the}} U.S. and its treatment of Palestinians during the Israel–Palestine conflict. This earned Castro respect throughout the Arab world, in particular from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who became his friend and ally. As the Yom Kippur War broke out in October 1973 between Israel and an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, Cuba sent 4,000 troops to defend Syrian territory from Israeli incursions. Leaving Algiers, Castro visited Iraq and North Vietnam.|$|E
