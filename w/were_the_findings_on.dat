40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to detect {{neurological}} abnormalities in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected children. This was achieved by a prospective evaluation, from November/ 1995 to April/ 2000, of 43 HIV infected children (group I) and 40 HIV seroreverters children (group II) through neurological exam and neurodevelopmental tests: Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) and Clinical Adaptive Test / Clinical Linguistic and Auditory Milestone Scale (CAT/CLAMS). A control group (III), of 67 children, were evaluated by CAT/CLAMS. Hyperactivity, irritability and hypotonia <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>on</b> neurological examination, without statistical differences between group I and II. On CAT/CLAMS, the group I developmental quotient (DQ) was significantly lower than the other groups. The same occurred in DDST, with group I presenting significantly more failures than group II. Nineteen HIV children of group I had brain computed tomographic scan, with abnormalities in three of them (basal ganglia calcification, white matter hypodensity and asymmetry of lateral ventricles). We conclude that in HIV infected children a neurodevelopment delay occur early in the disease, and it can be detected by screening tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{pursuit of}} equity {{is a key}} {{objective}} of many health care systems, including Australiaâ€™s Medicare. Using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, we measured the extent of inequity in the utilisation of hospital services. We used methodology developed by the ECuity project for measuring horizontal inequity indices. We examine income-related health care inequities in both inpatient and day patient access and utilisation, whilst controlling for morbidity, demographic and socio-economic variables. The probability of hospital inpatient admission appeared equitable, but {{the probability of a}} day patient visit demonstrated a pro-rich distribution. Even more pronounced <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>on</b> the quantity of visits. The positive horizontal inequality indices indicate a degree of inequity favouring the rich, especially for inpatient utilisation. The pro-rich distribution of the probability of a day patient visit was associated with whether individuals held private health insurance. These results suggest that in Australia, which has a universal and comprehensive health system, the rich and poor are not treated equally according to need. Further research should investigate whether the causes of inequities lie in the preferences of individuals or the preferences of health care providers. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose â€“ The {{purpose of}} this study <b>is</b> to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> relationship between CEO compensation and different company characteristics; including shareholder returns, sales, board size, family ownership (whether <b>the</b> company <b>is</b> family-owned or not) and firm size. Research design â€“ This study uses quantitative empirical data collected from companiesâ€™ annual reports and other relevant reports from years 2011 - 2015. <b>The</b> data <b>was</b> analyzed with descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. <b>The</b> sample <b>is</b> limited to companies listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm large cap, year 2017. <b>Findings</b> â€“ <b>The</b> main <b>findings</b> in <b>the</b> study indicate that there is no relation between total CEO compensation and shareholder wealth. Nor between changes in compensation and changes in returns a relationship could be seen. Instead, strong associations between total CEO compensation and board size, family ownership and firm size were found. These findings suggest that it <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> performance of the company but other factors that decide the compensation.

30|$|As {{reported}} in column 2 of Table 3, <b>the</b> results <b>are</b> quite different {{when it comes}} to the effects of work absences for men. The negative effect of a spell of unemployment on wages is between 0.2 and 0.5 % and not significant in the short and long term. 26 While we find that at the mean, women experience a 2 % loss in wages in the short term, men do not. As we control for education, work experience, hours of work and individual fixed effects in both regressions, these estimates are for similar workers. When we look again at the results for men, non-work in the short term leads to a loss of 1.4 â€“ 1.9 % if the spell occurred during the most recent two years. In the longer term, the loss decreases to 0.6 % but remains significant. Interesting <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> category of work absence that captures work interruptions or compulsory service. We find that a spell of work interruption during the current year leads to a wage gain of 3.2 % on the return to work. If more time has passed since the interruption, the wage effects do not contain a clear pattern. Only in <b>the</b> short term <b>is</b> <b>the</b> effect significant and positive. The size of <b>the</b> effect <b>is</b> quite substantial as it amounts to slightly less than half of the annual return to recent work experience (3.2 compared with 7.2 %).
