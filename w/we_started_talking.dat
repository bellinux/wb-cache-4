The worst case scenarios that you play out that usually don't come true. And with Richard holing himself up inside his office, it's just a breeding ground for rumor, fear and paranoia. So, when <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>talking</b> about this episode, the theme of paranoia emerged pretty quickly."

Additionally, she was initially approached for the female lead in Lars von Trier's controversial film Antichrist (2009). According to Trier, Green was positive about appearing in the film, but her agents refused to allow her. The unsuccessful casting attempt took two months of the film's pre-production process. Anglo-French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg was subsequently cast in the role.

[...] This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour, which according to Gaga was [...] "another level from where we were with the Fame Ball. [...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to." [...] Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that {{she did not want to}} use any of the things that they had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was [...] "the great lost tour", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.|$|E

Wade also recorded the band's demos for the album, {{in the back of a}} bus. The album itself was recorded at Wade's The Wade Studio, in Ocala, Florida, after the Easycore Tour had finished. Gilbert was touring with New Found Glory in Europe at the time, but with video conferencing he was able to offer input about the record. In September 2008, a demo appeared on the band's MySpace page, entitled [...] "Wax Larry". [...] Documenting the recording process, the band released several webisodes on YouTube, under the name The Real ADTR: Homesick in Ocala, which had been called a spoof of The Real World. The webisodes were aided by director Drew Russ, as guitarist Neil Westfall states: [...] "When he [...] was telling us in the beginning that he was getting into video stuff, and we were like 'Well that's kinda crazy 'cause we need a video guy to do these webisodes for us'.

So he started playing it again," [...] Davidson recalled. After the keyboard elements were completed, Scott and Kelley finished the song's music and lyrics at the studio. They discussed ideas for the song; Kelley put forward the basic melody and Scott followed up with her own contribution. After they wrote the lyrics, Davidson proposed that the song's title be [...] "Just a Kiss Goodnight". It was later changed to [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] after Scott felt that [...] "it's cool to have 'just a kiss' goodnight rather than going all the way." [...] Kelley told Country Weekly that the song {{was inspired by the}} band members' experiences: [...] "I remembered being out the first night with Cassie and thinking, 'This is different, and I don't want to give any wrong impression. I [...] don't want to make the wrong move because this feels like something [...] special.' <b>We</b> <b>started</b> <b>talking</b> about that and going back and forth with [...] different experiences when we wrote the song."

By this time, the band's line-up had stabilised around singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and drummer Alan White, who had {{replaced}} original drummer Bill Bruford the year before. During their stop in Tokyo, Anderson was {{in his hotel room}} seeking a theme for the next Yes album. One of his ideas involved a [...] "large-scale composition", which came to his mind when he found himself [...] "caught up in a lengthy footnote on page 83" [...] of Autobiography of a Yogi (1946), the autobiography of Indian yogi and guru Paramahansa Yogananda. This footnote described four bodies of Hindu text, collectively named the shastras, that Yogananda described as [...] "comprehensive treatises" [...] that cover [...] "every aspect of religious and social life, and the fields of law, medicine, architecture, art, etc." [...] that [...] "convey profound truths under a veil of detailed symbolism". Anderson soon [...] "became engrossed" [...] {{with the idea of a}} [...] "four-part epic" [...] album based on the four shastras, though he later admitted that he did not fully understand what the scriptures were about. He was introduced to Yogananda's book by Jamie Muir, then the percussionist for King Crimson, at Bruford's wedding reception on 2 March 1973. Anderson spoke about his meeting with Muir: [...] "I felt I had to learn from him. <b>We</b> <b>started</b> <b>talking</b> about meditation in music—not the guru type but some really heavy stuff." [...] During the album's production, Anderson talked to Vera Stanley Alder, a painter and author of several books on spirituality that had a profound influence on Anderson, for clarifications on his interpretations of the scriptures.|$|E

The second <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> about a 'women’s way,' we run a risk of falling into old patterns and traps of seeing women as 'less,' as 'softer,' as less capable of dealing with pressure, as less assertive, as less logical, or whatever. When <b>we</b> <b>start</b> to couch this in language of brain differences, we are basically turning sexist attitudes into some kind of pseudo-scientific data...."When we talk about women’s contributions to transforming society, it’s based on culture, not biology. If men are typically acculturated into a kind of sterile individualism, women are acculturated into relationships, caring, and other-centeredness. Both of these personas are part of the human spirit, and all human beings need access to both characteristics, that is, individualism and connectivity. So the point is that bringing a 'women’s culture' into Jewish life is not about 'femininity' as an essence but rather about restoring cultural balance to a world that has overly valued the culture of sterile individualism that has been typically owned by men." ...|$|R
