5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} (Picathartes oreas) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird in the}} family Picathartidae with a long neck and tail. Also known as the grey-necked picathartes, this passerine is mainly found in rocky areas of close-canopied rainforest from south-west Nigeria through Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and south-west Gabon. It additionally lives {{on the island of}} Bioko. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and inselbergs in its forested habitat. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a superspecies with the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl.</b> The grey-necked rockfowl has grey upperparts, a light grey breast, and lemon-coloured underparts. Its unusually long tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being powder blue on the forehead and upper mandible and carmine on the hindcrown. The bird’s cheeks and eyes are covered in a large, circular black patch that, though narrow, connects and divides the carmine and powder blue skin {{at the peak of the}} crown. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.|$|E
500|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Anton Reichenow in 1899 from a bird {{collected at the}} base of Mount Cameroon near Limbe, Cameroon. He published his description in Ornithologische Monatsberichte and described it as Picathartes oreas. The generic name was first used by René-Primevère Lesson in 1828 after he split the grey-necked rockfowl's close relative the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> from the crow genus Corvus and placed it in its own genus, Picathartes, as the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> did not share characteristics common to members of Corvus such as a feathered head. This generic name comes from a combination of the Latin genera pica for [...] "magpie" [...] and cathartes for [...] "vulture". The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek word oreas, meaning [...] "mountain". Since its initial description, the picathartes have been placed in more than five different families, including those of crows (Corvidae), starlings (Sturnidae), Old World flycatchers (Muscicapidae), babblers (Timaliidae) and Old World warblers (Sylviidae). Today the grey-necked rockfowl and the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> are believed to comprise a unique family, Picathartidae. Additionally, it has been suggested, though not generally accepted, that the two rockfowl represent the remnants of an ancient bird order. Recent DNA analysis has shown that Picathartidae and its closest relatives, southern Africa's rockjumpers and south-east Asia's rail-babbler, form a clade. The analysis suggests that the rockfowl split from the common ancestor of their clade 44million years ago. It is believed that the ancestor of this clade originated in Australia and spread to Africa. Though the grey-necked rockfowl has no subspecies, it may form a superspecies with the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl,</b> with plumage and facial pattern being the main differences between the two species.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{collecting}} {{this species}} for display in zoos {{was a major}} threat, and in Liberia in particular this practice destroyed several of the bird's colonies. The rockfowl were captured by the indigenous peoples {{through the use of}} traps, while hunters in Guinea, who were already catching rodents and hyraxes at the bird's nesting colonies, sometimes captured rockfowl at night. In Côte d'Ivoire specimens were sometimes caught by bat-catchers. Most birds collected from the wild die within 24 hours. Despite over 70 <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> being displayed in zoos during the 1970s, captive breeding was a rare occurrence and no stable captive populations have been formed. Despite this, zoos did have limited success and at least one zoo was able to hand-rear a <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl.</b> As of 2002, no <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> have existed outside of Africa since 1998.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} only found in West Africa from Guinea to Ghana. It is locally common in southeastern Guinea, and is {{widespread}} in Sierra Leone {{except for the}} north and northwest, and in Liberia except for the north and northeast. In Côte d'Ivoire the species is currently restricted to areas near the Guinean and Liberian border. The bird also lives in Ghana, where it is both local and uncommon in the south central parts of the nation. The <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl's</b> total range covers approximately 391,000 km2. However, the species occurs in low population densities in patches across this large range. The species does not migrate, though it does disperse widely after the breeding season.|$|R

50|$|The <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> (Picathartes gymnocephalus) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird in the}} family Picathartidae, with a long neck and tail. Also known as the white-necked picathartes, this passerine is mainly found in rocky forested areas at higher altitudes in West Africa from Guinea to Ghana. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often being isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and inselbergs. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a superspecies with the grey-necked rockfowl. The <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> has greyish-black upperparts and white underparts. Its unusually long, dark brown tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being bright yellow except for two large, circular black patches located just behind the eyes. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.|$|E
50|$|Common names {{used for}} this species include <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl,</b> white-necked picathartes, yellow-headed picathartes, bare-headed rockfowl, and the less {{frequently}} used white-necked bald crow. Rockfowl is {{a reference to the}} species' habit of building mud nests on rock surfaces and caves. Picathartes refers to the species' scientific name. Bald crow is a reference to its featherless head and somewhat crow-like appearance, especially its beak.|$|E
50|$|In {{the lore}} of Sierra Leone's {{indigenous}} people, the often bizarre rock formations near which the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> lives {{were believed to}} house ancestral spirits. Its residence there led it {{to be considered a}} guardian of the formations, leading to a degree of residual respect for the species that persists despite the beliefs that spawned this respect being practically extinct. However, in some regions the rockfowl's secretive habits and inaccessible habitat have meant it was unknown to the local population. Conversely, migrant Liberian hunters sometimes catch the nestlings for food. Due to this species' uniqueness it became a symbol for ecotourism and rainforest conservation in the region in the 1990s. The <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> has been depicted on numerous postage stamps from Ghana and Sierra Leone. Due to its strange appearance and behavior and the difficulty in seeing the species, this bird is considered particularly fascinating by birdwatchers. This species is considered {{to be one of the}} five most desirable birds in Africa by ornithologists.|$|E
50|$|This species {{also helped}} launch Sir David Attenborough's career in 1954, {{when he was}} the {{producer}} on the new television program Zoo Quest. The show's presenter Jack Lester was required to travel to Africa to record attempts to capture animals for display in zoos, with the focus of the series being on the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl.</b> However, when he fell ill, Attenborough took his place, which launched him into the limelight and starting his narrating career.|$|E
50|$|The rockfowl are {{distributed}} in west and western Central Africa, in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana (<b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl),</b> Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic (grey-necked rockfowl). The rockfowl live in lowland rainforest {{at up to}} 800 m, in rocky and hilly terrain {{on the slopes of}} hills and mountains. These birds require forest litter for foraging, a large enough area to contain army-ant swarms (Dorylinae), and rocks, cliffs or caves for nesting sites.|$|E
5000|$|Sapo National Park is a [...] "regional {{centre of}} endemism"and biodiversity, {{at one time}} hosting around 125 mammal species and 590 types of bird, {{including}} a number of threatened species,such as the African golden cat, drill, Gola malimbe, Liberian mongoose, white-breasted guineafowl, and <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl.</b> The park {{is also home to}} the African civet, African fish eagle, African grey parrot, giant forest hog, great blue turaco, speckle-throated otter,water chevrotain, three species of pangolin, seven species of monkey (including the endangered Diana monkey), crocodiles, leopards,bee-eaters, egrets, hornbills, kingfishers, rollers, and sunbirds.|$|E
50|$|The diet is {{diverse and}} generalized, {{enabling}} the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> {{to have a}} degree of adaptability in collecting food. This rockfowl primarily eats insects, including larval cockroaches, tettigoniid grasshoppers, earwigs, ants from the genera Pachycondyla and Dorylus, click beetles from the genus Psephus, and termites. Other than insects, {{it has been observed}} eating millipedes, centipedes, snails, earthworms, and occasionally small frogs and lizards. When feeding its nestlings, the rockfowl primarily collects earthworms, small frogs, and lizards, with the vertebrates forming most of the biomass fed to the young. In addition, rockfowl are occasionally seen eating plant material, normally from angiosperms or mosses.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> forages across slopes on mossy, creeper-covered {{boulders}} and in trees covered in lianas and hanging mosses. It occasionally forages by hopping across sand by a stream {{or even in}} the stream, as evidenced by crab remains in the rockfowl's droppings. While foraging on the ground, the rockfowl picks up leaves with its bill and tosses them aside. It feeds in mixed-species groups ahead of swarms of Dorylus ants with alethes, bristlebills, and Finsch's rufous thrushes, picking off insects flushed by the ants, mostly off the ground. The rockfowl has also been observed hopping from the ground and snatching prey midair.|$|E
50|$|The <b>White-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> breeds {{primarily}} in caves and pairs nest either alone or {{as part of}} a small colony. While its courtship behavior is unknown, the species is monogamous and therefore does not breed with rockfowl other than its mate despite earlier suggestions that it bred cooperatively. The <b>White-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> has two breeding seasons throughout the year, though the timing of the breeding seasons is determined by the location of the birds and the timing of the wet season, with nesting occurring just before and after the wet season and averaging 127 days apart. The rockfowl reuses its nest, and typically repairs it two to eight weeks prior to laying eggs. Guinean birds breed from July to January, while those in Sierra Leone breed from November to February and from April to October. In Liberia, breeding occurs from September to December and from March to July. Ghana's rockfowl breed from March to June and September to November. Breeding caves are traditionally deserted while the rockfowl are not breeding, so increased usage by the rockfowl is considered a first sign of breeding. Nesting colonies average two to five nests, although one colony had forty nests. In addition to breeding birds, sometimes non-breeding rockfowl are present. These birds occasionally attempt infanticide to gain access to prime nesting sites or mates. Birds in these colonies often chase each other in circles, even through the treetops, a rare destination for this species.|$|E
50|$|This rockfowl {{lives on}} steep slopes in both primary and mature {{secondary}} forests. These forests are typically covered in rocks and {{are found in}} hilly lowland areas up to 800 m. The <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> often lives near flowing streams and rivers so that it has access to wet mud for nest construction. Colonies are typically found within 100 m of a stream. The species also seems to show a preference for living near inselbergs. Rockfowl are occasionally seen in partly cleared forests and near cities, but {{this appears to be}} abnormal. Recent surveys have shown that abandoned rockfowl nests {{are more likely to be}} in or near secondary forest.|$|E
50|$|The park {{lies within}} {{one of the}} world’s Endemic Bird Areas. At least 250 bird species have been recorded, 28 being endemic to the Guinean zone. There are 143 species typical of primary forest, {{including}} African crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus), lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni), white-breasted guineafowl (Agelastes meleagrides), rufous fishing owl (Scotopilia ussheri), brown-cheeked hornbill (Ceratogymna cylindricus), yellow-casqued hornbill (Ceratogymna elata), western wattled cuckooshrike (Campephaga lobata), rufous-winged thrush-babbler (Illadopsis rufescens), green-tailed bristlebill (Bleda eximia), yellow-throated olive greenbul (Criniger olivaceus), black-capped rufous-warbler (Bathmocercus cerviniventris), Nimba flycatcher (Melaenornis annamarulae), Sierra Leone prinia (Prinia leontica), Lagden's bushshrike (Maloconotus lagdeni), copper-tailed glossy-starling (Lamprotornis cupreocauda), <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> (Picathartes gymnocephalus) and Gola malimbe (Malimbus ballmanni) (Fishpool & Evans, 2001). More on birds is given in Thiollay (1985).|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{considered}} Vulnerable by the IUCN {{due to its}} highly fragmented distribution, dwindling population, and habitat destruction. It {{is considered to be}} less common and more threatened than the closely related grey-necked rockfowl. The stronghold of the species is in Sierra Leone and southern Guinea, where the bird is still locally common if difficult to locate. It is estimated that only 2,500 to 10,000 <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> survive, with the population dwindling and spread out over a known 32 sites; however, most individuals studying this species believe that the population is far fewer than the 10,000 maximum. Many of its colonies are currently approaching the minimum population size necessary to guarantee long-term viability against inbreeding. The primary threat is the commercial destruction of its habitat for timber. Although the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> is capable of withstanding some disturbance of the nearby habitat, as demonstrated by one colony surviving after it was completely surrounded by a cocoa plantation, habitat disturbance is far more likely to negatively impact on breeding success. Most of the remaining colonies in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Côte d'Ivoire are on protected land, while Liberia and Ghana's colonies are mostly unprotected. In part to protect this species, Sierra Leone recently upgraded its protection of the Gola forest by turning it into its second national park, Gola National Park, and has announced that the country intends to work with Liberia to form a trans-national park protecting the Gola rainforest. In return for lost logging rights, Sierra Leone has compensated locals with road and school renovations, additional training for police officers, and construction of churches and a mosque. Liberia has also expressed a desire to expand its national park system, which would help protect the species. In Guinea, the bird's forests are being logged to provide land for rice farming to help support farmers immigrating from the country's drier north.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1825 from a specimen {{collected on the}} Guinean coast. He published his description in the 2nd volume of Nouveau recueil de planches coloriées d'oiseaux and described it as Corvus gymnocephalus, placing it in the crow genus Corvus. The species name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek words gymnos [...] "naked", and kephalē [...] "head". However, only three years later the bird was removed from the genus Corvus by René Primevère Lesson and placed in its own genus, Picathartes, as it did not share characteristics common to members of Corvus such as a feathered head. This generic name comes from a combination of the Latin genera pica for [...] "magpie" [...] and cathartes for [...] "vulture". Since its initial description, the picathartes have been placed in more than five different families, including those of crows (Corvidae), starlings (Sturnidae), Old World flycatchers (Muscicapidae), babblers (Timaliidae) and Old World warblers (Sylviidae). Today the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> and its close relative the grey-necked rockfowl are believed to comprise a unique family, Picathartidae. It has also been suggested though not generally accepted that the two rockfowl represent the remnants of an ancient bird order. Recent DNA analysis has shown that Picathartidae and its closest relatives, southern Africa's rockjumpers and southeast Asia's rail-babbler, form a clade. The analysis suggests that the rockfowl split from the common ancestor of their clade 44 million years ago. It is believed that the ancestor of this clade originated in Australia and spread to Africa. Though the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> has no subspecies, it is believed to form a superspecies with the grey-necked rockfowl, with plumage and facial pattern being the primary differences between the two species.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{numerous}} calls {{have been}} recorded, the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> is normally a silent bird. Its call {{has been compared}} to the clucks of a chicken, with clucks of [...] "chuk-chuk-chuk" [...] or [...] "choop-choop-choop" [...] being made at a constant rate of eight notes every five seconds. This call typically lasts for at least a minute. It has been suggested that this call may be a proper song, but more research is required to determine if this is accurate. The rockfowl's alarm call, one of its more frequent sounds, {{has been described as a}} continuous, low-pitched, guttural chatter similar to [...] "ow, ow, ow". Adults and juveniles have also been known to produce a long-drawn [...] "owooh" [...] call note. Additionally, fledglings can give a loud, quavering second-long whistle as a contact call.|$|E
50|$|These rockfowl feed {{primarily}} on insects, though parents feed small frogs to their young. One feeding strategy involves following Dorylus army ant swarms, feeding on insects flushed by the ants. Rockfowl {{move through the}} forest primarily {{through a series of}} hops and bounds or short flights in low vegetation. This species rarely flies for long distances. The <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> is monogamous and pairs nest either alone or in the vicinity of other pairs, sometimes in colonies with as many as eight nests. These nests are constructed out of mud formed into a deep cup and are built on rock surfaces, typically in caves. Two eggs are laid twice a year. Though the birds breed in colonies, infanticide is fairly common in this species, with rockfowl attempting to kill the young of other pairs. Nestlings mature in about a month. This bird is long-lived.|$|E
50|$|Laws {{exist in}} Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ghana {{to protect this}} species, but {{enforcement}} is minimal. International trading of the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> is regulated as the bird is currently listed under CITES Appendix I. Additionally, in 2004 BirdLife International drafted an international action plan to provide strategies for protecting this species. This plan focused on surveying the remaining habitat, raising awareness amongst the local populace, and limiting the continued destruction of its habitat. In 2006, BirdLife International received a US$19,900 grant from the Disney Wildlife Conservation Fund to help enact this plan. Surveys conducted with this funding {{have resulted in the}} discovery of additional populations in Sierra Leone. Additionally, wardens have been trained to protect Sierra Leone's Western Area Forest Reserve. This plan, coupled with the bird's appearance and unusual habits, have led it to become a flagship species for habitat conservation across Africa and particularly in its upper Guinean forests.|$|E
50|$|The seed for Zoo Quest was sown when Attenborough {{produced}} and presented a three-part nature programme, The Pattern of Animals, {{in the early}} 1950s. While researching animals for this programme, he befriended Jack Lester, the curator of the reptile house at London Zoo. Lester invited Attenborough {{to come along and}} film an expedition to Sierra Leone. In addition to capturing snakes for the zoo, Lester hoped to catch a <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> (Picathartes gymnocephalus), which had never been kept in a European zoo before. Attenborough, whose previous programmes had been studio-bound, was eager for a chance to film animals in the wild. He also thought the quest for the bird would make a compelling central story for the series. Attenborough and Lester were soon joined by a young Czech photographer, Charles Lagus, who would serve as Attenboroughs cameraman and travelling companion throughout Zoo Quests run. The team overcame the objections of BBC management to film the trip on 16mm film instead of the 35mm film that was then the Corporations standard.|$|E
50|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} (Picathartes oreas) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird in the}} family Picathartidae with a long neck and tail. Also known as the grey-necked picathartes, this passerine is mainly found in rocky areas of close-canopied rainforest from south-west Nigeria through Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and south-west Gabon. It additionally lives {{on the island of}} Bioko. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and inselbergs in its forested habitat. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a superspecies with the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl.</b> The grey-necked rockfowl has grey upperparts, a light grey breast, and lemon-coloured underparts. Its unusually long tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being powder blue on the forehead and upper mandible and carmine on the hindcrown. The bird’s cheeks and eyes are covered in a large, circular black patch that, though narrow, connects and divides the carmine and powder blue skin {{at the peak of the}} crown. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.|$|E
50|$|One to two eggs, {{typically}} two, {{are laid}} in each nest {{a day or}} two apart. The eggs weigh about 14.5 g and have an average size of 25.8 by 38.3 mm. The eggs are a creamy white with dark brown blotches spread across the egg but in higher density near the larger end. Incubation, which begins after the first egg is laid, lasts for 23 to 28 days. The parents take turns incubating their eggs. Hatching typically takes at least 12 hours. The infant rockfowl's eyes open after nine to eleven days, while feathers begin to grow seven days after hatching. After the young hatch, food is brought to them almost four times an hour. To feed its young, the adult rockfowl clings to the side of its nest while fluttering its wings; some birds use their tails as a prop underneath the nest to help support themselves. Rockfowl have been known to kill the young of other rockfowl, while nest predation is carried out by cobras of the genus Naja, the Nile monitor, sun squirrels, red-chested goshawks, and Procolobus monkeys. This leads on average to only 0.44 nestlings surviving per pair of rockfowl. Due to potential infanticide by other rockfowl, parents protect their nest and vicious fights often occur. Rare among other bird species, this behaviour is prevalent in <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl.</b> Not fully understood, it is thought to occur for the sake of resource competition or sexual selection. The young leave the nest after 23 to 27 days, at which time they resemble the adult rockfowl but with much shorter tails. The young leave the nest by standing on the edge, emitting a piercing whistle, and then gliding down to the ground on spread wings where they are met by an adult bearing insects. Even after leaving the nest, the young return to roost on it with their parents.|$|E
50|$|Unusually for a rainforest-dwelling bird, the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> {{builds a}} nest out of mud with varying amounts of plant fibers mixed in. Mud is {{collected}} from nearby {{rivers and streams}} and is shaped into a strong, thick-walled, and deep cup attached to the cave wall or roof, a cliff, or a large boulder approximately 2 to 4 m above the ground. These rocks must be sloped inwards to provide the nest with protection from the rain. Phloem fibers and roots from plants line {{the inside of the}} cup. The white-necked rockfowl's nesting caves normally are populated by wasps, and the wasp nests 2 to 3 cm long are often found embedded in the rockfowl's nests. It is believed that in order to build their nest on the smooth cave walls, rockfowl use the nests of the wasps as a nucleus to build around. Cliff nests are always built at a distance from nearby plants. Both birds work on the construction of the nest, with roles alternating as one bird collects the materials while the other shapes them into the nest. The mud is sometimes swallowed and regurgitated prior to use. While nearly all rockfowl nests are found in caves or on cliffs, there are records of nesting occurring on a riverbank and on a fallen tree trunk. Nests are typically constructed at least 1 m apart, but one colony had six nests adjoining each other. Nests also vary widely in size, though they average to be 108 mm long, 172 mm wide, and 129 mm deep. It used to be believed that each pair builds two nests, one for breeding and one for roosting; however, recent surveys have found no evidence of this, with all nests in the colony being used for breeding.|$|E
50|$|This rockfowl {{measures}} around 38 to 41 cm in length, {{with its}} notably long tail contributing about 18 cm. Adult rockfowl show little sexual dimorphism in plumage and the sexes cannot be told apart by appearance. On the adult, the head, excluding the chin and throat, is completely bare of feathers {{except for a}} thin layer of fuzz on the forehead. The head's skin is bright yellow except for two large, circular patches of black skin located just behind the eye and containing the ear; only a thin, 2 mm wide patch of yellow skin on the crown prevents the two black patches from connecting. The black patch has a raised edge and appears to be a distinct part of the face. The eyelid and eyering are a thin line of black surrounding the bird's large, dark brown eyes. The beak is robust, disproportionately large, and black. This beak can be considered crow-like, is noticeably decurved in the upper mandible, and is about 30 mm long. The bird's chin and throat are covered in {{a thin layer of}} white feathers, and the neck is long and slender. The nape is also covered in white feathers, while the hindneck is nearly bare, revealing the orange-yellow skin. The upper mantle is a solid black, merging into a greyish-black lower mantle. The rockfowl's thighs are very muscular and aid its partially terrestrial lifestyle. The back, rump, and undertail are a bluish grey, while the tail is a dark brown and tented in shape. The moderately-sized wings are also a dark brown. The underparts are a creamy white and appear their creamiest in the upper breast. In dim light the <b>white-necked</b> <b>rockfowl</b> can appear to be solely black above and white below. The legs are blue and relatively long. Overall the plumage appears to be smooth with long feathers. The adult weighs 200 to 250 g.|$|E
