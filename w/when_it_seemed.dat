5|$|The Allied 'congress' {{met again}} {{in the spring of}} 480 BC. A Thessalian {{delegation}} suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow Vale of Tempe, on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes's advance. A force of 10,000 Allies led by the Spartan polemarch Euenetus and Themistocles was thus despatched to the pass. However, once there, they were warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed by at least two other passes, and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelming; the Allies therefore retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont. The abandonment of Tempe meant that all of Thessaly submitted to the Persians, as did many cities {{to the north of the}} pass of Thermopylae <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> help was not forthcoming.|$|E

Her signal was misunderstood. Believing it to be safe, Ziemba, holding his five-year-old grandson Yankele Ber by the hand, {{tried to make a}} run for dear life. Wild screams and gunfire ensued. Ziemba fell to the floor; the others retreated under the ferocious assault.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> {{that the}} fate of the club would be hopelessly {{compromised}} by debt made millions for the purchase of the luxurious Spa Park, Santos came back to be only eleven shirts who fought and drew crowds. In one of the worst moments of its history, which resulted in the loss of the Spa Park and all that was invested in him, Santos rose a charismatic worship, which had its greatest asset in his legions of fans.|$|E
25|$|Brahms {{considered}} {{giving up}} composition <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> that other composers' innovations in extended tonality {{would result in}} the rule of tonality being broken altogether. Although Wagner became fiercely critical of Brahms as the latter grew in stature and popularity, he was enthusiastically receptive of the early Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel; Brahms himself, according to many sources, deeply admired Wagner's music, confining his ambivalence only to the dramaturgical precepts of Wagner's theory.|$|E

The support of the papacy was decisive, although negotiations were also underway between Aistulf and the pope (which soon failed), and {{an attempt was made}} to weaken Pepin by lobbying against him his brother Carloman.|$|E

Annie, who was 11 years her junior, became warmly attached to her, a sentiment that Deckers did not reciprocate at the time. Nevertheless, Pécher visited Deckers regularly in her convent, went to live near where Deckers stayed when sent to study at Leuven, and even fell into a deep depression and tried to kill herself <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> Deckers was about to be sent to a mission country.|$|E

At Destination X 2007 Shelley helped LAX win the match by hitting Brother Devon with a video camera and giving him a Frog Splash through a table.|$|E
25|$|The new commander, General Maude, despite {{receiving}} secret {{orders from}} Robertson not {{to attempt to}} take Baghdad, was given additional reinforcements and equipment. For {{the next six months}} he trained and organized his army. At the same time, the Ottoman Sixth Army was growing weaker. Khalil Pasha received very few replacements, and ended up disbanding the weak 38th Division and used its soldiers as replacements for his other divisions, the 46th, 51st, 35th, and 52nd. Robertson changed his mind <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> that the Russians might advance to Mosul, removing any Turkish threat to Mesopotamia, and authorised Maude to attack in December 1916.|$|E

25|$|The Rector of the University is an {{official}} {{elected by the}} matriculated students of the university for a three-year term. In common with other university rectors in Scotland, the position is largely ceremonial, although it does involve the representation of students on the University Court. The Rector at Dundee, unlike that of the ancient universities, does not chair the University Court, that duty instead falling to a lay member. The Rector may appoint an Assessor who can carry out the Rector's functions on his behalf when he is absent. The university gained national attention in 2001 <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> that actor David Hasselhoff may stand as rector.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} storyline {{featuring}} Diane during her initial stint on the soap concerned the character {{running away from}} home in 1990. In the on-screen events, Diane was shown to be increasingly unhappy towards {{the latter part of}} 1989, exacerbated by the sudden departure of her boyfriend Paul Priestly (Mark Thrippleton). Diane decided to run away from home in January 1990 <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> her family had forgotten her 16th birthday—they were actually planning a surprise party for her that she never got to see. Diane's disappearance dominated the programme in the beginning of 1990. Focus was placed upon the effect her departure had on the Butcher family, in particular her father Frank who searched unsuccessfully for his missing daughter.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{returned}} for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 {{in the first four}} games. In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs. Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> that he would steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler Clint McKay over short fine leg only to be caught by Nathan Hauritz, with India needing 19 runs to win with 18 balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and Australia won the match by three runs. During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs, and achieved his personal best against Australia, as well as the third highest score in a defeat.|$|E

25|$|But Jennings' {{principal}} {{role was}} as a tidy, dependable bowler, mainly in one-day cricket. His figures scarcely show many highlights, but his record of being consistently selected alongside stars such as Ian Botham, Joel Garner and Viv Richards indicates a value not measured in wickets. In 1978, he took 40 first-class wickets, the most he achieved in a season, and was awarded his county cap. The bowling included a return of five for 18 in 23.5 overs in the match against Sussex at Hove. That was his only five-wicket haul in senior cricket. Yet with all the stars available he was picked for both the crucial matches {{at the end of}} the season <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> that Somerset might at last win a trophy: in the event, the county lost both the Gillette Cup final to Sussex and the final John Player League match to Essex and missed out on both trophies.|$|E
25|$|Johnson's {{trial began}} in late March. With a {{predominantly}} Republican Senate, Johnson's impeachment seemed to many a foregone conclusion. However, throughout the process, several senators began showing hesitance {{to remove the}} President from office. Stanton, meanwhile, had remained barred in the War Department's headquarters for weeks, sneaking off {{once in a while}} to visit his home. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to Stanton that Johnson would not remove him forcefully from office, he began spending more time at home. Stanton watched closely as the trial, which he was convinced would end with Johnson's conviction, continued for several months. When it came time to vote, 35 voted to convict, 19 to acquit, falling one short of the 36-vote supermajority needed for a conviction. The remaining proceedings were delayed for several days for the Republican National Convention. On May 26, after Johnson had been acquitted on all of the ten other charges, Stanton submitted his resignation to the President.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to certain}} Spanish and Portuguese Jews (Western Sephardi Jews), the Dor Daim {{rejected}} the Zohar, {{a book of}} esoteric mysticism. They felt that the Kabbalah {{which was based on}} the Zohar was irrational, alien, and inconsistent with the true reasonable nature of Judaism. In 1913, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> that Rabbi Qafiḥ, then headmaster of the new Jewish school and working closely with the Ottoman authorities, enjoyed sufficient political support, the Dor Daim made its views public, and tried to convince the entire community to accept them. Many of the non-Dor Deah elements of the community rejected the Dor Deah concepts. The opposition, the Iqshim, headed by Rabbi Yiḥya Yiṣḥaq, the Hakham Bashi, refused to deviate from the accepted customs and from the study of the Zohar. One of the Iqshim's targets in the fight against Rabbi Qafiḥ was his modern Turkish-Jewish school. Due to the Dor Daim and Iqshim dispute, the school closed 5 years after it was opened, before the educational system could develop a reserve of young people who had been exposed to its ideas.|$|E
