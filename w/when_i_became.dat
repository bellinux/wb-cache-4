Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that I was {{a member of}} the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E

I did not know, myself, until the sixth of this present month, when I went to look.

500|$|Even some staunch traditionalists {{from both}} the urban and rural folk music {{communities}} had an affinity for the Kingstons' polished commercial versions of older songs. In her memoir And A Voice To Sing With, singer and activist Joan Baez recalled that [...] "Traveling across the country {{with my mother and}} sisters, we heard the commercial songs of the budding folk boom for the first time, the Kingston Trio's 'Tom Dooley' and 'Scotch and Soda.' Before I turned into a snob and learned to look down upon all commercial folk music as bastardized and unholy, I loved the Kingston Trio. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>became</b> one of the leading practitioners of 'pure folk,' I still loved them..." [...] Arthel [...] "Doc" [...] Watson of North Carolina, {{one of the most respected}} and influential musicians performing traditional music, remarked, [...] "I’ll tell you who pointed all our noses in the right direction, even the traditional performers. They got us interested in trying to put the good stuff out there—the Kingston Trio. They got me interested in it!" ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2008, Usher's father, Usher Raymond III, died. Both men regretted not {{spending}} more time in each other's lives. [...] "Prayer for You", the seventh track on Here I Stand, is an interlude dedicated to Usher's son, reflective on {{his relationship with his}} own father; [...] "No matter what happened, my father always prayed for me. The only difference is, I'm gonna be there to be the father that my dad wished he was to me." [...] The first album name that artists and repertoire representative Mark Pitts conceived was [...] "Measure of a Man", but that title had already been used by Clay Aiken for his debut album, so Usher called it Here I Stand. Pitts said, [...] "It was perfect because becoming a man is about going though pain, sorrow, and happiness. Usher's done that! From the love songs to the party joints, it's exactly the story he wanted to tell." [...] Usher noted Here I Stand as beginning [...] "a new chapter in my life"; the album's liner notes contain a verse from 1 Corinthians 13: [...] "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>became</b> a man, I put away childish things." [...] Here I Stand marked Usher's growth from boyhood to manhood. In March 2007, it was announced that work on the album had begun. Usher outlined the album's concept: [...] "A lot of what I plan to offer with this album is kinda standing in this spot ... The king's back. I ain't gonna say 'back,' I never left." ...|$|E

[...] "The leading preoccupation of the YCL <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>became</b> secretary," [...] Maurice Rush says in his autobiography, [...] "was to organize unemployed youth." [...] Like many other observers, Rush (who was leader of the YCL in British Columbia after 1935) claims that the YCL {{was active in the}} Relief Camp Worker's Unions (RCWU), and played a role in mobilizing relief camp youth to participate in the On to Ottawa Trek. During the Trek, many working people opened their homes and cupboards to the protestors, sometimes sharing family relief rations. Communist women in Vancouver issued a call for a solidarity action, and five thousand working-class women came out to a special [...] "Mother's Day" [...] demonstration on behalf of the camp workers and to demand the closing of the camps.|$|E
2500|$|Waldman was a shocked {{member of}} the crowd on the street that {{witnessed}} the catastrophic Triangle Waist Company fire of 1911, an event which clearly always remained with him and served {{as one of the}} landmarks of his life. Waldman described the grim scene in his 1944 memoirs: [...] One Saturday afternoon in March of that year — March 25, to be precise — I was sitting at one of the reading tables in the old Astor Library... It was a raw, unpleasant day and the comfortable reading room seemed a delightful place to spend the remaining few hours until the library closed. I was deeply engrossed in my book <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>became</b> aware of fire engines racing past the building. By this time I was sufficiently Americanized to be fascinated by the sound of fire engines. Along with several others in the library, I ran out to see what was happening, and followed crowds of people {{to the scene of the}} fire.|$|E
2500|$|While at {{the head}} of AMC, Chapin spearheaded the {{acquisition}} of Jeep from the Kaiser Motors Division of Kaiser Industries in 1970. According to Chapin: [...] "Perhaps the easiest decision I ever made was the purchase of Jeep from Kaiser in 1970. I tried to buy it when George Romney (later Michigan governor) and Roy Abernethy were running AMC. Romney and Edgar Kaiser couldn't get along. I was running the international operations under Abernethy and I was following Jeep around. When they put up a plant, I followed with a Rambler plant because it worked like a charm. Where Jeep was, there were roads and gasoline. Abernethy didn't go for the idea and the first thing I did <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>became</b> chairman and got a little money was to buy Jeep. We got it for a song, about $75 million..." [...] American Motors' engineers and designers quickly overhauled Jeep and expanded its lineup, creating a valuable asset that attracted Renault, Chrysler, and ultimately DaimlerBenz AG.|$|E

2500|$|Williams {{was born}} (with his twin sister Cassandra) in San Diego, California, to 19-year-old Sandy Williams and her husband, 18-year-old Errick Williams. He was born inside of Jack Murphy Stadium, also {{referred}} to as [...] "the Murph" [...] by San Diegans. Growing up middle class, his parents divorced in 1983 and Williams, at the age of five, was taking care of his sisters by putting them to bed and even cooking for them. Perhaps due to his broken home and the fact that his father was gone at such an early age, Williams suffered from anger issues that eventually led his mother to send him to counseling. He also struggled academically, despite a test he took as a six-year-old which revealed that he had the intelligence of someone twice his age. Williams himself once said, [...] "I was always very bright, but not necessarily a hard worker. I think I was in eighth grade <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>became</b> really focused as a student and started getting good grades." [...] By high school Williams was an honor roll student and was named to the San Diego Union-Tribune All-Academic team.|$|E

[...] He told the CPAC audience that he arrived in Washington as [...] "a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution", and addressed the issue of illegal immigration - one of the major issues where conservatives have attacked McCain. He said that [...] "it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first", before addressing other immigration laws. [...] Mike Huckabee spoke to CPAC two days later and said, [...] "I know that there was some speculation that I might come here today to announce that I would be getting out of the race. But I {{want to make sure you}} understand. Am I quitting? Well, let's get that settled right now. No, I'm not. And the reason is simple—I never learned arithmetic. You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because I go back to that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular to be a Republican or a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others. Let others join the [...] "Me, too" [...] crowd. But I didn't get where I am today and I didn't fight the battles in a state that, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>became</b> its governor, was 90 percent Democrat, by simply echoing the voices of others. I did it by staking out a choice, stating that choice, making that choice and fighting for that choice, to believe that some things were right, some things were wrong, and it's better to be right and even to not win than it is to be wrong and to be a part of the crowd." ...|$|E
