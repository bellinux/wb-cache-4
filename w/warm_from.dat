They can form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50°. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores <b>warm.</b> <b>From</b> an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
25|$|The Unruh effect (or {{sometimes}} Fulling–Davies–Unruh effect) is {{the prediction}} that an accelerating observer will observe blackbody radiation where an inertial observer would observe none. In other words, the background {{appears to be}} <b>warm</b> <b>from</b> an accelerating reference frame; in layman's terms, a thermometer waved around in empty space, subtracting any other contribution to its temperature, will record a non-zero temperature. The ground state for an inertial observer is seen as in thermodynamic equilibrium with a non-zero temperature by the uniformly accelerating observer.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "A Letter to Her Husband Absent upon Public Employment" [...] Bradstreet {{writes a}} letter to her husband who is away from her working at his job. Bradstreet uses various metaphors to {{describe}} her husband. The most visible use of metaphor that Bradstreet uses is comparing her husband to the seasons. When summer is gone, winter soon arrives. Summer {{can be seen as}} a time of happiness and warmth. Winter on the other hand can be seen as being gloomy and cold. Bradstreet's husband is her Sun and when he is with her it is always summer. She is happy and <b>warm</b> <b>from</b> the love that her husband brings when he is around. When her husband leaves home for work, everything then becomes winter. It is a sad, cold time for Bradstreet and she wishes for her husband to soon return. [...] "Return, return, sweet Sol, from Capricorn." [...] She wants her husband to know that she needs him and without him everything feels gloomy. She is not concerned with what others think. It is not intended for anyone else except her husband. Bradstreet knows that the situation is inevitable, summer can't be around always and soon winter will follow. Her husband's job is important. He can't be there always and he must go away at times. [...] "Till nature's sad decree shall call thee hence." [...] One thing that keeps her going is that even though they are far away from each other, they are one with each other.|$|E
