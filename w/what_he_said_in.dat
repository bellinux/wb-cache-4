He has disavowed some of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> The Population Bomb. He still thinks that governments should discourage people from having more than two children, suggesting, for example a greater tax rate for larger families.|$|E
25|$|Under President Carter, the CIA was {{conducting}} covertly funded pro-American opposition against the Sandinista. In March 1981, Reagan told Congress that the CIA would protect El Salvador by preventing the shipment of Nicaraguan arms {{into the country}} to arm Communist rebels. This was a ruse. The CIA was actually arming and training Nicaraguans Contras in Honduras in hopes that they could depose the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Through William J. Casey's tenure as DCI little of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> the National Security Planning Group, or to President Reagan {{was supported by the}} intelligence branch of the CIA, so Casey formed the Central American Task Force, staffed with yes men from Covert Action. On December 21, 1982, Congress passed a law restricting the CIA to its stated mission, restricting the flow of arms from Nicaragua to El Salvador, prohibiting the use of funds to oust the Sandinistas. Reagan testified before Congress, assuring them that the CIA was not trying to topple the Nicaraguan government.|$|E

2500|$|In 1923, Arthur Lammers, {{a wealthy}} printer and student of metaphysics, persuaded Cayce to give {{readings}} on philosophical subjects. Cayce {{was told by}} Lammers that, while in his trance state, he spoke of Lammers' past lives and of reincarnation, something Lammers believed in. Reincarnation was a popular subject of the day but not an accepted part of Christian doctrine. Because of this, Cayce questioned his stenographer about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> his trance state and remained unconvinced. He challenged Lammers' charge that he had validated astrology and reincarnation in the following dialogue: ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the retreat}} three of Wellington's {{division}} commanders took {{matters into their}} own hands. Lieutenant General William Stewart and two others decided to disobey the army commander's direct order to retreat by a certain road. Stewart was joined by Lieutenant General James Broun-Ramsay, Lord Dalhousie and either Major General John Oswald or Lieutenant General Henry Clinton. When Wellington found them in the morning, the three divisions were in complete confusion. Later the army commander was asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> the situation and he replied, [...] "Oh, by God, it was too serious to say anything." [...] On 16 November, the French cavalry rounded up 600 stragglers and the following day, they captured even more.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob {{lived in the}} land of Canaan, and this is his family's story. When Joseph was 17, he fed the flock with his {{brothers}}, and he brought Jacob an evil report about his brothers. Because Joseph was the son of Jacob's old age, Jacob loved him more than his other children, and Jacob made him a coat of many colors, which caused Joseph's brothers to hate him. And Joseph made his brothers hate him more when he told them that he dreamed that they were binding sheaves in the field, and their sheaves bowed down to his sheaf. He told his brothers another dream, in which the sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowed down to him, and when he told his father, Jacob rebuked him, asking whether he, Joseph's mother, and his brothers would bow down to Joseph. Joseph's brothers envied him, but Jacob kept <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> mind. The first reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|The early 1950s {{literature}} transformed blitzkrieg into {{a historical}} military doctrine, which carried {{the signature of}} Liddell Hart and Guderian. The main evidence of Liddell Hart's deceit and [...] "tendentious" [...] report of history {{can be found in}} his letters to Erich von Manstein, Heinz Guderian and the relatives and associates of Erwin Rommel. Liddell Hart, in letters to Guderian, [...] "imposed his own fabricated version of blitzkrieg on the latter and compelled him to proclaim it as original formula". Kenneth Macksey found Liddell Hart's original letters to Guderian in the General's papers, requesting that Guderian give him credit for [...] "impressing him" [...] with his ideas of armoured warfare. When Liddell Hart was questioned about this in 1968 and the discrepancy between the English and German editions of Guderian's memoirs, [...] "he gave a conveniently unhelpful though strictly truthful reply. ('There is nothing about the matter in my file of correspondence with Guderian himself except...that I thanked him...for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> that additional paragraph'.)".|$|E

2500|$|Wordsworth {{predicted}} that Crabbe's poetry would last [...] "from its combined merits as truth and poetry fully {{as long as}} anything that has been expressed in verse since it first made its appearance", though on another occasion, according to Henry Crabb Robinson, he [...] "blamed Crabbe for his unpoetical mode of considering human nature and society." [...] This last opinion was also held by William Hazlitt, who complained that Crabbe's characters [...] "remind one of anatomical preservations; or {{may be said to}} bear the same relation to actual life that a stuffed cat in a glass-case does to the real one purring on the hearth." [...] Byron, besides <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> English Bards and Scotch Reviewers, declared, in 1816, that he considered Crabbe and Coleridge [...] "the first of these times in point of power and genius." [...] Byron had felt that English poetry had been steadily on the decline since the depreciation of Pope, and pointed to Crabbe as the last remaining hope of a degenerate age.|$|E
