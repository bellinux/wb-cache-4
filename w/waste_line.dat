40|$|This {{fact sheet}} {{presents}} general guidance regarding {{the management of}} screen printing wastewater. If you follow {{the intent of the}} Best Management Practices (BMPs) you may discharge your wastewater to the Metro sanitary sewer. These guidelines are important because Metro must protect {{the health and safety of}} those who collect and treat wastewater. Metro also ensures that municipal treatment plants operate effectively, that biosolids (sludge) from these plants is not contaminated, and that federal and state water quality and hazardous waste regulations are complied with. To accomplish this, Metro develops discharge limitations and best management practices for industrial wastewater discharges. If your wastewater has different characteristics than those described in this fact sheet, or you have other questions call the Business <b>Waste</b> <b>Line</b> at 296 - 3976. Background Screen cleaning operations may generate wastewater that is disposed of in the sanitary sewer. About 75 % of screen print shops,generate wastewater. Out of 22 randomly selected King County shops, 7 did not generate wastewater, each of the 15 shops that. generated wastewater was sampled. The volume and characteristics of wastewater varies among shops. Volumes range from 0. 5 to 170 gallondday. Characteristics of wastewater depend on the inks used, the products used to clean screens, and the cleaning procedure. Metals Metals are found in some ink pigments. In general, textile printers use inks that are free of lead pigments. Sign, poster, label and electronic component printers tend to use solventbased inks that may contain lead pigments. Lead, copper, chromium and zinc were found in screen printing wastewater. Metals discharged to the sanitary sewer end up in biowlids produced in the municipal treatment plant. These biosolids are spre 3 d on forests, farms and made into compost for commercial and residential landscaping. Metals in the biosolids must be maintained at acceptable levels or the use of biosolids will be restricted and disposal costs could sharply increase [...] ...|$|E

25|$|This slip {{is poured}} into the space between plaster of Paris molds. The toilet bowl, rim, tank and tank lid require {{separate}} molds.

Then, the workers remove plugs to allow any excess liquid slip to drain from the cavities of the mold (this excess slip is recycled for later use). The drained-out slip leaves hollow voids inside the fixture, using less material to keep it both lighter and easier to fire in a kiln. This molding process allows the formation of intricate internal <b>waste</b> <b>lines</b> in the fixture; the drain's hollow cavities are poured out as slip.|$|R

40|$|This project, {{which began}} in FY 97, {{involves}} both the flow loop research on plugging and unplugging of waste transfer pipelines, and the large-scale industrial equipment test of plugging locating and unplugging technologies. In FY 98, the related work was performed under the project name ''Mixing, Settling, and Pipe Unplugging of <b>Waste</b> Transfer <b>Lines.</b> '' The mixing, settling, and pipeline plugging and unplugging are critical to the design and maintenance of a waste transfer pipeline system, especially for the High-Level Waste (HLW) pipeline transfer. The major objective of this work is to recreate pipeline plugging conditions for equipment testing of plug locating and removal and to provide systematic operating data for modification of equipment design and enhancement of performance of <b>waste</b> transfer <b>lines</b> used at DOE sites. As the waste tank clean-out and decommissioning program becomes active at the DOE sites, there is an increasing potential that the <b>waste</b> slurry transfer <b>lines</b> will become plugged and unable to transport waste slurry from one tank to another or from the mixing tank to processing facilities. Transfer systems may potentially become plugged if the solids concentration of the material being transferred increases beyond the capability of the prime mover or if upstream mixing is inadequately performed. Plugging can occur due to the solids' settling in either the mixing tank, the pumping system, or the transfer lines. In order to enhance and optimize the slurry's removal and transfer, refined and reliable data on the mixing, sampling, and pipe unplugging systems must be obtained based on both laboratory-scale and simulated in-situ operating conditions...|$|R
