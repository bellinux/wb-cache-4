5|$|Bismarck {{left the}} Kiel Fjord {{on the morning}} of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, Bismarck reached Gotenhafen (now Gdynia) the next day. Here Bismarck {{conducted}} a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk Bay). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a number of tests for the crew, which they passed easily. During high speed trials, Bismarck reached a top speed of , exceeding the design speed. However, one weakness quickly became apparent: without using the rudders but only the screws, Bismarck <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to steer.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{took place}} over several days at Music Bank, the famous {{rehearsal}} studios in London. Actor Michael spent forty hours practising the drumming beforehand, but with vision inside the suit limited to a camera feed piped to a small screen inside the head, precision <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible.</b> Many takes ended with the wooden drum sticks broken against the rims, sending shards of wood flying off-camera. This, combined with the difficulty of choreographing the delicate movements of the gorilla head with Michael's acting, meant that 35takes were required to produce the final 90-second scene.|$|E
5|$|The First Test was a {{continuation}} of the trend of English batsmen being largely unable to cope with Australia's pacemen. Hutton was the only Englishman to pass 50 in the MCC match, and at Trent Bridge only he and Compton managed this feat. Apart from Hardstaff, none of the remaining batsmen passed 25. Wisden's verdict was that England fought back very well, but that avoiding defeat <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> after their poor batting on the first day. Bowes considered the defensive English bowling display worthy of a draw, and blamed the first innings batting for the failure to prevenet defeat. However, he believed the English tactics to be justified and should have been continued.|$|E

No fewer than sixteen (most of the old standing) went away; and with them the very beauty and vigour of the stage; they who were left being {{for the most part}} learners, boys and girls, a very unequal match for them that revolted.|$|E
5|$|The Nuremberg Laws had a {{crippling}} {{economic and social}} impact on the Jewish community. Persons convicted of violating the marriage laws were imprisoned, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Nazi concentration camps. Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores, many of which closed {{due to lack of}} customers. As Jews were no longer permitted to work in the civil service or government-regulated professions such as medicine and education, many middle class business owners and professionals were forced to take menial employment. Emigration was problematic, as Jews were required to remit up to 90 per cent of their wealth as a tax upon leaving the country. By 1938 it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country willing to take them. Mass deportation schemes such as the Madagascar Plan proved to be impossible for the Nazis to carry out, and starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist gave {{evidence}} that he had identified magnesium hydroxide, a corrosion product, in fuel passages in one of Amana's engines. Counsel for the Department of Civil Aviation explained that evidence gathered during investigation of the crash indicated water {{in some of the}} fuel on board Amana was responsible for the corrosion products found in engines numbers 1 and 4; for the rough running of an engine heard by a number of witnesses; and for the intermittent failure of all engines, leading to the aircraft descending to ground level. The Inquiry heard evidence from the Department of Civil Aviation's Acting Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, C.A.J. Lum, a former RAAF Douglas Dakota pilot, who described his personal experience of a flight in 1946 in which all fuel tanks were checked for the presence of water prior to take-off and the flight proceeded normally for 20 minutes until both engines began running roughly. Lum returned to the aerodrome and checked again for water in the tanks, this time finding a significant amount of water. Counsel for the Vacuum Oil Co. explained that it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> for water to be introduced to an aircraft during refuelling, and vigorously rejected the theory that water in the fuel contributed to the crash.|$|E

5|$|After {{participating}} in the planned rebellion, Edmund became less popular at court. He was still allowed to accompany the king's wife Philippa to her coronation in January 1330, but his appearances at court became less frequent. At this point he became involved in another plot against the court, when he was convinced by rumours that his brother was still alive. It later emerged that Roger Mortimer himself was responsible for leading Edmund into this belief, in a form of entrapment. The plot was revealed, and in the parliament of March 1330 Edmund was indicted and condemned to death as a traitor. Upon hearing that the verdict was death, the condemned earl pleaded with Edward III for his life, offering to walk from Winchester to London with a rope around his neck {{as a sign of}} atonement. Edward III however knew that leniency was not an option for the aforementioned entrapment utilized by Mortimer could extend to him and potentially be subversive to his own kingship if his father, Edward II truly was alive. Thus Edward III sanctioned the killing of his uncle. It <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to find anyone willing to perform the execution of a man of royal blood, until a convicted murderer eventually beheaded Edmund in exchange for a pardon. Edmund's body was initially buried in a Franciscan church in Winchester, but it was removed to Westminster Abbey in 1331.|$|E

25|$|It is an {{interesting}} point {{to note that the}} selective breeding of cattle <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> before the enclosure of land by dykes and ditches in the 18th-century, because prior to this the cattle were free to mix without much control from the farmer and establishing or maintaining a 'pure breed' was therefore practically impossible.|$|E

However, ‚Äúgetting rich quick‚Äù was a dream that <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to achieve. The immigrants were paid a very low salary and worked long hours of exhausting work. Also, everything that the immigrants consumed had to be purchased from the landowner (see truck system). Soon, their debts became very high.|$|E
25|$|Finding coal {{for heat}} in winter was another preoccupation. The Germans had {{transferred}} the {{authority over the}} coal mines of northern France from Paris to their military headquarters in Brussels. The priority for the coal that did arrive in Paris was for the use in factories. Even with ration cards, adequate coal for heating <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to find. Supplies for normal heating needs were not restored until 1949.|$|E
25|$|The 1950s brought {{important}} changes. Zalaegerszeg got a more industrial profile {{with the}} construction of the textile factory and the discovery of oil resources in 1952. The railway line was expanded, too. Lots of workers were commuting from the nearby villages, because it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to find a flat in the city, so several residents of Zalaegerszeg (mostly those who were considered to be opposed to the Socialist system) were forced to relocate.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the Inquisition's history, it was rivaled {{by local}} ecclesiastical and secular jurisdictions. No matter how determined, no pope succeeded in {{establishing}} complete {{control over the}} prosecution of heresy. Medieval kings, princes, bishops, and civil authorities all {{had a role in}} prosecuting heresy, except where they individually opposed the practice. The practice reached its apex {{in the second half of}} the 13th century. During this period, the tribunals were almost entirely free from any authority, including that of the pope. Therefore, it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to eradicate abuse.|$|E

Without such communication it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> for any resistance strategy to be coordinated, but the operators were highly vulnerable to detection which was improving as the war progressed.|$|E
