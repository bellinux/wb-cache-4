2500|$|The German wine {{industry}} consists of many small vineyard owners. The 1999 viticultural survey counted 68 598 vineyard owners, down from 76 683 in Western Germany in 1989/90, {{for an average}} size of 1.5 ha. Most of the 40 625 operators of less than 0.5 ha should likely be classified as hobby winemakers. Many smaller vineyard owners do not pursue viticulture as a full-time occupation, {{but rather as a}} supplement to other agriculture or to hospitality. It is not uncommon for a visitor to a German wine region to find that a small family-owned Gasthaus has its own wine. Smaller grape-growers who do not wish to, or are unable to, commercialise their own wine have several options available: sell the grapes (either on the market each harvest year, or on long-term contract with larger wineries looking to supplement their own production), deliver the grapes to a wine-making cooperative (called Winzergenossenschaft in Germany), or sell the <b>wine</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> to winemaking firms that use them in [...] "bulk brands" [...] or as a base wine for Sekt. Those who own vineyards in truly good locations also have the option of renting them out to larger producers to operate.|$|E

50|$|He {{was only}} {{twenty years old}} when he took over the {{operations}} of the Château Mouton Rothschild vineyards and two years later, in 1924, came up with the unheard of idea of bottling the entire vintage at the Château, an idea that other producers of Premier Cru wines soon copied. Previously, vineyards sold their <b>wines</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk,</b> leaving the maturing, bottling, labeling and marketing to be handled by the wine merchants. Philippe de Rothschild's idea was to maintain control over the quality of his product and allow marketing of the brand name. Two years later, he developed a de facto price-fixing arrangement among other top Bordeaux producers.|$|R
50|$|Négociants buy {{everything}} from grapes to grape must to <b>wines</b> <b>in</b> {{various states of}} completion. In the case of grapes or must, the négociant performs virtually all the winemaking.

50|$|Not all growers {{produce their}} own wine, their grapes either being {{delivered}} to the co-operative wineries where the wine can be purchased in bottles and in bulk 5 litre and 10 litre plastic containers, or to the merchants who have facilities for vinification, bottling, and distribution on a commercial scale.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using δ(15) N {{as an additional}} isotopic marker able to link wine to its area of origin was investigated. The whole production chain (soil - leaves - grape - wine) was considered. Moreover the research included evaluation {{of the effect of}} the fermentation process, the use of different types of yeast and white and red vinification, the addition of nitrogen adjuvants and ultrasound lysis simulating wine ageing. The δ(15) N of grapes and <b>wine</b> was measured <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> samples and compounds, specifically in proline, for the first time. Despite isotopic fractionation from soil to wine, the δ(15) N values of leaves, grapes, wine and particularly must and wine proline, conserved the variability of δ(15) N in the growing soil. Fermentation and ultrasound treatment did not affect the δ(15) N values of grape must, which was therefore conserved <b>in</b> <b>wine.</b> The addition of inorganic or organic adjuvants was able to influence the δ(15) N of bulk wine, depending on the amount and the difference between the δ(15) N of must and that of the adjuvant. The δ(15) N of wine proline was not influenced by adjuvant addition and is therefore the best marker for tracing the geographical origin of wine. This article is protected by copyright.

5000|$|Luxembourg wine is {{primarily}} {{produced in the}} southeastern part of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, with vineyards overlooking the Moselle River. Along this river, which for 42 km makes up part of the border between Luxembourg and Germany, wine is made in three countries. There is a continuous history of winemaking along Moselle and in Luxembourg going back to Ancient Roman times. Wine production in 2006/07 was 123,652 hectoliter from 1237 ha of vineyards. Out of total wine exports of 87,776 hectoliter in 2005/06, 71,726 hectoliter or 82% was exported to nearby Belgium.

40|$|The {{authors of}} this paper analyze export and {{competitiveness}} of wine export from the Republic of Serbia. Main goal of the research reflects in perceiving basic features of export and competitiveness of wine export from the Republic of Serbia on international market. The analysis encloses time period 2004 - 2007. The amount of wine export is very modest and, in observed period, was realized average export of 8, 6 million litres, which value amounts 9, 6 million USD. Only 5 % of total domestic production is exported. In export structure dominate CEFTA agreement signatory countries. Export price of wine from Serbia is doubly less in regard to average world price, and thrice {{in regard to the}} biggest world exporter – Italy. Average export price of wine produced in Serbia is on the level of 1, 11 USD per litre. The export structure is very unfavourable, i. e. dominates <b>wine</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> (90 %), while only 10 % of total export makes wine in bottles, which, for sure, reflects to attained export price. The authors quote that main limitation factors of Serbian wine export are small surfaces under grapevine, inappropriate structure of production, i. e. lack of qualitative and top-class (famous) wines. The wines which produce in Serbia, on international market, are competitive by price. However, low quality represents limitation factor of competitiveness increase. Unfavourable production structure and wine export represents one more limitation factor of competitiveness increase. In total wine production in Serbia, top-class wines participate with less than 15 %, participation of qualitative wines is 20 %, while the higher participation, more than 65 %, have table wines, and more produces white (64 %) than rose wines (36 %). Previously mentioned is in opposition with demand trends on international market. Along with quality increase and change of production and export structure, there can be expected also increase of Serbian wine prices on international market. Analyzing the world turnover of wine, the authors resolve that leading exporters of wine have developed production and long tradition in wine export. Besides, there are series of governmental stimulations, aiming at export increase, which is significant from aspect of competitiveness increase. The European Union has increased wine export quota from 55 to 63 thousand hectolitres to the Republic of Serbia for duty free export, and mentioned decision on export quotas increase represents an incentive for faster development of viticulture and wine production in Serbia. As an imperative, the authors quote increase of high-quality wines participation in export, which have higher price in regard to table wines. They find that own chance for export must not be looked-for in quantity, because Serbia is relatively small wine producer, concerning high quality according to selected market segments, but also that Serbia must leave the path of industrial wines and produces only high-quality wines. In this paper has been pointed out to necessary measures, aiming at more dynamic export and competitiveness increase of wine export from Serbia. The Authors find that main focus should be on intellectual capital, which means permanent education of producers, in order to get wines of the highest quality which will find their consumers in a competitive world market. wine, export, competitiveness, Agribusiness, Crop Production/Industries, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
