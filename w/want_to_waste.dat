A number of methods to minimize this have been developed for use in trawling. Bycatch reduction grids or square mesh panels of net can be fitted to parts of the trawl, allowing certain species to escape while retaining others.|$|E

He had put in a light fuel load in an attempt to pass the cars in front of him; most drivers that qualify in low {{positions}} tend to do the opposite and go for heavier fuel loads to make one less pit stop (approximately 30 seconds each in terms of time loss) than the leaders, as they do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> a light car and an extra pit stop for a faster car that is stuck behind slower vehicles. Three laps later, Nelson Piquet Jr. hit the circuit wall at turn seventeen, one of the turns on the circuit which did not have a crane nearby, necessitating the deployment of the safety car.|$|E

2500|$|Coast redwood reproduces both sexually by {{seed and}} asexually by {{sprouting}} of buds, layering, or lignotubers. Seed production begins at 10–15 years of age. Cones {{develop in the}} winter and mature by fall. In the early stages, the cones look like flowers, and are commonly called [...] "flowers" [...] by professional foresters, although this is not strictly correct. Coast redwoods produce many cones, with redwoods in new forests producing thousands per year. The cones themselves hold 90–150 seeds, but viability of seed are low, typically well below 15% with one estimate of average rates being 3 to 10 percent. The low viability may discourage seed predators, which do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> time sorting chaff (empty seeds) from edible seeds. Successful germination often requires a fire or flood, reducing competition for seedlings. The winged seeds are small and light, weighing 3.3–5.0mg (200–300 seeds/g; 5,600–8,500/ounce). The wings are not effective for wide dispersal, and seeds are dispersed by wind an average of only [...] from the parent tree. Seedlings are susceptible to fungal infection and predation by banana slugs, bush rabbits, and nematodes. Most seedlings do not survive their first three years. However, those that become established grow very fast, with young trees known to reach [...] tall in 20 years.|$|E

Rabin felt nervous and pressured when their record label, Atco Records, informed him that they wished for another hit single like [...] "Owner of a Lonely Heart" [...] was, but he wished {{to move from the}} band's past and do something different regardless of its success. At Rabin's suggestion, the band agreed to relocate to Lark Recording Studios, a facility situated by Castello di Carimate, a castle in Carimate, Italy. He thought that such a location would help the band bond together and bring some new ideas to the music which would create a better album as a result. Rabin first spoke of the friction between Anderson and Squire during this time three years after the album's release, which suited him as it [...] "created a great vacuum for me to work in". Squire maintained that Rabin made the choice to record there as a step to save money and for tax purposes, and called it the wrong move, a view that Rabin denied years later and clarified that [...] "It was never the intention to save money, although I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> money." [...] Squire recalled more time being spent on what recording equipment to use than the music itself during the entire project, which also affected the tense situation.|$|E

[...] After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the wrong corner. Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that I was the aggressor. I kept my plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> my time with a third fight.
