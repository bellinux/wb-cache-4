5|$|The {{game was}} {{critically}} acclaimed. In 2010, it received awards for Most Challenging Game from IGN, and for Best Downloadable Game from GameSpot and GameTrailers. Critics lauded the game's precise control, retro artwork, and soundtrack. Reviewers generally praised the game's challenge, although some warned {{that not all}} players <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> the level of difficulty. The game was a commercial success, and sold {{more than one million}} copies as of January 2012. A sequel, Super Meat Boy Forever, is currently in development for release in 2018.|$|E

As wedding preparations continue, Stephanie becomes upset after learning that Heidi has chosen her sister Holly as her maid-of-honor. During the bridal shower, Stephanie assumes the responsibilities after she becomes increasingly displeased with Holly's poor performance. After she makes amends with Spencer, Darlene gives him her blessing for the nuptials. While out for dinner, Brody tries to convince Lauren to attend the wedding, knowing that Heidi <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> her presence.

5|$|Goya went to {{exile in}} France in 1824, and {{ownership}} of the house passed to his grandson Mariano. An 1830 inventory by Brugada indicates that the work took a full wall between two windows on the first floor, opposite A Pilgrimage to San Isidro. On the wall to the right were Saturn Devouring His Son and Judith and Holofernes. Leocadia, Two Old Men and Two Old Men Eating Soup were on the left wall. Art historian Lawrence Gowing observed that the lower floor was divided thematically, with a male side– Saturn and A Pilgrimage to San Isidro– and a female side– Judith and Holofernes, Witches' Sabbath and Leocadia. The house changed owners {{a number of times}} before March 1873, when it came into the possession of the Belgian Frédéric Émile d'Erlanger, who speculated that the area <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> in value over the coming years. The murals had deteriorated badly after many years on the walls. To preserve them, the new owner of the house had them transferred to canvas {{under the direction of the}} art restorer of the Museo del Prado, Salvador Martinez Cubells. Following their exhibition at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1878, where they were met with little reaction, d'Erlanger donated them to the Spanish state in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Legal {{disputes}} {{carried on}} for years, {{exacerbated by the}} fact that Marsh owned land near Van Cortlandt Park in particular. Opponents argued that building a park system would divert funds from more important infrastructure like schools and docks; that everyone in the city, instead of just the property owners near the proposed park, was required to pay taxes to pay for the parks' construction; and that since Marsh was trying to parcel off some of his land to developers, the park's size should be reduced in order to prevent him from profiting off park usage. However, most of this opposition was directed at the construction of Pelham Bay Park, which was then in Westchester. Supporters argued that the parks were for the benefit of all the city's citizens, thus justifying the citywide park tax; that the value of properties near the parks <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> greatly over time; that the Commission had only chosen property that could easily be converted into a park; and that Pelham Bay Park would soon be annexed to the city. Ultimately, the parks were established despite the objections of major figures like Mayors William Russell Grace and Abram Hewitt; Comptroller Edward V. Loew; and Assemblymen Henry Bergh and Theodore Roosevelt.|$|E
25|$|SGML found wide {{acceptance}} and use in fields with very large-scale documentation requirements. However, many found it cumbersome {{and difficult to}} learn—a side effect of its design attempting {{to do too much}} and be too flexible. For example, SGML made end tags (or start-tags, or even both) optional in certain contexts, because its developers thought markup would be done manually by overworked support staff who <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> saving keystrokes.|$|E

25|$|Journalists {{were able}} to play The Last Guardian at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016 and the 2016 Tokyo Game Show {{in the months before}} the game's release, and several {{expressed}} further concerns {{about the nature of the}} game's lengthy development period. Patrick Garrett, writing for VG247, found that the visuals felt flat and aged considering modern hardware capabilities, and expressed concern that while older gamers would readily purchase the title, The Last Guardian may not draw in enough newer gamers to be a commercial success. Philip Kollar for Polygon, though still impressed with the characters, graphics, and core gameplay, found controlling the character difficult and managing the game's camera tricky, elements that made the game feel like a PlayStation 2 title rather than something on modern hardware. Wireds Chris Kohler found much of the demo to require patient observation of Trico's movements and puzzle solving, which, he commented, some players <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> but were elements that have slowly been phased out of action games over the last console generation, and other players may not have the patience for these. Brian Ashcroft of Kotaku also noted that the demo's pace was often set by how fast Trico would respond or react, which may test the patience of players looking for a more action-based experience.|$|E

500|$|The few criticisms for {{the game}} {{centered}} on its length and pacing. Clements noted that not all players <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> a game with a [...] "deliberate, melancholic pace" [...] and short duration, comments echoed by the Edge review. Miller noted {{the lack of a}} complex gameplay elements in Journey, and Shaw was disappointed that the game was only a few hours long, though Douglas said the length was perfect. Miller concluded the game could be compared to [...] "a musical concert, a well-directed film, or a long-awaited book", while Clements concluded, [...] "completing Journey will create memories that last for years".|$|E
500|$|A common {{criticism}} amongst {{reviewers for}} Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 {{was the lack}} of additional on-disc content beyond the expanded character roster and gameplay tweaks. While IGN's Steven Hopper praised the inclusion of new characters, he criticized the lack of new features and modes. As a result, he stated that the game's [...] price tag was [...] "a little hard to swallow". Tim Turi of Game Informer stated that while hardcore fans <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> Capcom's balancing tweaks, casual fans who already played Fate of Two Worlds and were only interested in new characters would [...] "likely be left wanting".|$|E

Erren Van Duine, writing for RPG Site, said that fans <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> the scale of the narrative, and praised the handling of the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos. She did note that some plot points seemed only included for the sake of convenience, and that the ending forced a second playthrough to see the whole story.|$|E

500|$|Retrospective reviewers {{recommended}} {{the game for}} those who mastered the original, or those who <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> painful challenge. Casual Mario fans, GameZone wrote, would not find much to enjoy. Nintendo Life reviewer felt that while the original was designed for recklessness, its sequel taught patience, and despite its difficulty, remained both [...] "fiendishly clever" [...] and fun. On the other hand, GamesRadar felt that the game was an unoriginal, boring retread, and apart from its [...] "pointlessly cruel" [...] difficulty, not worthy of the player's time. GamesRadar and IGN agreed with Nintendo of America's choice against releasing the harder game in the 1980s, though Eurogamer thought that The Lost Levels was [...] "technically a much better game" [...] than the Doki Doki Panic-based Super Mario Bros. 2 the American market received instead.|$|E
500|$|While most of {{the songs}} that appear on this record {{can be found on}} Yankovic's first eight studio albums, there are several unique inclusions.

Early pressings of the album included the incorrect version of [...] "My Bologna", but this was later rectified in subsequent pressings.

Finally, the third disc contains the single edit of [...] "UHF" [...] as opposed to the lengthier version available on UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff; this was done because Yankovic figured that [...] "fans <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> having both versions available." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1979, Nora Roberts was {{a stay-at-home}} mother with two small children.

[...] After developing her idea into a novel-length contemporary romance, she continued writing and soon finished six more manuscripts. Roberts submitted her work to Harlequin Enterprises, a Canadian company considered the foremost publisher of romance novels in North America. [...] Harlequin typically published works by British authors set in the British Commonwealth, but in 1975 Harlequin relaxed its criteria slightly and purchased several novels from American Janet Dailey. [...] Unconvinced that the market <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> novels such as Dailey's [...] all featuring American protagonists and set in the United States [...] Harlequin was unwilling to further expose itself to risk.
