5|$|Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In {{its early}} stages, an {{intoxicated}} person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms {{give way to}} late-stage manganism, which resembles Parkinson's disease. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards <b>without</b> <b>falling,</b> rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance. Unlike Parkinson's disease, manganism is not associated with loss of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with L-DOPA. Symptoms of late-stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal.|$|E
5|$|At the Crucible O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Marcus Campbell in {{the last}} 32, Ali Carter {{in the last}} 16, Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. He reached the final <b>without</b> <b>falling</b> behind even once, and defeated Barry Hawkins 18–12 to win his fifth world title. O'Sullivan's break of 103 in the 15th frame was his 128th century break at the Crucible Theatre, breaking Stephen Hendry's record of 127 Crucible centuries. During the final he extended the record to 131 century breaks. O'Sullivan became the only player to score six century breaks in a World Championship final. He also became only the third player to retain his title at the Crucible after Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Falling is {{associated}} with psychosocial sequelae that may influence functional performance and fall risk. Exer-cise can improve psychosocial factors. To address the research questions (1) Do psychosocial variables differ among persons with and <b>without</b> <b>falls?</b> and (2) Among persons who fall, can exercise improve psychosocial variables? we evaluated psycho-social and functional performance variables in older persons with and <b>without</b> recent <b>falls.</b> A pretest and posttest design with a nonequivalent control group was used. Community-residing elderly individuals participated, 66 had falls {{in the past year}} (fallers) and 77 had no falls (nonfallers). Participants completed measures of self-esteem, depression, psychological impact, and functional performance at baseline and 6 weeks.

25|$|The leg {{arrangement}} of passerine birds contains a special adaptation for perching. A tendon {{in the rear}} of the leg running from the underside of the toes to the muscle behind the tibiotarsus will automatically be pulled and tighten when the leg bends, causing the foot to curl and become stiff when the bird lands on a branch. This enables passerines to sleep while perching <b>without</b> <b>falling</b> off. This is especially useful for passerine birds that develop nocturnal lifestyles.|$|E

25|$|Moro faced big challenges, especially, the {{necessity}} to conciliate the Christian and popular mission of the Democrazia Cristiana with the rising laicist and liberal values of the Italian society in the 1960s, and {{the necessity}} to integrate new important social groups (youth, women, workers) in the democratic system. DC's mission, in Moro's vision, was intended to recover the popular class that supported Fascism and ferry them in the democratic system. The contradiction of Moro's political stance was in trying to reconcile the extreme mobility of social transformations with {{the continuity of the}} institutions of representative democracy, and the integration of the masses in the State, <b>without</b> <b>falling</b> into autocracy.|$|E
25|$|The Anderson shelters {{performed}} well under blast and ground shock, {{because they had}} good connectivity and ductility, which meant that they could absorb {{a great deal of}} energy through plastic deformation <b>without</b> <b>falling</b> apart. (This was in marked contrast to other trench shelters which used concrete for the sides and roof, which were inherently unstable when disturbed by the effects of an explosion - if the roof slab lifted, the walls fell in under the static earth pressure; if the walls were pushed in, the roof would be unsupported at one edge and would fall.) However, when the pattern of all night alerts became established, it was realised that in winter Anderson shelters were cold damp holes in the ground and often flooded in wet weather, and so their occupancy factor would be poor. This {{led to the development of}} the indoor Morrison shelter.|$|E
25|$|The stirrup, {{which gives}} greater {{stability}} to a rider, {{has been described}} {{as one of the most}} significant inventions in the history of warfare, prior to gunpowder. As a tool allowing expanded use of horses in warfare, the stirrup is often called the third revolutionary step in equipment, after the chariot and the saddle. The basic tactics of mounted warfare were significantly altered by the stirrup. A rider supported by stirrups was less likely to fall off while fighting, and could deliver a blow with a weapon that more fully employed the weight and momentum of horse and rider. Among other advantages, stirrups provided greater balance and support to the rider, which allowed the knight to use a sword more efficiently <b>without</b> <b>falling,</b> especially against infantry adversaries. Contrary to common modern belief, however, it has been asserted that stirrups actually did not enable the horseman to use a lance more effectively (cataphracts had used lances since antiquity), though the cantled saddle did.|$|E

25|$|The United States' {{occupation}} of Japan (1945–52) {{resulted in the}} rebuilding {{of the nation and}} the creation of a democratic nation. US assistance totaled about US$1.9 billion during the occupation, or about 15% of the nation's imports and 4% of GNP in that period. About 59% of this aid was in the form of food, 15% in industrial materials, and 12% in transportation equipment. US grant assistance, however, tapered off quickly in the mid-1950s. US military procurement from Japan peaked at a level equivalent to 7% of Japan's GNP in 1953 and fell below 1% after 1960. A variety of United States-sponsored measures during the occupation, such as land reform, contributed to the economy's later performance by increasing competition. In particular, the post-war purge of industrial leaders allowed new talent to rise in the management of the nation's rebuilt industries. Finally, the economy benefited from foreign trade because it was able to expand exports rapidly enough to pay for imports of equipment and technology <b>without</b> <b>falling</b> into debt, as had a number of developing nations in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|During the British {{invasions of}} the Río de la Plata, British forces {{attacked}} Buenos Aires twice. In 1806 the British successfully invaded Buenos Aires, but an army from Montevideo led by Santiago de Liniers defeated them. In the {{brief period of}} British rule, the viceroy Rafael Sobremonte managed to escape to Córdoba and designated this city as capital. Buenos Aires became the capital again after its liberation, but Sobremonte could not resume his duties as viceroy. Santiago de Liniers, chosen as new viceroy, prepared the city against a possible new British attack and repelled the attempted invasion of 1807. The militarization generated in society changed {{the balance of power}} favorably for the criollos (in contrast to peninsulars), as well as the development of the Peninsular War in Spain. An attempt by the peninsular merchant Martín de Álzaga to remove Liniers and replace him with a Junta was defeated by the criollo armies. However, by 1810 it would be those same armies who would support a new revolutionary attempt, successfully removing the new viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. This is known as the May Revolution, which is now celebrated as a national holiday. This event started the Argentine War of Independence, and many armies left Buenos Aires to fight the diverse strongholds of royalist resistance, with varying levels of success. The government was held first by two Juntas of many members, then by two triumvirates, and finally by a unipersonal office, the Supreme Director. Formal independence from Spain was declared in 1816, at the Congress of Tucumán. Buenos Aires managed to endure the whole Spanish American wars of independence <b>without</b> <b>falling</b> again under royalist rule.|$|E
