5|$|The {{prosthetic}} phase begins {{once the}} implant is well integrated (or has a reasonable assurance {{that it will}} integrate) and an abutment is in place to bring it through the mucosa. Even {{in the event of}} early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners <b>will</b> <b>place</b> temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist will work to restore the vertical dimension of occlusion, the esthetics of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.|$|E

Joseph Smith taught that there were certain sins so grievous that man may commit, that they <b>will</b> <b>place</b> the transgressors beyond the power of the atonement of Christ. If these offenses are committed, then the blood of Christ will not cleanse them from their sins even though they repent. Therefore their only hope is to have their own blood shed to atone, as far as possible, in their behalf.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, Emanuel {{argues that}} there are four major {{arguments}} presented by opponents of euthanasia: a) not all deaths are painful; b) alternatives, such as cessation of active treatment, combined {{with the use of}} effective pain relief, are available; c) the distinction between active and passive euthanasia is morally significant; and d) legalising euthanasia <b>will</b> <b>place</b> society on a slippery slope, which will lead to unacceptable consequences. In fact, in Oregon, in 2013, pain wasn't one of the top five reasons people sought euthanasia. Top reasons were a loss of dignity, and a fear of burdening others.|$|E

Shepard having low EMS and picking Destroy {{will result in the}} Crucible devastating the galaxy, implicitly killing the Normandy's crew and leaving a more pessimistic outlook for the future. If Shepard has sufficiently high EMS, the surviving Normandy members hold a memorial service for him/her. The squad member closest to Shepard <b>will</b> <b>place</b> Shepard's name on the memorial wall (Control), and also comfort EDI (Synthesis). However, they will refuse to do so and instead smile hopefully if Shepard chooses Destroy.|$|E
