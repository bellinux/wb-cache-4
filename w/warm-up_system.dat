50|$|Also in 1941, Packard {{introduced}} the Electro-Matic clutch, {{which was a}} vacuum operated clutch pedal, signaled by {{the position of the}} accelerator. Significantly, it came with an 'off' switch, probably {{due to the fact that}} the system was somewhat unstable during engine <b>warm-up.</b> Packard's <b>system</b> was used in conjunction with their regular transmission so the H-pattern shifting remained.|$|R

The production capacity {{is expected to}} increase up 50,000 bbl per day by the end of 2009. [...] The system has been improved to maintain processing levels at cold temperatures. A steam jacket has been installed which creates drier sand and keeps the pumps, plumbing and the extraction chamber warmer during standby time, minimizing <b>warm-up</b> time. <b>System</b> performance has improved with the installation of more powerful pumps and additional sensors for better indications of mass flow, temperature and material levels. The upgraded process control provides more precise data required in order to measure the system's performance.|$|R

Based on results of numerical model calculations, the improvement in performance of the catalytic converter is verified for the same quantity of precious metal. Furthermore, systems with parabolic axial catalyst distribution are shown to have shorter <b>warm-up</b> times than <b>systems</b> with uniform axial catalyst distribution.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{modelling}} of one-dimensional (1 D) unsteady flows in the complete exhaust system of spark-ignited (SI) engines with secondary air injection, to reduce the catalyst light-off time and {{to speed up the}} after-treatment <b>system</b> <b>warm-up.</b> In particular, the numerical code GASDYN, developed by the authors, has been extended to model the injection of air in the exhaust manifold, simulating the post-oxidation of pollutant emissions in the ducts. The main chemical reactions arising in the gas phase, in {{the upper part of the}} exhaust manifold, have been included, considering the oxidation of C 3 H 6, C 3 H 8, and CO, and the steam reforming of C 3 H 6 and C 3 H 8. The heat released in the gas due to the exothermal reactions has been taken into account to evaluate the exhaust gas temperature caused by the injection of air. The gas composition in the exhaust pipe system is imposed by the cylinder discharge process after the calculation of the combustion process via a thermodynamic multizone combustion model, based on a ‘fractal’ approach and augmented by kinetic emission sub-models for the prediction of emissions. A sub-model for the catalytic converter has been applied to simulate the pre-catalysts and the main catalysts from a fluid dynamic, thermal, and chemical point of view, pointing out the influence of secondary air injection parameters on the conversion efficiency of pollutants during the <b>system</b> <b>warm-up.</b> A Fiat–GM Powertrain, six-cylinder 3. 2 l automotive SI engine (for Alfa Romeo) complying with Euro IV regulations has been modelled, in order to predict the chemical specie concentration along the exhaust system, allowing for reactions in gas and solid phases and taking account of the consequent heat released, which notably influences the wall and gas temperatures with and without secondary air injection. A large set of experimental data concerning this engine (in-cylinder pressures, pressure pulses, chemical composition along the system) has enabled a comprehensive comparison between predictions and measurements, in order to validate the model in different operating conditions...|$|R
50|$|Ranger 9 {{reached the}} Moon on 24 March 1965. At 13:31 UTC, a {{terminal}} maneuver was executed to orient the spacecraft so the cameras were {{more in line}} with the flight direction to improve the resolution of the pictures. 20 minutes before impact, the one-minute camera <b>system</b> <b>warm-up</b> began. The first image was taken at 13:49:41 UTC at an altitude of 2363 km. Transmission of 5,814 good contrast photographs was made during the final 19 minutes of flight. The final image taken before impact has a resolution of 0.3 m. The spacecraft encountered the lunar surface with an incoming asymptotic direction at an angle of -5.6 degrees from the lunar equator. The orbit plane was inclined 15.6 degrees to the lunar equator. After 64.5 hours of flight, impact occurred at 14:08:19.994 UTC at approximately 12.83 S latitude, 357.63 E longitude in the Alphonsus crater. Impact velocity was 2670 m/s. The spacecraft performance was excellent. Real-time television coverage with live network broadcasts of many of the F-channel images (primarily camera B but also some camera A pictures) were provided for this flight.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Temperatures of an {{automotive}} catalyst substrate {{warmed by}} convection pre-light-oV have been measured. Direct comparison {{has been made}} of warm-up by steady and pulsating ow for a one-dimensional ow case. The 32 Hz pulsating mass ow did not feature ow reversal. Pulsations were achieved by interruption of the airow by a rotating disc. Very small diVerences between steady and pulsating cases were observed because the eVect of mass ow pulsations on heat transfer is minimal. Two diVerent computational uid dynamics methods were used to predict temperature. A one-dimensional porous medium model, which required input of an assumed heat transfer coeYcient, was compared with a single-channel model. Predictions agreed closely and there was also qualitative agreement with measurements. Similar mass ow pulsations in the range 32 – 100 Hz have been studied for a case with a larger diameter automotive catalyst supplied via a conical diVuser. The radial ow distribution is controlled by pulsation frequency and the eVect of frequency on temperature at diVer-ent depths in the substrate was observed experimentally. Pulsations will aVect catalyst <b>warm-up</b> in practical <b>systems</b> because of their eVect on ow distribution, rather than on heat transfer...|$|R
50|$|The Iroquois {{class was}} {{originally}} equipped with one OTO Melara 5 in/54 calibre gun that {{was capable of}} firing 40 rounds per minute. For anti-air defense the ship was armed with one Mk III RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missile system. The Iroquois class had two Sea Sparrow launchers installed, each with four missile cells which allowed the ship to launch eight missiles at a time for point defense. The ships carried a total of 32 missiles. The launchers were located at the forward end of the superstructure and retracted into the deckhouse. The missile system was guided by the Hollandse Signaal Mk 22 Weapon Control System. The system was criticised for {{the time it took}} to deploy from the housing, which took several minutes in order to <b>warm-up</b> the guidance <b>system.</b> Reloading took nearly ten minutes and because the fire control was Dutch, the fire control system and the US missile system never worked effectively. The missile was also ineffective against sea-skimming anti-ship missiles, such as the Exocet. The Iroquois class was also equipped with one Mk 10 Limbo anti-submarine mortar for ASW purposes along with two triple Mk 32 torpedo tubes in a trainable mounts. The Mk 32 tubes were used to fire Mark 46 torpedoes.|$|R
