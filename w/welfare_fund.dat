5|$|For {{some time}} Zwingli had accused mendicant orders of {{hypocrisy}} and demanded their abolition {{in order to}} support the truly poor. He suggested the monasteries be changed into hospitals and welfare institutions and incorporate their wealth into a <b>welfare</b> <b>fund.</b> This was done by reorganising the foundations of the Grossmünster and Fraumünster and pensioning off remaining nuns and monks. The council secularised the church properties (Fraumünster handed over by Zwingli's acquaintance Katharina von Zimmern) and established new welfare programs for the poor. Zwingli requested permission to establish a Latin school, the Prophezei (Prophecy) or Carolinum, at the Grossmünster. The council agreed and it was officially opened on 19 June 1525 with Zwingli and Jud as teachers. It served to retrain and re-educate the clergy. The Zurich Bible translation, traditionally attributed to Zwingli and printed by Christoph Froschauer, bears the mark of teamwork from the Prophecy school. Scholars have not yet attempted to clarify Zwingli's share of the work based on external and stylistic evidence.|$|E

40|$|Making the Link: Pregnancy Prevention in the New Welfare Era offers {{strategies}} to prevent unintended pregnancy {{in an era}} in which the nation's welfare program has a changed mission, more money, and greater reach. The enactment of the 1996 welfare law allows federal <b>welfare</b> <b>funds</b> to be spent on an array of pregnancy prevention activities and family planning services; furthermore, <b>welfare</b> <b>funds</b> are no longer limited to welfare recipients who receive grants [...] funds may be spent on individuals who have never {{been a part of the}} welfare system. These fundamental policy changes, along with nearly $ 8 billion of unspent <b>welfare</b> <b>funds,</b> allow states to consider whether and how to invest in a range of {{strategies to}} prevent unintended pregnancy. The law permits, but does not require, any such investment. Nevertheless, a number of states are creating new ways to address unintended pregnancy. Some states are linking welfare offices and family planning services [...] through co-location, information dissemination, referrals, case management, education, and training. Others are tapping <b>welfare</b> <b>funds</b> to provide education, information, or services to those who might never enter a welfare office. Some programs target adults, others teens; some include a focus on males. Making the Link seeks to provide insight into different types of links and how to make them work...|$|R

25|$|In March 1960, SAG went {{on strike}} against the seven major studios. This was the first industry-wide strike in the 50-year history of movie making. Earlier walkouts {{involved}} production for television. The Writers Guild of America had been on strike since January 31, 1960 with similar demands to the actors. The independents were not affected since they signed new contracts. The dispute rested on actors wanting to be paid 6% or 7% of the gross earnings of pictures made since 1948 and sold to television. Actors also wanted a pension and <b>welfare</b> <b>fund.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 1985 National Conference on Education also {{recognized}} the importance of special education, in the form of programs for gifted children and for slow learners. Gifted children were allowed to skip grades. Slow learners were encouraged to reach minimum standards, although those who did not maintain the pace seldom reached the next stage. For the most part, children with severe learning problems and those with handicaps and psychological needs were the responsibilities of their families. Extra provisions were made for blind and severely hearing-impaired children, although in 1984 special schools enrolled fewer than 2 percent of all eligible children in those categories. The China <b>Welfare</b> <b>Fund,</b> established in 1984, received state funding and had the right to solicit donations within China and from abroad, but special education has remained a low government priority.|$|E
