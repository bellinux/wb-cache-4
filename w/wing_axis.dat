THE OBLIQUE FLYING WING (OFW) Adolph Busemann was the first to point out, theoretically and experimentally, that wing sweep could be used to fly supersonically without the adverse wave drag of super-sonic flight. 1, 2 R. T. Jones made the same discovery in the U. S. in 1944. 3, 4 Jones was flying hand launched ob-lique wing gliders as early as 1945. Busemann and Jones effectively considered a wing of infinite extent moving at a subsonic speed directly ahead. They then superimposed on this flow, a flow directly parallel to the <b>wing’s</b> <b>axis.</b> If the speed of this flow along the wing is sufficiently large, then its vector addition to the flow normal to the leading edge will produce a supersonic flow obliquely toward the wing. Because the wing is infinite in extent, the flow over the wing behaves as if it were subsonic. This is true for an inviscid or a viscous flow. 4 One way to understand this...|$|R

40|$|Butterfly eyespots {{may have}} {{evolved from the}} {{recruitment}} of pre-existent gene circuits or regulatory networks into novel locations on the wing. Gene expression data suggests one such circuit, the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway and its target gene engrailed (en), was recruited from a role in patterning the anterior-posterior insect <b>wing</b> <b>axis</b> to a role patterning butterfly eyespots. However, while Junonia coenia expresses hh and en both in the posterior compartment of the wing and in eyespot centers, Bicyclus anynana lacks hh eyespot-specific expression. This suggests that Hh signaling may not be functioning in eyespot development in either species or that it functions in J. coenia but not in B. anynana. In order to test these hypotheses, we performed functional tests of Hh signaling in these species. We investigated the effects of Hh protein sequestration during the larval stage on en expression levels, and on wing size and eyespot size in adults. Hh sequestration led to significantly reduced en expression and to significantly smaller wings and eyespots in both species. But while eyespot size in B. anynana was reduced proportionately to wing size, in J. coenia, eyespots were reduced disproportionately, indicating an independent role of Hh signaling in eyespot development in J. coenia. We conclude that while Hh signaling retains a conserved role in promoting wing growth across nymphalid butterflies, it plays an additional role in eyespot development in some, but not all, lineages of nymphalid butterflies. We discuss our findings {{in the context of}} alternative evolutionary scenarios that led to the differential expression of hh and other Hh pathway signaling members acros...|$|E

40|$|Infinite {{dimensional}} {{systems such}} as flexible airplane <b>wings</b> and Vertical <b>Axis</b> Wind Turbine (VAWT) blades may require control to improve performance. Traditional control techniques use position and velocity information feedback, but velocity information for infinite dimensional systems is not easily attained. This research investigates the use of reduced-sensing control for these applications. Reduced-sensing control uses feedback of position measurements and an associated filter state to stabilize the system dynamics. A filter state is a nonphysical entity that appends an additional ordinary differential equation to the system dynamics. Asymptotic stability of a system using this control approach is confirmed through a sequence of existing mathematical tools. These tools include equilibrium point solutions, Lyapunov functions for stability and control, and Mukherjee and Chen's Asymptotic Stability Theorem. This thesis research investigates the stability of a beam representing an airplane wing or a VAWT blade controlled using feedback of position and filter state terms only. Both of these infinite dimensional systems exhibit asymptotic stability with the proposed reduced-sensing control design.

40|$|Flapping wings can pitch passively {{about their}} {{pitching}} axes {{due to their}} flexibility, inertia, and aerodynamic loads. A shift in the pitching axis location can dynamically alter the aerodynamic loads, which in turn changes the passive pitching motion and the flight efficiency. Therefore, it is {{of great interest to}} investigate the optimal pitching <b>axis</b> for flapping <b>wings</b> to maximize the power efficiency during hovering flight. In this study, flapping wings are modeled as rigid plates with non-uniform mass distribution. The wing flexibility is represented by a linearly torsional spring at the wing root. A predictive quasi-steady aerodynamic model is used to evaluate the lift generated by such wings. Two extreme power consumption scenarios are modeled for hovering flight, i. e. the power consumed by a drive system with and without the capacity of kinetic energy recovery. For wings with different shapes, the optimal pitching axis location is found such that the cycle-averaged power consumption during hovering flight is minimized. Optimization results show that the optimal pitching axis is located between the leading edge and the mid-chord line, which shows close resemblance to insect wings. An optimal pitching axis can save up to 33 % of power during hovering flight when compared to traditional wings used by most of flapping wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs). Traditional wings typically use the straight leading edge as the pitching axis. With the optimized pitching <b>axis,</b> flapping <b>wings</b> show higher pitching amplitudes and start the pitching reversals in advance of the sweeping reversals. These phenomena lead to higher lift-to-drag ratios and, thus, explain the lower power consumption.

40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} components of a flapping-wing micro air vehicle (FWMAV), the design of an energy-efficient flapping-wing has been a research interest recently. Research on insect flight from different perspectives has been carried out, mainly with regard to wing morphol-ogy, flapping kinematics, and unsteady aerody-namics. However, the link between the wing morphology and kinematics with passive pitch-ing has been neglected in flapping-wing design. To address this, a model based on a quasi-steady aerodynamic model and the passive pitching mo-tion was made. To simplify the model and make optimization more feasible, the wing is mod-eled as a stiff plate with uniform mass distri-bution and a torsional spring at the wing root. An optimization is conducted with the objec-tive of minimizing power consumption for hov-ering flight using the six most influential wing morphological and kinematic parameters as de-sign variables.

40|$|A 3 D {{dragonfly}} wing {{is developed}} {{by using the}} Autodesk point cloud methodology, which takes several high definition (HD) pictures of the wing and uploads them into the software which computes all the spatial points and to give a rough matrix of the external structure. The structure is further modified by using Mesh mixer and printed in 3 D of Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) material. Initially a bending and torsion stiffness test is carried out by cantilevering the wing onto a U shaped frame, where the increasing weights are suspended on the wing tip end to calculate the deflection upon loading at different room temperatures. Keeping the Reynolds and Strouhal numbers constant, a flapping mechanism is de-signed consisting of two smart servo motors connected to the wing root with a fix-tures designed to give the <b>wing</b> four <b>axis</b> degrees of freedom (DOF) maintaining the centre line axis. The servos are programmed by using Arduino Nano board and the whole mechanism is fixed onto two load cells on an apparatus which is connected to a LabView® programme for collecting the data. The data from the load cells is taken and investigated in MatLab® by using Fourier analysis. The maximum deflection of the wing tip as per the literature review is {{in the range of}} 3 - 12 mm depending on the loads acting on the wing during flight. For this thesis the average deflection of the wing tip during the experiment upon applied loading is to be about 3 - 10 mm. It varies with the forces acting on it and also expected to change for another sample of the model wing which can be produced using flexible PVC which has different properties. These deflection values are used to determine the amount of force acting on the wing tip during the bottom end of the flap cycle. The torsional deflection of the wing during flight was assumed to be 20 degrees. Where as in the torsional stiffness experiment it is more than 10 degrees for the ABS structure. The values obtained during the experiment is lower compared to the value from the previous literature due to the rigidity of the material. It varies with the forces acting on it and also expected to change for another sample of the model wing which can be produced using flexible PVC which has different properties. The flapping experiment is carried out for various flapping and torsional angles us-ing a flapping test rig. The data is studied for the extraction of the forces acting on the wing and is assumed to give more information on the stable and unstable aer-odynamics of the dragonfly wing. It is observed that when the phase difference is changed from 0 ° to 270 ° the lift generated value is raised from 0. 4 N to 0. 6 N. -max is determined as 0. 55 and is maximum when the phase difference between the flapping angle, torsion angle is maintained as 270 °.

40|$|Inspired by insect flights, {{flapping}} wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs) keep attracting {{attention from}} the scientific community. One of the design objectives is to reproduce the high power efficiency of insect flight. However, {{there is no clear}} answer yet {{to the question of how}} to design flapping wings and their kinematics for power-efficient hovering flight. In this thesis, we aim to answer this research question from the perspectives of wing modeling, design and optimization. Quasi-steady aerodynamic models play an important role in evaluating aerodynamic performance and designing and optimizing flapping wings. In Chapter 2, we present a predictive quasi-steady model by including four aerodynamic loading terms. The loads result from the wing's translation, rotation, their coupling as well as the added-mass effect. The necessity of including all four of these terms in a quasi-steady model to predict both the aerodynamic force and torque is demonstrated. Validations indicate a good accuracy of predicting the center of pressure, the aerodynamic loads and the passive pitching motion for various Reynolds numbers. Moreover, compared to the existing quasi-steady models, the proposed model does not rely on any empirical parameters and, thus, is more predictive, which enables application to the shape and kinematics optimization of flapping wings. For flapping wings with passive pitching motion, a shift in the pitching axis location alters the aerodynamic loads, which in turn change the passive pitching motion and the flight efficiency. Therefore, in Chapter 3, we investigate the optimal pitching axis location for flapping wings to maximize the power efficiency during hovering flight. Optimization results show that the optimal pitching axis is located between the leading edge and the mid-chord line, which shows a close resemblance to insect wings. An optimal pitching axis can save up to 33 % of power during hovering flight when compared to optimized traditional wings used by most of the flapping wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs). Traditional wings typically use the straight leading edge as the pitching axis. In addition, the optimized pitching axis enables the drive system to recycle more energy during the deceleration phases as compared to their counterparts. This observation underlines the particular importance of the <b>wing</b> pitching <b>axis</b> location for energy-efficient FWMAVs when using kinetic energy recovery drive systems. The presence of wing twist can alter the aerodynamic performance and power efficiency of flapping wings by changing the angle of attack. In order to study the optimal twist of flapping wings for hovering flight, we propose a computationally efficient fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model in Chapter 4. The model uses an analytical twist model and the quasi-steady aerodynamic model introduced in Chapter 2 for the structural and aerodynamic analysis, respectively. Based on the FSI model, we optimize the twist of a rectangular wing by minimizing the power consumption during hovering flight. The power efficiency of the optimized twistable wings is compared with corresponding optimized rigid wings. It is shown that the optimized twistable wings can not dramatically outperform the optimized rigid wings in terms of power efficiency, unless the pitching amplitude at the wing root is limited. When this amplitude decreases, the optimized twistable wings can always maintain high power efficiency by introducing certain twist while the optimized rigid wings need more power for hovering. Considering the high impact of the root stiffness on flapping kinematics and power consumption, we present an active hinge design which uses electrostatic force to change the hinge stiffness in Chapter 5. The hinge is realized by stacking three conducting spring steel layers which are separated by dielectric Mylar films. The theoretical model shows that the stacked layers can switch from slipping with respect to each other to sticking together when the resultant electrostatic force between layers, which can be controlled by the applied voltage, is above a threshold value. The switch from slipping to sticking will result in a dramatic increase of the hinge stiffness (about 9 x). Therefore, a short duration of the sticking can still lead to a considerable change in the passive pitching motion. Experimental results successfully show the decrease of the pitching amplitude with the increase of the applied voltage. Flight control based on the electrostatic force can be very power-efficient since there is ideally no power consumption due to the control operations. In Chapter 6, we retrospect and discuss the most important aspects related to the modeling, design and optimization of flapping wings for efficient hovering flight. In Chapter 7, the overall conclusions are drawn and recommendations for further study are provided. Structural Optimization and Mechanic...|$|R
