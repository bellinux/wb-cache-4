5|$|In prior cases, {{the fear}} had been {{expressed}} that using parliamentary debates as evidence in court could violate parliamentary privilege, under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> Parliament within the courts). Browne-Wilkinson held that: In my judgment, the plain meaning of article 9, viewed against the historical background {{in which it}} was enacted, was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said and were able, contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy, to discuss what they, as opposed to the monarch, chose to have discussed. Relaxation of the rule will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament. The purpose of looking at Hansard will not be to construe the words used by the Minister but to give effect to the words used so long as they are clear. Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would be giving effect to what is said and done there.|$|E
500|$|The finale first {{aired on}} the Fox {{network in the}} United States on May 6, 2011. It was watched by an {{estimated}} 3.0 million viewers. It scored a 1.2/4 ratings share among viewers 18–49, an 8 percent decrease from the previous week's episode. The finale and its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, did however help Fox tie for first place in that demographic with ABC and CBS. The rating for this episode almost doubled when DVR time shifted viewing was taken into account. Because of its comparatively low live ratings, SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall speculated that only [...] "the core of the core audience" [...] watched the episode, as [...] "no outsiders could have possibly fathomed <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> that 45 minutes." ...|$|E
500|$|The War Within: A Secret White House History (2006–2008) is a non-fiction book by Washington Post {{reporter}} Bob Woodward {{that was}} released by publisher Simon & Schuster on September 8, 2008. It is the fifteenth book written by Woodward, the fourth {{in a series of}} books about President George W. Bush and his administration's foreign policy including Bush at War, Plan of Attack, and State of Denial. The book discusses the debate within the administration about the controversial Iraq [...] "surge" [...] strategy implemented in 2007. Simon & Schuster editor Alice Mayhew said in an official statement that “There has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the Nixon tapes and the Pentagon Papers. This is the declassification of <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> secret, behind the scenes.” ...|$|E

500|$|Some {{members of}} the Tories' {{campaign}} committee had urged Diefenbaker not to build his campaign around the Pipeline Debate, contending that the episode was now {{a year in the}} past and forgotten by the voters, who did not particularly care <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> Parliament anyway. Diefenbaker replied, [...] "That's the issue, and I'm making it." [...] Diefenbaker referred to the conduct of the government in the Pipeline Debate more frequently than he did any other issue during the campaign. St. Laurent initially dealt with the question flippantly, suggesting in his opening campaign address that the debate had been [...] "nearly as long as the pipeline itself and quite as full of another kind of natural gas". As the issue gained resonance with the voters, the Liberals devoted more time to it, and St. Laurent devoted a major part of his final English television address to the question. The Liberals defended their conduct, and contended that a minority {{should not be allowed to}} impose its will on an elected majority. St. Laurent suggested that the Tories had performed badly as an opposition in the debate, and suggested that the public give them more practice at being an opposition.|$|E

2500|$|What part of 'Japanese Army sex slaves' does Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, have so {{much trouble}} {{understanding}} and apologizing for? ... These were not commercial brothels. Force, explicit and implicit, was used in recruiting these women. <b>What</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> them was serial rape, not prostitution. The Japanese Army's involvement is documented in the government's own defense files. A senior Tokyo official more or less apologized for this horrific crime in 1993...Yesterday, [...] grudgingly acknowledged the 1993 quasi-apology, but only {{as part of a}} pre-emptive declaration that his government would reject the call, now pending in the United States Congress, for an official apology.

2500|$|Cocks' {{work has}} been anthologized and {{discussed}} in other works on Stanley Kubrick films, but sometimes with skepticism. In particular, Julian Rice writing in the opening chapter of his book Kubrick's Hope believes Cocks' views are excessively speculative and contain too many strained [...] "critical leaps" [...] of faith. Rice holds that <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> Kubrick's mind cannot be replicated or corroborated beyond a broad vision {{of the nature of}} good and evil (which included concern about the Holocaust), but Kubrick's art is not governed by this one single obsession. Diane Johnson, co-screenwriter for The Shining, commented on Cocks' observations and holds that preoccupation with the Jewish Holocaust on Kubrick's part could very likely have motivated his decision to place the hotel on a Native American burial ground, although Kubrick never directly mentioned it to her.|$|E

David pries Hook away, saying that Arthur was right, he doesn't remember anything from the events in Camelot, and the now, Arthur was [...] "no longer important." [...] Hook says Emma told them this was about him, but Regina says that Emma is manipulating him, like all the Dark Ones do, and Regina and Mary Margaret are convinced that Emma has fully succumbed to the darkness. Hook believes Emma hasn't fully caved to the darkness yet, since she hasn't used the sword yet, but Regina thinks Emma still needs another ingredient for her spell. Hook is determined to find out <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> Camelot, saying {{that the only way}} to help her is to find out what happened between him and Emma. Hook visits Gold at his shop, and Mr. Gold tells Belle to put down the crossbow, since Hook wasn't Emma. Mr. Gold says he had some squid ink set aside, but the new Dark One took it. Hook says that Dark Ones are clever, being able to convince everyone that they've really changed when they haven't, and then asks what’s going on inside Emma’s head. He tells Gold what Emma said about her actions being about him. Gold says he recognizes the look on her face – regret. He says he became the Dark One to save his son. He adds that he convinced himself everything he did was for that, and that once he saved his son, he would atone for his sins, but things did not work out. He tells Hook to find out what Emma is trying to atone for to get the answers. Hook says he can’t find her, and Gold says that he will have to give her a reason to find him. Hook goes outside and calls for Emma and asks what happened between them and what she wants.|$|E
