40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether higher {{mortality}} after breast cancer contributes to the life-expectancy gap of 15 years in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> severe mental illness (SMI). We estimated all-cause mortality rate ratios (MRRs) of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> SMI, <b>women</b> <b>with</b> breast cancer and <b>women</b> <b>with</b> both disorders compared to <b>women</b> <b>with</b> neither disorder using data from nationwide registers in Denmark for 1980 - 2012.

SETTING: Universities of Udine, Pisa, and Modena in Italy, and of Wien in Austria. PATIENT(S) : Forty <b>women</b> <b>with</b> idiopathic premature ovarian failure (POF), 23 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> hypogonadotropic hypothalamic amenorrhea, 40 healthy postmenopausal women, and 40 age-matched <b>women</b> <b>with</b> normal ovarian function (controls). INTERVENTION(S) : Blood {{samples were collected}} between 8 and 9 AM. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Serum levels of inhibin A, inhibin B, and activin A. RESULT(S) : <b>Women</b> <b>with</b> POF had lower concentrations of serum inhibin A and inhibin B than <b>women</b> <b>with</b> hypothalamic amenorrhea and fertile controls, {{and the difference between}} these concentrations was statistically significant. Levels of inhibin A and inhibin B were low in postmenopausal women and were no different than in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> POF.

Eight tertiary centres prospectively enrolled 125 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>with</b> CHD (pregnancy duration 0. 1). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45 % was present in 3. 2 % of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> CHD and 14. 4 % had tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) < 16  mm. Absolute values of ventricular function parameters and diameters were less favourable in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> CHD. No permanent changes occurred in right and left ventricular function parameters and dimensions in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> CHD. The patterns of change in cardiac function and dimensions were comparable between <b>women</b> <b>with</b> CHD and controls, except for LVEF (p= 0. 026). In <b>women</b> <b>with</b> right-sided CHD the pattern of TAPSE over time differed from controls (p= 0. 043) (no decrease in TAPSE postpregnancy in CHD).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} histologically proved endometritis as a clinical syndrome that is distinct from laparoscopically confirmed salpingitis. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of 152 women in an urban hospital with a suspected pelvic inflammatory disease. All women provided a standardized medical history and underwent physical examination, endometrial biopsy, and laparoscopy. We defined endometritis by the presence of plasma cells in endometrial stroma and neutrophils in the endometrial epithelium. RESULTS: Of 152 women who were enrolled, 43 women had neither endometritis nor salpingitis; 26 women had endometritis alone without salpingitis, and 83 women had salpingitis. Those <b>women</b> <b>with</b> endometritis alone more often had couched recently, had a current intrauterine device, and were in menstrual cycle day 1 to 7, compared <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> no endometritis or salpingitis (P =. 007,. 04,. 005, respectively) or <b>women</b> <b>with</b> acute salpingitis (P =. 03,. 01,. 02, respectively). Infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis was found more frequently in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> endometritis alone than in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> no endometritis or salpingitis (P <. 001) and less frequently than in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> salpingitis (P =. 05).

40|$|BackgroundThe {{prevalence}} of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) differs considerably between the sexes, {{illustrated by the}} male/female ratio 4 - 6 : 1. Women are also reported {{to have a higher}} risk of rupture, and a poorer outcome compared with men. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if <b>women</b> <b>with</b> AAA have a different reproductive history compared <b>with</b> other <b>women.</b> The secondary aim was to study if <b>women</b> <b>with</b> a larger AAA differ in their reproductive history from <b>women</b> <b>with</b> a smaller AAA. MethodThis case-control study was performed in October 2009 and included 140 consecutively monitored <b>women</b> <b>with</b> AAA and 140 with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) at the Department of Vascular Surgery at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm. AAA was defined as AAA diameter > 3 cm, and <b>women</b> <b>with</b> AAA were subdivided into groups with AAA diameter ≥ 5 cm and diameter < 5 cm. A validated questionnaire was used to obtain information about participants' reproductive history and general health. The response rate was 70 % (n = 196). ResultsWomen with AAA were smokers to a greater extent than <b>women</b> <b>with</b> PAD (previous, 52 % vs 46 %; current, 46 % vs 34 %, P =. 001). Diabetes mellitus was more prevalent in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> PAD (28 %) than in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> AAA (15 %, P =. 034). Angina pectoris occurred more often in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> AAA (26 %) than in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> PAD (11 %, P =. 026). No significant difference was found between PAD and AAA women regarding statin use, treatment for hypertension, prior myocardial infarction, and body mass index (BMI). The 54 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> AAA ≥ 5 cm and the 44 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> AAA < 5 cm were similar in age (76 vs 76 years, P =. 908) and BMI (25. 7 vs 24. 0 kg/m 2, P =. 66). No difference was noted in the occurrence of other risk factors between <b>women</b> <b>with</b> AAA ≥ 5 cm and <b>women</b> <b>with</b> AAA < 5 cm. Mean age at menopause was lower in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> AAA ≥ 5 cm than in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> AAA < 5 cm and in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> PAD (47. 7 vs 49. 9 vs 49. 7 years, P =. 011). Apart from menopausal age, the groups had a similar reproductive history, including hormone replacement therapy, parity, use of contraceptives, prior gynecological surgery, and breast cancer. ConclusionThese findings suggest that <b>women</b> <b>with</b> larger AAA reach menopausal age earlier, and this could influence an earlier onset of aneurysmatic disease or an increase in aneurysm growth.
