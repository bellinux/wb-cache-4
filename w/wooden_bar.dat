5|$|In a story {{recorded}} {{in the area of}} Cetinje, a zduhać was mortally wounded on Mount Lovćen in a battle against the transmarine zduhaći. The dying zduhać disclosed the way in which he could be saved, and one of his relatives acted according to the instructions. He went by night to a valley where he saw horses, oxen, rams, billy goats, men, and women. He passed by them in total silence, before he saw a black ox. He struck the ox with a <b>wooden</b> <b>bar,</b> and the animal roared tremendously. When he returned home, he found the zduhać sound and healthy. As believed in the region of Birač, eastern Bosnia, a mortally wounded zduhać could get well if he burned beech buds in a milk bucket, and censed himself with the smoke, using a spindle to wave the smoke toward himself. Before performing this rite, he should have publicly confessed that he was a zduhać. Most zduhaći would reputedly rather die than do that, because afterwards they could no more fly as zduhaći. As thought in Herzegovina, a man {{who did not want to}} be a zduhać anymore, should have confessed to a priest and promised that he would not fly anymore.|$|E
25|$|During archaeological {{excavations}} in 2012 {{the remains}} of a skeleton pierced with an iron bar in the heart were found. It is believed that those are {{the remains of}} the local nobleman Krivich (or Krivitsa), ruler of the fortress of Sozopol (castrofilax). Believed to be a very cruel person, the locals made sure that he would not come back to haunt the city after his death by piercing him with an iron bar in the chest. There are more than 100 medieval funerals similar to that of Krivitsa found all over Bulgaria. The remains were pierced with either an iron or a <b>wooden</b> <b>bar</b> through the chest {{to make sure that the}} dead will not rise from the grave as a vampire.|$|E
25|$|The bass type, {{similarly}} to the theorbo and other baroque lutes, has a vaulted body (shell) constructed of separate ribs, a flat soundboard {{with either a}} carved rose or one which is inset into the soundhole, and a bridge (without a saddle) consisting of a <b>wooden</b> <b>bar</b> acting as a string-holder glued to the soundboard. Unique to this instrument is the neck, which is long enough to allow for ten to 12 tied gut frets. The pegbox is either straight and set at a sharp angle to the neck (much like a lute pegbox), or gently curving and set at a shallow angle, either case being fitted with laterally-inserted tuning pegs (although sometimes a flat pegboard with sagittal pegs is found). The strings were of gut and are strung either singly or, especially on Italian instruments, in double courses. However, on German-made instruments, the first course (highest in pitch) is usually single (a chanterelle) and often has its own separate raised peg rider/holder attached to the pegbox. The number of courses varies from six to eight. Open string lengths tend to be fairly long (6272cm) on German instruments, but shorter (5565cm) on late Italian ones, probably because they tended to be tuned to a higher pitch.|$|E

500|$|The Court of Common Pleas, {{along with}} the other {{superior}} courts, sat in Westminster Hall from its creation. Due to the provisions in Magna Carta, it was bound to sit there; an apocryphal story says that Orlando Bridgeman refused to move the court a few feet to avoid the draught from the north entrance, fearing that to do so would be to infringe on Magna Carta.

500|$|Though much of {{his work}} was made public only years later, Charles Ives had been {{exploring}} the possibilities of the tone cluster—which he {{referred to as the}} [...] "group chord"—for some time. In 1906–7, Ives composed his first mature piece to extensively feature tone clusters, Scherzo: Over the Pavements. Orchestrated for a nine-piece ensemble, it includes both black- and white-note clusters for the piano. Revised in 1913, it would not be recorded and published until the 1950s and would have to wait until 1963 to receive its first public performance. During the same period that Ornstein was introducing tone clusters to the concert stage, Ives was developing a piece with what would become the most famous set of clusters: in the second movement, [...] "Hawthorne," [...] of the Concord Sonata ( [...] 1904–15, publ. 1920, prem. 1928, rev. 1947), mammoth piano chords require a <b>wooden</b> <b>bar</b> almost fifteen inches long to play. The gentle clusters produced by the felt- or flannel-covered bar represent the sound of far-off church bells (...) [...] Later in the movement, there are a series of five-note diatonic clusters for the right hand. In his notes to the score, Ives indicates that [...] "these group-chords...may, if the player feels like it, be hit with the clenched fist." [...] Between 1911 and 1913, Ives also wrote ensemble pieces with tone clusters such as his Second String Quartet and the orchestral Decoration Day and Fourth of July, though none of these would be publicly performed before the 1930s.|$|E

40|$|International audienceXylophone sounds {{produced}} by striking <b>wooden</b> <b>bars</b> with a mallet are {{strongly influenced by}} the mechanical properties of the wood species chosen by the xylophone maker. In this paper, we address {{the relationship between the}} sound quality based on the timbre attribute of impacted <b>wooden</b> <b>bars</b> and the physical parameters characterizing wood species. For this, a methodology is proposed that associates an analysis-synthesis process and a perceptual classification test. Sounds generated by impacting 59 <b>wooden</b> <b>bars</b> of different species but with the same geometry were recorded and classified by a renowned instrument maker. The sounds were further digitally processed and adjusted to the same pitch before being once again classified. The processing is based on a physical model ensuring the main characteristics of the wood are preserved during the sound transformation. Statistical analysis of both classifications showed the influence of the pitch in the xylophone maker judgement and pointed out the importance of two timbre descriptors: the frequency-dependent damping and the spectral bandwidth. These descriptors are linked with physical and anatomical characteristics of wood species, providing new clues in the choice of attractive wood species from a musical point of view...|$|R
