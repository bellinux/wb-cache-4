I tried to play her as Tracy would have been in those moments." ...|$|E

At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln's sister-in-law <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> him in the same presidential box where he was later slain; she turned to him and said, [...] "Mr. Lincoln, he looks as if he meant that for you." [...] The President replied, [...] "He does look pretty sharp at me, doesn't he?" [...] On another occasion, Lincoln's son Tad saw Booth perform. He said that the actor thrilled him, prompting Booth to give Tad a rose. Booth ignored an invitation to visit Lincoln between acts.|$|E

When going around a bend a few tenths of a mile from his parents' house, Favre lost control of his car, which flipped three times and came to rest against a tree.

Alabama coach Gene Stallings said, [...] "You can call it a miracle or a legend or whatever you want to. I just know that on that day, Brett Favre was larger than life." ...|$|E
