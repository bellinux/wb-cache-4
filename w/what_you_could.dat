25|$|The book, co-authored with Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication, reprints Shannon's 1948 {{article and}} Weaver's popularization of it, which is {{accessible}} to the non-specialist. Warren Weaver {{pointed out that the}} word information in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E

500|$|According to the {{historian}} Nio Joe Lan, Allah jang Palsoe {{was the first}} stage drama in Malay by a Chinese writer. The six-act work was written in vernacular Malay, the lingua franca of the Indies, and was based on E. Phillips Oppenheim's short story [...] "The False Gods". Though in his foreword Kwee Tek Hoay apologised {{for the quality of}} the stage play, writing that [...] "the content and arrangement of this book are far from <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call neat", Sumardjo praises his language, feeling that the story flowed well.|$|E
2500|$|The piano {{is another}} tool McGlaughlin {{frequently}} employs to get concepts across. Of his original {{decisions about the}} show's format, McGlaughlin says, [...] "It’s very hard to talk about music on the radio unless you can hear a sound, so I said I need a piano. Instead of saying 'a minor third,' I can play it. I wanted {{to make certain that}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> hear was prominent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Australian sports {{broadcasting}} analyst Colin Smith {{noted that}} the addition of Japanese and American teams {{could result in a}} TV deal worth more than A$1billion beyond 2020. Specifically, he stated, [...] "You could have a deal comparable to the other major sports in Australia. Rugby is a college (university) sport in the US, if soccer can create its own league there and sell teams for $40million, imagine <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do in 10–12 years with rugby in that market." [...] By comparison, the largest TV deal in Australian sport, that of the Australian Football League (Australian rules), is worth A$1.26billion from 2012 to 2016. Even that figure was dwarfed by the TV contracts of the NFL, for which contracts at the time were worth more than US$4billion annually.|$|E

But <b>what</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have your cake and eat it too? <b>What</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> grow the economy while improving the environment? As the government changes some key environmental policy settings, particularly around climate change, we will need to focus on changing industries through the green training we give future workers...|$|R

2500|$|Because of its {{location}} in New York, executive producer Stephanie Savage said [...] "We were quickly told {{it would be}} too expensive, too complicated" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} series. She told it had been proposed to shoot in a Los Angeles studio that would recreate Central Park but they eventually filmed the series in New York. Savage explained their choice to film there: [...] "There's no New York City on TV, or there wasn't when we started making the pilot, except <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see in the background behind the dead bodies on cop shows. We've never seen the city from the point of view of teenagers. It felt like a world with high stakes for young people." [...] Schwartz added: [...] "What's funny about these teenagers is they grew up watching Sex and the City, even though it wasn't about them. And I think they've probably incorporated that into how they mythologize New York. I fought really hard to shoot the show in New York because we want New York to be a character in the show." [...] Many scenes were filmed in the Empire Hotel on the Upper West Side.|$|E
