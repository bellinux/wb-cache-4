5|$|Being herbivores, {{blackbuck}} graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing as well. They prefer sedges, fall <b>witchgrass,</b> mesquite, {{and live}} oak. They have occasionally been observed browsing on acacia {{trees in the}} Cholistan Desert. Oats and berseem {{were found to be}} palatable and nutritious to captive populations in a study. A study in the Velavadar Black Buck Sanctuary (Gujarat, India) showed that Dichanthium annulatum comprised 35 percent of their diet. Digestion of nutrients, especially crude proteins, was poor in summer, but more efficient in the rainy and winter seasons. Consequently crude protein intake in summer was very low, even below the recommended value. Blackbuck had a lower food consumption in summer. The fruits of Prosopis juliflora are often eaten, and blackbuck {{may play a role in}} their dispersal. Prosopis becomes a significant food item if grasses are scarce. Water is a daily requirement of the blackbuck.|$|E

5000|$|The mottled sand {{grasshopper}} is herbivorous, eating 19 to 28 {{different species}} of plants consisting of grasses, sedges, and forbs. [...] "Blue grama, needleandthread, western wheatgrass, sand dropseed, <b>witchgrass,</b> and threadleaf" [...] are the main grasses and sedges eaten by the mottled sand grasshopper. Other, less favored grasses and sedges include [...] "sand bluestem, little bluestem, prairie sandreed, buffalograss, hairy grama, junegrass, sun sedge, and baltic rush". Forbs eaten include [...] "kochia, Missouri milkvetch, sand sagebrush, western sticktight, sunflower, redroot pigweed, bracted spiderwort, rusty lupine, western ragweed". They are geophilous, meaning they live and forage on the ground. They may climb up stalks of grass to cut off a piece to eat, but they mostly forage on ground debris. The front tarsi are used to hold the grass while the grasshopper lies horizontally.|$|E

40|$|Quackgrass or <b>witchgrass</b> is a {{creeping}} perennial grass, {{related to}} common wheat, {{and one of}} the most widely distributed and destructive weeds in the North Temperate Zone [...] Quackgrass can rarely be exterminated on large areas, but it can be brought under reasonable control. The best plan is to allow it to form a sod and then plow it in midsummer during dry hot weather. Attacking the weed in wet weather or in the spring when the rootstocks are growing vigorously is almost a waste of time. After plowing, the field should be harrowed frequently until winter and the following year planted with a cultivated crop. A smother crop may follow the cultivated crop. On small areas quackgrass can be eradicated by hand digging, smothering with tar paper, spraying with chemicals, or by other means. Quackgrass makes good hay, pasturage, silage, and lawns and often can be utilized more economically than it can be destroyed. " [...] p. ...|$|E

40|$|Panicum schinzii (Transvaal millet), P. dichotomiflorum (Fall panicum) and P. capillare (<b>Witchgrass)</b> are alien panicoid grasses {{that have}} {{gradually}} spread {{and are now}} locally naturalized in corn fields in Belgium. One of the possible reasons for their expansion in corn fields might be a lower sensitivity to post-emergence herbicides acting against panicoid grasses, in particular those inhibiting 4 -hydroxyphenyl pyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) and acetolactate synthase (ALS). Dose-response pot experiments were conducted in the greenhouse {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of five HP-PD-inhibiting herbicides (sulcotrione, mesotrione, isoxaflutole, topramezone, tembotrione) and two AILS-inhibiting herbicides (nicosulfuron, foramsulfuron) for controlling populations of P. schinzii, P. dichotomiflorum and P. capillare (all naturalized Belgian populations except for P. capillare). In another dose-response pot experiment, sensitivity of five local P. dichotomiflorum populations to HPPD-inhibitors and nicosulfuron was investigated. Finally, the influence of growth stage at time of herbicide application on efficacy of topramezone and nicosulfuron for Panicum control was evaluated. Large interspecific differences in sensitivity to HPPD-inhibiting herbicides were observed. Panicum schinzii was sensitive to tembotrione but moderately sensitive to topramezone and poorly sensitive to mesotrione and sulcotrione. However, P. dichotomiflorum was sensitive to mesotrione and topramezone but moderately sensitive to tembotrione. All Panicum species were sensitive to low doses of nicosulfuron and foramsulfuron. Naturalized P. dichotomiflorum populations exhibited differential herbicide sensitivity profiles. All species tested showed a progressive decrease in sensitivity to topramezone and nicosulfuron with seedling age. A satisfactory post-emergence control of Panicum species in the field will require appropriate choice of herbicide and dose, as well as a more timely application (i. e. before weeds reach the four leaves stage) ...|$|E

40|$|Seed banks, {{the reserve}} of viable seeds dormant in the soil, {{function}} in several {{important roles in}} the population and community dynamics of plant communities. Identification of the seed bank can furnish information on the vegetation history of a habitat, predict the future composition of the plant community, and provide insight on the seed viability and biology of plant species. Although seed banks of prairie ecosystems have been well studied, very little information exists on seed banks of reconstructed prairie. Identification of seed bank populations of reconstructed prairie provides a means to evaluate the success of restorations and establishes baseline data to monitor the development of prairie over time. A seed bank study of reconstructed prairie in central Iowa was conducted from March 2000 to July 2002. Samples of the seed bank in the top 3 cm of soil were collected at 15 sites on the reconstruction {{at the beginning of}} its fifth growing season. A seedling assay was used to identify and count seeds. A total of 2, 693 seedlings and 62 plant taxa were observed in the seed bank. Out of the 78 plant species seeded at the study sites, 15 species were observed in the seed bank. Three of these were non-native species seeded by mistake. Among the other 47 species observed, about half were native and half were exotic. The most abundant species in the seed bank included green carpetweed (Mollugo vertieillaw), common yellow oxalis (Oxalis striew), <b>witchgrass</b> (Panicum capillare), hairy white oldfield aster (Symphyotrichum pilosum), and amaranth (Amaranthus rudis). Total seed densities ranged from 293 seeds/m 2 / 3 cm to 12, 247 seeds/m 2 / 3 cm. An ordination of the seed bank samples with the vegetation in 1999 and 2000 clearly shows a high dissimilarity between vegetation and seed bank as well as much greater variation in the seed bank composition than in the vegetation...|$|E
