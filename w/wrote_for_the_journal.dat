According to the historian Alan Sykes, this magazine became [...] "increasingly influential" [...] in the British far-right. Much of the material that Tyndall <b>wrote</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>journal</b> was less openly Neo-Nazi and extreme than his previous writings, something which may have resulted from caution surrounding the Race Relations Act 1965. The GBM engaged in several stunts to raise publicity; in 1964 for instance Webster assaulted the Kenyan leader Jomo Kenyatta outside his London hotel while Tyndall hurled insults at him through a loudspeaker. In 1965, the group staged a shooting incident at its Norwood headquarters, claiming {{that it had been}} an attack by anti-fascists.

In 1966, several GBM members were arrested for carrying out arson attacks against synagogues.|$|E
