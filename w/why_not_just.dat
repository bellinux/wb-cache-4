After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you?

500|$|In 1968 Le Mesurier {{was offered}} a role in a new BBC {{situation}} comedy playing an upper-class Sergeant Arthur Wilson in Dad's Army, although he was the second choice after Robert Dorning. Le Mesurier was unsure about taking the part as he was finishing the final series of George and the Dragon {{and did not want}} another long-term television role. He was persuaded both by an increase in his fee—to £26210s (£262.50) per episode—and by the casting of his old friend Clive Dunn as Corporal Jones. Le Mesurier was initially unsure of how to portray his character, and was advised by series writer Jimmy Perry to make the part his own. Le Mesurier decided to base the character on himself, later writing that [...] "I thought, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> be myself, use an extension of my own personality and behave rather as I had done in the army? So I always left a button or two undone, and had the sleeve of my battle dress slightly turned up. I spoke softly, issued commands as if they were invitations (the sort not likely to be accepted) and generally assumed a benign air of helplessness". Perry later observed that [...] "we wanted Wilson to be the voice of sanity; he has become John".|$|E

[...] IGN in their [...] "Babes of Soulcalibur" [...] article noted that while her outfit pushed the line even by game standards, {{they had no}} actual complaint towards that aspect of the character. Team Xbox emphasized that while her appearance played a factor in her allure, her fighting skills and unique weapon were significant as well, adding that [...] "Ivy never disappoints in a swordfight". Leigh Alexander in an article for GameSetWatch noted that while characters such as Samus Aran served as [...] "bastions of dignity", characters such as Ivy filled {{an important role in}} video games too, stating [...] "t looks like Ivy’s back is set to snap – but she’s a game character; she’ll be fine. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> enjoy it?" [...] The Escapist noted that the character's behavior and sex appeal defined the character rather than serving as an extraneous aspect, stating [...] "Ivy's oversexed dominatrix demeanor perfectly compliments her confident, punishing move set." [...] UGO.com repeated the sentiment, noting in their [...] "Top 11 Girls of Gaming" [...] article [...] "Soul Calibur's mega-bombastic whip-wielding hottie isn't the only babe in the game, or even the best-endowed...but her combination of sultry moves and revealing outfits shoots her up the charts." [...] In an examination of feminist viewpoints regarding women in gaming, comedian and writer Liana Kerzner cited Ivy as an example of misperception of an empowered female character, noting that when compared to characters such as Wonder Woman the latter was considered a positive character for being [...] "empowered" [...] despite sharing similar exposing outfits and physical builds. She further went on to state that the character was interesting for having [...] "to fight her own flawed battle with no help from anyone", and that women passionate about gaming had more in common with the character: [...] "aggressive, intimidating, combative, and scrabbling through life by sheer will, armed with homemade weapons".|$|E

Her two-hour set was a {{brilliant}} pop extravaganza that kept the songs at its center." [...] He further noted that Knowles didn't need distractions from her singing, [...] "which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with [...] staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion". Lee Hildebrand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a very positive review for the concert and noted that Knowles performed [...] "two fast-paced hours of terrific singing, solid musicianship, spectacular staging {{and some of the}} most imaginative choreography ever to have graced the stage of Oracle Arena." [...] Hildebrand further noted that Knowles used [...] "occasional bits of rasp to her ringing mezzo tones to emphasize key lines" [...] while performing the ballads. He wrote that every [...] "twitch, turn, slide and hip shake was in perfect sync" [...] and praised the singer's constant motion most of the time which never left her [...] "out of breath". While reviewing Knowles' concert in Bangkok, Thailand, Lisnaree Vichitsorasatra of The Nation praised her dancing which included [...] "shaking, bouncing and belly dancing, mixed with hip-hop" [...] further comparing it with Shakira's. She further noted that the highlight of the show was when Knowles sang the slow-tempo ballads. The Courier Mails Tonya Turner praised Knowles' [...] "passionate and fiery" [...] performance accompanied by [...] "frantic booty popping and sexy R moves". Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Ann Powers noted that the tour was one of the [...] "modern superstar spectacles that casts the artist's reality onto the level of myth". However, she noted, that [...] "Beyoncé's 'Experience' plays off the performer's well-known struggles and triumphs to build a story that will make fans both gawk and relate. The maddening thing about this dazzling entertainment, though, is that the tale it tells is partly the wrong one." [...] She concluded the review by saying, [...] "Beyoncé is electric in concert yet reined in by her show's post-feminist theme. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> let it be about her musical prowess?". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News praised Knowles' energy and powerful performance on stage, writing [...] "With her triumphant gait, statuesque figure and steely stare, the singer seemed primed not just to perform but to vanquish... Beyoncé sang with a fiery determination, stressing cries and shouts that had no use for subtlety and even less for vulnerability. She danced at an equally mad clip... hitting every mark with a vengeance... A Beyoncé show... {{has everything to do with}} power and nothing to do with nuance. It's the kind of thing meant to inspire awe, not intimacy... She sang her songs last night with the force of a rapper, stressing pieces from her two solo albums in a way that made every sound seem percussive." [...] However, Farber criticized the unsure repertoire of songs performed, writing [...] "Many of her tunes prove too skittish to sink in, and some of her rhythms are too robotic to find a groove." [...] Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter noted that the snippets of other artists that Knowles included in her own songs were refreshing and included the fast-paced Destiny's Child medley and the performances of [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] as highlights of the show.

2500|$|The idea of atonement for sin is {{criticized by}} Richard Dawkins {{on the grounds}} that the image of God as {{requiring}} the suffering and death of Jesus to effect reconciliation with humankind is immoral. The view is summarized by Dawkins: [...] "if God wanted to forgive our sins, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> forgive them? Who is God trying to impress?" [...] Oxford theologian Alister McGrath maintains that Dawkins is [...] "ignorant" [...] of Christian theology, and therefore unable to engage religion and faith intelligently. He goes on to say that the atonement was necessary because of our flawed human nature, which made it impossible for us to save ourselves, and that it expresses God's love for us by removing the sin that stands in the way of our reconciliation with God. Responding to the criticism that he is [...] "ignorant" [...] of theology, Dawkins asks, [...] "Do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in leprechauns?" [...] and [...] "es, I have, of course, met this point before. It sounds superficially fair. But it presupposes that there is something in Christian theology to be ignorant about. The entire thrust of my position is that Christian theology is a non-subject." [...] Dinesh D'Souza says that Dawkins' criticism [...] "only makes sense if you assume Christians made the whole thing up." [...] He goes on to say that Christians view it as a beautiful sacrifice, and that [...] "through the extremity of Golgotha, Christ reconciles divine justice and divine mercy." [...] Andrew Wilson argues that Dawkins misses the point of the atonement, which has nothing to do with masochism, but is based on the concepts of holiness, sin and grace.|$|E
