5|$|A {{prevailing}} design philosophy for A Realm Reborn was {{to simultaneously}} appeal to hardcore MMORPG players while {{reaching out to}} new players and Final Fantasy fans who had never experienced the genre before. As a consequence, Yoshida held optimizing gameplay for controllers as a top priority. To streamline development, he made about 400 fundamental design decisions which eliminated time lost to getting approvals, {{with a focus on}} implementing standard features of the genre first. The new workflow pipeline <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> <b>using</b> updates to the original game and applied to development of A Realm Reborn. The continuing operations of the original release also provided a valuable testing ground for new features that would be carried into the relaunch. Throughout this process, Yoshida emphasized that communication with players and restoring their trust was key, even admitting that sales were secondary compared to redeeming the reputation of the series. Live streaming conversations between the development team and fans, such as the Letters from the Producer LIVE events, became a major element of Yoshida's player outreach strategy.|$|E

25|$|Tom Prescott {{worked for}} Sikorsky Aircraft, Piper Aircraft, and Learjet. He left Learjet in 1983 {{to produce the}} Prescott Pusher. The pusher <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> <b>using</b> a 1/5 scale model in the Wichita State University wind tunnel in 1983. Flying scale models were tested in 1984, {{which led to the}} {{development}} of the drooped wing tips for better low speed handling and reduced drag. The aircraft was modeled using CAD/CAM software for creating drawings and defining machine cuts on the fuselage steel, becoming the first CAD/CAM designed homebuilt aircraft. The AVIA Products Co was purchased to develop an electrically controlled variable pitch fiberglass pusher propeller.|$|E
25|$|The {{rhetoric of}} the nudism and anti-nudism {{movements}} emphasizes freedom {{from many of the}} normal constraints which regulate human interaction in nudist settings, although for different reasons. Using data from French and German beaches, this hypothesis <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> <b>using</b> five different indicators. Little significant variation between nudists and non-nudists within French and German settings is found in their patterns of interactional spacing, while more significant main effects for differences of cultures are found regardless of nudity status. As a subculture, nudists would appear to differ from nonnudists only in their propensity to like to sunbathe in the nude. Their nude status would appear to have none of the de-inhibiting effects often attributed to nudism. By contrast, clear cultural differences between German and French cultures are shown consistent with Hall's high-low context distinction and the Francoeur's hot-cool sexuality continuum.|$|E
500|$|When the – {{now famous}} – [...] "Hello, World!" [...] program example in The C Programming Language was first {{published}} in 1978 a similar mainframe COBOL program sample would have been submitted through JCL, very likely using a punch card reader, and 80 column punch cards. [...] The listing below, with an empty DATA DIVISION, <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> <b>using</b> GNU/Linux and the System/370 Hercules emulator running MVS 3.8J. [...] The JCL, written in July 2015, is derived from the Hercules tutorials and samples hosted by Jay Moseley.

30|$|For {{statistical}} comparisons, {{mean and}} standard deviation values for all mechanical testing measures (ultimate strength, percent elongation at failure, and elastic modulus) were calculated for each location, orientation, and species. Outlier data were identified using Chauvenet’s criteria and removed from data sets. Location differences within each species <b>were</b> <b>tested</b> <b>using</b> paired t-tests, with a Bonferroni-adjusted significance level less than 0.0167 being required to reach significance at the p[*]=[*] 0.05 level. Orientation differences within each species were also compared using a paired t-test. Cross-species differences <b>were</b> <b>tested</b> <b>using</b> an unpaired t-test assuming unequal variance. Sex differences in the human data <b>were</b> <b>tested</b> <b>using</b> an unpaired t-test assuming equal variance. Correlations between human donor age or BMI and mechanical measures <b>were</b> <b>testing</b> <b>using</b> regression analysis. P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. All data is represented as mean[*]±[*]SEM.|$|R
2500|$|In 2014, the {{adaptive}} value of sensitisation due to injury <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> <b>using</b> the predatory interactions between {{longfin inshore squid}} (Doryteuthis pealeii) and black sea bass (Centropristis striata) which are natural predators of this squid. [...] If injured squid are targeted by a bass, they began their defensive behaviours sooner (indicated by greater alert distances and longer flight initiation distances) than uninjured squid. [...] If anaesthetic (1% ethanol and MgCl2) is administered prior to the injury, this prevents the sensitisation and blocks the behavioural effect. [...] The authors claim {{this study is the}} first experimental evidence to support the argument that nociceptive sensitisation is actually an adaptive response to injuries.|$|E
2500|$|Hess [...] (1964) {{made the}} first {{measurements}} of P-wave azimuthal velocity variations in oceanic basins. [...] This area was chosen for this study because oceanic basins are made of large, relatively uniform homogeneous rocks. [...] Hess observed, from previous seismic velocity experiments with olivine crystals, that if the crystals had even a slight statistical orientation this would be extremely evident in the seismic velocities recorded using seismic refraction. [...] This concept <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> <b>using</b> seismic refraction profiles from the Mendocino Fracture Zone. [...] Hess found that the slow shear waves propagated perpendicular to the plane of slip and the higher velocity component was parallel to it. [...] He inferred that the structure of oceanic basins could be recorded quickly and understood better if these techniques were used.|$|E
