To measure this value and identify the factors affecting it, this paper uses the contingent valuation method with double-bounded dichotomous choice approach. The empirical result shows that usage time of mobile device, the priority of handset subsidy when choosing <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> plan, and the awareness of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> payment system are related to dissatisfaction of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> fee.

40|$|Abstract The era {{of mobile}} {{communications}} and <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> has begun. The ongoing mobile revolution has dramatically and fundamentally changed our daily lifestyles, {{and it will}} continue to do so in a foreseeable future. For the next generation, <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> end users have more demands for such services. This thesis examines the challenging user perspectives in designing and developing high value added <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> The aim of this research is to develop reference models and elicit user requirements for 3 G and beyond <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> in order to improve the quality of <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> This thesis first examines the existing architectures and models for high value added <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> followed by the contributions of the thesis. In this thesis, a Cyberworld model, which is a contribution to the WWRF reference modeling initiative and a specification of the WSI reference model, was developed and it serves as a basis for 3 G and beyond <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> design and development. A series of definitions of the Cyberworld model and a roadmap of the enabling technologies were also built up. The emphasis of this part is on how to describe and model user participation in <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> For this purpose, a model of the communication element to represent the components of the wireless world was created. Both static and dynamic reference modeling steps were established to better describe and understand user participation in <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> The validation was achieved through the CyPhone navigation <b>mobile</b> <b>service.</b> In order to enhance <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> mobility, personalisation, and security, an ontology based model was developed to extend the Cyberworld model functionalities. The innovative ontology based mobile system will greatly increase service mobility, personalisation and security, thus improving the quality of <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> The ontology based model was illustrated and validated using a healthcare <b>mobile</b> <b>service.</b> A Quality Function Deployment (QFD) approach was adopted in this research in order to elicit, weigh and prioritise actual user requirements and link them to technical design requirements of <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> Traditionally QFD is employed in manufacturing industry. This approach is now extended to the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> industry for the first time. In this thesis, a detailed step by step QFD approach was proposed for designing high value added <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> As a result, the developed <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> will better meet users' wants and needs which also means that the quality of <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> will be significantly improved. The QFD approach was validated through a <b>mobile</b> e-learning <b>service</b> and another dedicated healthcare service for senior citizens. Through development of reference models and examination of user requirements for 3 G and beyond <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> from user perspectives, this thesis contributes to the design and development of high value added <b>mobile</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

The back-ground knowledge and market effects will be discussed {{at the beginning and}} the findings will be discussed in section “Mobile <b>Services</b> Survey”. <b>Mobile</b> phone users expect that mobile phone is a versatile digital assistant. Information exchange and navigation are the most popular <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> The competition between mobile phone manufacturers, their business models and operating systems will bring more advanced <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> to consumers. To develop successful <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> {{the most important thing is}} to understand customer requirements and to design the <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> to meet their expectations. The evaluation of typical <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> is the main subject in this thesis, the analysis and background knowledge research are based on the <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> survey result.

40|$|The {{working paper}} starts with an {{overview}} of the growth in research on <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> Based on the increase in the research on <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> the last few years, the fact that the last general review article on <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> we identified was published in 2010, and the change to more appbased <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> we argue for the importance of conducting a review to identify gaps in the literature that should be guiding future research on <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> The methodology applied to identify articles for the review is described along with {{an overview of}} the journals from which the articles are selected. The main categorization of the articles includes conceptual, qualitative, and quantitative contributions. The analysis starts with a description of the <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> studied within each of the main categories of the articles. The analysis shows that articles sometimes operate with rather generic descriptions of the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> category studied – e. g. mobile commerce, mobile marketing, <b>mobile</b> data <b>services,</b> etc. The next part of the analysis is a review of the main topics studied in the articles. The conceptual articles typically focus 1) definitions, opportunities and challenges of <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> 2) description of success criteria, 3) implications of <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> and 4) description and discussion of system design and modelling processes. The main focus of the qualitative studies is on success criteria. Also, a few articles look into issues of business models and system design and modelling processes. The quantitative studies constitute the largest category of articles. A lot of these studies look into success criteria – and a large part of this topic is covered by adoption studies focusing antecedents of successful adoption of various <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> It is an interesting observation that surveys seem to be the dominating methodological design in the quantitative studies. Based on the review, the main gaps identified are 1) only a few studies look into app-based <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> This seems reasonable as app-based <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> are a rather novel type of <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> but it is still worrying due to the apparent success of these services. 2) Only a few studies look into effects of using <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> and when compared to the large amount of adoption studies, this is emphasized as an interesting path for future research. 3) Only a few studies seem to focus on <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> developed for specific contexts. A few exceptions are, for example, two studies investigating in-store <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> – <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> tailored to support the shopping experience in a specific store. We see this as an interesting direction for future research as we also expect a growth in such types of <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> in the years to come. 4) We also observe that a rather small part of the studies are applying experiments as the methodological design. To improve the validity of <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> research, we argue for the importance of applying more experiment based research designs...|$|R

40|$|The <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> {{market has}} gone through a major change in the last several years. The market has evolved from a {{traditional}} monopolistic situation to a situation with a variety of different service providers. The competition in the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> market has grown at an exceptional rate in the past several years, and customers can now freely migrate form one service provider to another. With fewer new subscribers to sign up for <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> managing customer churn {{has become one of the}} most critical challenges for the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> providers. The focus has now switched from acquiring new customers to rather retaining existing ones. The aim of this paper is to study the competition between <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> providers, and examine different types of churning behavior in order to predict the future of the market. In particular, the study looks at what happens in the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> market when we have churning. Customer churning behavior plays an important role in the market, and in order to predict the future of the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> market, it is critical to understand what drives customers to churn. This study, investigates different churning determinates that affects the churning behavior. The research also includes network effects and word-of-mouth effect. The study proposes a model, called the Competitive <b>Mobile</b> <b>Service</b> Model (CMSM), to model the competition between service providers in the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> market. The model is taking into account the adoption of new customers and churning between <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> providers. The CMSM model was implemented in AnyLogic with system dynamics, and tested with three different scenarios to analyze the temporal evolution of the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> market.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{highlight}} the connections between the diffusion of innovation theory and the evolutionary models for technological changes {{within the context of}} mobile communication research. On the basis of empirical findings, the discussion focuses on addressing three research questions: Why should <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion be understood as an evolutionary process? How should <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion be explained and modelled using evolutionary conceptions? And in what way the evolutionary framework could influence future <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion studies? Based on empirical observations and a literature study, this thesis argues that <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion involves dynamic, developmental and historical economic process which is comparable to an evolutionary process. Some essential features of evolutionary processes can also be observed empirically along the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion. For instance, the presence of various generations of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> technology along the diffusion timeline as well as different intensities of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> use, i. e. single subscriptions and multiple subscriptions, indicates that the variation characterizes the diffusion process of <b>mobile</b> <b>service.</b> The cord-cutter population implicitly indicates the presence of selection mechanism of individuals who choose to retain mobile-only communications rather than other type of communication. Similarly the existence of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> non-users also implicitly indicates that retention exists along the diffusion process. All these indications suggest that the evolutionary concepts are relevant in order to comprehend <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion. To explain and model <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion using an evolutionary framework, this thesis underlines the importance of data granularity and the use of a relevant diffusion model. The use of data granularity is critical to represent the variation and to serve as a proxy for making trend projection based on the level of interest. The use of a relevant diffusion model is essential to describe the pattern of the data according to selection mechanisms that determine the diffusion process. The evolutionary variation and selection mechanisms are also considered in two examples of diffusion modelling that address the level of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> use and intergenerational technology effects. The results show intuitive trend projections as well as realistic understanding toward the process of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion which are helpful for business strategy and policy planning. However the proposed approach is still unable to address different actors and forces that may internally or externally influence the evolutionary process of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion (i. e. dynamics in pricing, inter-technological substitutions and complementarities, service bundling, etc.). This suggests that future studies in <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> diffusion should take into account the evolutionary conceptions that could model dynamic interactions of relevant actors and interests in <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is {{the future}} for voice {{communication}} and, by using a unique IP infrastructure as the common transport platform, it brings invaluable benefits such as deployment cost reduction, ease of management, ubiquitous coverage and convergence of data and voice together. On the other side, VoIP introduces new security vulnerabilities, since it comes with completely different operational and security settings than the old telephone network: the physical location of clients is not fixed and great flexibility is required to provide enhanced <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> Furthermore, the <b>integration</b> with wireless LANs, with their inherent security weaknesses, introduces the need of new security features: the payloads of voice packets should be protected during conversations and no-replay as well as user authentication must be ensured on and end-to-end basis. The above concerns are actually the major barrier that may prevent the wide deployment of VoIP technologies, and coping with them is a truly challenging task. Consequently, we developed a novel hybrid framework for enhanced end-to-end security in the new generation SIP-empowered VoIP environments, based on the introduction of proven technologies such as digital signatures and efficient streamline encryption to enforce calling party identification, privacy, no-replay and non-repudiation throughout the whole IP Telephony system. All the security mechanisms used have been carefully chosen so that no systematic method is known to break the framework in realistic times and the overall voice quality will not be affected.

40|$|What is {{the current}} state of <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> among {{academic}} libraries of the country’s top 100 universities, and what are the best practices for librarians implementing <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> at the university level? Through in-depth website visits and survey questionnaires, the authors studied each of the top 100 universities’ libraries’ experiences with <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> Results showed that all of these libraries offered at least one <b>mobile</b> <b>service,</b> and the majority offered multiple services. The most common <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> offered were <b>mobile</b> sites, text messaging <b>services,</b> e-books, and <b>mobile</b> access to databases and the catalog. In addition, chat/IM services, social media accounts and apps were very popular.   Survey responses also indicated a trend towards responsive design for websites so that patrons can access the library’s full site on any mobile device. Respondents recommend that libraries considering offering <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> begin as soon as possible as patron demand for these services is expected to increase...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — To date, <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> {{have failed}} to match the {{explosive}} growth of the Web. This, we argue, is because current <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> are difficult to find, to use, to trust, to design and deploy. The IST SMS (Simple <b>Mobile</b> <b>Services)</b> project takes up the challenge of creating innovative tools addressing {{the specific needs of}} mobile users and making it easier for individuals and small businesses to become providers of Simple <b>Mobile</b> <b>Services.</b> We hope that, thanks to SMS, a large base of people can create Simple <b>Mobile</b> <b>Services,</b> like it happened for the Web, where creating a web page is within the reach of non-expert users. In this paper, we first focus on one of the facets of SMS: service authoring tools. We highlight the importance of powerful authoring tools, to speed up and reduce the cost of service development. Then we focus on the location based services that are an important component of SMS. Index Terms — simple <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> service creation, location based service...|$|R
