500|$|Writer Ian Maxtone-Graham, {{a former}} {{resident}} of New York, had conceived {{the idea of}} having the family travel to the city to locate their missing car and believed it to be [...] "a classic Manhattan problem".

[...] "There were a number of scenes that paced well when we intercut them rather than letting them play as written in a linear fashion. For instance, we wanted to let the mission briefing scene play normally—this is where the SEAL team is briefed on their target. That scene was followed by a scene of the target beheading a local. <b>We</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> an actual briefing is very technical and rote, so intercutting these scenes helped keep the audience engaged." ...|$|E

500|$|Several film {{executives}} later made efforts {{towards the}} project, including Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi, Dick Zondag, Glen Keane, and Dave Goetz. In 2011, director Chris Buck {{began work on}} another attempted adaption and also faced challenges with the Snow Queen character. Producer Peter Del Vecho explained that this was primarily because she was not relatable and too isolated, having no personal connections. As a result, they could not explain her motivations. After several changes were proposed, someone on the writing team suggested making the Snow Queen Anna's sister. [...] "Once <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> these characters could be siblings and have a relationship, everything changed," [...] Del Vecho relayed.|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} DecembeRadio all began playing music in their teens. [...] Josh Reedy and Brian Bunn {{attended}} the same schools, and the former's rendition of [...] "Johnny B.

We played Hootie & the Blowfish covers {{and that sort of}} thing. Then shortly thereafter, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> God had given us these gifts, and we wanted to utilize them for him," [...] recalled Bunn.

[...] The duo set the order of the tracks to cover the four sides of a two-disc vinyl LP.

The idea was to make the songs better by arranging them the way we did; to make it more even as an album."

500|$|Song's first {{starring}} {{role as the}} title character was in the 2006 Disney Channel Original Movie , which had over 5.7 million viewers at its premiere. Wendy Wu was planned to be a comedy, but {{the directors of the}} film were having trouble finding a suitable actor with both the comedic presence and taekwondo ability to play the main character, originally named Kenny Lu. Lydia Cook, one of the films's directors, said, [...] "Brenda was originally brought in to play the [...] monk's role. We started training with her in martial arts, and that's when <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> she should be Kenny Lu. They quickly switched things around and offered Brenda the lead in the movie. She had the perfect combination of wit and martial arts." [...] Song had to break a brick with her hand in a screen test before landing the title role.|$|E
500|$|Guitarist Kirk Hammett {{noted that}} {{the length of the}} songs was {{problematic}} for fans and for the band: [...] "Touring behind it, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the general consensus was that songs were too fucking long. One day after we played 'Justice' and got off the stage one of us said, 'we're never fucking playing that song again. Nevertheless, [...] "One" [...] quickly became [...] a permanent fixture in the band's setlist. When performed live, the opening war sound is lengthened from seventeen seconds to approximately two minutes. At the song's conclusion, the stage turns pitch-black and fire erupts from various places. The live performance is characterized as a [...] "musical and visual highlight" [...] by Rolling Stone journalist Denise Sheppard. Other songs from …And Justice for All that have frequently been performed are [...] "Blackened" [...] and [...] "Harvester of Sorrow", which were often featured during the album's promotional Damaged Justice Tour.|$|E

500|$|After {{working on}} their debut self-titled album, Whodini {{embarked}} on a three-month European tour. Two-and-a-half weeks into this tour, {{they were joined by}} Kangol Kid and UTFO. The group had also planned to tour in Israel and Australia following their European tour, but refused to do so, as they had been away from home for three weeks and found the tour [...] "rigorous". Singer-songwriter Jalil Hutchins later said, [...] "Somebody should've stepped in and made us [...]" [...] Whodini member John Fletcher (Ecstasy) said that the group thought European audiences would be unfamiliar with their music, but they [...] "found that lots of kids, lots of club owners, had made a real effort to get hold of our music. When we discovered that, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the music we were working with really was universal, that we didn't have to think of a particular market.

500|$|In 1993, Sega and Japanese {{electronics}} company Hitachi {{formed a}} joint venture {{to develop a new}} CPU for the Saturn, which resulted {{in the creation of the}} [...] "SuperH RISC Engine" [...] (or SH-2) later that year. The Saturn was ultimately designed around a dual-SH2 configuration. According to Kazuhiro Hamada, Sega's section chief for Saturn development during the system's conception, [...] "the SH-2 was chosen for reasons of cost and efficiency. The chip has a calculation system similar to a DSP , but <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> a single CPU would not be enough to calculate a 3D world." [...] Although the Saturn's design was largely finished before the end of 1993, reports in early 1994 of the technical capabilities of Sony's upcoming PlayStation console prompted Sega to include another video display processor (VDP) to improve the system's 2D performance and texture-mapping. CD-ROM-based and cartridge-only versions of the Saturn hardware were considered for simultaneous release at one point during the system's development, but this idea was discarded due to concerns over the lower quality and higher price of cartridge-based games.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} on Her {{took place}} in mid-2012, with a production budget of $23 million. It was primarily filmed in Los Angeles with an additional two weeks of filming in Shanghai. During production of the film, actress Samantha Morton performed the role of Samantha by acting on set [...] "in a four-by-four carpeted soundproof booth made of black painted plywood and soft, noise-muffling fabric". At Jonze's suggestion, she and Joaquin Phoenix avoided seeing each other on set during filming. Morton was later replaced by Scarlett Johansson. Jonze explained: [...] "It was only in post production, when we started editing, that <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> what the character/movie needed was different from what Samantha and I had created together. So we recast and since then Scarlett has taken over that role." [...] Jonze met Johansson {{in the spring of}} 2013 and worked with her for four months. Following the recast, new scenes were shot in August 2013, which were either [...] "newly imagined" [...] or [...] "new scenes that [...] had wanted to shoot originally but didn't".|$|E

500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like {{we could go to}} New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's {{part of the reason that}} when we talked about it, we said, 'You know what? This season let's stay in L.A.' Because so much of L.A. still looks like it did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something we had talked about in the middle of the first season... <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> not only was it a good idea for the storytelling, but also...it's much easier for us to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Owen was {{diagnosed}} with prostate cancer in 2010, but he was later given {{a clean bill of}} health, which led to the band's reunion, without Herndon. Following a series of tornados destroying homes and businesses throughout their state in 2011, Alabama assembled a benefit concert in Birmingham, called Bama Rising. Featuring the band's first set since 2004, alongside Luke Bryan, Sheryl Crow and Brad Paisley, the concert raised $2.1 million. [...] "I guess <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> maybe we missed the playing... and five or six years had gone by and we were like, 'Maybe that wasn't as bad as we remember it being,'" [...] said Gentry. In celebration of the group's 40th anniversary, Alabama resumed touring in 2013 for the Back to the Bowery tour, referencing the Myrtle Beach club where they first became professional musicians. They also undertook a short cruise, The Alabama & Friends Festival at Sea, which left for the Bahamas on Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Pearl ship. In addition, the band released Alabama & Friends, a tribute album encompassing covers from newer artists such as Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line, in addition to two new tracks by Alabama.|$|E
500|$|The Allman Brothers Band {{had first}} played Fillmore East in December 1969, opening for Blood, Sweat & Tears for three nights. Promoter Bill Graham enjoyed {{the band and}} promised to have them back soon. In January 1970, the band opened for Buddy Guy and B.B. King at San Francisco's Fillmore West, and one month later at Fillmore East {{supporting}} the Grateful Dead. According to biographer Alan Paul, [...] "these shows were crucial in establishing the band and exposing them to a wider, sympathetic audience on both coasts." [...] Drummer Butch Trucks considered their performances at the Fillmore East to be the launching pad for their success. In 1970, Duane Allman told disc jockey Ed Shane, [...] "You know, we get kind of frustrated doing the [...] records, and I think, consequently, our next album will be... a live recording, {{to get some of}} that natural fire on it." [...] "We were not intentionally trying to buck the system, but keeping each song down to 3:14 just didn't work for us," [...] remembered Gregg Allman. [...] "And <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the audience {{was a big part of}} what we did, which couldn't be duplicated in a studio.

500|$|The {{concept of}} a black Spider-Man was first {{discussed}} {{a few months before}} the November 2008 election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Axel Alonso describes the catalyst, [...] "When we were planning [...] "Ultimatum," [...] <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> we were standing at the brink of America electing its first African-American President and we acknowledged that maybe it was time to {{take a good look at}} one of our icons." [...] This new Spider-Man would replace Parker as Spider-Man only in Ultimate Marvel, an imprint whose storyline is set in a universe separate from the mainstream Marvel universe, in which Marvel's characters were reimagined for a 21st century audience. The replacement of Ultimate Peter Parker was considered as a possible part of the 2008–09 [...] "Ultimatum" [...] story arc that restructured much of the Ultimate Marvel universe, but those early thoughts were abandoned because the story for that character had not yet been developed. When Marvel's editorial staff decided that the Ultimate universe's Peter Parker would be killed in the 2011 storyline [...] "", the character Miles Morales was created. Although Morales is the first black Spider-Man, he marks the second time a Latino character has taken the Spider-Man identity. Miguel O'Hara, who is of half Mexican descent, was the title character in the 1990s series Spider-Man 2099.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Wentz drew lyrical {{inspiration}} from rapper Lil Wayne, whom he called [...] "the best lyricist of [...]" [...] Speaking of Infinity on Highs lyrical themes, Wentz stated, [...] "On the last record, the lyrics were about 'This is where we're {{going to be}} a year from now, and this is what you're going to be saying about us.' But this time, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> a lot of bands should spend less time running their mouths and more time writing their songs." [...] In 2013, Wentz reflected, [...] "on a record like Infinity on High, I feel like I tried really hard to explain my perspective – and when I look back on it in hindsight I think it’s an extremely unrelatable record. Critics felt that much of the lyrics address the band's rise to fame and the pressure of maintaining a loyal fanbase. Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that [...] "The only top-ten acts that talk about fame as much as Fall Out Boy does are rappers, although their take on selling records is less conflicted." [...] Cory Apar of Allmusic opined that [...] "Wentz' lyrics are oftentimes resentful, full of fame-induced angst, and really emphasize his need to drive home his position that stardom has not changed the band." ...|$|E
500|$|The band began {{recording}} {{without much}} material {{and needed to}} compose songs on the spot, either by jamming or talking through ideas. Morrison enjoyed not having multiple takes, as on The Soft Parade, and showed up to the sessions on time and sober, unlike sessions for that album. The absence of Rothchild helped as he was a perfectionist who insisted on many takes. In 1994, guitarist Robby Krieger stated, [...] "Rothchild was gone, {{which is one reason}} why we had so much fun. The warden was gone." [...] Despite its troubled beginnings, L.A. Woman contains some of the Doors' most critically acclaimed songs, {{as well as some of}} their most blues-oriented. Lyrically, it deals with contemporary topics such as love, life in Los Angeles, and complex aspects of the human experience. Manzarek explained the band did not [...] "approach the album with one vision, but after we started working on the songs, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> they're talking about L.A. They're about men, women, boys, girls, love, loss, lovers-lost, and lovers-found in Los Angeles". The album, as a whole, demonstrated Morrison's songwriting abilities, combined with his poetic phrasing and enthusiasm for Los Angeles, and a desire to leave the city with his partner, Pamela Courson. Artistically, L.A. Woman saw the band mixing blues, psychedelia, and jazz, often within a single song. For the first time since [...] "The End" [...] and [...] "When the Music's Over", the group incorporated longer songs, including [...] "L.A. Woman" [...] and [...] "Riders on the Storm".|$|E
