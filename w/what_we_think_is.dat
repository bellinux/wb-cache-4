The shows themselves varied considerably {{in comparison to the}} previous Chinese Democracy Tour. All of the North American shows took place in smaller-scale clubs, rather than a large arena or stadium. All pyrotechnics were removed from the shows. The European leg of the tour began approximately one month after the band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Guitarist DJ Ashba discussed a potential follow up to Chinese Democracy in a 2012 interview, stating [...] "I've written and demoed up probably about 12 songs, I think.

2500|$|In July 2007, Hagel was one {{of three}} Republican Senators who {{supported}} Democratic-proposed legislation requiring a troop withdrawal from Iraq to begin within 120 days. He told Robert D. Novak [...] "This thing is really coming undone quickly, and [...] Maliki's government is weaker by the day. The police are corrupt, top to bottom. The oil problem is a huge problem. They still can't get anything through the parliament—no hydrocarbon law, no de-Baathification law, no provincial elections." [...] In 2008, along with then-Senator (and presumptive Democratic nominee for president) Barack Obama, and Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), Hagel visited Iraq in a congressional delegation trip, meeting with U.S. service members, General David Petraeus, and the Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki. While talking to reporters in Iraq, Hagel said, [...] "Each one of us who has a responsibility of helping lead this country needs to reflect on <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> in the interests of our country, not the interest of our party or our president." ...|$|E
2500|$|Deleuze's unusual metaphysics entails {{an equally}} {{atypical}} epistemology, {{or what he}} calls a transformation of [...] "the image of thought". According to Deleuze, the traditional image of thought, found in philosophers such as Aristotle, René Descartes, and Edmund Husserl, misconceives of thinking as a mostly unproblematic business. Truth may be hard to discover—it may require a life of pure theorizing, or rigorous computation, or systematic doubt—but thinking is able, at least in principle, to correctly grasp facts, forms, ideas, etc. It may be practically impossible to attain a God's-eye, neutral point of view, but that is the ideal to approximate: a disinterested pursuit that results in a determinate, fixed truth; an orderly extension of common sense. Deleuze rejects this view as papering over the metaphysical flux, instead claiming that genuine thinking is a violent confrontation with reality, an involuntary rupture of established categories. Truth changes what we think; it alters <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> possible. By setting aside the assumption that thinking has a natural ability to recognize the truth, Deleuze says, we attain a [...] "thought without image", a thought always determined by problems rather than solving them. [...] "All this, however, presupposes codes or axioms which do not result by chance, but which do not have an intrinsic rationality either. It's just like theology: everything about it is quite rational if you accept sin, the immaculate conception, and the incarnation. Reason is always a region carved out of the irrational—not sheltered from the irrational at all, but traversed by it and only defined by a particular kind of relationship among irrational factors. Underneath all reason lies delirium, and drift." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Electoral {{continuity}} and discontinuity {{have been a}} staple of voting research for decades. Most researchers have employed Pearson’s r {{as a measure of}} congruence between two electoral outcomes across a set of geographic units. This paper argues that that practice should be abandoned. The correlation coefficient is a measure of linearity, not similarity, and is almost always the wrong measure. The paper recommends other quantities that better accord with what researchers usually mean by electoral persistence. Replications of prior studies in American and comparative politics demonstrate that the consequences of using r when it is inappropriate can be stark. In some cases <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> continuities are actually discontinuities. ...|$|R
