The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as Fuck, including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title. Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> keep Fuck as its title.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{initially}} {{opposed the}} march outright, {{because he was}} concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed. With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> work to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000. Therefore, he enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and the UAW union to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause.|$|E

The Society also houses its library and collections in the jail and runs a small museum shop from the building.|$|E
5|$|An Admiralty {{memorandum}} set out {{the detailed}} instructions. The first requirement was to resolve disagreements in the earlier surveys about the longitude of Rio de Janeiro, which was essential as the base point for meridian distances. The accurate marine chronometers needed to determine longitude had only become affordable since 1800; the Beagle carried 22 chronometers to allow corrections. The ship was to stop at specified points for four-day rating of the chronometers and to check them by astronomical observations: it was essential to take observations at Porto Praya and Fernando de Noronha to calibrate against the previous surveys of Owen and Foster. It <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> survey {{the extent of the}} Abrolhos Archipelago reefs, shown incorrectly in Roussin's survey, then proceed to Rio de Janeiro to decide the exact longitude of Villegagnon Island.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{providing}} thematic consistency with the original, {{the repetition of}} iconography also acted as a vital marketing tool. The marketing of the album was documented in an episode of the 1995 BBC television programme The Music Biz. Executives at Virgin Records thought that this <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> attract the target audience, who they believed no longer spent much time in record shops.

5|$|Carlisle {{selected}} William Ralls Morrison, another tariff reformer, to {{lead the}} Ways and Means committee, but allowed Randall {{to take charge of}} Appropriations. Morrison's committee produced a bill proposing tariff reductions of 20%; Randall opposed the idea from the start, as did the Republicans. Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress at a crucial time in April 1884, and the tariff bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes. Two days later, Randall's Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support. Many Democrats who had voted for Morrison's tariff were thereby reminded that Randall had the power to defeat spending that <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> them; when the final vote came, enough switched sides to join with Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151.|$|E
5|$|Decorative {{arts for}} luxury {{consumers}} included fine pottery, silver and bronze vessels and implements, and glassware. The {{manufacture of pottery}} {{in a wide range}} of quality <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> trade and employment, as were the glass and metalworking industries. Imports stimulated new regional centres of production. Southern Gaul became a leading producer of the finer red-gloss pottery (terra sigillata) that was a major item of trade in 1st-century Europe. Glassblowing was regarded by the Romans as originating in Syria in the 1st century BC, and by the 3rd century Egypt and the Rhineland had become noted for fine glass.|$|E

5|$|French fur traders from Canada {{were the}} first Europeans to enter Indiana, {{beginning}} in the 1670s. The quickest route connecting the New France districts of Canada and Louisiana ran along Indiana's Wabash River. The Terre Haute highlands were once considered {{the border between the}} two French districts. This made Indiana a vital part of French lines of communication and trade routes. The French established Vincennes as a permanent settlement in Indiana during European rule, but the population of the area remained primarily Native American. As French influence grew in the region, Great Britain, competing with France for control of North America, came to believe that control of Indiana <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> halt French expansion on the continent.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> bury the dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{keep track}} of the amount of ice being loaded onto a ship for both {{commercial}} and safety reasons, so ice blocks were each weighed before they went onto a ship, and a total tally of the weight of the ice was recorded. Initially a crude method of loading involving ice tongs and a whip was used to lower the separated blocks of ice into the hold, but an improved method was developed by the 1870s involving a levered platform, superseded by a counterweighted platform device by 1890. Ships were loaded quickly to prevent the ice from melting and, in U.S. ports, an average cargo could be loaded in just two days. Freight charges were paid on the intake, or departure, weight of the cargo, and conditions were laid down on the handling of the ice along the route.|$|E

5|$|New Labour {{accepted}} the economic efficiency of {{free markets and}} believed {{that they could be}} detached from capitalism to achieve the aims of socialism, while maintaining the efficiency of capitalism. Markets were also useful for giving power to consumers and allowing citizens {{to make their own decisions}} and act responsibly. New Labour embraced market economics because they believed they could be used for their social aims, as well as economic efficiency. The party did not believe that public ownership was efficient or desirable; ensuring that they were not seen to be ideologically pursuing centralised public ownership <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the party. In government, the party relied on public-private partnerships and private finance initiatives to raise funds and mitigate fears of a 'tax and spend' policy or excessive borrowing.|$|E
5|$|Ole Juulson Kvale was a Minnesota congressman of the Farmer-Labor Party, and a proud Norse-American. Kvale was {{a member}} of the Norse-American Centennial Commission, which was to {{organize}} a 100th anniversary celebration of the Restauration voyage. This celebration <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> a Norse-American community that had been perceived as antiwar during World War I, and was attempting to display both ethnic pride and assimilation. Kvale, a Lutheran minister, was also a member of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, and in January 1925 approached the Treasury Department, seeking its support for a commemorative coin in honor of the anniversary; he was told that the Treasury would oppose it. Commemorative coins for ethnic heritage groups were unlikely to pass Congress at that time due to the controversy caused by the 1924 Huguenot-Walloon Tercentenary half dollar, seen by some as Protestant propaganda.|$|E

The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.|$|E
