Though Green missed catching her daughter when she did jump, Kate was not hurt. When the two ran into Farrar minutes later, Kate said that Farrar had been accusatory toward Green and Green had been crying and worried about her missing children.|$|E

Field {{explained}} in 2016 that [...] "I felt Annie Hathaway was a Chanel girl organically, {{as opposed to}} let's say a Versace [...] girl." [...] <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> the company to ask for assistance, they were delighted because [...] "they wanted to see Chanel on a young girl to give it another point of view," [...] showing it as a brand for [...] "not just middle-aged women in suits, but youthful and funky."

500|$|The prosecutor, Eugene Duchesne QC, {{began his}} case by calling Mathew Lamb's uncle, Stanley Hesketh, to the stand. Hesketh testified that {{three hours after}} the shootings his nephew {{had told him that}} he [...] "must have done it". He said that since his nephew had come to live with him {{following}} his release from prison, he had always been exceptionally polite and helpful to his family. However, during the morning of 26 June Lamb had for the first time been hesitant, not giving full answers to questions and generally acting in a less open manner. Duchesne then called witnesses of the shootings, who agreed unanimously that Lamb had been unhurried, cool and collected. When cross-examined by Nosanchuk about this unusual calmness, they said that Lamb had appeared very distant and did not seem to have any bearing on what was happening around him: one of the witnesses said that Lamb had not appeared to even notice a very loud party in progress across the street. Heaton said that the boy had looked frightened and had fled without reason <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> to her husband. The police officers who arrested Lamb also agreed that the defendant had been unusually cool and silent. Hesketh told the court that when he had come home his nephew had been fast asleep in bed.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{preferred}} Paltrow's {{return in}} the [...] "Sexy" [...] installment to her initial appearance. The Washington Post Emily Yahr {{felt that she was}} better integrated into this episode, and Raymund Flandez of the Wall Street Journal called her return [...] "infinitely better" [...] than her first appearance: [...] "Back then, she was a puzzle, a loony bin. Here, she's sly and quick-witted, appropriately adult and seductively saucy in an episode that showcased more of her comedic timing, than her stiff dance skills. All the better for us." [...] Fallon wrote that Paltrow was [...] "if possible, even sassier and sultrier" [...] than before, and felt that she served to anchor a busy episode. In contrast, Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly had mixed feelings about Holly and believed that she dominated screen time. VanDerWerff liked Paltrow's acting, but disliked Holly's interaction with Will, saying they lacked [...] "chemistry". Soraya Roberts of the Daily News disliked her return for prolonging Will and Emma's separation, branding Holly a home-wrecker. She commented that while Paltrow's appearance in [...] "The Substitute" [...] was [...] "relatively fresh", in [...] "Sexy" [...] she was [...] "acting almost like a cardboard cutout version of her former self, overly enunciating her lines [...] treading carefully around her choreography". Poniewozik found all of Paltrow's scenes [...] "labored and ridiculous", and wrote that the actress failed to bring an element of realism to her character. Canning said that [...] "the moment she came on screen the whole episode lit up", and the episode was a [...] "fun and funny showcase for everybody's favorite recurring character", and Futterman echoed him <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> Paltrow [...] "our new favorite cast member".|$|E

50|$|Despite {{being about}} a family, the novel {{demonstrates}} {{the solitude of}} the various characters.

2500|$|Schlessinger's first {{appearance}} on radio was in 1975 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> in to a KABC show hosted by Bill Ballance. Impressed by her quick wit {{and sense of}} humor, Ballance began featuring her in a weekly segment. Schlessinger's stint on Ballance's show led to her own shows {{on a series of}} small radio stations. By 1979 she was on the air Sunday evenings from 9:00 to midnight on KWIZ in Santa Ana, California. That year, the Los Angeles Times described her show as dealing with all types of emotional problems, [...] "though sex therapy is the show's major focus".|$|E

[...] She ran half a mile, believing she was being chased, to a Beverly {{residence}} at 805 Blanton Street, where she screamed for help and banged on the front door. A car passed but did not stop <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> after it. She ran {{to the back of the}} house and woke up the owners, who then notified authorities. Bowie County Sheriff W. H.

2500|$|The 24 {{candidates}} were narrowed down to 10 semi-finalists and were later trimmed to five finalists. Carlene Aguilar, {{who represented the}} National Capital Region (NCR), won Miss Philippines 2001 with the theme focused on the environment. She was a 19-year-old advertising and public relations student at the Assumption College when she was crowned.

2500|$|After its première in 1958 it {{was greeted}} with mixed, half-hearted reviews, {{although}} the first night reviews of [...] 'Ondine' [...] were unanimous about one thing: Fonteyn's triumph in the title role. A.V.Coton spoke of [...] "the supernormal sensitivity of feeling, interaction and mutual understanding which exists between Ashton and his heroine", and Cyril Beaumont saw the ballet as Ashton's [...] "greatest gift" [...] to his ballerina. Nothing else about the piece pleased everybody, though most reviewers liked Lila de Nobili's designs and praised {{the contribution of the}} supporting cast – Beaumont called Alexander Grant's Tirrenio [...] "of Miltonic stature, magnificently danced and mimed." [...] Edwin Denby dismissed [...] 'Ondine' : after praising Fonteyn he said [...] "But the ballet is foolish, and everyone noticed". Most critics disliked the music and Mary Clarke was in the minority <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> it [...] "rich and romantic and superbly rhythmical". Fernau Hall thought Henze showed [...] "little understanding of the needs of classical dancing", and that [...] 'Ondine' [...] would establish itself firmly in the repertoire [...] "if it were not for Henze's music".|$|E
2500|$|Jane Kowalski's {{call was}} placed by {{cellphone}} at 6:30p.m. {{while she was}} driving on U.S. Route 41. [...] "I was at a stoplight and a man pulled up {{next to me and}} there was a child screaming in the car", she said. [...] She explained further that she heard [...] "terrifying screaming" [...] and that she had [...] "never heard anything like that". [...] Kowalski believed that she was witnessing a child abduction. [...] She also identified the car as a Camaro but stated the color as blue (rather than green). [...] She stated that she had made eye contact with the driver after which [...] "a hand came up and started banging on the passenger window". [...] Since she had crossed the county line into Charlotte, the call was routed to Charlotte County's 9-1-1 call center. [...] It was only after she saw the news the following day that she realized she had witnessed the abduction of Lee rather than that of a child. [...] <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> the North Port Police Department to explain who she was and that she had made a 9-1-1 call, it became apparent that the call had not been forwarded to the correct authorities. [...] It is this call that is alleged to have been mishandled {{due to the fact that}} the operatives neglected to file it correctly. [...] This call was also presented by the state prosecutors as part of the key evidence at King's trial.|$|E

2500|$|Paglia is {{critical}} of the influence modern French writers have had on the humanities, claiming that universities are in the [...] "thrall" [...] of French post-structuralists; that {{in the works of}} Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault, she never once found a sentence that interested her; and that post-structuralism has broken the link between the word and the thing, and thus endangers the Western canon. François Cusset writes that Paglia, like other major American public intellectuals after World WarII, owes her broader recognition mainly to the political repercussions of polemics that first erupted on college campuses, in her case to a polemic against foreign intellectualism. He says she achieved phenomenal success <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> Foucault a [...] "bastard", thereby providing (together with Alan Sokal's Social Text parody) the best evidence for Paul deMan's view that theory should be defined negatively, based on the opposition it arouses. However, Paglia's assessment of French writers is not purely negative. She has called Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949) [...] "brilliant", and identified Jean-Paul Sartre's work as part of a high period in literature. Paglia has praised Roland Barthes' Mythologies (1957) and Gilles Deleuze's [...] (1967), while finding both men's later work flawed. Of Gaston Bachelard, who influenced Paglia, she wrote [...] " [...] dignified yet fluid phenomenological descriptive method seemed to me ideal for art", adding that he was [...] "the last modern French writer I took seriously".|$|E
