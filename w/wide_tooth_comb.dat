Most physicians advise against sharing hair care instruments like combs and clips, to prevent spreading hair conditions like dandruff and head lice.|$|E
5000|$|Combs {{can vary}} in shape {{according}} to function. A hairdressing comb {{may have a}} thin, tapered handle for parting hair and close <b>teeth.</b> Common hair <b>combs</b> usually have <b>wider</b> <b>teeth</b> halfway and finer teeth {{for the rest of}} the comb. [...] Hot combs were used solely for straightening hair during the colonial era in North America.|$|R
5000|$|Slow lorises (Nycticebus coucang, Nycticebus bengalensis) and pygmy {{slow lorises}} (Nycticebus pygmaeus), are {{arboreal}} prosimians. They are considered indirectly or secondarily venomous, because their venom {{is produced in}} the brachial gland {{on the inside of}} the elbows, licked, and injected into the victim by a specialized <b>tooth</b> <b>comb.</b> [...] A protein in the secretion, which is similar to the allergen protein isolated from the domestic cat, may be introduced by the bites of these lorises, resulting in anaphylaxis. The brachial gland is a specialized apocrine sweat gland and the <b>tooth</b> <b>comb</b> is a set of spaced incisors on the lower jaw, primarily used for grooming. The lack of physical connection between the brachial gland and the <b>tooth</b> <b>comb</b> makes it hard for lorises to fit in most of the definitions of a venomous animal. Additionally, this “venom” is toxic only for some incidentally susceptible species.|$|R

50|$|Possible {{treatments}} include: {{combing the}} hair frequently {{with a fine}} <b>tooth</b> <b>comb</b> or shaving the head completely. A number of topical medications are also effective, including malathion, ivermectin, and dimethicone. Dimethicone, which is a silicone oil, is often preferred due to the low risk of side effects. Pyrethroids such as permethrin have been commonly used; however, have become less effective due to increasing pesticide resistance. There is little evidence for alternative medicines.|$|R
5000|$|A special fine <b>tooth</b> <b>comb</b> {{that can}} pick out lice is used. For a {{treatment}} with louse comb alone, {{it is recommended}} to comb the hair for an hour to {{an hour and a}} half (depending the length and type of the hair) daily or every second day for 14 days. Wetting the hair especially with water and shampoo or conditioner will facilitate the combing and the removal of lice, eggs and nits.|$|R
40|$|Schultz’s rule (as reconstructed by Smith) {{states that}} there is a {{relationship}} between the pattern (or relative order) of eruption of molar versus secondary (replacement) teeth and the overall pace (or absolute timing) of growth and maturation. Species with ‘fast’ life histories (rapid dental development, rapid growth, early sexual maturation, short life spans) are said to exhibit relatively early eruption of the molars and late eruption of the secondary replacement teeth (premolars, canines, incisors), whereas species with ‘slow’ life histories are said to exhibit relatively late eruption of the molars and early eruption of the secondary dentition. In a recent review, B. H. Smith noted that primates with <b>tooth</b> <b>combs</b> might violate this rule because <b>tooth</b> <b>combs</b> tend to erupt early, regardless of the pace of life history. We show that exceptions to Schultz’s rule among lemurs are not limited to the relative timing of eruption of the <b>tooth</b> <b>comb.</b> Rather, among lemurs, some species with extremely accelerated dental development exhibit a pattern of eruption of molars and of secondary teeth in direct opposition to the expectations of Schultz’s rule. We focus particularly on the pattern (order) and pace (absolute timing) of dental development and eruption in Avahi and Lepilemur – two relatively small, nocturnal folivores with rapid dental development. These taxa differ markedly in their eruption sequences (the premolars erupt after M 2 and M 3 in Lepilemur but not Avahi). We offer an explanation for the failure of Schultz’s rule to predict these differences. Schultz’s rule presumes that eruption timing is dependent {{on the size of the}} jaw and that, therefore, molar crown formation and eruption will be delayed in species with slow-growing jaws. We show that a variety of processes (including developmental imbrication) allows the crowns of permanent teeth to form and to erupt into jaws that might appear to be too small to accommodate them...|$|R
2500|$|Electronic louse combs {{use a small}} {{electrical}} charge to kill lice. The metal <b>teeth</b> of the <b>comb</b> have alternating positively and negatively charged tines, which are powered by a small battery. When the comb is used on dry hair, lice make contact with multiple tines of the fine-toothed comb, thereby closing the circuit and receiving an {{electrical charge}}. A non-peer-reviewed letter has been published in a dermatology journal claiming effectiveness based on personal experience (total of 6 uses). For those with long or fine hair, the metal long <b>tooth</b> <b>combs</b> seem to snag and pull hair. Metal combs may be better for thick hair, while plastic short-tooth combs are best used for treating long and fine hair.|$|R

Typically the teeth are arranged so that they can slide past one another until each tooth occupies the slot in the opposite comb.|$|R

40|$|Extract] In {{developed}} {{market economies}} pediculosis causes angst {{which is far}} {{out of proportion to}} its clinical significance. Control has used a biomedical approach, based on the biology of head lice, dispelling myths with evidence and unifying recommendations. Topical insecticides have been the major intervention until the last decade when use of hair conditioner and physical removal of lice using fine <b>tooth</b> <b>combs</b> has been promoted. However, the anxiety provoked by head lice in developed market economies has not been addressed in a systematic way at the population level. Since the socio-emotional area is arguably the major impact of pediculosis in developed market economies, failure to deal with this aspect is a major deficiency in control strategies. The most prominent differences between head lice control in developing countries and developed market economies are that in the former emotional reactions to head lice are far less important...|$|R
