500|$|Tom (Aziz Ansari) is {{attending}} a launch party for cologne maker Dennis Feinstein (Jason Mantzoukas) at the Snakehole Lounge, where Tom hopes to pitch his own cologne [...] "Tommy Fresh" [...] to him. Ben (Adam Scott) initially turns down the invitation {{because he does}} not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> attached to anybody, since his job will require him move soon. However, Ben relents when Tom invites him again at Leslie's urging (Ben also notes that [...] "Dennis Feinstein" [...] is an oddly ordinary name for a cologne designer, but Tom explains that Dennis' real name, [...] "Dante Fiero", is considered less exotic here). Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) are now dating, but Andy is worried he is too broke to take her out.|$|E
500|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the Tower of Joy, actor Robert Aramayo was cast to play a young Eddard Stark. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Aramayo stated {{that he was a}} big fan of the series, and that [...] "it was an honor and a gift {{to be able to be}} a part of it." [...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> hung up in sounding like Sean because I think that would've sort of got in my way if I'd have just situated all my work in that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in and I think that was the biggest help for me when creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is." [...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to be on the show was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was beyond my wildest dreams. Then when I found out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E
6000|$|Swenson {{interposed}} his tall figure. [...] "What do you want?" [...] he asked, bluntly. [...] "You don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> close. You've {{been talking}} to the ranger." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, Tatangelo had open-heart surgery. [...] "I {{still have}} many ideas, but {{physically}} the doctors don't <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> involved. I miss ... {{being able to}} sit down {{and trying to figure out}} problems. ..." [...] he told The Laredo Morning Times.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{not more}} than two or two and a half knots an hour. However, we are in no hurry. With a light wind like this, we don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> close to the shore, or we might have some of their gunboats coming out after us. I expect that in the morning, if the wind holds light, the captain will take in our upper sails, and just drift along. Then, after it gets dark, he will clap on everything; and run in so as to strike the coast a few miles above Malaga. Then we will take in sail, and anchor as close in as we dare. Anything coming along, then, will take us for a craft that has come out from Malaga." ...|$|E
50|$|The Cobequid Acadians {{were close}} to an Indian mission located where the Stewiacke meets the Shubenacadie; and which had been run, for many years, by Le Loutre. In January 1750, Le Loutre made an ever closer {{alliance}} with his native friends (the sworn allies of the French crown). This meant that the Acadians of Cobequid did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> friendly with the English.|$|E
5000|$|... "You {{can play}} it in octaves—single notes in both hands. Or you could double it up. When you're backing a singer, you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> intense. But when the horns {{come in on}} the mambo, you've got to cut through a little more. At that point, I'll double the octave in my right hand, while still playing a single note in the left. To get really intense, I'll play double octaves in both hands." ...|$|E
5000|$|Adrian: A {{normal human}} male who is {{unexpectedly}} {{thrown into a}} life with Conri. After saving the little cat-boy, he claims {{that he does not}} want nor will he ever want a pet. Little does Conri know that this decision resulted from the death of one of his past friends as they saved their pet. Because this experience was traumatic, he is distant—not really a bad person, just not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> attached <b>to</b> anyone or anything. He has a strange Indonesian neighbor who claims Adrian's favorite food is stinky bean paste, something that Conri strongly dislikes. Adrian's personality is honest, kind, generous, and understanding, though sometimes these traits are masked in hostility.|$|R

50|$|Simmons {{helped found}} “The Children Matter,” {{which is a}} {{collaborative}} initiative with the charity MATTER that fights to get kids around the world access to health care. “You have a cavity, {{you go to the}} dentist. Most of the children out there can’t do that. Bad eyesight, bad hearing, and it gets much, much worse,” Simmons said. “So I, along with Twin Cities charity MATTER, are going to change all that. And we don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> heavy-handed and try and make you cry about it. Let’s celebrate life but also do some good.” The Gene Simmons Band will headline a benefit concert for “The Children Matter” September of 2017 at the CHS Field in St. Paul.|$|E

But the closer they get, the more Abhay must struggle to resist his primal instincts.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the episode}} [...] "Distractions", Nathan {{receives}} a telephone call from Meredith Gordon, a woman in Texas with whom he once had a relationship. She informs him that their daughter Claire is still alive. Nathan assumes that her timing the call right before his election means that she wants money, and offers $100,000 to stay quiet, which she accepts;she later lies to Claire saying the amount is only $50,000 and Claire is entitled to half. In [...] "Run!", Nathan shows up to visit Meredith and deliver the money but states he does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> involved with Claire. Claire was secretly listening to the conversation which, due to lies Meredith told her, did not portray Nathan in a very positive light. At {{the end of the}} episode, back in Vegas, Jessica gets a call from Linderman saying that he wants Nathan assassinated.|$|E
5000|$|Corman got {{the idea}} for a sequel to the {{original}} film when he was being interviewed by an Italian journalist who remarked that The Hunger Games had similarities to Death Race 2000. Corman contacted Universal Pictures who had produced the modern remake (which Corman felt had jettisoned too much of the political commentary of the original) and discussed bringing back the dark satire of the original. Corman told them, [...] "You did a good job, but you’ve taken out the killing of the pedestrians and the broken-society themes." [...] Filming began when Corman was in his late eighties and during the US election. It features a businessman who is now president of America. Corman told an interviewer, “The president does have a hair style which could be approaching Trump’s hair style, but I don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> heavy into that, because Trump will come and go and the film will remain." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 23 May 2009, Paea was {{the subject}} of a {{controversial}} racial vilification dispute with Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks captain, Paul Gallen, late in the local derby played between the Dragons and Sharks. Gallen, who took objection to Paea accidentally stepping on his hand in a tackle, got up and called Paea a [...] "black cunt". Paea's angry response was caught by television cameras and microphones, but he did not wish to take the matter further after the match. After the match, Paea said, [...] "But then something told me to just forget about it and to just move on. Things happen on the field and you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> personal about it. But I've been getting different kinds of reactions. After the game I had my church friends sending me messages saying, 'You handled it really well, it was very Kingdom the way you dealt with it'. Then I had other mates saying, 'You should have smashed him'." ...|$|E

5000|$|On December 8, Yousef {{moved into}} the Doña Josefa Apartments under the alias [...] "Najy Awaita Haddad" [...] and purported {{himself to be a}} Moroccan. Edith Guerrera, the manager, laughed with the {{receptionist}} after the two men asked for new registration forms. [...] "Perhaps they have forgotten their names", she said as the first ones were torn up. Yousef had accidentally put his [...] "real name" [...] on the first form. He did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> discovered <b>too</b> early.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's the car!" [...] cried Hal. [...] "We'll have <b>to</b> be <b>getting</b> a move on, or Pat {{will lose}} his beauty sleep {{and be in}} no shape for to-morrow.

5000|$|The {{artist is}} {{actually}} creating his own storyboard for the film. I become the [...] "camera" [...] {{and look for}} angles, lighting, close-ups, wide angles, long shots-- just as a director does {{to tell the story}} in the most visually interesting way he can. My first sketches are as much composition and design ideas as they are character and action images... I dont <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> involved in the juicy parts since some of what Im doing will be modified or discarded as I get further involved in the storytelling. I then stand {{back and look at the}} page as a complete unit to make sure its designed well: [...] "Hmmm, three close-up panels in a row of characters talking. Better change that middle panel to a far shot. Maybe make that panel an open vignette." ...Then I place the facing pages together and look at how the spread holds together, and sometimes make changes based on that." ...|$|E
50|$|Back at Rashōmon gate (after the trial), the woodcutter {{explains}} to the commoner {{that all three}} stories were falsehoods. The woodcutter had actually witnessed the rape and murder, he says, but just did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> involved at the trial. According to the woodcutter's new story, Tajōmaru begged the samurai's wife to marry him, but the woman instead freed her husband. The husband was initially unwilling to fight Tajōmaru, saying he would not risk his life for a spoiled woman, but the woman then criticized both him and Tajōmaru, saying they were not real men and that a real man would fight for a woman's love. She spurred the men to fight one another, but then hid her face in fear once they raised swords; the men, too, were visibly fearful as they began fighting. They began a duel that was much more pitiful than Tajōmaru's account had made it sound, and Tajōmaru ultimately won through a stroke of luck. After some hesitation he killed the samurai, who begged for {{his life on the}} ground, and the woman fled in horror. Tajōmaru could not catch her, but took the samurai's sword and left the scene limping.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2015, it was {{confirmed}} that Thomson had left Holby City. Of leaving the show, Thomson stated [...] "I've loved {{every second of}} my time on Holby but, as an actor, I want to try new roles and don't ever <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> comfortable. I've really enjoyed playing Jonny and I'll remember him fondly - but I don't think even he could handle any more devastation in his life!" [...] Jonny left with Jac and their daughter Emma. Thomson explained that Jonny was ready for a new journey, after going through so much with Jac, Bonnie and his imprisonment. Before he leaves, Jonny confronted Guy Self (John Michie), as he blamed him for everything that had happened to him. Thomson later described the exit storyline with Guy as [...] "the most high stakes" [...] it had ever been for his character. Jonny departed on 7 April 2015, but made a guest appearance on 23 June 2015. In October 2015, it was mentioned that Jonny and Jac had broken up. Producer Simon Harper confirmed the off-screen split was [...] "perfectly amiable" [...] and that they were co-parenting Emma.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have made}} blasphemous efforts," [...] David confessed, [...] "but I {{certainly}} cannot call myself an expert. Perhaps {{what is known}} as the American spirit has rather interfered with my efforts. You see, we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> things done <b>too</b> quickly. Golf is a game eminently suited to the British temperament." ...|$|R
60|$|One evening, after tea, when Rollo was {{a pretty}} big boy, he came and began to climb up into his father's lap. When he had climbed up, he took his place astride of his father's knee, {{as if he were}} riding a horse. His little brother Nathan came up and stood near, <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up <b>too,</b> only there was not room. His cousin James was there, that evening, on a visit. He sat upon a cricket before the fire, and his mother was at the table doing some sort of work.|$|R
50|$|Cole {{was first}} seen {{at a party}} that Starr Manning and her friend Langston Wilde {{attended}} after being invited by some boys. When several boys at the party <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> intense with the girls, Cole stepped in and did so later when they received taunts from their enemy, Britney Jennings. Starr and Cole started <b>to</b> <b>get</b> closer, attending a dance together and sharing their first kiss. In November 2006, Cole had a steroid-induced outburst towards Starr, much to the thanks of Britney and football player Gabe, when they started to make out in a bedroom following a football after-party. Cole <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go further, but Starr did not. As a result, Cole completely lost it and began to trash the room. In this process, he ripped the front of Starr's shirt, by accident. The fight continued out into the kitchen, where Cole proceeded <b>to</b> <b>get</b> angry at many other people. When Starr just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go home, Britney wouldn't allow it and called the police, pretending to be Starr. When the police showed up at her home and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> question her about the events that took place, Starr hesitantly agreed. As the police questioned her, Cole and his mother arrived at the police station. Everyone was surprised when they realized who Cole's mother was, Marty Saybrooke.|$|R
50|$|I {{think the}} only other times I’ve gotten a regular check for doing work was when I had a {{syndicated}} feature with the Herald Tribune. And then a revival of that 30 years later. That was Poor Arnold’s Almanac... They {{had a very good}} comics editor. It was almost completely a writer’s syndicate. They had a few comics and the newer ones were B.C. by Johnny Hart and Mell Lazarus’ Miss Peach, which was very good also. It was sort of like Peanuts in a way, with bright little kids saying sophisticated things. But they had a few old-time things that they kept alive. I think one was called Mr. And Mrs. I can’t rattle them off. So Al sold them Tall Tales, and I sold them Poor Arnold’s Almanac, which ran two years. It was a Sunday only, which was why they canceled me. They wanted a daily. They said it makes the Sunday feature stronger. The Sunday feature was doing—not great, but well enough for me to make money. At that time I was living in England, and my magazine work and record album work was starting. I wasn’t in great haste to do a daily. But during one of my many moves, when I came back, I found that I had penciled a stack of dailies, but I was never going to ink them. I didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> locked up in the syndicate thing.|$|E

5000|$|Squee's {{next door}} {{neighbor}} is Johnny C, aka [...] "Nny" [...] (pronounced knee), the main character of the series. [...] "Nny" [...] regularly visits Squee late at night by breaking into his room. The series focused more on the 'mentoring' or 'big brother' aspect of [...] "Nny" [...] and Squee's relationship, but little interaction occurs in Squee!, aside from the occasional drawing or note left in Squee's room, or short references to 'the crazy neighbor man' (he does appear as an out-patient of [...] "Defective Head Meat Institute", who Squee is oddly pleased to see). Squee has only one friend, albeit a possibly imaginary one, the dilapidated teddy bear affectionately referred to as Shmee. Only one real person makes any attempt to befriend Squee, a boy named Pepito {{who happens to be}} the Antichrist. During the course of the series, Squee encounters a killer chihuahua (that fatally mauls the only classmate who was friendly to him), zombified classmates, sporting mishaps, alien abductions, near recruitment into Satan's army, an encounter with his future self, a ghostly visitor, a giant murderous dust mite, and eventual committal to a mental institution despite being one of the most sane characters in the comic. These experiences lead him to remark to a 'lamb-baby-dog-thing' in one strip that some bitter cartoonist must be drawing his life and therefore he doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> attached to anyone or anything in it.|$|E
