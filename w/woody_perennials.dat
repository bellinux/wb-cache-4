50|$|Annual and {{perennial}} {{species are}} known to respond to selection in different ways. For instance, annual domesticates tend to experience more severe genetic bottlenecks than perennial species, which, at least in those clonally propagated, {{are more prone to}} continuation of somatic mutations. Cultivated <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> are also known for their longer generation time, outcrossing with wild species (introducing new genetic variation), and variety of geographic origin. Some <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> (e.g., grapes or fruit trees) also have a secondary source of genetic variation within their rootstock (base to which the above-ground portion, the scion, is grafted).|$|E

50|$|Not {{commonly}} encountered, crop-over-tree systems employ <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> in {{the role}} of a cover crop. For this, small shrubs or trees pruned to near ground level are utilized. The purpose, as with any cover crop, is to increase in-soil nutrients and/or to reduce soil erosion.|$|E

50|$|It {{has also}} been found that the removal of feral goats leads {{to a decline in}} {{introduced}} annual grasses and an increase in native <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> and introduced fire-promoting perennial grasses.

50|$|Analog {{forestry}} is {{a system}} of silviculture that seeks to design, plan and manage ecosystems dominated by <b>woody</b> <b>perennials.</b> It has been primarily employed in tropical or subtropical areas, but {{can be used in}} temperate areas too. The design seeks to mimic the architectural structure and ecological function of the preexisting climax vegetation of the area, and can be designed to provide economic, social and environmental benefits.|$|E
50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{propagation}} that are successful but not widely used for commercial production include grafting and tissue culture. Stock for grafting is vigorous {{and as such}} is labour-intensive in constant control of stock regrowth from the lignotuber.

Rootstock and scion combinations are used for many <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> to provide the necessary mix of floral or fruit characteristics and cultural requirements.|$|E
50|$|Artificial {{selection}} {{seems to}} have favored the annual habit, {{at least in the}} case of herbaceous species, likely due to fast generation time and therefore a quick response to domestication and improvement efforts. However, <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> also exemplify a major group of crops, especially fruit trees and nuts. High yield herbaceous perennial grain or seed crops, however, are virtually nonexistent, despite potential agronomic benefits. Several common herbaceous perennial fruit, herbs, and vegetables exist, however; see perennial plants for a list.|$|E

50|$|Paratylenchus hamatus, the fig pin nematode, is a migratory plant endoparasite, {{that causes}} lesions on plant roots {{resulting}} in symptoms of chlorosis, wilting and ultimtely yield losses (6,12). They move and feed on {{different parts of}} host tissue throughout their life cycle {{in order to find}} enough susceptible host tissue to survive and reproduce (7). A wide range of host plant species are susceptible to the fig pin nematode, including many valuable fruit and vegetable crops such as figs, carrots and celery (5,13). They are also commonly found associated with <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> in California (10). P. hamatus inhabits soils in both Europe and North America, and was originally isolated from fig in central California in 1950 (1).|$|E
50|$|Dorstenia is a predominately Old and New World {{plant genus}} {{within the family}} Moraceae, {{but there is one}} Dorstenia species that is located in Indonesia and South Asia. There are 105 species within this genus that are fairly equally {{distributed}} between the Afrotropics and Neotropics, second only in number to the Ficus genera in Moraceae, but Dorstenia is unique when compared to other members of the Moraceae because of their extremely diverse growth habits and life forms. The majority of the Moraceae is <b>woody</b> <b>perennials,</b> while Dorstenia is dominated by herbaceous, succulent, or suffrutescent perennials, and only 10% exhibit the typical woody habit of the Moraceae. Dorstenia also have a striking reproductive structure composed of clusters of bisexual flowers on disc-shaped receptacles that are often adorned with variable size and shape bracts. Like most members of the Moraceae, Dorstenia have drupe fruits like peaches (peaches are {{not a member of the}} Moraceae), but another special feature of Dorstenia drupes is that they explode to release the seed. The seeds are usually small with a minuscule endosperm. The Dorstenia genus is also well known by indigenous people in the tropics as a medicinal plant with numerous flavonoid compounds that have anti-microbial, anti-reverse transcriptase, and anti-inflammatory effects.|$|E

40|$|A highly {{effective}} and versatile {{technology for the}} isolation of RNAs from grapevines and other <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> for use in virus diagnostics Huogen Xiao 1, Won-Sik Kim 2 and Baozhong Meng 1 * Background: Isolation of pure RNA from <b>woody</b> <b>perennials,</b> especially fruit crops such as grapevine rich in complex secondary metabolites, has remained very challenging. Lack of effective RNA isolation technology has resulted in difficulties in viral diagnosis and discovery as well as studies on many biological processes of these highly important woody plants. It is imperative to develop and refine methodologies with which large amounts of pure nucleic acids can be readily isolated from <b>woody</b> <b>perennials.</b> Methods: We compared five commonly used RNA isolation kits in isolating total RNA from twelve species of <b>woody</b> <b>perennials.</b> We made modifications to select RNA isolation systems to simplify and improve their efficiency in RNA isolation. The yield and quality of isolated RNAs were assessed via gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometric measurement. We also performed RT-PCR and RT-qPCR to detect several major viruses from grapevines...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: <b>Woody</b> <b>perennials</b> can be {{difficult}} to establish on harsh soils in arid and semi-arid regions. Historically, technological advances have focussed on methods to improve transplanting and direct-seeding but the available information on these advances remains fragmented and the edaphic factors have been largely ignored. This review explores the literature on plant establishment and identifies soil properties that limit plant response in harsh environments. Conclusions: We reveal that some <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> are particularly well-adapted to dry conditions and can also help reclaim degraded landscapes. Furthermore, the environmental and phenological factors that limit the success of direct seeding are well understood but the edaphic factors are not. For example, seedbed preparation and subsoil amelioration before seeding have not been evaluated in dry regions. Seed-priming and seed-placement are also poorly understood, as is the tolerance of <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> to different salt types in waterlogged soils of extreme pH and high soil strength. The reason why <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> can penetrate strong, hard soils is not obvious from the literature. They apparently cannot exert root growth pressures of the same magnitude as domesticated plants, so they must be able to exploit soil biopores and cracks more efficiently. Other gaps in our understanding of the soil factors that limit woody perennial establishment on hostile soils are identified. ...|$|E

40|$|Strigolactones are a {{new class}} of plant hormones that {{play a key role in}} {{regulating}} shoot branching. Studies of branching mutants in Arabidopsis, pea, rice and petunia have identified several key genes involved in strigolactone biosynthesis or signaling pathway. In the model plant Arabidopsis, MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 1 (MAX 1), MAX 2, MAX 3 and MAX 4 are four founding members of strigolactone pathway genes. However, little is known about the strigolactone pathway genes in the <b>woody</b> <b>perennial</b> plants. Here we report the identification of MAX homologues in the woody model plant Populus trichocarpa. We identified the sequence homologues for each MAX protein in P. trichocarpa. Gene expression analysis revealed that Populus MAX paralogous genes are differentially expressed across various tissues and organs. Furthermore, we showed that Populus MAX genes could complement or partially complement the shoot branching phenotypes of the corresponding Arabidopsis max mutants. This study provides genetic evidence that strigolactone pathway genes are likely conserved in the <b>woody</b> <b>perennial</b> plants and lays a foundation for further characterization of strigolactone pathway and its functions in the <b>woody</b> <b>perennial</b> plants...|$|R
