25|$|Some engines {{were given}} 'significant numbers' for {{publicity}} purposes, e.g. the experimental <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boiler locomotive was allocated 10000, and the 'P2' class started at 2001.|$|E
25|$|The Reed <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boiler was {{a type of}} <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boiler {{developed}} by J.W. Reed, manager of the engine works at Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company of Jarrow, England, where it was manufactured from 1893 to 1905. Intended {{for use in the}} steam propulsion of ships, it was similar to other boilers such as the Normand and Yarrow, themselves developments of the du Temple boiler. About 170of Reed's boilers were installed in ships of the Royal Navy, in two of which they were installed to replace boilers rejected by the Admiralty.|$|E
25|$|The undertype had {{the steam}} engine mounted under the boiler, usually between the frames of the chassis. The boiler was usually mounted well forward and {{was often a}} {{vertical}} and/or <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> type.|$|E

5000|$|A {{steam drum}} is a {{standard}} feature of a water-tube boiler. It is a reservoir of water/steam at the top end of the <b>water</b> <b>tubes.</b> The drum stores the steam generated in the <b>water</b> <b>tubes</b> and acts as a phase-separator for the steam/water mixture. The difference in densities between hot and cold water helps in the accumulation of the [...] "hotter"-water/and saturated-steam into the steam-drum.|$|R
2500|$|The iron works: {{the four}} boilerplates (with {{vertical}} <b>water</b> <b>tubes</b> and three drums) and their chimneys ("Prat" [...] type), the catwalk above {{them and the}} helix stairs was contracted to Anonima Pignone in February 1934.|$|R

25|$|Babcock & Wilcox {{was founded}} in 1867 and gained early fame with its <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boilers. The company built and put into service the first black liquor {{recovery}} boiler {{in the world in}} 1929. This was soon followed by a unit with completely water cooled furnace at Windsor Mills in 1934. After reverberatory and rotating furnaces the recovery boiler was on its way.|$|E
25|$|She was {{propelled}} by three Yarrow type 250 pound {{per square inch}} <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boilers, powering Brown-Curtis geared independent oil fuelled steam turbines developing 27,120 SHP and driving two screws at 260 RPM for a maximum designed speed of 34 knots. She was oil-fired and had a bunkerage of 320 to 350 tons. This gave a range of between 3500 nautical miles at 15 knots to 900 nautical miles at 32 knots.|$|E
5|$|The {{water wheel}} was about 30 chi in diameter, with ten bamboo <b>watering</b> <b>tubes</b> {{fastened}} at its perimeter. Some farmers even used three stage watering wheels to lift {{water to a}} height of over 30 chi.|$|R
50|$|There were, and are, many {{different}} designs of firebox for stationary boilers. In flue-type boilers (e.g. the Lancashire boiler) the flues themselves form the firebox. In water-tube boilers, the firebox {{is usually a}} firebrick-lined compartment below the <b>water</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Later Ofeldt also {{designed}} {{a more conventional}} steam-generating water-tube steam boiler. This {{was similar to the}} [...] "Lune Valley" [...] pattern, a central drum surrounded by coiled <b>water</b> <b>tubes,</b> but with irregular wedge-shaped coils rather than a simple circle.|$|R
25|$|In the {{presidency}} of Daniel Willard, the motive power department, headed by Col. George H. Emerson, entered on {{a long series of}} experiments intended to improve the performance of the steam locomotive. Particular emphasis was placed on the <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boiler, as opposed to the fire tube boiler used from the earliest days of steam. (In practice, only the firebox used water tubes.) The culmination of these experiments was the duplex #5600 George H. Emerson, the first of its kind. It was to be succeeded by a visionary locomotive of a unique design, of which very little was built before the whole project was cancelled.|$|E
500|$|Karlsruhe and Rostock were {{powered by}} {{two sets of}} Marine-type steam turbines, each of which drove a three-bladed screw [...] in diameter. Each turbine was divided into its own engine room; steam was {{supplied}} by twelve coal-fired <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boilers and two oil-fired double-ended <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boilers split into five boiler rooms.

The electrical power plant comprised four diesel generators that provided 520kilowatts and two emergency generators that provided 100kW each. The total power output was 2,280kW at 230volts.|$|E
50|$|The {{small size}} of the <b>water</b> <b>tubes</b> allows for much higher {{pressures}} than those of larger boilers, because of this, the water {{is not allowed to}} boil. Instead, it is allowed to reach supercritical temperature of up to 1200 °F.|$|R
50|$|When Hyde {{placed the}} order for these locomotives, he {{specified}} fireboxes equipped with Drummond <b>water</b> <b>tubes.</b> This involved {{the installation of}} crossing <b>water</b> <b>tubes</b> into the firebox, as featured on the London and South Western Railway's T9 Class and L11 Class, {{in an attempt to}} increase the heating surface area of the water, albeit at the cost of increased boiler complexity. The tubes were arranged in two clusters and angled to aid circulation. Visible exterior evidence of the presence of Drummond tubes was the two offset rectangular inspection covers attached to the sides of the firebox. They contained stay plugs, serving stays which extended through the tubes from cover to cover through the firebox.|$|R
50|$|Four more (nos. 18 to 21) were {{supplied}} by Dübs in 1902. These omitted the watercart tenders but had another Drummond family speciality - cross <b>water</b> <b>tubes</b> in the firebox. No 21 is recorded as retaining this boiler in unmodified form until 1934.|$|R
500|$|She {{was armed}} with a QF 12-pounder gun located in the forward gun position; five QF 6-pounder guns, four of which were {{arranged}} along her sides and one located centrally towards her stern as a rear gun; {{and a pair of}} [...] torpedo tubes on a horizontally rotating mount located on deck towards the stern, ahead of the rear gun. Admiralty specifications in force {{at the time of her}} construction required that she should be able to steam at 30knots, and from this she was one of a group of torpedo boat destroyers known informally as [...] "30-knotters". Spitefuls propulsion was through two propellers, each driven by one of two triple expansion steam engines that were powered by four coal-fired Reed <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boilers operated at 250pounds per square inch (1,724kilopascals). In ships of her type the boilers were installed in a line fore-and-aft and in pairs, so that in each pair the furnace doors faced each other: thus one group of stokers could tend two boilers simultaneously, and only two boiler rooms, also known as stokeholds, were required. In sea trials it was found that, when run at 29.9knots, she consumed [...] of coal per indicated horsepower(IHP) per hour, which was considered low, and a speed of 30.371knots was [...] "easily maintained". At 13.05knots it was found that her capacity of about 116tons (118tonnes) of coal, consumed at a rate of [...] per IHP per hour, gave her a steaming range of about 4,000nautical miles.|$|E
2500|$|The boiler was an Almy type <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boiler, {{built by}} the Almy <b>Water</b> <b>Tube</b> Boiler Company, of Providence, Rhode Island. [...] It could be fired by either wood or coal. [...] The boiler was shipped from Providence on March 31, 1905 to Montague, California by rail, and then hauled {{overland}} by a wagon and team to Klamath Falls.|$|E
2500|$|Reed <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boilers were a [...] "speciality" [...] of {{the engine}} works at Palmers, which was capable of {{producing}} one [...] "heavy marine boiler" [...] a week, besides [...] "a large number of <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boilers". While equipment designed by Reed was used in merchant ships, for example the SSHanoi built in Sunderland in 1893 for the French mail service between Haiphong in Vietnam and Hong Kong in China, about 170of his <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boilers were used in ships of the Royal Navy. These included cruisers, destroyers and gunboats, besides torpedo boat destroyers, of which Palmers alone built 16. Among these was Spiteful, in which the boilers were later adapted to burn fuel oil. Reed boilers were also installed in ships ordered by the Admiralty and built in Scotland by shipyards on the River Clyde. Two torpedo boat destroyers built by Hanna, Donald & Wilson of Paisley, [...] and , both launched in 1895, were fitted with four Reed boilers each by order of the Admiralty and {{at a cost of}} £14,200, after it rejected the locomotive boilers installed by their builders. Production of the Reed <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boiler ceased in 1905.|$|E
5000|$|Differences {{between these}} types of boiler are in the {{arrangement}} of their <b>water</b> <b>tubes.</b> They all share the same basic layout. The outer casing of the boiler is of steel plates, lined with firebrick, and plays no part in their heating area.|$|R
50|$|Copper <b>water</b> <b>tubes</b> are {{susceptible}} to cold water pitting caused by contamination of the pipe interior, typically with soldering flux; erosion corrosion caused by high speed or turbulent flow; and stray current corrosion, caused by poor electrical wiring technique, such as improper grounding and bonding.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>water</b> <b>tubes</b> are long, {{numerous}} and of 2 in diameter, or smaller. This gives an extremely large heating area, and so good steam raising capabilities. [...] "A maximum fire surface is obtained {{in a given}} space, and great economies in fuel are thereby made possible." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{power plant}} {{consisted}} of twin triple-expansion steam engines and two Yarrow <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boilers. [...] The ship had twin propellers. [...] The maximum speed was about 15.5 knots but this required firing of both boilers and {{was reserved for}} special occasions. [...] Normal speed was 13 knots, and one boiler was sufficient for this.|$|E
2500|$|She was {{powered by}} four Parsons {{turbines}}, that were built by Denny's.

The vast majority of copper systems far exceed this time period but a small minority may fail after a comparatively short time.|$|R
50|$|Fire-tube boiler with Water-tube firebox. Sometimes the two above types {{have been}} {{combined}} {{in the following}} manner: the firebox contains an assembly of <b>water</b> <b>tubes,</b> called thermic siphons.

2500|$|The Reed <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> boiler was {{developed}} and patented in 1893 by J.W. Reed, manager of the engine works at Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, which manufactured it. It was similar to its antecedent the duTemple boiler, and other developments from it such as the Normand and Yarrow boilers, in that each featured three cylindrical water chambers arranged to form a triangle or, viewed from one end, an inverted [...] "V" [...] shape: the top chamber collected steam, and was connected by two banks of steam-generating tubes to the two lower chambers, between which was a furnace.|$|E
50|$|They are characterised by single {{steam and}} water drums {{vertically}} above each other, with curved vertical <b>water</b> <b>tubes</b> {{to the sides}} forming an overall cylindrical volume. There is no grate {{at the base of}} this furnace space, so they are fired by liquid burners, oil or gas, rather than a solid fuel furnace producing ash.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fundamental}} {{characteristic of the}} [...] "three-drum" [...] design is the arrangement of a steam drum above two water drums, in a triangular layout. <b>Water</b> <b>tubes</b> fill in {{the two sides of}} this triangle between the drums, and the furnace is in the centre. The whole assembly is then enclosed in a casing, leading to the exhaust flue.|$|R
