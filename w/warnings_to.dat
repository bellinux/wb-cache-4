He met with many conservative Republican senators, and based on assurances he gave them, he was recommended for the Judiciary Committee's chairmanship in late 2004. He officially assumed that position when the 109th Congress convened on January 4, 2005.|$|E

In {{the aftermath of the}} riot, there was extensive media attention on Fremantle Prison, and investigative journalists uncovered prior <b>warnings</b> <b>to</b> the prison authorities of the risk of such an event. The government hastily initiated an enquiry into the incident, and a report was completed within six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are {{generally}} small birds with rounded wings and strong legs. They have mostly sombre grey, white, brown and rufous plumage, which is sexually dimorphic in pattern and colouring.

Gamede killed two on Mauritius, including one who drowned in high waves.|$|E
5|$|The {{speakers}} {{for modern}} sirens can be {{integral to the}} lightbar, {{or they may be}} hidden in or flush to the grill to reduce noise inside the ambulance that may interfere with patient care and radio communications.

5|$|While Connie was {{meandering}} in {{the western}} Atlantic Ocean, its potential track posed problems for forecasters. On August7, a hurricane warning was issued from North Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia, with a hurricane alert further north to New York City. The Weather Bureau later extended the hurricane <b>warnings</b> <b>to</b> Delaware Breakwater, with storm warnings further northeast to Provincetown, Massachusetts. The alert for North Carolina was up for about three days until Connie moved inland.|$|E

5|$|A second, {{far smaller}} storm cell passed along a similar {{route to the}} first {{later in the evening}} of 14 April. This cell was never given the {{classification}} of 'severe' by the Bureau of Meteorology, nor did it develop into a supercell like its predecessor. Therefore, the route of the second cell was more direct and predictable than the first, following the general movement of the cold front (see conditions and climatology), and the Bureau of Meteorology issued <b>warnings</b> <b>to</b> all residents in the second cell's projected path to expect further storm activity.|$|E
5|$|Each {{city and}} county in the Metro service area has similar {{ordinances}} that regulate or prohibit vending on Metro-owned property, and which prohibit riders from eating, drinking, or smoking in Metro trains, buses, and stations; the Transit Police {{have a reputation for}} enforcing these laws rigorously. One widely publicized incident occurred in October 2000 when police arrested 12-year-old Ansche Hedgepeth for eating french fries in the Tenleytown-AU station. In a 2004 opinion by John Roberts, now Chief Justice of the United States, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Hedgepeth's arrest. By then WMATA had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing <b>warnings</b> <b>to</b> juveniles, and arresting them only after three violations within a year.|$|E
5|$|Residents in some {{portions}} of the country became angry {{due to lack of}} assistance. In the town of Lazaro Cardenas in Tabasco, residents opened ditches to alleviate flooding on their streets, which flooding thousands of vehicles along a section of highway near the state's capital, Villahermosa. In the capital city, which remained submerged by floodwaters for a week, residents protested the sandbagging efforts after waters were redirected to some neighborhoods. Due to the protests, police officers beat and arrested 100people. The Federal Consumer Protection Agency issued <b>warnings</b> <b>to</b> businesses accused of price gouging for water and other basic products. Isolated villages experienced food shortages due to cut off roads.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time the People's Republic of China entered the {{conflict}} after issuing several <b>warnings</b> <b>to</b> the United Nations. On 19 October 1950, large formations of Chinese troops, dubbed the People's Volunteer Army (PVA), secretly crossed the border and into North Korea. One of the first Chinese units to reach the Chosin Reservoir area was the PVA 42nd Corps, and it was tasked with stopping the eastern UN advances. On 25 October, the advancing ROK I Corps made contact with the Chinese and halted at Funchilin Pass, south of the Chosin Reservoir. After the landing at Wonsan, the US 1st Marine Division of the X Corps engaged the defending PVA 124th Division on 2 November, and the ensuing battle caused heavy casualties among the Chinese. On 6 November, the PVA 42nd Corps ordered a retreat to the north with the intention of luring the UN forces into the Chosin Reservoir. By 24 November, the 1st Marine Division occupied both Sinhung-ni on {{the eastern side of the}} reservoir, and Yudami-ni on the west side of the reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{development}} of the tropical depression, forecasters issued a tropical storm warning for parts of the Texas coast. When the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay, the warnings were extended from Matagorda, Texas to coastal Louisiana. On September 8, forecasters extended the <b>warnings</b> <b>to</b> Port Aransas, Texas, and areas from Port O'Connor to High Island, Texas were put under a hurricane watch as the storm was forecast to reach hurricane strength before making landfall. However, the hurricane watch for those areas were discontinued when Fay failed to reach hurricane strength. In addition, coastal Texas as well as coastal Louisiana were under a coastal flood warning, while parts of inland Texas were under flash flood warnings and flood warnings.|$|E
5|$|Early on December 5, RSMC Nadi {{started to}} issue special weather bulletins on Cyclone Daman as a {{tropical}} cyclone gale warning had been issued for the Fijian dependency of Rotuma. Later that morning, as the Cyclone moved over Rotuma, RSMC Nadi issued a tropical cyclone alert {{for the rest}} of Fiji. During that afternoon, RSMC Nadi canceled the tropical cyclone gale warning for Rotuma and then upgraded the cyclone alerts for the northwest of Fiji to a tropical cyclone gale warning later that day. Early the next day, as the storm was intensifying, they upgraded the gale warnings for parts of northwest of Fiji to storm warnings while expanding the <b>warnings</b> <b>to</b> the western and central sides of Viti Levu and the western side of Vanua Levu. During that afternoon RSMC Nadi further revised the warnings as Cyclone Daman had become a severe tropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible <b>warnings</b> <b>to</b> alert road users.|$|E
5|$|Eruptions on Mauna Loa {{are almost}} always preceded and {{accompanied}} by prolonged episodes of seismic activity, the monitoring {{of which was the}} primary and often only warning mechanism in the past and which remains viable today. Seismic stations have been maintained on Hawaiʻi since the Observatory's inception, but these were concentrated primarily on Kīlauea, with coverage on Mauna Loa improving only slowly through the 20th century. Following the invention of modern monitoring equipment, the backbone of the present-day monitoring system was installed on the volcano in the 1970s. Mauna Loa's July 1975 eruption was forewarned by {{more than a year of}} seismic unrest, with the HVO issuing <b>warnings</b> <b>to</b> the general public from late 1974; the 1984 eruption was similarly preceded by as much as three years of unusually high seismic activity, with volcanologists predicting an eruption within two years in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Oxford were pre-race favourites, {{and won the}} toss, electing {{to start}} the race from the Surrey station.

Oxford attempted to find a quicker racing line and were still in touch, but Cambridge inched away from them, passing the finishing post one-and-a-third lengths ahead in a time of 17 minutes 35 seconds.|$|E
