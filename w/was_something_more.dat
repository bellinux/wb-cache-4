5|$|More than anything, {{they just}} made me laugh. I couldn't believe I'd walked into this situation. You didn't care {{if they were in}} time with the dance steps or whether one was {{overweight}} or one wasn't as good as the others. It <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more.</b> It just made you feel happy. Like great pop records.|$|E
25|$|A slight {{concussion}} {{warned the}} crowd that there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> perilous than sulphur alone in the burning pile. A second slight explosion did not warn the firemen and surrounding crowds. A third passed unheeded even.|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} for Butterfly, Carey {{was in the}} midst of her separation from then husband, Tommy Mottola. While writing the material for the album, she wrote a house music record titled [...] "Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)" [...] with David Morales. When the song was finished, Carey felt there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> she could do with the song; the lyrics were very personal and a perfect fit for a ballad. After contemplating on the matter, Carey re-wrote [...] "Fly Away" [...] in ballad form, and incorporated new lyrics and vocals.|$|E
60|$|The lad {{burst out}} laughing, {{and said that}} he wished it <b>were</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> useful.|$|R
5000|$|Asher - The series protagonist. He is a fisherman's {{son from}} an {{outlying}} village, destined to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more.</b>|$|R
60|$|Joh. There must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> in't; {{for your}} {{conscience}} {{was very quiet}} when you took me for Morayma.|$|R
2500|$|A design {{competition}} held in 2009 called for designs for an [...] "Olympic tower". It received about 50 submissions. Johnson {{has said that}} his early concept for the project <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> modest than Orbit, {{along the lines of}} [...] "a kind of 21st-century Trajan's Column", but this was dropped when more daring ideas were received.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{factor that}} may have ignited the {{violence}} was an announcement {{of the murder of}} two Azerbaijanis. On February 27, Soviet Deputy Federal Procurator, Aleksandr Katusev, announced on Baku Radio and Central Television, that two Azerbaijani youths, Bakhtiyar Guliyev and Ali Hajiyev, were killed in a clash between Armenians and Azerbaijanis near Agdam several days earlier [...] One of the youth was killed by an Azerbaijani police officer, but Katusev neglected to mention that and would later receive a stinging rebuke for revealing the nationalities of the young men. [...] The secretive nature the Soviet Union was still attempting to shake off led many Azerbaijanis to believe that there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> nefarious to Katusev's report than he led on.|$|E
2500|$|In Japan, Famitsu {{gave it a}} {{score of}} one eight, one nine, one ten, and one nine {{for a total of}} 36 out of 40. One {{reviewer}} said, [...] "The way you participate in events and run races on public roads serves well as a new direction for the series. [...] Earning popularity for things like drifting and other stuff makes it fun to just drive around, but I still wish there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> unique to this game. I have to give top marks to the graphics and ease of play, though." [...] Another reviewer stated, [...] "This used to be a really stoic racing simulator, but this is more of a driving game designed to be easy to pick up. I feel like the controls are more forgiving, too, and the open-world freedom makes the whole thing a lot more approachable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more,</b> I think." [...] And Mrs. March {{smoothed}} the soft cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I understand. Nevertheless, this <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than trance. So far as I can determine, {{this body}} is without a tenant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'This <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than common drivelling,' said Ralph, after {{listening}} with a curled lip {{to the old}} sinner's raptures. 'The girl's name?' ...|$|R
2500|$|President Chen and Vice President Lu were {{standing}} {{in the back seat of}} an open convertible Jeep moving slowly through a crowded street when around 1:45 PM, a bullet penetrated the windshield of the vehicle, grazed Chen's stomach, and was stopped in his clothes. Chen received a flesh wound [...] long and [...] wide. The other bullet penetrated the windshield and hit a cast on Lu's knee which she was wearing due to an earlier injury and was later found in the vehicle. At first both believed that they had been hit by firecrackers, which are common in Taiwanese political parades and rallies. Chen realized that it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> serious when he noticed that he was bleeding from the abdomen and that there was a bullet hole in the window. Chen reported pain in his abdomen and Lu reported pain in her knee and they were taken to the Chi-Mei Hospital. At 3:30 pm, the spokesperson for the president, Chiou I-jen, announced that the [...] "National Security Mechanism" [...] had been activated. By 5:30 pm, both the Pan-Blue and Pan-Green coalitions announced that they would cease all scheduled campaigning activities.|$|E
6000|$|Courtland {{looked at}} him sharply. [...] "Then there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than WORDS passed between him and you, Cato. What happened? Come, speak out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, {{a motive}} had been established. 'Seek him whom the crime benefits,' say our French confr√®res. But there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than that.|$|E
5000|$|Driven by a piano {{melody and}} mid-tempo percussion, the ballad {{is focused on}} Vesely's vocals, as he wails about self-revelation and purpose in life: [...] "There must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more.</b> Do we know what we're {{fighting}} for?... I fooled everyone and now what will I become? I have to start this over... There must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more.</b> Do we know what we're fighting for?", the hypnotic ballad reflects on learning how to forgive and move on from a shattered relationship.|$|R
6000|$|Melville was spiteful. [...] "Yes," [...] he admitted, [...] "but I {{thought your}} little {{movement}} <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than party politics and self-advancement----?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{staggered}} slightly, however, {{and a short}} [...] "Humph!" [...] {{from the}} policeman showed that he believed the youth to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than giddy.|$|R
6000|$|Randal {{drew back}} a step. Mrs. Presty's audacity <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> {{than he could}} understand. [...] "Is this woman mad?" [...] he said to himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} I half guessed there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than mere {{gratitude}} in Jeanne's heart when she flamed out just now; did not you, mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{knew that}} he was trying to keep her from going, trying to {{indicate}} that he <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than a person to whom one brought trousers for pressing. He besought: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is a true}} revelation, {{as far as it}} goes; {{but there}} <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more.</b> I have {{received}} this letter, and I wanted to say--something.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Convalescent? But {{those three}} braves yonder <b>are</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than convalescent. They are {{as well as}} I am. Why do they not rejoin the troops?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{spoke to}} you last Sunday on this text. But there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> in it, which I had not time {{to speak of}} then.|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely. But it {{was also}} my sense of that virtue in him, and it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> besides." [...] And he spoke with sudden intensity. [...] "I couldn't {{talk to him about}} her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you well, Seignior Quentin?" [...] {{said the}} Countess Isabelle, {{in a tone}} of {{interest}} at which she herself blushed, while she felt that it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than the distance between them warranted.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked up}} in her eyes. There was permission: there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more,</b> that was {{flattering}} to his vanity. He took the wine-glass, and, slowly and in silence, filled it from the mysterious flask.|$|E
60|$|Concho (aside). There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> in {{this than}} Don Jose would have known. I'll watch Diego, {{and keep an}} eye on Miss Jovita too.|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> in that pile of stones, Cassandra," [...] {{she said}} to the jet-black maiden at her elbow, [...] "that could make me wish it had <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than a mill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There was, {{or should}} have <b>been,</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than that in our proposal, please your Majesty,' said Sir Richard. 'There was a {{condition}} annexed to it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|We now went to bed, {{placing the}} crib {{close to my}} wife's pillow. All this turmoil had worn upon me, and within two minutes I <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than half asleep. Mrs. McWilliams roused me: ...|$|E
60|$|My absence at {{this time}} <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than an annoyance--it was a downright grief to my blind Lucilla. On the morning of my departure, she clung {{to me as if}} she was {{determined}} not to let me go.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very much," [...] our visitor said, {{with the}} fine irony {{characteristic}} of him. [...] "All the more because I hadn't expected {{that sort of}} thing of you. What I have expected of you hitherto <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> of the major morality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but life}} should <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than {{pleasant}}," [...] said Job, who always looked discontented; [...] "an ox in a pasture has a pleasant life." ...|$|R
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. God grant it! God grant it! [Buries {{his face}} in his hands.] But there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> I have to tell you, Arthur.|$|R
6000|$|... "To me," [...] he announced, [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> {{satisfying}} about {{a meal of}} {{this description}} than that two-franc dinner where you stole my chicken." ...|$|R
