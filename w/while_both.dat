5|$|In {{order to}} run safely on {{multiprocessor}} machines, access to shared resources (like files, data structures) must be serialized so that threads or processes do {{not attempt to}} modify the same resource at the same time. In order to prevent multiple threads from accessing or modifying a shared resource simultaneously, DragonFly employs critical sections, and serializing tokens to prevent concurrent access. <b>While</b> <b>both</b> Linux and FreeBSD 5 employ fine-grained mutex models to achieve higher performance on multiprocessor systems, DragonFly does not. Until recently, DragonFly also employed spls, but these were replaced with critical sections.|$|E
