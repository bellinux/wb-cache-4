5|$|A Coast Guard {{detachment}} {{aboard the}} Fife confirmed {{that it was}} properly flying the U.S. flag. The Coast Guard was suspicious since the ship was low in the water, suggesting it was carrying heavy cargo, yet there were no cranes or other equipment that a legitimate fishing vessel {{would be expected to}} have. Instead there were several large shipping containers. Via radio, they asked the Joint Interagency Task Force West, a consortium of various federal law enforcement agencies, for permission to investigate further, since smugglers and drug traffickers <b>were</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> use that route.|$|E
5|$|After antiquity, {{mention of}} lead {{poisoning}} was absent from medical literature {{until the end}} of the Middle Ages. In 1656 the German physician Samuel Stockhausen recognized dust and fumes containing lead compounds as the cause of disease, called since ancient Roman times morbi metallici, that <b>were</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> afflict miners, smelter workers, potters, and others whose work exposed them to the metal.|$|E
5|$|Although quick {{draw and}} hip {{shooting}} {{was an important}} skill in the West, {{only a handful of}} historically known gunslingers <b>were</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> be fast, such as Luke Short, John Wesley Hardin, Wild Bill Hickok, Doc Holliday, and Billy the Kid. Shooting a pistol with one hand is normally associated with gunslingers, and is also a standard for them of the era to carry two guns and fire ambidextrously. Capt. Jonathan R. Davis carried two revolvers in his iconic gunfight, while Jesse James himself carried over half a dozen revolvers in many of his gunfights.|$|E

When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized a new form of lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{bonds between}} atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the {{interactions}} between their constituent electrons. As the chemical properties of the elements <b>were</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law, in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir suggested {{that this could be}} explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus.|$|E

5|$|Doubts about Oppenheimer's loyalty dated {{back to the}} 1930s, when he was {{a member}} of {{numerous}} Communist front organizations, and was associated with Communist Party USA members, including his wife and his brother. These associations <b>were</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> Army Counter-intelligence at the time he was made director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1942, and chairman of the influential General Advisory Committee of the AEC in 1947. In this capacity Oppenheimer became involved in bureaucratic conflict between the Army and Air Force over the types of nuclear weapons the country required, technical conflict between the scientists over the feasibility of the hydrogen bomb, and personal conflict with AEC commissioner Lewis Strauss.|$|E
5|$|Fireworks: Fireworks first {{appeared}} in China during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), in the early age of gunpowder. The common people in the Song era could purchase simple fireworks from market vendors; these were made of sticks of bamboo packed with gunpowder, although grander displays <b>were</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> be held. Rocket propulsion was soon applied to warfare, {{and by the time}} of the mid 14th century there were many types of rocket launchers available.|$|E
5|$|Gaylussacia brachycera {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from {{other members of}} its genus by its leaves: they resemble those of boxwood (hence its name) and lack the resin glands typical of huckleberries. Like its relatives, it bears white urn-shaped flowers in the early summer, which develop to blue, edible berries in late summer. It is mostly found in Appalachia; many of its stations there <b>were</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> natives, who picked and ate the berries, before botanists became aware {{of them in the}} 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus has {{documented}} that the Qedarites were {{called upon to}} assist Cambyses II of the Persian empire in his invasion of Egypt in 525 BCE. The Qedarites and Nabataens <b>were</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> enjoy close relations, even engaging as wartime allies against the Assyrians. It {{is possible that the}} Qedarites were eventually incorporated into the Nabataen state which emerged as the strongest Ishmaelite presence in northwestern Arabia c. the 2nd century CE. In The Cambridge Ancient History, some of the (Arab) Nabataens mentioned by Diodorus in his retelling of events that took place in 312 BCE are said to be Qedarites.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{diamonds}} <b>were</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> {{be found}} only in alluvial deposits in southern India. India led the world in diamond production {{from the time of}} their discovery in approximately the 9th century BC to the mid-18th century AD, but the commercial potential of these sources had been exhausted by the late 18th century and at that time India was eclipsed by Brazil where the first non-Indian diamonds were found in 1725.|$|E
5|$|Hog Island was colonized in the 17th century. The sheep that colonists {{would have}} been using at the time {{would have been}} the {{contemporary}} English breeds, but Merinos <b>were</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> roam the barrier islands, taken there by Spanish ships that wrecked and let the sheep loose.

5|$|In 1900 a spur {{connecting}} the branch to the up slow {{line of the}} West Coast Main Line was constructed. The water supply for locomotives at Wolverton was insufficient, so a water column was built at the intermediate station in Bradwell. Water came from the town's own source, with many houses losing their supply. On Mondays, housewives <b>were</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> shake their fists at engine drivers when their weekly wash was interrupted. Eventually drivers were forbidden from taking water from Bradwell on Mondays.|$|E
