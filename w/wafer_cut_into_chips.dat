In GSMBE, monomethylsilane (MMS: CH 3 SiH 3) with a pressure of 10 − 2  Pa was used as the single source of silicon and carbon with a typical substrate temperature of 1323  K [29]. Graphitization annealing was conducted in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) by heating the samples radiatively from the back with a graphite heater. Graphene formation was confirmed by Raman scattering spectroscopy. As for the analysis on reactions at the Ni/ 3 C-SiC interface during heating/annealing/cooling of the samples, in situ SR-XPS observations were conducted at the BL 23 SU surface chemistry end-station [30] in the SPring- 8 facilities using 650  eV photons. Angle-resolved (AR) observations were also conducted to obtain information on the order of the stacking layers. Since the photoelectrons that escape the surface at angles in the range of ± 8 ° around the line-of-sight direction from the surface to the analyzer were integrally collected in the present AR-XPS, only relative intensities between components were utilized in the analysis to avoid complexity.|$|R

The chip uses standard cold-atom control techniques along with readily available photonics technologies to provide an integrated atomic physics device that is not ‘scalable’ so much as already scaled. We describe experiments where atoms are driven into the trench using magneto-optical traps and magnetic traps. In the latter case, the large, homogeneous magnetic field that is present during the atom-light interaction allows us to observe polarization-dependent effects in absorption signals from the trench. Vacuum difficulties have limited the efficiency of rf-driven evaporative cooling in our magnetic trap to 0. 4 (with a final phase-space density of 2 × 10 ^- 5). To circumvent this issue, we have developed a novel evaporative cooling process, in which a dimple potential, comprised of an optical trap and a magnetic trap, is used to perform cycles of isentropic trap deformation and selective atom removal. Using this cooling process increases our evaporative cooling efficiency to 1. 2. Various other cooling strategies that involve the dimple are also investigated. Using the dimple, we achieve a phase-space density of 0. 04. Having cooled the cloud using the dimple, we move it into the trench and measure absorption signals of 50...|$|R

Immediately after the native oxide removal, the Si sample was placed in an electrolytic cell made of polytetrafluoroethylene. An active opening of the cell had a round shape and an area of 3  cm 2. A highly pure graphite disk was used as a contact electrode to a backside of the samples during the electrochemical treatment. A platinum spiral wire was used as a cathode electrode.
