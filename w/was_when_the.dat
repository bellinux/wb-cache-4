5|$|Immediately {{following}} the tornado in Comfrey there was {{uncertainty about the}} town's long-term survival. Then in the week {{following the}} tornado the town decided to rebuild the school, {{and as a result}} most of Comfrey's businesses decided to follow suit. Ground was broken on the new school early the next year, and it opened to students on October 4, 1999. The population of Comfrey is down to 367 from the 425 it <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> tornado hit.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Jennings was {{the first}} Governor to have an {{attempted}} impeachment brought against him {{in response to his}} actions as an agent of the federal government during the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's in 1819, illegal under Indiana's constitution. The evidence of his role was destroyed, and after two months of investigation the proceedings were dropped. The only other time <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly attempted to bring impeachment proceedings against Governor James B. Ray for a similar action in 1826, but the action was also defeated 28–30.|$|E
5|$|Lon Nol {{hoped to}} use the Vietnamese as hostages against PAVN/Viet Cong activities, and the {{military}} set about rounding them up into detention camps. That <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> killing began. In towns and villages all over Cambodia, soldiers and civilians sought out their Vietnamese neighbors in order to murder them. On 15 April, the bodies of 800 Vietnamese floated down the Mekong River and into South Vietnam.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{levels in the}} {{covariation}} model: high and low. Each of these levels influences the three covariation model criteria. High consensus <b>is</b> <b>when</b> many people can agree on an event or area of interest. Low consensus <b>is</b> <b>when</b> very few people can agree. High distinctiveness <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> event or area of interest is very unusual, whereas low distinctness <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> event or area of interest is fairly common. High consistency <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> event or area of interest continues for a length of time and low consistency <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> event or area of interest goes away quickly.|$|R

5|$|A {{highlight}} of the series in 1959 <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Russians allowed Moore {{to be the first}} Westerner to see the photographic results of the Luna 3 probe, and to show them live on air. Less successful was the transmission of the Luna 4 probe, which ran into technical difficulties and around this time Moore famously swallowed a large fly; both episodes were live and Moore had to continue regardless. He was invited to visit the Soviet Union, where he met Yuri Gagarin, the first man to journey into outer space. For the fiftieth episode of The Sky at Night, in September 1961, Moore's attempt {{to be the first to}} broadcast a live direct telescopic view of a planet resulted in another unintended 'comedy episode', as cloud obscured the sky.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} October 9, 2002 and wrapped by March 7, 2003. The quick shoot was only marred by two accidents: as Jack Sparrow steals the Interceptor, {{three of the}} ropes attaching it to the Dauntless did not break at first, {{and when they did}} snap, debris hit Depp's knee, though he was not injured, and the way the incident played out on film made it look like Sparrow merely ducks. A more humorous accident <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> boat Sparrow was supposed to arrive in at Port Royal sank. In October, the crew was shooting scenes at Rancho Palos Verdes, by December they were shooting at Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and in January they were at the cavern set at Los Angeles. The script often changed with Elliott and Rossio on set, with additions such as Gibbs (Kevin McNally) telling Will how Sparrow allegedly escaped from an island – strapping two turtles together with rope made of his back hair – and Pryce was written into the climactic battle to keep some empathy for the audience.|$|E
5|$|The Underground State {{achieved}} its zenith {{of influence}} in early 1944. In April, the Polish government in exile recognized the administrative structure of the Delegate's Office as the Temporary Governmental Administration. This <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Delegate officially became recognized as the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Council of Ministers at Home (Krajowa Rada Ministrów, KRM) was created. The Underground State however declined sharply {{in the aftermath of}} the nationwide uprising, Operation Tempest, initiated in the Spring of 1944. In addition to the costly and eventually unsuccessful Warsaw Uprising part of the Operation Tempest, the hostile attitude of the Soviet Union and its puppet Polish government, the Polish Committee of National Liberation (Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego, PKWN) towards the non-communist resistance loyal to the Polish government in exile proved to be disastrous. The Underground State assumed that the Polish resistance would aid the advancing Soviet forces, and AK commanders and representatives of the administrative authority would assume the role of legitimate hosts. Instead, the Soviets commonly surrounded, disarmed and arrested the Underground's military authority members and its civilian representatives, instituting their own administrative structures instead. In early July 1944, even as the AK resistance continued its struggle against the Germans, the Underground State was forced to order the AK and its administrative structure to remain in hiding from the Soviets, due to continued arrests and reprisals experienced by those who revealed themselves.|$|E

50|$|Resonant {{systems are}} said to be tightly coupled, loosely coupled, {{critically}} coupled or overcoupled. Tight coupling <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> coupling coefficient <b>is</b> around 1 as with conventional iron-core transformers. Overcoupling <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> secondary coil <b>is</b> so close and the formation of mutual flux is hindered by the effect of antiresonance, and critical coupling <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> transfer in the passband is optimal. Loose coupling <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> coils <b>are</b> distant from each other, so that most of the flux misses the secondary. In Tesla coils around 0.2 is used, and at greater distances, for example for inductive wireless power transmission, it may be lower than 0.01.|$|R
50|$|Cardiac {{diastole}} is {{the period}} of time <b>when</b> <b>the</b> heart relaxes after contraction in preparation for refilling with circulating blood.

Additionally, for the first time, all uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches and umpires) wore #42 for the day. The sole exception <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> scheduled game at Nationals Park between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Washington Nationals was rained out; they wore the jerseys in the night game of a day-night doubleheader May 16.|$|E
5|$|The main {{creative}} {{force behind}} the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated full motion video (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train. The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While {{this was not a}} new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect. The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed {{to figure out how to}} shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the {{original}} design was such that No. A866 was put {{on display at the}} British Empire Exhibition at Wembley from May to November 1925, and no class-wide modifications were made until 1934. This <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> SECR and Woolwich batches began to receive new domes and front footsteps during overhauls and general repairs. These were the same design as those used on Nos.14001414, and were intended to standardise components between the batches. The SECR and Woolwich batches also received smoke deflectors to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring the driver's vision ahead. The U1 chimneys replaced the standard Nclass type on the earlier locomotives, which, along with the removal of the piston tail rods on the earlier batches, created a truly standardised appearance.|$|E
