It {{follows a}} tradition in jazz for the Ringwald family set by her father. “I {{grew up in a}} home filled with music and had an early appreciation of jazz since my dad was a jazz musician. Beginning at around age three I started singing with his band and jazz music has continued to be one of my three passions along with acting and writing. I like to say jazz music is my musical equivalent of comfort food. It's always <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> back to when I want to feel grounded,” Ringwald said in a statement.|$|E
500|$|The {{fragrance}} {{is described}} by Steal Their Style as a [...] "feminine and flowery fragrance". Along with Glow by JLo, the perfume achieved success in the fragrance market {{and became one of}} America's highest-selling bottles. Collectively with Glow by JLo, it brought in over $USD300 million within a year, making Lopez the nineteenth richest person under forty, according to business magazine Forbes. The Fragrance Foundation's FiFi Awards named it the [...] "Celebrity Fragrance of the Year" [...] in June 2003. Several writers compared the theme of Still Jennifer Lopez's promotional campaign to her hit-song [...] "Jenny from the Block" [...] (2002), in which she declared [...] "I'm Still, I'm Still Jenny from the Block / Used to have a little now I have a lot / No matter <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>go,</b> I know where I came from." [...] Speaking about the fragrance's slogan, The New York Times wrote that it is [...] "a line that refers partly to her composure under the media glare but also serves as a pitch to potential consumers [...] It also evokes a song from her latest album, Jenny from the Block, in which she declares that despite fame, she is essentially her old self from South Bronx." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Gaga explained {{that she wanted to}} put together an expensive looking, beautiful show which would be affordable for her fans. She asserted that the tour was a [...] "pop-electro opera" [...] because the theatrics and the story elements interwoven in it were played like an opera. According to her, the design of the show was innovative and forward in terms of creativeness. Gaga wanted to change the shape of the stage and designed one with Haus of Gaga that was [...] "essentially a frame with forced perspective, and the frame is put inside the stage." [...] The stage had a triangular inset, like a diamond, and everywhere the show took place, the dimensions were measured {{in such a way that}} the box fit any stage. [...] "So no matter <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>go,</b> my fans get the same experience. So often you go into theaters and there's ambient light flying in from all sorts of places, and the audience is in different spots, and the stage is in different shapes and lengths and widths and depths, so this is a way for me to control all the light and all of the different elements of the show", she added.|$|E

500|$|Lacroix {{felt that}} with Unbreakable TNA [...] "truly {{cemented}} the formula needed for delivering great pay per views." [...] He concluded with [...] "TNA's Unbreakable PPV was an astounding buffet of action, {{catering to the}} variety of tastes among professional wrestling fans." [...] Lacroix also commented [...] "If you missed it, get the replay. Don't think, just do it [...] the main event is well worth the price." [...] The main event was given Lacroix's highest match rating of 10 out of 10 in his review. He gave his lowest rating of 4 out of 10 to the opening Six Man Tag Team match. The NWA World Heavyweight Championship bout was ranked with a 7.5 out of 10, while a 7 out of 10 {{was given to the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship contest. Commenting on the main event, Lacroix spoke of it as a [...] "certified match of the year candidate." [...] Going onto describe in detail: [...] "Unbreakable came to a close with mind-boggling main event, featuring a three-way dance between Samoa Joe against AJ Styles against X Division champion Christopher Daniels for the championship title. Now, this is the part <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> into a detail review of the match, but I'm not going to that. Fact is there is no review that could do justice in describing just how stellar this bout was." [...] Regarding the Four Way Elimination match, Lacroix believed Johnny Candido's participation was [...] "a nice gesture", but wonder [...] "if they could have come up with something else, preferably outside of the match." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "No Man's Land" [...] portrays {{an angry}} and violent woman {{trying to escape}} her lovers life. In an {{exclusive}} interview with Recochoku about the song, Koda stated that [...] "No Man's Land" [...] is a [...] "nuance" [...] of a [...] "girl screaming that she wants to go to a world with no other men." [...] Koda identified that the themes cheating and betrayal are present throughout the song's lyrics. However, Koda stated that [...] "No Man's Land" [...] had a similarity to her single [...] "Futari de...", where she believed had also grown strength after moving on. Koda performs the song in both the English and Japanese languages, one of nine tracks from Japonesque that is performed bilingually. According to the lyric sheet provided by Avex Trax, English is used in the song's hook; [...] "No man's, no man's, no man's land". The onomatopoeia lyric [...] "Ding Dong Ding Dong" [...] is spoken during the first verse, whilst the rest is rapped in Japanese. The chorus opens with the English lyrics; [...] "I've been running in circles, round and around", carries on with Japanese, and ends with [...] "Welcome to no man's land". The second verse includes the phrases [...] "Zero zero" [...] and [...] "so look at deep", whilst performed in Japanese. The bridge section has Koda singing in English; [...] "No matter <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>go,</b> this is still my home" [...] and [...] "my home", whilst performing in Japanese. The song's final English phrase is the interlude break; [...] "Everybody put hands right this", and finishes with the chorus and hook.|$|E

2500|$|In Dion's version, [...] "I Drove All Night" [...] is dance-pop. It {{was also}} {{considered}} [...] "{{a little bit}} dance-club, a little bit rock & roll." [...] Lyrically, she recalls a feverish trek for sexual gratification. She sings in the first verse, [...] "Maybe I should have called you first, but I was dying to get to you/I was dreaming while I drove the long, straight road ahead." [...] In the chorus, she sings, [...] "Woke you from your sleep {{to make love to}} you/Is that all right?/I drove all night." [...] In the second verse, Dion duplicates a line as it is heard in Orbison's original recording. Instead of singing, [...] "no matter <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> I hear the beating of our heart," [...] Dion sings, [...] "our one heart." [...] Like the original, the chorus is sung again twice, which ends the single.|$|E

This was Khan's first bout in the United States and defending his WBA light welterweight title for a second time. In front of 4,412, in a once-sided fight, Khan retained his title after referee ref Steve Smoger halted the fight at 1:25 of round 11. In the aftermath Malignaggi admitted he lost to the better man, saying, [...] "I've fought two elite fighters, Miguel Cotto and Amir Khan. From here, I'm not sure <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>go.</b> I'll sit down with my team. I don't want to be a punching bag." [...] Khan showed his speed, power and combinations throughout the fight and proved to be too much for Malignaggi.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{also writes}} about {{the degree to which}} the 1990 death of AIDS {{sufferer}} Ryan White affected him in a poem titled after the youth, and as he presents in the poem, Jackson believes the teenage boy suffered through general ignorance of the disease. The poem Mother was written for his mother Katherine, whom Jackson loved deeply. In one stanza Jackson writes [...] "No matter <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> from here/You're in my heart, mother dear". The poem had previously been published by his mother in her 1990 autobiography My Family, and was not the only material in Dancing the Dream to have appeared elsewhere. The poems Dancing the Dream (titled as The Dance) and Planet Earth were included in the sleeve notes for Jackson's 1991 Dangerous album (and in its 2001 special edition re-release). Furthermore, the lyrics to the songs [...] "Will You Be There" [...] and [...] "Heal the World"—also from the 1991 album—were included in Dancing the Dream.
