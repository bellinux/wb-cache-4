A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct <b>wildtype</b> in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs.|$|E
5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the <b>wildtype</b> coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair growing {{from the top of the}} tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding in certain parts of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E

40|$|The {{complement}} system is implicated in Wallerian degeneration (WD). We have previously {{shown that the}} membrane attack complex (MAC) the terminal activation product of the complement cascade, mediates rapid axonal degradation and myelin clearance during WD after peripheral nerve injury. In this study we analyzed the contribution of CD 59 a, a cell membrane negative regulator of the MAC, to WD. Following injury, the level of MAC deposition was higher in the CD 59 a deficient mice than <b>wildtypes</b> whereas the residual axonal content was lower in CD 59 a deficient mice than <b>wildtypes,</b> strongly implicating MAC as a determinant of axonal damage during WD. The number of endoneurial macrophages was significantly higher in CD 59 a deficient mice compared to <b>wildtypes</b> at 1 day post-injury.

Here, we investigated whether the established ADHD treatment, atomoxetine, alleviates these abnormalities when {{tested in the}} light/dark exploration box (LDEB) and 5 -Choice Serial Reaction-Time Task (5 -CSRTT). MethodsSeparate cohorts of mice were tested in the 5 -CSRTT and LDEB after treatment with no injection, vehicle or atomoxetine (5 -CSRTT: 0. 3, 3 or 10 mg/kg; LDEB: 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg). ResultsAtomoxetine reduced the hyperactivity displayed by NK 1 R−/− mice in the LDEB at a dose (3 mg/kg) which {{did not affect the}} locomotor activity of <b>wildtypes.</b> Atomoxetine (10 mg/kg) also reduced impulsivity in NK 1 R−/− mice, but not <b>wildtypes,</b> in the 5 -CSRTT. No dose of drug affected attention in either genotype. ConclusionsThis evidence that atomoxetine reduces hyperactive/impulsive behaviours in NK 1 R−/− mice consolidates the validity of using NK 1 R−/− mice in research of the aetiology and treatment of ADHD...|$|R
40|$|The study {{evaluated}} the Mutant Prevention Concentration (MPC) of Pradofloxacin on three Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains, 2 <b>wildtypes</b> and one first-step gyrA resistant mutant. We also measured {{the value of}} AUC (Under the Concentration) /MPC that prevents growth of resistant mutants. It is of importance to reach a concentration above MPC that prevent E. coli from developing resistance against the antibiotic. We used an in vitro kinetic model where we added bacteria? and antibiotic. The culture flask was attached to a pump with an adjustable pump-speed. This {{made it possible to}} dilute the antibiotics in a satisfying elimination half-life (t 1 / 2 = 7 hours) pace. Samples were removed with a syringe at different times in the study. The samples where then cultured on agar- plates to enable counting of the viable colonies after incubation. The optimal concentration to completely eradicate both E. coli <b>wildtypes</b> Nu 14 and MG 1655 with Pradofloxacin was Cmax ≥ 8 times MPC and AUC/MPC then became 73. Additional experiments needs to be done on the resistant mutant LM 378 before we can determine the optimal concentration.

Abnormal glucose levels are {{often seen in}} cystic fibrosis (CF), a systematic disease caused by mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), an endocrine disorder featured with hyperandrogenism affecting 5 – 10 % women of reproductive age. Here, we explored the role of CFTR in glucagon production in α cells and its possible contribution to glucagon disturbance in CF and PCOS. We found elevated fasting glucagon levels in CFTR mutant (DF 508) mice compared to the <b>wildtypes.</b> Glucagon and prohormone convertase 2 (PC 2) were also upregulated in CFTR inhibitor-treated or DF 508 islets, {{as compared to the}} controls or <b>wildtypes,</b> respectively. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) -induced PCOS rats exhibited significantly lower fasting glucagon levels with higher CFTR expression in α cells compared to that of controls. Treatment of mouse islets or αTC 1 - 9 cells with DHT enhanced CFTR expression and reduced the levels of glucagon and PC 2. The inhibitory effect of DHT on glucagon production was blocked by CFTR inhibitors in mouse islets, and mimicked by overexpressing CFTR in αTC 1 - 9 cells with reduced phosphorylation of the cAMP/Ca 2 + response element binding protein (p-CREB), a key transcription factor for glucagon and PC 2. These results revealed a previously undefined role of CFTR in suppressing glucagon production in α-cells, defects in which may contribute to glucose metabolic disorder seen in CF and PCOS...|$|R

40|$|Elevated {{homocysteine}} (Hcy) due {{to common}} gene variants is correlated with {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD), but definite causality remains uncertain. Hcy increases due to genetic and environment interactions. Assuming no direct effects of folate on CHD except via increased Hcy, and that folate drives Hcy metabolism, investigating on how genes influence folate balancing is strongly useful. DHFR and MTHFR fully activate diet folate. Common polymorphisms influence activity/level of enzymes. MTHFR 677 TT reduces enzyme efficiency yielding ~ 20 % higher Hcy. Less definitive is the role ascribed to DHFR 19 bp ins/del; some authors reported ~ 50 % higher mRNA in del/del genotype. We selected 14 CHD patients from our Center carrying opposite DHFR/MTHFR genotypes. We hypothesized that patients (n= 7) carrying both polymorphisms in homozygous condition (DHFRdel/del and MTHFR 677 TT) might have different folate status and respond differently, than double <b>wildtypes</b> (n= 7), under controlled in vitro folate levels. So, we put whole blood in culture (t 0, t 48, t 96 - 120 hours) containing 10 ng/ml folate. DD/TT patients had significant lower basal folate levels (plasma and RBC) versus <b>wildtypes.</b> Interestingly, in vitro culture showed DD/TT genotype rapidly gained folate stores, to completely cancel the gap at ~ 96 h. These results are partially in contrast with previous reports in which DHFR properties were tested without consider MTHFR, and strongly advice to analyze these two common variants before ascribing disease risk and public health implications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNedd 4 (neural {{precursor}} cell expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4) is an E 3 ubiquitin ligase highly conserved from yeast to humans. The expression of Nedd 4 is developmentally down-regulated in the mammalian nervous system, but {{the role of}} Nedd 4 in mammalian neural development remains poorly understood. Here we show that a null mutation of Nedd 4 in mice leads to perinatal lethality: mutant mice were stillborn {{and many of them}} died in utero before birth (between E 15. 5 –E 18. 5). In Nedd 4 mutant embryos, skeletal muscle fiber sizes and motoneuron numbers are significantly reduced. Surviving motoneurons project axons to their target muscles on schedule, but motor nerves defasciculate upon reaching the muscle surface, suggesting that Nedd 4 plays a critical role in fine-tuning the interaction between the nerve and the muscle. Electrophysiological analyses of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) demonstrate an increased spontaneous miniature endplate potential (mEPP) frequency in Nedd 4 mutants. However, the mutant neuromuscular synapses are less responsive to membrane depolarization, compared to the <b>wildtypes.</b> Ultrastructural analyses further reveal that the pre-synaptic nerve terminal branches at the NMJs of Nedd 4 mutants are increased in number, but decreased in diameter compared to the <b>wildtypes.</b> These ultrastructural changes are consistent with functional alternation of the NMJs in Nedd 4 mutants. Unexpectedly, Nedd 4 is not expressed in motoneurons, but is highly expressed in skeletal muscles and Schwann cells. Together, these results demonstrate that Nedd 4 is involved in regulating the formation and function of the NMJs through non-cell autonomous mechanisms...|$|R

25|$|Mitochondrial {{diseases}} {{range in}} severity from asymptomatic to fatal, and are most commonly due to inherited rather than acquired mutations of mitochondrial DNA. A given mitochondrial mutation can cause various diseases {{depending on the}} severity of the problem in the mitochondria and the tissue the affected mitochondria are in. Conversely, several different mutations may present themselves as the same disease. This almost patient-specific characterization of mitochondrial diseases (see Personalized medicine) makes them very hard to accurately recognize, diagnose and trace. Some diseases are observable at or even before birth (many causing death) while others do not show themselves until late adulthood (late-onset disorders). This is because the number of mutant versus <b>wildtype</b> mitochondria varies between cells and tissues, and is continuously changing. Because cells have multiple mitochondria, different mitochondria in the same cell can have different variations of the mtDNA. This condition is referred to as heteroplasmy. When a certain tissue reaches a certain ratio of mutant versus <b>wildtype</b> mitochondria, a disease will present itself. The ratio varies from person to person and tissue to tissue (depending on its specific energy, oxygen, and metabolism requirements, and the effects of the specific mutation). Mitochondrial diseases are very numerous and different. Apart from diseases caused by abnormalities in mitochondrial DNA, many diseases are suspected to be associated in part by mitochondrial dysfunctions, such as diabetes mellitus, forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease, lactic acidosis, specific forms of myopathy, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinsons's disease, stroke, male infertility and which are also believed {{to play a role in}} the aging process.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} linkage between roan and {{chestnut}} is readily observed. If a horse possesses one chromosome with the <b>wildtype</b> non-chestnut allele and the dominant roan allele (E and Rn), {{while the other}} chromosome contains the recessive chestnut allele and the recessive non-roan allele (e and rn), he will outwardly appear blue roan, barring the influence of other genes. Normally, the chestnut and roan alleles would be separated during chromosomal crossover, but these two linked genes will usually remain together. Such a horse will produce sex cells that are either E/Rn or e/rn. Mated to chestnut non-roan partners (e/rn), the horse would produce primarily blue roans, or chestnut non-roans, but few chestnut roans and few black non-roans. If, on the other hand, the recessive e and dominant Rn {{were on the same}} chromosome, the horse would be expected to produce primarily chestnut roans and non-chestnut non-roans with chestnut, non-roan partners.|$|E
25|$|Ciliary {{neurotrophic}} factor (CNTF) is a cytosolic protein {{that is not}} secreted.

Further, CNTF has been previously shown to affect the differentiation of glial precursor cells in vitro; however, the influence of CNTF in the in vivo setting has only recently been determined. Winter et al. used CNTF over-expressing transgenic mice as well as <b>wildtype</b> controls that had CNTF levels artificially elevated via injection, were subjected to neuronal damage using ZnSO4 (a known neuronal degenerative factor), which was injected intranasally in the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory bulb was then assessed for the expression of GFAP mRNA- a common marker for the glial scar. It was determined that mice with elevated levels of CNTF increased their GFAP mRNA expression two-fold. This data suggests that CNTF may mediate glial scar formation following CNS damage.|$|E

Prior study has implicated laminin-α 4 in NMJ maintenance, with altered NMJ morphology observed in adult laminin-a 4 deficient mice (lama 4). The present study further investigated the role of laminin-a 4 in NMJ maintenance by functional characterization of transmission properties, morphological investigation of synaptic proteins including synaptic laminin-α 4, and neuromotor behavioral testing. Results showed maintained perturbed transmission properties at lama 4 NMJs from adult (3 months) through to aged (18 - 22 months). Hind-limb grip force demonstrated similar trends as transmission properties, with maintained weaker grip force across age groups in lama 4. Interestingly, both transmission properties and hind-limb grip force in aged <b>wildtypes</b> resembled those observed in adult lama 4. Most significantly, altered expression of laminin-α 4 was noted at the wild-type NMJs prior to the observed decline in transmission properties, suggesting that altered laminin-a 4 expression precedes the decline of neurotransmission in aging wild-types. These findings significantly support the role of laminin-a 4 in maintenance of the NMJ during aging...|$|R
25|$|Agrobacterium-mediated {{transformation}} {{is the easiest}} and most simple plant transformation. Plant tissue (often leaves) are cut into small pieces, e.g. 10x10mm, and soaked for 10 minutes in a fluid containing suspended Agrobacterium. The bacteria will attach {{to many of the}} plant cells exposed by the cut. The plant cells secrete wound-related phenolic compounds which in turn act to upregulate the virulence operon of the Agrobacterium. The virulence operon includes many genes that encode for proteins that are part of a Type IV secretion system that exports from the bacterium proteins and DNA (delineated by specific recognition motifs called border sequences and excised as a single strand from the virulence plasmid) into the plant cell through a structure called a pilus. The transferred DNA (called T-DNA) is piloted to the plant cell nucleus by nuclear localization signals present in the Agrobacterium protein VirD2, which is covalently attached {{to the end of the}} T-DNA at the Right border (RB). Exactly how the T-DNA is integrated into the host plant genomic DNA is an active area of plant biology research. Assuming that a selection marker (such as an antibiotic resistance gene) was included in the T-DNA, the transformed plant tissue can be cultured on selective media to produce shoots. The shoots are then transferred to a different medium to promote root formation. Once roots begin to grow from the transgenic shoot, the plants can be transferred to soil to complete a normal life cycle (make seeds). The seeds from this first plant (called the T1, for first transgenic generation) can be planted on a selective (containing an antibiotic), or if an herbicide resistance gene was used, could alternatively be planted in soil, then later treated with herbicide to kill <b>wildtype</b> segregants. Some plants species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana can be transformed by dipping the flowers or whole plant, into a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, typically strain C58 (C=Cherry, 58=1958, the year in which this particular strain of A. tumefaciens was isolated from a cherry tree in an orchard at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York). Though many plants remain recalcitrant to transformation by this method, research is ongoing that continues to add to the list the species that have been successfully modified in this manner.|$|E

Yet the site of iNOS expression is still unclear. It has been reported that infiltrating leukocytes express iNOS after cerebral ischemia and thereby can lead to enlargement of the infarcted area. However, an expression of iNOS has also been reported in resident microglia. In order to further clarify this discrepancy we used a rodent gfp-chimera which allows the differentiation of infiltrating cells from resident glia. By transplanting bone marrow from iNOS-deficient mice into <b>wildtypes</b> and vice versa chimera were generated that either expressed iNOS in peripheral blood cells or in resident CNS cells. No difference in infarct size could be detected between the four transplantation groups (wt→wt, iNOS-/-→iNOS-/-, iNOS-/-→wt, wt→iNOS-/-) after 45 min of transient focal cerebral ischemia. Based on this data the role of iNOS in the post-ischemic setting has to be reevaluated. The findings of this study suggest that iNOS may not be a general mediator of the inflammatory reaction after cerebral ischemia...|$|R
40|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} plays {{a central}} role for the integration of biochemical and biomechanical signals across the cell required for complex cellular functions. Recent studies indicate that the intermediate filament vimentin is necessary for endothelial cell morphogenesis e. g. {{in the context of}} leukocyte transmigration. Here, we present evidence, that the scaffold provided by vimentin is essential for VASP localization and PKG mediated VASP phosphorylation and thus controls endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Vimentin suppression using siRNA technique significantly decreased migration velocity by 50 % (videomicroscopy), diminished transmigration activity by 42. 5 % (Boyden chamber) and reduced proliferation by 43 % (BrdU-incorporation). In confocal microscopy Vimentin colocalized with VASP and PKG in endothelial cells. Vimentin suppression was accompanied with a translocation of VASP from focal contacts to the perinuclear region. VASP/Vimentin and PKG/Vimentin colocalization appeared to be essential for proper PKG mediated VASP phosphorylation because we detected a diminished expression of PKG and p(Ser 239) -VASP in vimentin-suppressed cells, Furthermore, the induction of VASP phosphorylation in perfused arteries was markedly decreased in vimentin knockout mice compared to <b>wildtypes.</b> A link is proposed between vimentin, VASP phosphorylation and actin dynamics that delivers an explanation for the important role of vimentin in controlling endothelial cell morphogenesis...|$|R

Methods We {{conducted a}}n analysis in the Nurses 2 ̆ 7 Health Study (n = 1121) to assess the relation between 11 breast cancer susceptibility loci and mammographic density.
