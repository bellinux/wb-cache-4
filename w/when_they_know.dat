25|$|Both {{indirect}} reciprocity {{and costly}} signaling {{depend on the}} value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helping <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects. Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic. People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns.|$|E
25|$|We want {{every man}} and woman in these two {{counties}} to recall the dates of these murders and also to recall whether or not any person close to them was missing or out of pocket during those nights. Persons who have such information and have been withholding it <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no mistake {{about the fact that}} the slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge you to come in and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{also gave}} the episode a {{positive}} review, and opined, [...] "With the dissing of glee club temporarily put on hold, Glee {{the series was}} {{able to have a}} little fun with Tuesday night's episode. And fun it was, with the gang of New Directions taking on Valentine's Day, with flirting, kissing and, of course, singing. Without the bullying, this was a much lighter episode of Glee, and the results gave way to a lot more laughs and story development." [...] He went on to praise Ashley Fink's performance as Lauren Zizes, and said of Puck's falling in love with Lauren, [...] "I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Canning ultimately gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10. Wyndham Wyeth of Paste went on to praise the episode for its depiction of relationships in high school, as well as the backing vocals for Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] by Queen. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review and a grade of [...] "A−": Silly Love Songs' is a fine example of the show at what's very nearly its absolute best. There’s nothing too heady here, but if the show has one tone that it's nailed almost completely consistently, it’s the feeling of teenage romance, the sense that the person you're in love with is the only person you will ever be in love with [...] followed almost immediately by the crippling feeling of heartbreak, of losing that person too soon. Teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions. And like most musicals, Glee has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters' lives. As such, 'Silly Love Songs', which is pretty much just an excuse to play around with the show's many romantic pairings among its glee club characters, is a lot of fun without trying all that hard." [...] In conclusion of his review, he wrote, [...] "The best episodes play that elation and devastation off of each other. The worst episodes flounder about for some sort of emotional foothold. But when Glee just tells small, sweet stories about these kids and the ways they're trying to cope with being in high school <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> they're meant for bigger things, it can be terrific. Tonight was one of those episodes, and tonight's episode was terrific. Here's to a good February sweeps." ...|$|E

2500|$|An on-line abuse panel (itself {{the subject}} of controversy) at the 2016 SXSW festival {{said that there was}} no {{technological}} {{solution to the problem of}} harassment given human nature; although policy changes have been made, the larger issue is more societal than platform-specific. Referring to the discussion at SXSW in a speech for Women's History Month, President of the United States Barack Obama said that [...] "We know that women gamers face harassment and stalking and threats of violence from other players. When they speak out about their experiences, they're attacked on Twitter and other social media outlets, even threatened in their homes." [...] Obama urged targets of harassment to speak out, praising the courage of those who had resisted online harassment. [...] "And what's brought these issues to light is that there are a lot of women out there, especially young women, who are speaking out bravely about their experiences, even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> they'll be attacked for it".|$|E

2500|$|Insight 3 – No {{matter how}} well they have gained {{insights}} 1 and 2, insight alone rarely enables people to undo their emotional disturbances. They may feel better <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>know,</b> or think they know, how they became disturbed, because insights can feel useful and curative. But {{it is unlikely that}} people will actually get better and stay better unless they have and apply insight 3, which is that there is usually no way to get better and stay better except by continual work and practice in looking for and finding one’s core irrational beliefs; actively, energetically, and scientifically disputing them; replacing one’s absolute [...] "musts" [...] (rigid requirements about how things should be) with more flexible preferences; changing one's unhealthy feelings to healthy, self-helping emotions; and firmly acting against one’s dysfunctional fears and compulsions. Only by a combined cognitive, emotive, and behavioral, as well as a quite persistent and forceful attack on one's serious emotional problems, is one likely to significantly ameliorate or remove them, and keep them removed.|$|E
2500|$|Physical {{appearance}} {{gives us}} clear {{clues as to}} a person's personality without him/her ever having to speak or move. Women tend {{to be better than}} men at judging nonverbal behavior. [...] After viewing pictures of people in a neutral position and in a self-chosen posed position, observers were accurate at judging the target's levels of extraversion, emotional stability, openness, self-esteem, and religiosity. The combined impression of physical characteristics, body posture, facial expression, and clothing choices lets observers form accurate images of a target's personality, so long as the person observed is presenting themselves genuinely. However, there is some conflicting data in this field. Other evidence suggests that people sometimes rely too much on appearance cues over actual information. When provided with descriptive information about a target, participants still rely on physical appearance cues when making judgments about others' personalities and capabilities. Participants struggle to look past physical appearance cues even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> information contrary to their initial judgment. Physical cues are also used to make judgments about political candidates based on extremely brief exposures to their pictures. Perceived competence level of a candidate measured from first impressions of facial features can directly predict voting results.|$|E
