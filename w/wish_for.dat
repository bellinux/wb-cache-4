5|$|After {{this day}} of fierce fighting, which has been {{described}} as the hardest-fought action of the whole Sinai campaign, the Anzac Mounted Division's advance was effectively stopped. Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence's <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force. Further, the Anzac Mounted Division had lost a significant proportion of their strength; over 300 casualties, including eight officers and 65 other ranks killed.|$|E

5|$|From the beginning, Welensky was {{involved}} {{in the creation of the}} Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. He had earlier wanted an amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia with a constitution similar to that of Southern Rhodesia (that had granted responsible government to the white Rhodesians). After the British Government rejected this idea, he set about the creation of a federation, and against his judgement, the small colony of Nyasaland was included. His main <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> amalgamation, and later federation, was primarily so the complementary economic strengths of the Rhodesias could be put to best use. He felt that the colonies were missing out on the post-war economic boom.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} there was {{unconscious}} guilt associated with the relationship, the <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to repression, which Sigmund Freud had linked {{with the development of}} morbid dread. Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; love is replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect {{may or may not be}} present. Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their fear of dying.|$|E

Bin al-Shibh also passed along bin Laden's <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> the attacks {{to be carried out}} as soon as possible. Some of the hijackers received passports from corrupt Saudi officials who were family members, or used fraudulent passports to gain entry.|$|E
60|$|He mounted his three-legged {{stool and}} away he {{flew through the}} air until he had come again to the tavern where he was lodging. There he sat him down and began to churn his thoughts, and the butter he made was worth the having, I can tell you. He <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> a grand palace of white marble, and then he <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> {{all sorts of things}} to fill it--the finest that could be had. Then he <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> {{servants}} in clothes of gold and silver, and then he <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> fine horses and gilded coaches. Then he <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> gardens and orchards and lawns and flower-plats and fountains, and all kinds and sorts of things, until the sweat ran down his face from hard thinking and wishing.

5|$|Welensky {{was elected}} to the Northern Rhodesian Legislative Council in the 1938 general elections.

The party won all five seats it contested in the 1941 elections.

5|$|An Assisted Elopement is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company.

In a ploy to get their children to elope, the fathers become bitter enemies in public and the couple elopes much to their enjoyment and intention.

5|$|Each carving {{receives}} a special name, and common motifs are {{animals and plants}} that symbolise some virtue. For example, water plants and animals, such as crabs, tadpoles and water weeds, are commonly found to symbolise fertility. In some areas noble elders claim these symbols refer to strength of noble family, but not everyone agrees. The overall meaning of groups of carved motifs on houses remains debated and tourism has further complicated these debates because some feel a uniform explanation must be presented to tourists. The image to the left shows an example of Torajan wood carving, consisting of 15 square panels. The center bottom panel represents buffalo or wealth, a <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> many buffaloes for the family. The center panel represents a knot and a box, a hope {{that all of the}} family's offspring will be happy and live in harmony, like goods kept safe in a box. The top left and top right squares represent an aquatic animal, indicating the need for fast and hard work, just like moving on the surface of water.
