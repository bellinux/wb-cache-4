Behind the diversity of institutional forms involved, the issues raised concerned the administrative and budgetary organisation of the state and how it would adapt to new economic functions. The article examines the origin and development of these heterogeneous administrative structures before and during World War I and during the 1920 s. The office created in 1924 to produce fertilizers, in particular its subsequent misadventures, serve to illustrate why this new institutional form was contested and to better understand the task of the Offices Commission in charge of reforming these structures. The commission’s determination to rationalise did not however prevent the creation of new offices, including the important <b>Wheat</b> <b>Office</b> in 1936...|$|E

The town supported a developed main street with a grain elevator, a bank, stores, a dance hall, and lumber yards. The town was primarily an agricultural community with a stop and depot. The <b>Wheat</b> basin post <b>office</b> was closed in 1936. The railroad later pulled out and the town descended into steep decline.|$|R
