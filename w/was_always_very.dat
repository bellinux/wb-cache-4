5|$|In May 2001, Narayan was hospitalised. A {{few hours}} before {{he was to be}} put on a ventilator, he was {{planning}} on writing his next novel, a story about a grandfather. As he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>very</b> selective about his choice of notebooks, he asked N. Ram to get him one. However, Narayan did not get better and never started the novel. He died on 13 May 2001, in Chennai at the age of 94.|$|E

25|$|While Gryce {{was a very}} {{accomplished}} saxophonist, clarinetist, and flautist {{his playing}} tended to be less innovative than his writing. As a saxophonist he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>very</b> much influenced by Charlie Parker, who he had always idolized and became friends with in the mid-fifties. Contemporaries recall that Parker would sometimes borrow Gryce's horn.|$|E
25|$|Hecker <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>very</b> much a {{favourite}} {{with all}} the German democrats. The song ("Heckerlied") and the hat named after him (a broad slouch hat with a feather) became famous as the symbols of the middle-classes in revolt. In America he won great esteem, not only on political grounds but also for his personal qualities.|$|E
25|$|Eltham High Street {{lies on the}} A210, the {{original}} A20 London to Maidstone road. But the A20 has now been diverted southwards, passing through Mottingham, {{and it is a}} dual carriageway that connects to the M20 motorway in Kent. Similarly, to the north, the dual carriageway A2 has replaced the Rochester Road section, which <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>very</b> congested (the old road had dangerous readings of lead pollution, close to schools, before the advent of lead-free petrol).|$|E

25|$|Machen, {{brought up}} {{as the son of}} a Church of England clergyman, always held Christian beliefs, though {{accompanied}} by a fascination with sensual mysticism; his interests in paganism and the occult were especially prominent in his earliest works. Machen was well read on such matters as alchemy, the kabbalah, and Hermeticism, and these occult interests formed part of his close friendship with A. E. Waite. Machen, however, <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>very</b> down to earth, requiring substantial proof that a supernatural event had occurred, and was thus highly sceptical of Spiritualism. Unlike many of his contemporaries, such as Oscar Wilde and Alfred Douglas, his disapproval of the Reformation and his admiration for the medieval world and its Roman Catholic ritualism did not fully tempt him away from Anglicanism—though he never fitted comfortably into the Victorian Anglo-Catholic world.|$|E

500|$|Brain had {{declined}} {{the offer of}} a knighthood in the late 1960s, but accepted appointment as an Officer of the Order of Australia on 26January 1979. When asked {{towards the end of}} his life why he had achieved so much but was not as well known as other aviation pioneers, he replied [...] "Because I <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>very</b> careful and didn't kill myself". Having suffered from cancer for several years, Brain died in Sydney on 30June 1980. He was survived by his wife and children, and cremated. In November 2008, Qantas announced that one of its new Airbus A380s would be named Lester Brain.|$|E

500|$|Personally, Burnside <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>very</b> popular, both in {{the army}} and in politics. He made friends easily, smiled a lot, and remembered everyone's name. His {{professional}} military reputation, however, was less positive, and he was known for being obstinate, unimaginative, and unsuited, both intellectually and emotionally for high command. Grant stated that he was [...] "unfitted" [...] for the command of an army and that no one knew this better than Burnside himself. Knowing his capabilities, he twice refused command of the Army of the Potomac, accepting only the third time when the courier told him that otherwise the command would go to Joseph Hooker. Jeffry D. Wert described Burnside's relief after Fredericksburg in a passage that sums up his military career: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Disney {{began to}} {{consider}} producing a sequel, {{but rather than}} using stop motion, Disney wanted to use computer animation. Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>very</b> protective of Nightmare not to do sequels or things of that kind," [...] Burton explained. [...] "You know, 'Jack visits Thanksgiving world' or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it {{and the people that}} like it... Because it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it." [...] The 2004 video game [...] did serve as a sequel of the film, with Capcom's crew of developers going after Burton for advice, and having the collaboration of the film's art director, Deane Taylor. In 2009, Selick said he would do a film sequel if he and Burton could create a good story for it.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} week, {{after one}} further substitute appearance, O'Keefe was handed his first league start for Southend by manager Steve Tilson against Leeds United at Elland Road on 27 January 2009. However, this {{proved to be}} his last appearance for the club during the 2008–09 season. Despite this, O'Keefe was nominated for the League One Apprentice of the Year award, eventually losing out to Carlisle United defender Tom Aldred. The following season, O'Keefe featured more regularly for the first team, making nine appearances in total despite missing two months of the season due to a hernia injury sustained in a match against Millwall on 26 January 2010. Following his departure from Roots Hall, the club's head of youth director Ricky Duncan praised O'Keefe's attitude, stating [...] "Stuart <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>very</b> driven and single-minded and he was different {{to a lot of}} the other lads in that regard." ...|$|E

500|$|David Lovering {{was born}} in Burlington, Massachusetts. He learned to play drums during his teenage years and joined his high school's marching band. According to his friend John Murphy, Lovering <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>very</b> [...] "drum oriented" [...] in his musical taste. In his high school {{yearbook}} entry, Lovering stated his three main ambitions: {{to be in a}} rock band, to be an electrical engineer, and to tour with Rush, his favorite band. After graduating from high school, Lovering studied electronic engineering at the Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston. He got a job at a Radio Shack store with Murphy, and the pair often played practical jokes while at work. One such incident involved Lovering wiring the store toilet to a fire alarm. After graduating from Wentworth with a bachelor's degree in 1982, he took a job building lasers, and continued to drum in local bands such as Iz Wizard and Riff Raff. A number of different genres of music have influenced him, including bands [...] Steely Dan, Led Zeppelin, and Devo.|$|E
500|$|The {{reunion of}} the band has been {{characterized}} as dysfunctional by both Barker and DeLonge. Hoppus commented on this era {{of the band}} in a later interview: [...] "Everything <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>very</b> contentious. There was always just a strange vibe. [...] I {{knew there was something}} wrong." [...] In his memoir, Can I Say, Barker claims DeLonge's behavior on tour was [...] "introverted" [...] until [...] "money started coming in," [...] after which [...] "he'd get excited about Blink." [...] He states DeLonge abruptly quit sometime in mid-2014, and rejoined the following day. The group planned to begin writing their seventh album in January 2015, which had continually seen delays. [...] "I'd do interviews and I just felt awful for fans because they were promised albums for years and we couldn't do it," [...] Barker later said. A record deal was finalized and sessions were booked before DeLonge's manager informed the band he intended to spend more time on [...] "non-musical activities" [...] and indefinitely depart the group. In his own statement, DeLonge remarked that he [...] "Never planned on quitting, just find it hard as hell to commit." [...] After these events, Barker summarized the band's reunion: [...] "Why Blink even got back together in the first place is questionable." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There {{were some}} strong personalities in that band, Graham especially, and very {{strongly}} self-motivated. The membership changes {{down the line}} {{had something to do}} with the failure. The way we approached it <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>very</b> safe - never very adventurous. We never stuck our necks out." ...|$|E

Whether it was a trip to the hospital or an autograph session, Corey was great. He was the ideal ambassador." ...|$|E

[...] As time went on, the beloved Beacham was beautified and remodeled into Dekko's. [...] While the Beacham itself was cleaned up, the overall [...] "vibe" [...] of Orlando's scene seemed to darken somewhat just as the quality of club drugs that were still available during that time became tainted.|$|E
