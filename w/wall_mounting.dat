5|$|Unlike {{other great}} {{scholars}} {{of the age}} he travelled little and his knowledge of geography came from his library of over one thousand books and maps, from his visitors and from his vast correspondence (in six languages) with other scholars, statesmen, travellers, merchants and seamen. Mercator's early maps were in large formats suitable for <b>wall</b> <b>mounting</b> but {{in the second half}} of his life he produced over 100 new regional maps in a smaller format suitable for binding into his Atlas of 1595. This was the first appearance of the word Atlas in a geographical context but Mercator used it as a neologism for a treatise (Cosmologia) on the creation, history and description of the universe, not simply a collection of maps. He chose the word as a commemoration of a King Atlas of Mauretania whom he considered to be the first great geographer. This King Atlas was a son of the Titan Atlas but the two myths very quickly coalesced.|$|E
25|$|In the Victorian {{era in the}} United Kingdom, {{a common}} design for the home {{aquarium}} was a glass front with the other sides made of wood (made watertight with a pitch coating). The bottom would be made of slate and heated from below. More advanced systems soon began to be introduced, along with tanks of glass in metal frames. During {{the latter half of}} the 19th century, a variety of aquarium designs were explored, such as hanging the aquarium on a <b>wall,</b> <b>mounting</b> it as part of a window, or even combining it with a birdcage.|$|E

McCaughey stated that a specialised type of screwdriver not {{available to the public}} would have been required to take the painting off the wall.

Mr Choosy was a particularly popular character, his routine was to come in then run around to his theme song and burst {{his head with a}} pin with different substances coming out, such as glitter or [...] "muck muck".|$|E
60|$|They {{were glad}} {{when they reached}} the archway leading to the stairs that led {{to the top of the}} <b>wall.</b> <b>Mounting,</b> they kept along by the parapet, stooping so that their figures should not show against the sky for, dark as it was below, they might have been noticed had they not done so.

60|$|But it {{was evident}} that the man and woman knew big water. No racing stroke did they make in advance of the wave. The captain {{inwardly}} applauded as he saw them turn and face the wave and wait for it. It was a picture that of all on the beach he alone saw, wonderfully distinct and vivid in the magnification of the binoculars. The wall of the wave was truly a <b>wall,</b> <b>mounting,</b> ever mounting, and thinning, far up, to a transparency of the colours of the setting sun shooting athwart all the green and blue of it. The green thinned to lighter green that merged blue even as he looked. But it was a blue gem-brilliant with innumerable sparkle-points of rose and gold flashed through it by the sun. On and up, to the sprouting beard of growing crest, the colour orgy increased until it was a kaleidoscopic effervescence of transfusing rainbows.|$|E

50|$|Working {{with natural}} light {{it has to}} be ensured that enough light is available. <b>Wall</b> <b>mounting</b> systems need to be {{equipped}} with some form of lighting, designed to achieve uniform illumination on the full plate surface. Usually mounting systems similar to natural stone panels are used — e.g., LUCEM uses perforated mounting with visible screws, undercut anchors with agraffes or façade anchors.|$|E

50|$|As a {{component}} of a building wiring system, the installation of light switches will be regulated by some authority concerned with safety and standards. In different countries the standard dimensions of the <b>wall</b> <b>mounting</b> hardware (boxes, plates etc.) may differ. Since the face-plates used must cover this hardware, these standards determine the minimum sizes of all wall mounted equipment. Hence, the shape {{and size of the}} boxes and face-plates, as well as what is integrated, varies from country to country.|$|E
50|$|Rack-mountable {{equipment}} is traditionally mounted by bolting or clipping its front panel to the rack. Within the IT industry, {{it is common}} for network/communications equipment to have multiple mounting positions, including table-top and <b>wall</b> <b>mounting,</b> so rack mountable equipment will often feature L-brackets that must be screwed or bolted to the equipment prior to mounting in a 19-inch rack. With the prevalence of 23-inch racks in the Telecoms industry, the same practice is also common, but with equipment having 19-inch and 23-inch brackets available, enabling them to be mounted in existing racks.|$|E
50|$|A switch of {{basically}} the same design is also used on Australian power outlet wall-plates. It is now extremely rare to find {{any other type of}} switch in Australian homes, although the Australian Wiring Standard AS 3112 does not forbid other types.While there are many variations of Australian designs and cover plates available, some designers and renovators may import UK/European designed switches when they are aiming for a particular finish. However, while standard Australian <b>wall</b> <b>mounting</b> plates are of the same dimensions as those used in North America, they are not of the same dimensions as those used in the UK or Europe.|$|E

50|$|Yo-yo, pile-up, or pilewind, hoists use yo-yo type devices {{instead of}} {{helically}} grooved drums. The yo-yos lines are coiled into overlapping layers of cable {{in the narrow}} slots. The pile-up drum hoists are usually used in low load. As the hoists are narrower than helically grooved drum hoists, these {{can be used in}} the places with limited space. Pile-up drum hoists can be mounted in many locations including ceiling, floor or <b>wall</b> <b>mounting.</b> Typical applications are to have a pile-up drum hoist with many pulleys to control a batten. Since the line is piled up on itself, this type of drum hoist provides a zero fleet angle solution.|$|E
