5|$|Phil {{explains}} to Mulder {{that he wanted}} a divorce from Ellen two years ago, but she got pregnant and would not allow it. He also believes {{that he is the}} reason for this happening and that he somehow summoned the entity. It turns out that Ellen is the entity, which is given away by a cut in her back given by Jenny during the attack. Ellen transforms into the creature, attacks Mulder, and attempts to drown him in a bath tub, but stops when she sees her monstrous reflection in the water. She is placed in a psychiatric hospital, where the doctors diagnose her with multiple personality disorder. Meanwhile, Scully reveals to Mulder that the mysterious prostitute killer was not an X-File at all, but rather a man disguised as a woman <b>who</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the prostitutes about religion and attempted to help them get out of the prostitution ring.|$|E
25|$|According to reports, on 2 November from {{thirty to}} forty sampan-men {{entered the house}} of the {{contractor}} who supplies the Harbour Department with fuel for launches, and threatened to maim him if he refused to join their cause by stopping supplies. The contractor told them he would not {{have anything to do with}} them, and, fearing an attack, collected in all of his coolies, although the sampan-men did not reappear. On 13 November Lim Eow Thong and Goh Taik Chee introduced a deputation of sampan-men to Assistant Protector of Chinese Beatty, whereupon the sampan-men related the hardship brought about by the prohibition on repairs along Weld Quay, and of the inadequacy of the present fare structure. Beaty said he would lay these complaints before Bland. Following that a meeting took place at Bland's office. In addition to the Chinese sampan-men <b>who</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Beatty, leaders of the Malay and Indian sampan-men approached Major H. Barry de Hamel, the Chief Police Officer, and L. H. Clayton, the Superintendent of Indian Immigration. The Government refused to do anything unless the sampan-men called off their strike.|$|E

500|$|The show {{began with}} a woman dressed in an 18th-century white nightgown <b>who</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the {{audience}} briefly before disappearing. There was a video introduction in which different people told their dreams. At {{the end of the}} video, Spears appeared sleeping in a bubble. A platform with a wheel attached rose several feet above the ground, and she appeared strapped to it while wearing a black ensemble. She started rotating in a similar way to a target girl while starting to perform [...] "Oops!...I Did It Again" [...] with her dancers. [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] was performed next with Spears captured by her dancers. She left the stage for a costume change while her dancers performed. [...] "Overprotected" [...] was performed next with Spears (dressed in a futuristic version of one of Elvis Presley's jumpsuit) surrounded by laser lights. The video backdrop showed images of a bald Spears, with her hair growing as the song went along. In the next section, a giant musical box was raised, and Spears emerged from the middle as a ballerina to perform [...] "Born To Make You Happy". She tore off her tutu and put on a long white satin cote to perform [...] "Lucky" [...] while confetti was shot. The medley ended with a performance of [...] "Sometimes" [...] for which she donned a bathrobe.|$|E

[...] "Within hours there were men literally lining up at our door," [...] Dateline reported. In two-and-a-half days, 18 men showed up at the house after making a date with a Perverted-Justice volunteer.|$|E

2500|$|Toby Harnden {{said that}} IRA members in South Armagh <b>who</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{him in the}} late 1990s {{generally}} condemned the massacre. One of them, Volunteer M, {{was quoted as saying}} that it was [...] "a gut reaction [...] and a wrong one. The worst time in my life was in jail after Kingsmill. It was a dishonourable time". Another, Volunteer G, was quoted as saying that he [...] "never agreed with Kingsmill". Republican activist Peter John Caraher said that those ultimately responsible were [...] "the loyalists who shot the Reavey brothers". He added, [...] "It was sad that those people [...] had to die, but I'll tell you something, it stopped any more Catholics being killed". This view was reiterated by a County Tyrone republican and Gaelic Athletic Association veteran who spoke to Ed Moloney. [...] "It's a lesson you learn quickly on the football field... If you're fouled, you hit back", he said. Colin Worton, whose brother was killed in the massacre, said [...] "Kingsmill did stop Catholics being killed in South Armagh, but that doesn't justify it".|$|E
2500|$|On Saturday, March 20, 2010, {{during the}} NASCAR [...] "Saturday Night Showdown", where retired NASCAR drivers drove in a 35-lap race for charity, a terrifying crash {{involving}} Larry Pearson and Charlie Glotzbach {{ended up in}} a near-tragedy. The race was put under immediate red flag. Pearson spun out in turn 2, and as his car was sliding down the track, Glotzbach exited turn 2 and rammed into the driver's door of Pearson's car. As Glotzbach climbed out of his car and went to the infield care center, Pearson was unconscious in his car while rescue workers sawed off the roof of the car to get him out. After they got Pearson out, he regained consciousness, as reported by his brothers <b>who</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him. They also reported that Larry was able to move his arms around. Pearson was air lifted to a nearby hospital. Later, Glotzbach was driven to the same hospital. Before the race started back up, NASCAR legend David Pearson (Larry's father), who was also racing that day, withdrew from the race and went down to the hospital to see his son.|$|E
2500|$|Reese {{was born}} in Sweetwater, Nebraska, and died in Santa Maria, California. [...] He went to school in Nebraska and Kansas. [...] "I was the eldest of six {{children}} of a very poor couple. My father was a horse breaker and former cavalryman; my mother {{was the daughter of}} a frontier blacksmith and woodworker. I may be the last professional writer <b>who</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> those survivors of the 1880s and 1890s and {{who grew up in the}} same environment. It was a specialized education for one job alone, the one I have." [...] He married Margaret Smith in 1938, was divorced, and married Norma Spivack in 1962. [...] Altogether he had seven children, one of whom was adopted. [...] In addition to writing, John H. Reese worked for the U.S. Department of Internal Revenue and as a reporter for the Los Angeles Examiner in California and as a free-lance for newspapers in Mexico. His first Western novel was Signal Guns at Sunup written under the pseudonym of John Jo Carpenter. He is survived by his great granddaughter Kim who is also a published author.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the hour}} {{preceding}} the attack, 13 people including the shooter {{participated in the}} Bible study. [...] According to the accounts of people <b>who</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> survivors, when the shooter walked into the historic African-American church, he immediately asked for Pinckney and {{sat down next to}} him, initially listening to others during the study. He started to disagree when they began discussing Scripture. Eventually, after waiting for the other participants to begin praying, he stood up and pulled a gun from a fanny pack, aiming it at 87-year-old Susie Jackson. Jackson's nephew, 26-year-old Tywanza Sanders, tried to talk him down and asked him why he was attacking churchgoers. The shooter responded, [...] "I have to do it. You rape our women and you're taking over our country. And you have to go." [...] When he expressed his intention to shoot everyone, Sanders dove in front of Jackson and was shot first. The suspect then shot the other victims, all the while shouting racial epithets. He also reportedly said, [...] "Y'all want something to pray about? I'll give you something to pray about." [...] He reloaded his gun five times. Sanders' mother and his five-year-old niece, both attending the study, survived the shooting by pretending to be dead.|$|E
2500|$|After {{hiding out}} {{for nearly a}} week, Duane Peak was arrested for the crime on August 28. [...] In his first {{statement}} to police, without having consulted an attorney, Peak {{said that there was}} an envelope for him at NCCF headquarters on Sunday, August 16. Inside, a note told him to go in back of the Lothrop Drug store and pick up a suitcase, which he did before 5 p.m. He was instructed to take the suitcase to an address near 28th and Ohio at 11 p.m. that night and leave it on the field side of a fence. The note told him to go to a particular payphone before 2 a.m. and wait for a phone call. The phone rang and a woman's voice told him to call 911 and report a woman dragged into 2867 Ohio. The police report indicates that he admitted to placing the 911 call. Peak implicated neither Rice nor Poindexter in his first statement. [...] There are no police reports for August 29 or August 30, so it is unknown <b>who</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him over the weekend, though in his February 4, 1971 deposition, Peak said that Lt. James Perry interrogated him several times over that weekend. On Monday, August 31, Peak told the County Attorney Art O'Leary in a deposition, that Poindexter had made the bomb at Rice's house, told him to plant it, and then lure the police to the vacant house with an anonymous 911 call. (Peak allegedly carried a suitcase bomb with a clothespin triggering device into three vehicles and to two different residences from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. that day, at one point putting it in the trunk of a car because there were seven passengers in the car including his two small nieces.) ATF Agent Tom Sledge, brother of the Omaha police officer assigned to the call, was present during Peak's deposition, as were two Omaha Police officers, Bill Coleman and Pitmon Foxall and Peak's attorney, Tom Carey, although Peak had to ask the County Attorney who Carey was.|$|E
