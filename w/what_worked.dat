25|$|In 1990, Richard Pascale {{wrote that}} {{relentless}} change requires that businesses continuously reinvent themselves. His famous maxim is “Nothing fails like success” {{by which he}} means that what was a strength yesterday becomes the root of weakness today, We tend to depend on <b>what</b> <b>worked</b> yesterday and refuse {{to let go of}} <b>what</b> <b>worked</b> so well for us in the past. Prevailing strategies become self-confirming. To avoid this trap, businesses must stimulate a spirit of inquiry and healthy debate. They must encourage a creative process of self-renewal based on constructive conflict.|$|E
25|$|As {{commonly}} argued by Dewey’s greatest critics, he was {{not able}} to come up with strategies in order to fulfill his ideas that would lead to a successful democracy, educational system, and a successful women’s suffrage movement. While knowing that traditional beliefs, customs, and practices needed to be examined in order to find out <b>what</b> <b>worked</b> and what needed improved upon, it was never done in a systematic way. “Dewey became increasingly aware of the obstacles presented by entrenched power and alert to the intricacy of the problems facing modern cultures”. With the complex of society at the time, Dewey was criticized for his lack of effort in fixing the problems.|$|E
25|$|Nations do not {{necessarily}} need wealth to gain health. For example, Sri Lanka had a maternal mortality rate of 2% in the 1930s, higher than any nation today. It reduced it to 0.5–0.6% in the 1950s and to 0.6% today while spending less each year on maternal health because it learned <b>what</b> <b>worked</b> and what did not. Knowledge on the cost effectiveness of healthcare interventions can be elusive and educational measures {{have been made to}} disseminate what works, such as the Copenhagen Consensus. Cheap water filters and promoting hand washing {{are some of the most}} cost effective health interventions and can cut deaths from diarrhea and pneumonia.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{commenced}} on 20 August 1968 after {{a summer}} of pre-production. Director Ken Turner, who headed the location unit, recalled that The Secret Service became a complex series to shoot because it incorporated three design elements (studio puppet filming, studio special effects filming and live-action location filming). In a reversal to the practice used on earlier Supermarionation productions, location filming needed to be completed first before work could start at the Century 21 Studios.

500|$|The Daily Telegraphs Gavin Fuller praised Pullman's {{portrayal}} of Danes, singling {{it out as}} the strongest of the series next to lead female actor Eve Myles. Fuller also felt that giving such an unlikeable character a prominent focus and allowing him a shot at redemption in the final episode [...] "was certainly a brave move from Davies." [...] In a post-series review of <b>what</b> <b>worked</b> and what did not during Torchwood's fourth series, Digital Spys Morgan Jeffrey stated that [...] "Bill Pullman {{made the most of}} his tenure as Oswald Danes, being both extremely charismatic and utterly repellent throughout." [...] Jeffrey stated that [...] "we never like Oswald, but Pullman's layered performance ensures that we do often sympathise with him, before having the rug pulled swiftly out from under us as he commits yet another heinous crime."

500|$|Saville {{entered the}} Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., in September 1938, and {{graduated}} the following June. He then {{was assigned to}} Washington, D.C., as assistant to {{the chief of the}} Plans Division in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps. He assumed the role of assistant intelligence and operations officer of the Air Defense Command (ADC) at Mitchel Field in March 1940. Led by Brigadier General James E. Chaney, the ADC was tasked with testing various air defense measures to determine <b>what</b> <b>worked.</b> Chaney was unfamiliar with air defense, and he made Saville the coordinator of all projects. This was the first time Saville was able to test and implement his theories on a large scale. New SCR-270 radar units were tried out and incorporated into the command scheme, giving greater reach to ground controllers. Army maneuvers held at Watertown, New York, in August 1940 allowed Saville to prove that fighter aircraft could protect a domestic target from air attack long before anti-aircraft artillery could fire, a result that Chaney said [...] "astonished" [...] high-ranking Army observers.|$|E

500|$|Thrud the Barbarian {{was one of}} {{the best}} loved pieces in White Dwarf over the five years that the strip ran, being voted [...] "Most popular feature" [...] for three {{consecutive}} years during the magazine's golden age. Long-term fans of Thrud were excited and nostalgic to see him return in his own full-length comic, but were concerned that the idea would not stretch to 24pages. In reviewing issue 1, Jez Higgins, writing on TRS2, and Robert Clark of Strike to Stun, considered the comic a success that was more than one joke spread thin and which was not limited by the single page brevity of the original strip. Steven Maxwell of Bulletproof Comics, however, found that <b>what</b> <b>worked</b> well within the constraints of a single page seemed stretched when spun out over 24. Issue 2 received similarly mixed reviews, with Clark criticising the comic for being much the same, with the same themes and joke as issue 1 while Glenn Carter of Comics Bulletin found it to be well written light reading with quite a few elements of humour. Overall, the comic was deemed a success, with even the more negative reviewers awarding it 6 out of 10 and looking forward to more issues.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 33 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, stating that the band seemed more settled and comfortable while [...] "accentuating the big riffs and bigger emotions, crafting songs without a worry as to whether they're hip or not and, most importantly, enjoying the deep-rooted, nervy arena rock that is uniquely their own." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News gave the album four out of five stars, commenting that while [...] "some key sounds and sensibilities" [...] and uplifting lyrics were unlike Pearl Jam's earlier style, the music in Lightning Bolt marked a return to the [...] "thick-bottomed rhythms, hard-nosed guitars and darkened tone of classic Pearl Jam" [...] compared to predecessor Backspacer. Cole Waterman of PopMatters gave the album an eight out of ten, praising [...] "Pearl Jam thriving in their persona, building on <b>what</b> <b>worked</b> in the past without trying to copy it while adding new elements to the mix" [...] and feeling that despite [...] "the closing songs get monotonous in their united balladry", [...] "Future Days" [...] was a good album closer, comparing it to Tom Waits.|$|E

Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing.

[...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted.

500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took <b>what</b> <b>worked</b> and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E
500|$|For {{several years}} Disney had been {{considering}} building a theme park. When he visited Griffith Park in Los Angeles with his daughters, {{he wanted to}} be in a clean, unspoiled park, where both children and their parents could have fun. He visited the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was heavily influenced by the cleanliness and layout of the park. In March 1952 he received zoning permission to build a theme park in Burbank, near the Disney studios. This site proved too small, and a larger plot in Anaheim, [...] south of the studio, was purchased. To distance the project from the studiowhich might attract the criticism of shareholdersDisney formed WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney Imagineering) and used his own money to fund a group of designers and animators to work on the plans; those involved became known as [...] "Imagineers". After obtaining bank funding he invited other stockholders, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatrespart of American Broadcasting Company (ABC)and Western Printing and Lithographing Company. In mid-1954, Disney sent his Imagineers to every amusement park in the U.S. to analyze <b>what</b> <b>worked</b> and what pitfalls or problems there were in the various locations and incorporated their findings into his design. Construction work started in July 1954, and Disneyland opened in July 1955; the opening ceremony was broadcast on ABC, which reached 70million viewers. The park was designed as a series of themed lands, linked by the central Main Street, U.S.A.a replica of the main street in his hometown of Marceline. The connected themed areas were Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland. The park also contained the narrow gauge Disneyland Railroad that linked the lands; around the outside of the park was a high berm to separate the park from the outside world. An editorial in The New York Times considered that Disney had [...] "tastefully combined some of the pleasant things of yesterday with fantasy and dreams of tomorrow". Although there were early minor problems with the park, it was a success, and after a month's operation, Disneyland was receiving over 20,000 visitors a day; by the end of its first year, it attracted 3.6million guests.|$|E

The second season sees more medical mysteries and twist with each episode as Dr. Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and her team are back to handle everything from a child kidnapping to a murder where the entire city could be suspect. Along with murder and other crimes, the team deals with a new romance and Hunt continues to work around strained relationships with her ex-husband and boss. The series still feels formulaic and doesn't quite fire on all cylinders for me, but season two was an improvement. The series leaves you wanting to see what will happen in season three.|$|E
