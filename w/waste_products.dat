5|$|Clearing waste: CSF {{allows for}} the removal of <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> from the brain, and is {{critical}} in the brain's lymphatic system. Metabolic <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> diffuse rapidly into the CSF and are removed into the bloodstream as CSF is absorbed.|$|E
5|$|The atria of {{the heart}} also {{function}} {{as part of the}} excretory system by filtering <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> out of the blood and dumping it into the coelom as urine. A pair of nephridia ("little kidneys") to the rear of and connected to the coelom extracts any re-usable materials from the urine and dumps additional <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> into it, and then ejects it via tubes that discharge into the mantle cavity.|$|E

5|$|Several Parkinson-related {{genes are}} {{involved}} in the function of lysosomes, organelles that digest cellular <b>waste</b> <b>products.</b> It has been suggested that some cases of PD may be caused by lysosome dysfunctions that reduce the ability of cells to break down alpha-synuclein.|$|E
5|$|The {{antibiotics}} neomycin and metronidazole {{are other}} antibiotics {{used to treat}} hepatic encephalopathy. The rationale of their use {{was the fact that}} ammonia and other <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> are generated and converted by intestinal bacteria, and killing these bacteria would reduce the generation of these <b>waste</b> <b>products.</b> Neomycin was chosen because of its low intestinal absorption, as neomycin and similar aminoglycoside antibiotics may cause hearing loss and kidney failure if used by injection. Later studies showed that neomycin was indeed absorbed when taken by mouth, with resultant complications. Metronidazole, similarly, is less commonly used because prolonged use can cause nerve damage, in addition to gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E
5|$|The tentacles then {{contract}} {{to bring the}} prey into the stomach. Once the prey is digested, the stomach reopens, allowing the elimination of <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> {{and the beginning of}} the next hunting cycle. They can scavenge drifting organic molecules and dissolved organic molecules.|$|E

50|$|Pyrrhotite is a <b>waste</b> <b>product</b> of the Desulfovibrio bacteria, a sulfate {{reducing}} bacteria.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method is}} {{oxidative}} cleavage of cyclohexene using hydrogen peroxide. The <b>waste</b> <b>product</b> is water.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies demonstrating {{the central role}} of ammonia, ammonia levels do not always correlate with the severity of the encephalopathy; it is suspected that this means that more ammonia has already been absorbed into the brain in those with severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low. Other <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> implicated in hepatic encephalopathy include mercaptans (substances containing a thiol group), short-chain fatty acids, and phenol.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about how ctenophores get rid of <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> {{produced}} by the cells. The ciliary rosettes in the gastrodermis may help to remove wastes from the mesoglea, and may also help to adjust the animal's buoyancy by pumping water into {{or out of the}} mesoglea.|$|E
5|$|Most spiders convert {{nitrogenous}} <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> into uric acid, {{which can}} be excreted as a dry material. Malphigian tubules ("little tubes") extract these wastes from the blood in the hemocoel and dump them into the cloacal chamber, from which they are expelled through the anus. Production of uric acid and its removal via Malphigian tubules are a water-conserving feature that has evolved independently in several arthropod lineages that can live far away from water, for example the tubules of insects and arachnids develop from completely {{different parts of the}} embryo. However, a few primitive spiders, the sub-order Mesothelae and infra-order Mygalomorphae, retain the ancestral arthropod nephridia ("little kidneys"), which use large amounts of water to excrete nitrogenous <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> as ammonia.|$|E

50|$|These {{compounds}} form {{during the}} catabolism of carbohydrates and lipids in condensation reactions, {{and in some}} other metabolic reactions of the amino acids. Oxygen is produced by plants and some bacteria in photosynthesis, while CO2 is a <b>waste</b> <b>product</b> of all animals and plants. Nitrogen gases are produced by denitrifying bacteria and as a <b>waste</b> <b>product,</b> and bacteria for decaying yield ammonia, as do most invertebrates and vertebrates. Water is the only liquid waste from animals and photosynthesizing plants.|$|R
5|$|Sponges' cells absorb oxygen by {{diffusion}} {{from water}} into cells as water flows through body, into which {{carbon dioxide and}} other soluble <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> such as ammonia also diffuse. Archeocytes remove mineral particles that threaten to block the ostia, transport them through the mesohyl and generally dump them into the outgoing water current, although some species incorporate them into their skeletons.|$|E
5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E
5|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2), {{adenosine}} monophosphate (AMP) and phosphate groups (PP) are released as <b>waste</b> <b>products.</b> Luciferase catalyzes the reaction, {{which may be}} mediated by cofactors such as calcium (Ca2+) or magnesium (Mg2+) ions, and for some types of luciferin (L) also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction can occur either inside or outside the cell. In bacteria such as Aliivibrio, the expression of genes related to bioluminescence {{is controlled by the}} lux operon.|$|E

5|$|In {{other parts}} of the body, {{circulation}} in the lymphatic vasculature clears extracellular <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> from the cell tissue. For the tissue of the brain, such a system has not yet been identified. However, the presence of a glymphatic pathway has been proposed. Newer studies from two laboratories have shown the presence of meningeal lymphatic vessels running alongside the blood vessels, and these have been shown with lymph valves, to be more extensive {{at the base of the}} brain where they exit with the cranial nerves.|$|E
5|$|MOX fuel {{improves}} total burnup. A {{fuel rod}} is reprocessed {{after three years}} of use to remove <b>waste</b> <b>products,</b> which by then account for 3% of the total weight of the rods. Any uranium or plutonium isotopes produced during those three years are left and the rod goes back into production. The presence of up to 1% gallium per mass in weapons-grade plutonium alloy has the potential to interfere with long-term operation of a light water reactor.|$|E
5|$|Nemertea use organs called protonephridia to excrete soluble <b>waste</b> <b>products,</b> {{especially}} nitrogenous by-products {{of cellular}} metabolism. In nemertean protonephridia, flame cells which filter out the wastes {{are embedded in}} the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels. The flame cells remove the wastes into two collecting ducts, one on either side, and each duct has one or more nephridiopores through which the wastes exit. Semiterrestrial and freshwater nemerteans have many more flame cells than marines, sometimes thousands. The {{reason may be that}} osmoregulation is more difficult in non-marine environments.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{use their}} leaves to {{intercept}} sunlight. The energy {{is used to}} reduce carbon dioxide from the air with electrons from water to make sugars (and other biomass) and a <b>waste</b> <b>product,</b> oxygen, {{in the process of}} photosynthesis. Leaves also respire, in a similar way to animals, by burning their biomass to generate chemical energy. This energy is temporarily stored in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which acts as an energy currency for metabolism in all living things. As a <b>waste</b> <b>product,</b> respiration produces carbon dioxide.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{differences}} between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines. This short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. The valve provides a long surface area, requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> pass into the cloaca.|$|E
5|$|The {{space between}} the skin and gut is filled with mesenchyme, a {{connective}} tissue made of cells and reinforced by collagen fibers that act {{as a type of}} skeleton, providing attachment points for muscles. The mesenchyme contains all the internal organs and allows the passage of oxygen, nutrients and <b>waste</b> <b>products.</b> It consists of two main types of cell: fixed cells, some of which have fluid-filled vacuoles; and stem cells, which can transform into any other type of cell, and are used in regenerating tissues after injury or asexual reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros {{were more likely to}} be <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they {{were more likely to be}} artefacts at the end of their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E
