5|$|As with {{previous}} Star Trek films, existing props and footage were reused where possible to save money, though The Voyage Home required less of this than previous films. The Earth Spacedock interiors and control booth sets were reused from The Search for Spock, although the computer monitors in these scenes featured new graphics—the old reels had deteriorated in storage. Stock {{footage of the}} destruction of the Enterprise and the Bird-of-Prey's movement through space were reused. While the Bird-of-Prey bridge <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> new design, other parts of the craft's interior were also redresses; the computer room was a modification of the reactor room where Spock died in The Wrath of Khan. After all other Bird-of-Prey bridge scenes were completed, the entire set was painted white for one shot that transitioned into a dream sequence during the time travel.|$|E
5|$|Claims that Stroheim's {{original}} cut <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> unabridged {{version of}} McTeague are not accurate. Stroheim's 300-page script {{was almost as}} long as the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones. In the Norris novel, McTeague's back story in Placer County and relationships with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In Stroheim's original Greed, this sequence took up the first hour of the film and was not a flashback. Stroheim also modernized the novel's time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century later than the novel.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{agreed with}} Blount's report, which found the populace to {{be opposed to}} annexation. Liliuokalani {{initially}} refused to grant amnesty {{as a condition of}} her reinstatement, saying that she would either execute or banish the current government in Honolulu, but Dole's government refused to yield their position. By December 1893, the matter was still unresolved, and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress. In his message to Congress, Cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the Congress to continue the American tradition of non-intervention (see excerpt at right). The Senate, under Democratic control but opposed to Cleveland, commissioned and produced the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount's findings and found the overthrow <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> internal affair. Cleveland dropped all talk of reinstating the Queen, and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the new Republic of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Environment Secretary, Peter Walker {{announced}} {{the entire length}} of the A303 would be upgraded as part of a new roads programme that would deliver 1,000 new miles of motorway by 1980. A bypass of Marsh was opened in 1976; it was (and remains) the only dual carriageway upgrade of the A303 through the Blackdown Hills. By the mid-1980s, the A303 had been extended from its original fork by Micheldever Station, next to the A30, eastwards to meet the M3 motorway, and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> uninterrupted dual carriageway westwards as far as Amesbury. Ilminster was bypassed around this time; however the new road was built as single carriageway with 3 lanes, which caused a serious safety hazard leading to several fatal accidents.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, construction of the motorway was further postponed because of onset of the Croatian War of Independence. The decade saw renewed discussion regarding construction of the motorway, including renewed considerations of its route. Soon, the originally devised route running through Bihać was set aside and two new routes were considered: One of them was {{a modified version of the}} original route, bypassing Bihać and running through the Plitvice Lakes region while the other <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> new route further to the west via Gospić and Zadar, which was eventually accepted for construction. Both of the alternative routes proposed that the Zagreb–Karlovac motorway already completed in 1972 were to be used as the northernmost section of the Zagreb–Split and Zagreb–Rijeka motorways.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after Ben Silverman {{was named}} {{co-chairman}} of NBC's entertainment division in 2007, he asked Greg Daniels {{to create a}} new comedy series. Silverman and Daniels previously worked together on The Office, a half-hour comedy Daniels adapted from the British comedy of the same name by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Daniels wrote the pilot for what eventually became Parks and Recreation along with series co-creator Michael Schur, who had served as a writer on The Office. Daniels and Schur had been considering ideas for a possible show with cast members Rashida Jones and Aziz Ansari, but the concept for the series did not form until they learned Amy Poehler could play the lead character. Once that casting was determined, the script for the pilot episode was first written in the summer of 2008 revolving around her as a city bureaucrat seeking to turn an enormous construction pit into a park. They also decided the script would include the mockumentary comedy style of The Office and, like that show, would allow for improvisation on set. However, they did not consider the script an Office spin-off and NBC officials vehemently insisted to media outlets that the show <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> separate series, despite the similarities between the two shows.|$|E
5|$|The National Championship Game against Stanford <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> {{different}} story. UConn {{started the}} game with its worst first half in school history by scoring only 12 points; only eleven teams in tournament history have been held to 12 points or less in the first half: {{three of them were}} against UConn teams, and two of them (Southern and Temple) just days earlier in the 2010 Tournament. Stanford itself only managed to score 20 points in the first half. Maya Moore gave UConn the lead (23–22) in the second half with a three-pointer and led the team on a scoring run of 30–6 that eventually secured the national championship with a final score of 53–47. It was the only game in the Huskies' 78-game winning streak that was won by fewer than 10 points. Moore was named the Tournament Most Outstanding Player, to go along with her second straight Wade Trophy award and Academic All-America of the Year award. Charles, who won the John R. Wooden Award and Naismith College Player of the Year awards, was chosen first overall in the WNBA draft days later.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} era (10th–14th editions, 1901–1973), the Britannica was managed by American {{businessmen}} who introduced direct marketing and door-to-door sales.

The 10th edition was a nine-volume {{supplement to the}} 9th, but the 11th edition <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> new work, and is still praised for excellence; its owner, Horace Hooper, lavished enormous effort on its perfection.|$|E

Pennsylvania <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> free state when the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 was passed by Congress {{as part of the}} Compromise of 1850.

25|$|Britannica by the 6th edition {{was in some}} regards hopelessly out of date. The {{supplement}} to the 3rd edition contained updates which {{were not included in}} it, and which had become dated themselves anyway, the 4th edition expanded the text somewhat but revised very little, and the 5th and 6th were just reprints of the 4th.

The House of Hermès (Couture Department) designed extravagant creations just for her. She was a noted collector of fine antiques, favoring pieces like her famous collection of Second French Empire furniture. She {{was also a}} jewellery connoisseur and had an extensive jewellery collection, including the 41.37 carat (8.274 g), D-flawless Ashoka diamond. In 1968, she commissioned a serpent diamond necklace from Cartier Paris. The result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> articulated serpent made out of platinum and white gold and encrusted with 178.21 carats (35.642 g) of diamonds.

Another North Korean having served as a soldier recalled that he felt disgusted by the pictures. Other ex-soldiers like Lim Young-sun, who runs the online television channel Unification Broadcasting, which shows North Korean propaganda to help in understanding the culture of the North, have stated that the leaflets and contents like candy dropped on the North Korean soil actually calmed their initial hostility towards the South Koreans. The New York Times reported in 2016 that there has been no reliable study on how many North Koreans read the leaflets, or how they react on them. In comparison, South Korean people are known to mostly ignore North Korean leaflets as South Korea is a democratic society with distinct political values.|$|E
25|$|Don Quixote {{was brought}} from Russia to other {{countries}} first by Anna Pavlova's company in 1924 in an abridged version of Gorsky's 1902 production, though the full-length work was not staged abroad for many years.

The first full-length production mounted outside of Russia <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> new staging, produced and choreographed by Ninette de Valois for The Royal Ballet in 1950. The first full revival of the original Russian production to be staged in the West was by Ballet Rambert in 1962. In 1966 Rudolf Nureyev staged his version for the Vienna State Opera Ballet, with Minkus' score adapted by John Lanchbery. In 1973, Nureyev filmed his version with the Australian Ballet and Robert Helpmann as Don Quixote. Mikhail Baryshnikov mounted his own version in 1980 for American Ballet Theatre, a production that has been staged by many companies, including the Royal Ballet, though the company would later stage Nureyev's version and most recently, Carlos Acosta's. Today the ballet has been staged by many companies all over the world in many different versions, and is considered to be among the great classics of the ballet.|$|E
