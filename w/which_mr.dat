5|$|On Thursday morning 20 June two {{defendants}} were indicted for stealing silverware {{from the home}} of Rev. J. Vachell in Littleport and one was charged with receiving the stolen goods.

5|$|The boys take Marvin to an all-you-can-eat buffet, {{where he}} is shocked by how much food the townsfolk consume {{compared}} to his home country, and by how wasteful Cartman is with his food. Back at school, Mr. Garrison announces the food drive is a failure because students have brought {{in only a few}} cans of creamed corn. The boys present Marvin to the class during show and tell, after <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Garrison and Principal Victoria tell the boys they will have to call Red Cross and send Marvin home. Meanwhile, Dr. Mephisto shows Chef that the turkey DNA is growing so rapidly that the turkeys might take over the world if they are not stopped.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E
5|$|During another {{summer with}} his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, Harry Potter and Dudley are {{attacked}} by Dementors. After using magic to save Dudley and himself, Harry is expelled from Hogwarts, {{but the decision}} is later rescinded. Harry is whisked off {{by a group of}} wizards (including the real Mad-Eye Moody, Professor Lupin, and several new faces, including Nymphadora Tonks, a bubbly young witch who is a Metamorphmagus , and Kingsley Shacklebolt, a senior Auror who believes everyone is equal) to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, the former home of his godfather, Sirius Black. The building also serves as the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, of <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> and Mrs. Weasley, Lupin, Mad-Eye, and Sirius are members. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger explain that the Order of the Phoenix is a secret organisation led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort and his followers, the Death Eaters. From the members of the Order, Harry and the others learn that Voldemort is seeking an object {{that he did not have}} prior to his first defeat, and assume this object to be a weapon of some sort. Harry learns that the Ministry of Magic, led by Cornelius Fudge, is refusing to acknowledge Voldemort's return because of the trouble that doing so would cause, and has been running a smear campaign against him and Dumbledore.|$|E

25|$|Rosalind Ivy Fuller was {{the third}} of four daughters born to a Portsmouth draper, whose eldest child was a son, Walter (born 1881). Behind the draper’s shop was a hall in <b>which</b> <b>Mr</b> Fuller {{organized}} free public entertainment on Sunday afternoons, having his daughters recite, sing and play various instruments – the eldest girl learned the harp, for instance. Rosalind, who was called Ivy by her family until she was 21, when she opted for her first given name, always disliked having to perform on stage because she suffered agonies of self-consciousness.|$|E

In the final Christmas special, Sampson, a card sharp, steals {{a letter from the}} Prince of Wales to his mistress, Rose's friend Freda Ward, which, if made public, would create a scandal; the entire Crawley family connives to {{retrieve}} it, though it is Bates who extracts the letter from Sampson's overcoat, and it is returned to Mrs Ward.|$|E
25|$|On 1 March 2012, the {{advocate}} depute led evidence from Sgt Paul Grainger of Lothian and Borders Police.

Sgt Grainger told the court that during the interview he noticed a scar on Mr Gilroy's forehead under his hairline and {{that there had been}} some sort of scratch on his chin. The court also heard that Gilroy had told police, that on the evening of 2 May 2010 he and Suzanne Pilley had decided to split up and then took part in a Buddhist-style religious ceremony, writing their feelings down on pieces of paper and burning them.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{attracted}} ridicule. He {{was strongly}} criticised by “The Morning Post” (“a costly blunder for <b>which</b> <b>Mr</b> W. Churchill {{must be held}} responsible”) while Admiral Beatty wrote to his wife that Churchill had been “a darned fool” and “mad”. Asquith wrote to Venetia Stanley likening Churchill to a tiger which has “tasted blood” and who was hinting that he wanted other opportunities for a major field command, and that he preferred military glory to political success. By 13 October Asquith was writing of “the wicked folly of it all” and that Churchill had led “sheep to the shambles”. He faced criticism for his poor judgement from his wife Clementine (he missed {{the birth of his}} daughter Sarah), and in his later writing conceded that he might have done things differently.The Dunkirk force was also wound up after others, including Asquith, grew irritated about it.|$|E

25|$|In August 2005, elderly Daisy Fuller {{is on her}} deathbed in a New Orleans {{hospital}} as Hurricane Katrina approaches. She starts rambling to her daughter, Caroline, about a train station built in 1918 and Mr. Gateau, the best clockmaker {{in all of the}} South, who was hired to make a clock for it. Mr. Gateau was blind, and lost his son in World War I, which crushed him, but he continued to labor over his clock. When it was unveiled at the station, the public was surprised to see that the clock ran backwards, to <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gateau says he made it that way so that the boys they lost in the war could come back again and live their lives that were ended too soon. After that, Mr. Gateau was never seen again, and people speculated he died of a broken heart or went out to sea.|$|E
25|$|On 9 June 1995, Mr Dixon, aged 47, and {{his wife}} were {{passengers}} on Ansett New Zealand Flight 703 when the aircraft crashed in the Tararua Ranges near Palmerston North. Mr Dixon escaped from the wreckage with fractures. However, despite his injuries, he returned to the aircraft to help other passengers trapped in the wreckage. As a result of this selfless action, he was critically burned when a flash fire broke out on the left wing of the aircraft near a hole in the fuselage from which he was helping passengers escape. He was hospitalised and underwent surgery and skin grafts. Mr Dixon remained in a coma, and although he made some initial improvement, his condition worsened and he died two weeks later, the fourth victim of the crash. The situation in <b>which</b> <b>Mr</b> Dixon found himself was extremely dangerous and he displayed great bravery in returning to the aircraft, although injured, to help other passengers which subsequently resulted in the loss of his own life. His bravery undoubtedly ensured that the loss of life was not greater.|$|E
25|$|Malthus went on {{to argue}} that under such ideal conditions, the {{population}} could conceivably double every 25 years. However, the food supply could not continue doubling at this rate for even 50 years. The food supply would become inadequate for the growing population, and then:...the mighty law of self-preservation expels all the softer and more exalted emotions of the soul.... The corn is plucked before it is ripe, or secreted in unfair proportions; and the whole black train of vices that belong to falsehood are immediately generated. Provisions no longer flow in {{for the support of}} the mother with a large family. The children are sickly from insufficient food.... No human institutions here existed, to the perverseness of <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Godwin ascribes the original sin of the worst men. No opposition had been produced by them between public and private good. No monopoly had been created of those advantages which reason directs to be left in common. No man had been goaded to the breach of order by unjust laws. Benevolence had established her reign in all hearts: and yet in so short a period as within fifty years, violence, oppression, falsehood, misery, every hateful vice, and every form of distress, which degrade and sadden the present state of society, seem to have been generated by the most imperious circumstances, by laws inherent in the nature of man, and absolutely independent of it human regulations.|$|E

25|$|Back at Regina's office, Hades {{is able to}} {{put back}} {{together}} the Olympian Crystal with Zelena's help. Zelena then sees Emma {{trying to break the}} protection spell that Zelena put on the town hall knowing that Emma wants to kill Hades (after she saw the new pages appear in front of her), leading to a confrontation between the women. Back inside the town hall after they entered through a tunnel, Regina and Robin uses Zelena's distraction to take the baby, only to be caught by Hades, who wants to use the crystal to destroy Regina first explaining that the crystal won't allow the person {{to move on to the}} Underworld but rather simply destroying their very presence, but Robin sacrifices himself as he saves Regina from being destroyed by Hades. Then Zelena comes in, and picks up the crystal as Hades tempted Zelena to kill Regina, only to have Zelena realize that Hades never changed and kills Hades instantly by stabbing the crystal through his heart. Later, Emma, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, Regina, Zelena and others attend Robin Hood's funeral, as Zelena tells Regina that she has named her daughter Robin in honor of her father. Emma decides to stay for a couple more minutes, and notices a resurrected Hook, who was brought back by Zeus as a reward for helping to defeat Hades, and the two are happily reunited. During this time, Mr. Gold comes inside Regina's office, and it is revealed that a piece of the Olympian Crystal is still around, <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gold collects for a new plan.|$|E
25|$|The main {{minority}} grievance {{regards the}} appointment of muftis. The Greek government started appointing muftis instead of holding elections {{after the death of}} Mufti of Komotini in 1985 (which is a failure to implement Law 2345/1920 according to Cultural Survival), although the Greek government maintained that as the practice of state-appointed muftis is widespread (including in Turkey), this practice should be adhered to in Greece, and as the muftis perform certain judicial functions in matters of family and inheritance law, the state ought to appoint them. Human Rights Watch alleges that this is against Lausanne Treaty which grants the Muslim minority the right to organize and conduct religious affairs free from government interference (although it is unclear whether issues such as inheritance law are religious matters). As such, there are two muftis for each post, one elected by the participating faithful, and one appointed by Presidential Decree. The elected Mufti of Xanthi is Mr Aga and the government recognized one is Mr Sinikoğlu; the elected Mufti of Komotini is Mr Şerif and the government recognized one is Mr Cemali. According to the Greek government, the elections by <b>which</b> <b>Mr</b> Aga and Mr Şerif were appointed were rigged and involved very little participation from the minority. As pretension of (religious) authority is a criminal offence against the lawful muftis under the Greek Penal Code, both elected muftis were prosecuted and on conviction, both were imprisoned and fined. When, however, the case was taken to the European Court of Human Rights, the Greek government was found to have violated the right to religious freedom of Mr Aga and Mr Şerif.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the nuclear}} {{stalemate}} became apparent, the Governments of East and West {{have adopted the}} policy <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Dulles calls 'brinkmanship'. This is a policy adapted from a sport which, I am told, is practiced by some youthful degenerates. This sport is called 'Chicken!'. It is played by choosing a long straight road with a white line down the middle and starting two very fast cars towards each other from opposite ends. Each car is expected to keep the wheels {{on one side of}} the white line. As they approach each other, mutual destruction becomes more and more imminent. If one of them swerves from the white line before the other, the other, as he passes, shouts 'Chicken!', and the one who has swerved becomes an object of contempt. As played by irresponsible boys, this game is considered decadent and immoral, though only the lives of the players are risked. But when the game is played by eminent statesmen, who risk not only their own lives but those of many hundreds of millions of human beings, it is thought on both sides that the statesmen on one side are displaying a high degree of wisdom and courage, and only the statesmen on the other side are reprehensible. This, of course, is absurd. Both are to blame for playing such an incredibly dangerous game. The game may be played without misfortune a few times, but sooner or later it will come to be felt that loss of face is more dreadful than nuclear annihilation. The moment will come when neither side can face the derisive cry of 'Chicken!' from the other side. When that moment is come, the statesmen of both sides will plunge the world into destruction.|$|E
