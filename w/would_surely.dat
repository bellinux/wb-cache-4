5|$|Akhtab {{eventually}} {{managed to}} enter and persuade them that the Muslims <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> be overwhelmed. The sight of the vast Confederate armies, surging over the land with soldiers and horses {{as far as the}} eye could see, swung the Qurayza opinion in the favour of the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
5|$|Elvis {{might never}} have been born, but someone else <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic {{accounts}} for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{influence}} on events, {{it was more}} than Napoleon's personality that took effect. He reorganized France itself to supply the men and money needed for wars. He inspired his men—Wellington said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers, for he inspired confidence from privates to field marshals. He also unnerved the enemy. At the Battle of Auerstadt in 1806, King Frederick William III of Prussia outnumbered the French by 63,000 to 27,000; however, when he was told, mistakenly, that Napoleon was in command, he ordered a hasty retreat that turned into a rout. The force of his personality neutralized material difficulties as his soldiers fought with the confidence that with Napoleon in charge they <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> win.|$|E
5|$|T.J. {{was born}} on June 6, 1981 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is of Armenian descent; {{he grew up in}} Cyprus, and came to the US {{for the first time in}} 1999. He is a Fulbright Scholar {{pursuing}} a master's degree in student affairs administration at Michigan State University. Outgoing and involved, T.J. is active in several student organizations pertaining to performance art, gender, and social change. He lives with other students in a housing cooperative. His mother lives in a close-knit Armenian community in Cyprus, where the news <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> travel if T.J. transitions. Because his mother opposes his transition, and because he must return to Cyprus for two years due to a travel visa requirement, he has not yet started HRT.|$|E
5|$|The zduhaći {{of a band}} {{would leave}} their bodies in sleep and gather at an {{appointed}} place, before flying into a battle. They used various weapons, such as spindles, beech buds, sharp splinters, leaves, stalks of straw, fluff, flakes, sand, long twigs, cornel stones, pine cones, eggshells, and other light objects. As believed in Herzegovina, zduhaći uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them. However, the most powerful zduhać weapon was held to be a stick of luč (resinous wood burned to give light or used as kindling) charred at both ends, or any charred splinter of wood. A zduhać who was hit with this weapon <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> die. People therefore avoided igniting the sticks at both ends, and they took care that no splinters were left half-burned.|$|E

5|$|The {{settlers}} {{were discovered}} in early May 1823 by the Mexican Eagle, a schooner from British Honduras carrying the Chief Magistrate of Belize, Marshal Bennet, to the Mosquito king's court. Seven men and three children had died, and many more were sick. Bennet informed them that Poyais did not exist {{and that he had}} never heard of this Cazique they spoke of. He advised them to return with him to British Honduras, as they <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> die if they stayed where they were. The majority preferred to wait for Hall to come back, hopefully with news of passage back to Britain. About half a week later Hall returned with the Mosquito king, who announced that MacGregor's land grant was revoked forthwith. He had never granted MacGregor the title of Cazique, he said, nor given him the right to sell land or raise loans against it; the emigrants were in fact in George Frederic Augustus's territory illegally and would have to leave unless they pledged allegiance to him. All the settlers left except for about 40 who were too weakened by disease to make the journey.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{appointed}} Northrop a {{brigadier general}} on November 26, 1864, {{but he did}} not risk sending the appointment to the Confederate Senate, where it <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> have been rejected.|$|E
25|$|On 2 August 2005 {{he issued}} {{ordinances}} establishing {{a new kind}} of work contract (called CNE) for small enterprises, with fewer guarantees than ordinary contracts. While Villepin's measures <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> have been approved by his wide UMP majority in Parliament. Villepin said the government needed to act fast, especially when Parliament was going on its summer recess.|$|E

In fact, {{the truth is that}} the Dean's figures were badly mixed, and the fault lay indubitably with the mathematical professor of two generations back.|$|R
25|$|Orville also {{relied on}} the {{unpublished}} statement by Stanley Beach. Orville wrote that Whitehead never told Beach he had flown, and that Beach believed none of Whitehead's aircraft ever left the ground under their own power. Orville asserted that if Whitehead had flown, Beach <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> have known about it after associating frequently with Whitehead for nine years and helping him financially.|$|E
25|$|Community {{leaders in}} 1961 {{had responded to}} demands for more student housing at the University of Oregon with a project known as the East Campus Urban Renewal. The project {{demolished}} historic homes east of the university and constructed large residence complexes surrounded by a landscaped campus that opened in 1965. Some reasoned that if a mall environment could work on a college campus, it <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> work in the downtown business district.|$|E
25|$|On July 11, 2007, Florida Marlins team {{president}} David Samson was {{featured on the}} show as he often is. When told by Dan about the report of Seattle Mariners player Ichiro Suzuki signing a 5-year, $100 million contract, Samson {{was in a state}} of disbelief. He went on to say that no player in baseball was worthy of that amount and that this deal <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> return the league to the days of ridiculous contracts, surely ruining the sport.|$|E

25|$|Meaning: Many Underlanders {{believe these}} lines {{refer to the}} death of Boots, because it <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> crush Gregor and make him useless to them as a warrior. Gregor and Nerissa, however, {{postulate}} that Gregor's hypothetical murder of the baby Bane would have been equally disastrous because it would have destroyed his humanity. This could have made him emotionally unstable, and the Bane's death would have inflamed the rats and destroyed their fragile peace with the humans.|$|E
25|$|In {{breeding}} experiments, Michael R. Rose selected {{fruit flies}} for long lifespan. Based on antagonistic pleiotropy, Rose expected that this <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> reduce their fertility. His team {{found that they}} were able to breed flies that lived more than twice as long as the flies they started with, but to their surprise, the long-lived, inbred flies actually laid more eggs than the short-lived flies. This was another setback for pleiotropy theory, though Rose maintains it may be an experimental artefact.|$|E
25|$|So Manoah {{offered to}} God a young goat and a meal-offering, {{and as the}} flame went up off the altar toward heaven, the angel ascended in the flame and disappeared, and Manoah and his wife fell on their faces, as Manoah {{realized}} that he was an angel. Manoah told his wife that they <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> die, as they had seen God, but she replied that if God had wanted to kill them, God would not have received the burnt-offering or shown them what God did.|$|E

50|$|Eventually Largo discovers another bit {{of amazing}} information. Nerio {{was not his}} step-father at all, but his {{biological}} parent. He kept Largo's existence a secret {{to protect him from}} The Commission, which <b>would</b> have <b>surely</b> used the son against the father.|$|R
50|$|Polls {{and analysts}} claimed Vujanović <b>would</b> most <b>surely</b> win {{the largest number}} of votes and {{face-off}} with Medojevic in the second round. Since Vujanovic won over 50 {{percent of the vote in}} the first round there was no need for a runoff.|$|R
25|$|Carmen Jones was a CinemaScope {{motion picture}} {{that had begun}} {{shooting}} within the first 12 months of Twentieth Century Fox's venture in 1953 to CinemaScope Technicolor as its main production mode. The historical costume drama, the western and the war film had filled Fox's production schedule and this all-black musical drama based on an established and popular opera <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> be a box-office success, as proved true. Carmen Jones was released in October 1954, exactly one year and one month after Fox's first CinemaScope venture, the Biblical epic The Robe, had opened in theatres.|$|E
25|$|First {{asserting that}} his own {{experience}} of God is continuous, Meher Baba explains that the upliftment produced by drugs is only temporary and thus not a true realization of Divinity; in the end, drugs lead only to madness, delusion, and hypocrisy. After one more disillusioning scene in Millbrook, Louis closes the door on drugs. He tells us that he stopped using LSD after it became illegal, but adds that {{had it not been}} for LSD, he <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> have taken his own life, just as his mother and grandfather did.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, Featherston drifts for a short while, before joining the newly created Freedom Party. Featherston establishes himself as head propagandist, and eventually becomes its leader, aided by Party member Ferdinand Koenig. With his raw energy and humble origins, Featherston has little trouble whipping up support from much of the Confederate populace, and it seems by the early 1920s that he <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> be leading the country. But with the assassination of President Wade Hampton V in June 1922 by a Party stalwart, the Freedom Party suffers a sudden and near-total collapse as a political force.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} is a list (taxonomically organized) of the breeding species of which at least 70% of their North American population rely upon the boreal forest for nesting. If the boreal forests were cleared, these species <b>would</b> almost <b>surely</b> perish or be endangered.|$|R
