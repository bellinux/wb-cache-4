5|$|John {{was born}} to Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine on 24 December 1166. Henry had {{inherited}} significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard—Anjou, Normandy and England—and expanded his empire by conquering Brittany. Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine, who reigned over the Duchy of Aquitaine and had a tenuous claim to Toulouse and Auvergne in southern France, {{in addition to being}} the former wife of Louis VII of France. The result was the Angevin Empire, named after Henry's paternal title as Count of Anjou and, more specifically, its seat in Angers. The Empire, however, was inherently fragile: although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry, the disparate parts each had their own histories, traditions and governance structures. As one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine, the extent of Henry's power in the provinces diminished considerably, scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all. Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time. It was unclear <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> empire on Henry's death. Although the custom of primogeniture, under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe, it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England. Most believed that Henry would divide the empire, giving each son a substantial portion, and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death. To complicate matters, much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the House of Capet. Henry had often allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor against France, making the feudal relationship even more challenging.|$|E
25|$|In 1947 an agreement, {{known as}} the Tripartite Agreement between India, Nepal and the United Kingdom was {{negotiated}} {{in order to determine}} <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gurkhas upon the formalisation of India's Independence. As a result of this agreement it was decided that of the pre-war Gurkha regiments, four would be transferred to the British Army, while six—one of which was the 1st Gurkhas—would become part of the newly independent Indian Army.|$|E
500|$|The World Without Us is a non-fiction {{book about}} <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> natural and built {{environment}} if humans suddenly disappeared, written by American journalist Alan Weisman {{and published by}} St. Martin's Thomas Dunne Books. It is a book-length expansion of Weisman's own February 2005 Discover article [...] "Earth Without People". Written largely as a thought experiment, it outlines, for example, how cities and houses would deteriorate, how long man-made artifacts would last, and how remaining lifeforms would evolve. Weisman concludes that residential neighborhoods would become forests within 500 years, and that radioactive waste, bronze statues, plastics, and Mount Rushmore would be among the longest-lasting evidence of human presence on Earth.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{initially}} scheduled to feature Dan Nelson on vocals. However, following the events later that year, {{he was no}} longer a member of the band. When asked <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> completed studio album featuring Nelson's vocals, Ian said: [...] "Until we have a new singer, I can't tell you {{what will happen to the}} record. We'll probably change a few things on it, including the vocals." [...] Ian also indicated that the album's release could be delayed until 2010. It was assumed that John Bush was going to record new vocals for the album after his reunion with the band. However, this did not happen. In an interview at the time, Bush said he was trying to re-record vocals for some of the songs that had already been recorded.|$|E
500|$|The {{unresolved}} {{question of}} <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mersey estuary if the canal was built had remained a sticking point. During questioning, an engineer for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board was {{asked how he}} would avoid such a problem. His reply, [...] "I should enter at Eastham and carry the canal along the shore until I reached Runcorn, and then I would strike inland", prompted Williams to change his design to include this suggestion. [...] Despite continued opposition, the committee's third bill, presented in November 1884, was passed by Parliament on 2 May 1885, and received royal assent on 6 August, becoming the Manchester Ship Canal Act 1885. Certain conditions were attached; £5million had to be raised, and the ship canal company was legally obliged to buy both the Bridgewater Canal and the Mersey & Irwell Navigation within two years. The estimated cost of construction was £5.16million, and the work was expected to take four years to complete.|$|E

Three days after Live Nation's endorsement, UK Athletics confirmed its formal support for West Ham United and Newham Council in their joint bid {{to take over the}} Olympic Stadium in legacy mode. In November 2010, West Ham commenced a search for potential developers for [...] "informal discussions" [...] about <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground if it were to win its bid to take over the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. According to the club, the site could be vacated and open to redevelopment by the summer of 2014. On 11 February 2011, the Olympic Park Legacy Committee selected West Ham as the preferred club to move into the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games.|$|E

500|$|Moon became {{involved}} in solo work {{when he moved to}} Los Angeles during the mid-1970s. In 1974, Track Records-MCA released a Moon solo single covering the Beach Boys' [...] "Don't Worry, Baby" [...] and [...] "Teenage Idol." [...] The next year he released his only solo album, entitled Two Sides of the Moon. Although it featured Moon on vocals, he played drums on only three tracks; most of the drumming was left to others (including Ringo Starr, session musicians Curly Smith and Jim Keltner and actor-musician Miguel Ferrer). The album was received poorly by critics. NME's Roy Carr wrote, [...] "Moonie, if you didn't have talent, I wouldn't care; but you have, which is why I'm not about to accept Two Sides of the Moon." [...] Dave Marsh, reviewing the album in Rolling Stone, wrote: [...] "There isn't any legitimate reason for this album's existence." [...] During one of his few televised solo drum performances (for ABC's Wide World), Moon played a five-minute drum solo dressed as a cat on transparent acrylic drums filled with water and goldfish. When asked by an audience member <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kit, he joked that [...] "even the best drummers get hungry." [...] His performance was not appreciated by animal lovers, several of whom called the station with complaints.|$|E
500|$|Three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were {{considered}} {{in that order}} by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. After Peters addressed the House {{in favor of the}} Maine bill, Connecticut's John Q. Tilson inquired if the proposed coin would replace the existing design (the Walking Liberty half dollar) {{for the rest of the}} year; Peters explained that it would not, and that only 100,000 coins would bear the commemorative design. [...] John Franklin Miller of Washington state asked who would bear the expenses of the coinage dies, and Peters responded that the state of Maine would. Virginia's Andrew Jackson Montague asked if the Treasury Department had endorsed the bill, and Peters informed him that both Houston and Baker had. Vestal asked that the bill be passed, but Ohio's Warren Gard had questions about <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coins once they entered circulation; Peters stated that they would, once issued, be treated as ordinary half dollars. In response to questions by Gard, Peters explained that although Maine would pay for the dies, they would become federal government property. Peters added that though there would be no statewide celebration in Maine for the centennial, there would be local observances. Gard had no further questions about the Maine bill (he would also quiz the sponsors of the Alabama and Pilgrim bills), and on Vestal's motion it passed without recorded dissent.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the public outcry, the LAUSD held meetings to determine <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trees. Walter Warriner, the Arborist {{of the city of}} Santa Monica proposed installing Rubbersidewalks by Rubbersidewalks, Inc., which could be easily lifted in order to prune the tree roots for maintenance. [...] After months of negations, the LAUSD decided not to remove the trees and agreed to install Rubbersidewalks, making University High School the first high school in the United States to use Rubbersidewalks in order to preserve its trees. Installation for the Rubbersidewalks started on November 20, 2003, over a year after the LAUSD had originally condemned the trees.Installation of the Rubbersidewalks was covered by Huell Howser for California's Gold. The episode covering Uni High's Rubbersidewalks aired on KCET on January 28, 2004. Rubber asphalt was also used to repave the pushed up concrete in the teachers' parking lot.|$|E
2500|$|Caballero {{was written}} in a decade marked by heated debate about the Mexican-American's place in United States society. The 1930s saw {{the birth of the}} League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and other {{organizations}} that promoted the cultural assimilation of peoples of Latin American heritage into mainstream United States culture. Within LULAC, however, there was disagreement about the forms and the extent of this assimilation. Male [...] "Lulackers" [...] typically promoted assimilation in public but sought to maintain patriarchal structures in private. Many females, however, countered this public/private assimilation and advocated for the modernization of gender roles, especially within Mexican-American homes. González was one of the more vocal of these women, and Caballero, which holds at its center a doomed patriarch who refuses to part ways with traditions that subordinate women, can be read as her [...] "warning of <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ethnic Mexican community if it resisted the democratization of [...] gender roles and ignored the modernization of Mexican American female subjectivity".|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 prime {{minister}} Kevin Rudd {{introduced a new}} asylum policy which meant that all asylum seekers arriving by boat would be sent offshore to Manus Island in Papua New Guinea for processing and resettlement. This included gay refugees, even though they face persecution under Papua New Guinean law with homosexual acts criminalised and a potential penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Asylum seekers are warned in an orientation presentation on arrival by the Salvation Army that [...] "Homosexuality is illegal in Papua New Guinea. People have been imprisoned or killed for performing homosexual acts." [...] This places them {{in the position of}} being required to declare their sexuality to be eligible for refugee protection yet liable to face persecution from other people and under local laws. Gay asylum seekers also face bullying, assault and sexual abuse on Manus Island from others, including officials and other refugees, due to their sexuality. Australia faces accusations from refugee advocates that it has violated its non-refoulement obligations under international law by exposing LGBT asylum seekers to such dangers. After the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea in 2016 ordered the closure of Manus Island immigration detention centre on the basis that it breached constitutional guarantees of liberty, the Australian government confirmed the closure but not <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> detainees.|$|E
