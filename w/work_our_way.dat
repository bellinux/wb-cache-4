500|$|In mid-1949, Nixon, {{although}} {{anxious to}} advance his political career, {{was reluctant to}} run for the Senate unless he was confident of winning the Republican primary. He considered his party's prospects in the House to be bleak, absent a strong Republican trend, and wrote [...] "I seriously doubt if we can ever <b>work</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> back in power. Actually, in my mind, I do not see any great gain in remaining a member of the House, even from a relatively good District, if it means we would be simply a vocal but ineffective minority." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't <b>work</b> <b>our</b> <b>way.</b> That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E
2500|$|Wall first {{suggests}} [...] "embedded markets", {{embedded in}} society, with [...] "state provision decentralised", {{as a first}} step to adapt capitalism. He cites the example of the Indian adivasis, who regained the land they originally inhabited and sold tea via the Fair trade system. Here, Wall argues that [...] "social preference rather than profit maximisation socialised economic activity". He welcomes the movements in Argentina that have seen workers occupy and reopen bankrupt factories. He applauds the work done on creating a [...] "decentralised, socialist economy" [...] in Cuba and Venezuela. Wall is encouraged by the growth in Green consumerism, noting that [...] "we cannot shop or <b>work</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to utopia, but such projects ease present ills and point roughly to a different future".|$|E
6000|$|... "At Melbourne," [...] {{said the}} captain, {{who was in}} a hurry to be off, [...] "we all separated, and Duckett and me <b>worked</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> home on a cargo-boat. We always stick together, Peter and me." ...|$|R
6000|$|And so we <b>worked</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{toward an}} argument. [...] "Confound this argument!" [...] I thought; but I had no skill in self-extraction, and my {{irritation}} crept into my voice. Three little spots of color {{came into the}} cheeks and nose of Mr. Gabbitas, but his voice showed nothing of his ruffled temper.|$|R
60|$|But {{where was}} Mr. Pike? Did the second mate {{know he was}} on deck? I {{proceeded}} to feel Mr. Mellaire out as we <b>worked</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> aft, along the mad poop toward the wheel. I talked about the difficulty of sleeping in stormy weather, stated the restlessness and semi-insomnia that the violent motion of the ship caused in me, and raised the query of how bad weather affected the officers.|$|R
2500|$|On March 26, 2008, Secretary Paulson said in remarks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, “As we <b>work</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{through this}} turbulence, our highest {{priority}} is limiting {{its impact on}} the real economy. We must maintain stable, orderly and liquid financial markets and our banks must continue to play their vital role of supporting the economy by making credit available to consumers and businesses. And we must of course focus on housing, which precipitated the turmoil in the capital markets, and is today the biggest downside risk to our economy. We must work to limit the impact of the housing downturn on the real economy without impeding the completion of the necessary housing correction. I will address each of these in turn. Regulators and policy makers are vigilant; we are not taking anything for granted.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In the lead-up to the 2010 federal election, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated [...] "I {{believe that}} this nation should be a republic. I also {{believe that this}} nation has got a deep affection for Queen Elizabeth." [...] It was her view {{that it would be}} {{appropriate}} for Australia to become a republic only once Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends. On the process for becoming a republic, Gillard said [...] "What I would like to see as the prime minister is that we <b>work</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> through to an agreement on a republic." [...] In 2010, then opposition leader Tony Abbott, who previously served as Executive Director of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, supported the status quo. He opined: [...] "While there may very well be further episodes of republicanism in this country, I am far from certain that, at least in our lifetimes, there's likely to be any significant change." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bianca's rape {{was heavily}} debated; viewers who despised the storyline argued the rape as [...] "punishment" [...] for her sexuality, and as unnecessary; others {{felt that it}} realistically {{captured}} what gay women sometimes face from men who want to force themselves on lesbians. When GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was asked by Metro Weekly why GLAAD sent out an action alert voicing their concern over the rape of Bianca, but two days later sent out another release which seemed to support how the storyline was told, Joan M. Garry, {{executive director of the}} organization, responded that they had [...] "some concerns" [...] about [...] and [...] "that the broader context of the [...] genre kind of needs to be taken into account." [...] Metro Weekly felt that this did not answer their question. They wanted to know why there was a sudden reversal in GLAAD's statement, specifically citing that GLAAD's second press release spoke of rape experience for lesbians and how men who rape lesbians not only engage in gender based acts of violence, but in acts of hate violence, and that this release was supportive of how Bianca's rape storyline was told, as opposed to GLAAD's first press release on the matter. Garry said she felt that their first press release concerning Bianca's rape was premature. Metro Weekly countered by asking what is the [...] "actual process" [...] GLAAD uses to select what to criticize, what raises their organization's red flags. [...] "There's a whole host of input we receive about things as we hear about them, as we see them in script form, as we see them in pilots," [...] Garry relayed. [...] "We have a strong team of program folks who represent different regions around the country, different communities. We get an awful lot of stuff that comes across the transom via our website raising concerns. And we did get quite a number of concerns coming over email, particularly about All My Children." [...] Garry continued, [...] "So it's basically community feedback, {{as well as some of}} our own observations and perceptions. Combine that with conversations that we have with folks that are actually producing the images and we really try to <b>work</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> through those different opinions and shape a position we think makes sense." ...|$|E
60|$|We had no trouble. We {{stopped in}} the plain with a family of peasants and stayed a week, helping them with their work for board and lodging, and making friends of them. We got clothes like theirs, and wore them. When we had <b>worked</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> through their {{reserves}} and gotten their confidence, we found that they secretly harbored French hearts in their bodies. Then we came out frankly and told them everything, and found them ready to do anything they could to help us.|$|R
5000|$|In early 2009, Elsley began finding writers for the North American version. Elsley said [...] "We {{started at}} the top of the Hollywood tree and <b>worked</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> down, and it wasn't until we got to the bottom that we {{actually}} found writers we liked. We started saying to agents, 'Who have you just taken on? Who's got a great play on somewhere?' And that turned up just incredible writers that have never done anything." [...] After reading 400 scripts around the clock, a team of six was formed.|$|R
6000|$|... [10] This is one {{of those}} {{beautiful}} ideas which so abound in all Bunyan's <b>works.</b> <b>Our</b> <b>way</b> to the kingdom is consecrated by the cross of Christ, and may be known throughout by the sprinkling of his blood, his groans, his agonies. All the doctrines that put us in the way are sanctified by the atonement; all the spurs to a diligent running in that way are powerful as motives, by our being bought with that precious price, the death of Emmanuel. O! my soul, be thou found looking unto Jesus, he is THE WAY, the only way to heaven.--Ed.|$|R

60|$|As we {{clung to}} the lee rail and <b>worked</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> aft, I {{happened}} to glance to leeward. The Ghost, at the moment, was uptossed on a sea, and I caught {{a clear view of}} a small steamship two or three miles away, rolling and pitching, head on to the sea, as it steamed toward us. It was painted black, and from the talk of the hunters of their poaching exploits I recognized it as a United States revenue cutter. I pointed it out to Maud and hurriedly led her aft to the safety of the poop.|$|R
60|$|We <b>worked</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> noiselessly {{along the}} rim-wall curve {{for several hundred}} yards {{and came to a}} halt again, this time with a splendid command of the situation. The trail ended {{abruptly}} at the dark cave, so menacingly staring at us, and the corner of the cliff had curled back upon itself. It was a box-trap, with a drop at the end, too great for any beast, a narrow slide of weathered stone running down, and the rim wall trail. Old Tom would plainly be compelled to choose one of these directions if he left his cave.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music in}} the short is pieced {{together}} {{from a number of}} contemporary Warner Brothers features. The featured song, [...] "Easy as Rollin' Off a Log", is written by M. K. Jerome and Jack Scholl and sung by Johnnie Davis and Mabel Todd in the 1937 film Over the Goal. Other songs used include [...] "You're an Education" [...] by Al Dubin and Harry Warren which was written for, but never used in Warner Brothers' 1938 feature film Gold Diggers in Paris and the Richard A. Whiting/Johnny Mercer song [...] "We're <b>Working</b> <b>our</b> <b>Way</b> through College" [...] from Warner Brothers' 1937 feature Varsity Show. Carl Stalling supervised the music soundtrack.|$|R
6000|$|... "It can," [...] said George. [...] "We know Holland and the Rhine. Very well, my {{suggestion}} is that we take the boat to Hamburg, see Berlin and Dresden, and <b>work</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to the Schwarzwald, through Nuremberg and Stuttgart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{trees are}} pretty thick in this orchard. Let us try to <b>work</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> from one tree to another {{until we can}} reach the fence. Then, perhaps, we can drop outside {{and get out of}} the way of that animal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} best {{thing we can do is}} to <b>work</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> around to the rocks," [...] said Dick after {{studying}} the situation. [...] "We can work up from the rocks to the outbuildings, and so on to the ranch itself--if we get the chance." ...|$|E
60|$|I didn't {{think this}} was possible, but I didn't stop to make any conjectures about it. Rectus and I ran up on the forward deck, {{to see how this}} {{agreeable}} change had come about. The moment we got outside, we found the wind blowing fearfully and the waves dashing as high as ever, but they were not plunging against our sides. We carefully <b>worked</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> along to the pilot-house, and looked in. The captain was inside, and when he saw us {{he opened the door and}} came out. He was going to his own room, just back of the pilot-house, and he told us to come with him.|$|R
30|$|In {{this review}} {{we have tried}} to bring {{together}} the knowledge available so far in the two fields of colloidal science and tunnel grouting. We have methodically <b>worked</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> through the different factors that may affect the silica gels, from the availability of different silica sols to the impact of environmental factors. We have found that these factors play an integrate part for the effectiveness of the silica gels as a grouting material. Also the behaviour of the gels can be predicted by understanding the chemistry of the key building block; the silica nanoparticles. This understanding will be critical for the future designing and refinement of silica sols for grouting purposes.|$|R

Informed by extensive data, the in-depth study examines the causes and consequences of highly prevalent unsafe abortion practices among Burmese migrant women. The report, the first to directly deal with sexual health issues among Burmese women, concludes with a series of recommendations intended for the Burmese community and Thai government and health officials alike. “Working conditions are not supportive of traditional community and family mechanisms and behaviors,” Cynthia Maung writes in the report. “It becomes difficult for women to address their domestic problems effectively. ...|$|R

60|$|Now {{we should}} have been in the Sanctuary, and in the full blaze of those awful columns of living fire. But they were out, or we had strayed elsewhere; at least the {{darkness}} was intense.

5000|$|After {{being passed}} {{for the lead}} on the final lap of the {{previous}} day's Xfinity Series race, Ryan Blaney rebounded to finish twelfth. [...] "It was a good run for us," [...] {{he said of the}} Indy run. [...] "I wish things played out a little better for us in the end, but it wasn't too bad when we finally got track position. That was so huge today. I thought when we {{got a little bit of}} clean air, we were pretty good. But it was hard to get that. We were in a good spot for that last restart but it really didn't go <b>our</b> <b>way.</b> I was wanting to get some help and the 2 car Keselowski, who finished tenth really didn't help us out. But I'm really proud of these guys. After starting 30th, we <b>worked</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> up there and I can't thank them enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was a {{long time}} before Marble forgave this speech. He said it was [...] "un{{patriotic}};" [...] a word which was less used in 1799 than it is used to-day, certainly; but which, nevertheless, was used. It often meant then, as now, a thick and thin pertinacity in believing in provincial marvels; and, in this, Marble {{was one of the most}} patriotic men with whom I ever met. I got him out of the church, and along Fleet street, through Temple Bar, and into the Strand, however, in peace; and then we emerged into the arena of fashion, aristocracy and the court. After a time, we <b>worked</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> into Hyde Park, where we brought up, to make our observations.|$|R
60|$|The {{infinite}} number of islands which lie in these seas embarrassed us strangely, and it was with great difficulty that we <b>worked</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> through them; then we steered for {{the north side of}} the Philippines, when we had a double chance for purchase, viz., either to meet with the Spanish ships from Acapulco, on the coast of New Spain, or we were certain not to fail of finding some ships or junks of China, who, if they came from China, would have a great quantity of goods of value on board, as well as money; or if we took them going back, we should find them laden with nutmegs and cloves from Banda and Ternate, or from some of the other islands.|$|R
6000|$|... “We {{had better}} try to <b>work</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{from town to}} town,” replied Carl. “Perhaps we’ll be {{fortunate}} enough to give exhibitions on the way.

6000|$|... "Not direct into Ladysmith. Possibly we may <b>work</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> round; {{but after}} {{what we saw}} of the fire from their position, trench above trench, and miles upon miles in length, my own {{conviction}} is, that allowing to the utmost for the gallantry and devotion of our men, we shall never win our way across those hills." ...|$|E

"And we ought, by rights, {{after doing}} this parish, to go round Higher and Lower Mellstock, and call at Viney's, and so <b>work</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> hither again across He'th," [...] said Mr. Penny, {{recovering}} {{scent of the}} matter in hand.

6000|$|Towards {{three o'clock}} we <b>worked</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> round to the station, and {{began looking for}} our train. We hunted all over the place, but could not find it anywhere. The central station at Munich is an {{enormous}} building, and a perfect maze of passages and halls and corridors. It {{is much easier to}} lose oneself in it, than to find anything in it one may happen to want. Together and separately B. and I lost ourselves and each other some twenty-four times. For about half an hour we seemed to be doing nothing else but rushing up and down the station looking for each other, suddenly finding each other, and saying, [...] "Why, where the dickens have you been? I have been hunting for you everywhere. Don't go away like that," [...] and then immediately losing each other again.|$|R
60|$|We <b>worked</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> up to London, {{with the}} tides, and were carried into London dock; where we discharged. This {{was my first}} visit to the modern Babylon, of course; but I had little {{opportunity}} of seeing much. I had one or two cruises, of a Sunday, in tow of Cooper, who soon became a branch pilot, in those waters, about the parks and west end but I was too young to learn much, or to observe much. Most of us went to see the monument, St. Paul's, and the lions; and Cooper put himself in charge of a beef-eater, and took a look at the arsenals, jewels and armoury. He had a rum time of it, in his sailor rig, but hoisted in a wonderful deal of gibberish, according to his own account of his cruise.|$|R
