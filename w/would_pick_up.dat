He has an elder brother, Vikash, and an elder sister, Bhavna. According to his family, when he was three-years old, Kohli <b>would</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a cricket bat, start swinging it and ask his father to bowl at him.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, state Sen. Joseph F. Timilty {{resigned}} his Norfolk and Suffolk seat {{to pursue}} a career in private law, and Keating became the only major Democratic contender for the office. In the general election he faced Republican Marion Boch, who promoted a plan for dramatic cuts to legislators' pay and hours, invoking the energy of the Ronald Reagan campaign. Keating focused his campaign on expanding resources for crime prevention and education, tailoring his message to the Boston constituency he <b>would</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> as a senator. He was successful, winning about 64 percent of the vote, and was sworn in the following January.|$|E
5|$|Mainer grew up {{listening}} to traditional mountain music and was largely influenced by his brother-in-law Roscoe Banks. He first learned to play the banjo at square dances, where he <b>would</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> instruments left by performers and practice on them. After moving to Concord, North Carolina and working in a series of jobs at cotton mills, he became a part of his brother J.E.'s band, known as J. E. Mainer's Mountaineers. His entry into the band in 1934 marked the beginning of a nearly six-decade career in music. J.E. played the fiddle while Wade performed on the banjo for the string band, and they played at fiddlers' conventions and other gatherings.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Martin {{was still}} {{optimistic that the}} fourth {{installment}} might be released {{in the last quarter}} of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called A Feast for Crows. The book <b>would</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap. The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.|$|E
5|$|When Saldívar {{became a}} {{business}} associate, their relationship began to deteriorate. In September 1994, Selena met Ricardo Martinez, {{a doctor who}} lived in Monterrey, Mexico. Selena wanted to expand the number of boutiques by opening a Selena Etc. store in Monterrey. Martinez said he had contacts in Mexico who could help her grow her business. Martinez became a business adviser to Selena, though her family said he was simply a fan who posed in several pictures with her. Saldívar became envious of Selena's dependency on Martinez. He began sending flowers to Selena's hotel room. Saldívar warned the singer that Martinez might have unprofessional intentions. Selena began visiting Monterrey more frequently, often in disguise. Sebastian D'Silva, Martinez's assistant, <b>would</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> Selena at the airport; he said he noticed she was wearing wigs and using her husband Chris Pérez's surname so others would not identify her. According to Martinez, he had lent several thousand dollars to Selena because she was short on cash.|$|E

25|$|Westfalia Campers were {{available}} from Volkswagen dealers worldwide and were also delivered via the Tourist Delivery Program — whereby a customer <b>would</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> their new van in Germany, drive it in Europe, then VW would ship {{it to the}} customer's home. Many Volkswagen Campers were purchased by American servicemen and sent home in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Curly found {{constant}} companionship in {{his dogs}} and often befriended strays whenever the Stooges were traveling.

When not performing, he would usually have a few dogs waiting for him at home as well.|$|E

25|$|Until November 2000, the Melbourne City Centre {{terminus}} {{was at a}} coach depot in Franklin Street. It <b>would</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> passengers at {{the then}} Spencer Street station and various city hotels before continuing on to the airport. In November 2000, Skybus relocated to Spencer Street station with services operating express to the airport, cutting the journey time to 20 minutes and allowing more services to be introduced. Connecting minibuses were introduced to continue the hotel transfer/pickup service.|$|E
25|$|The RP {{did manage}} to secure around 20% of the white vote nationally {{on a regular basis}} and it <b>would</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> most of the non-white {{constituency}} votes, but the first-past-the-post electoral system meant that they never won seats in the Assembly. Widespread press censorship and government control of radio and TV inhibited opposition activity. The lack of an effective parliamentary opposition is one factor that made it difficult to end UDI when this measure had become clearly necessary.|$|E
25|$|On 23 September, the Green Party MP Gareth Hughes {{attempted}} {{to introduce a}} bill to parliament to include Red Peak as an option in the first referendum. The bill's introduction was blocked by New Zealand First. Prime Minister John Key confirmed that the National Party <b>would</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the legislation, meaning the Red Peak flag was added as a fifth option in the flag referendum. Red Peak gained 10.9% {{of the vote in}} the first referendum.|$|E

After nine appearances with Phoenix, on December 6, 2007, Auld was traded to the Boston Bruins for right winger Nate DiCasmirro and the Bruins' fifth-round pick in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The textile industry, {{which had}} always been an {{important}} pillar of Haarlem's economy, was in a bad shape {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century. Strong international competition, and revolutionary new production methods based on steam engines already in use in England, dealt a striking blow to Haarlem's industry. In 1815 the city's population was about 17,000 people, a large percentage of whom were poor. The foundation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in that year gave hope to many, who believed that under a new government the economy <b>would</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up,</b> and that export-oriented economic activities such as the textile industry would recover.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea was}} to build an {{offshore}} terminal with docks equipped with Dashaveyor tracks instead of a conventional container shipping port on land. An operator would load containers onto Dashaveyor cars, which would then enter a tunnel to move them at high speed to the shore. There they would exit the tunnel and automatically drive the container to its storage location, and optionally lift it to stack them. In a Dashaveyor equipped port, a single vehicle <b>would</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up,</b> move and stack the containers. Normally each of these steps required a separate, manned, vehicle. Additionally, the ships never had to enter port, which had major advantages in terms of siting and construction.|$|E

25|$|With the Panthers' {{success in}} the 2011–12 NHL season, fans have revived the rat tossing by {{throwing}} plastic rats onto the ice following home victories. On April 15, 2012, the Florida Panthers threw plastic rats on the ice after a 4–2 playoff victory over the New Jersey Devils. It was the first playoff victory for the Panthers since 1997. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, fans threw hundreds of rats onto the ice, making it the most since the run to the Cup. After victories at the BankAtlantic Center, workers <b>would</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the rats and return them to the Pantherland gift shop for resale. The Panthers organization alleged that Devils fans bought rats at Pantherland to throw them prematurely {{in an attempt to}} spur a penalty against the Panthers. Unwilling to assume the risk, the team decided to discontinue sales of toy rats at Pantherland. It remains unknown whether any other measures would be applied to discourage rat-throwing.|$|E
25|$|He argued infants were {{engaging}} {{in an act}} of assimilation when they sucked on everything in their reach. He claimed infants transform all objects into an object to be sucked. The children were assimilating the objects to conform to their own mental structures. Piaget then made the assumption that whenever one transforms the world to meet individual needs or conceptions, one is, in a way, assimilating it. Piaget also observed his children not only assimilating objects to fit their needs, but also modifying some of their mental structures {{to meet the demands of}} the environment. This is the second division of adaptation known as accommodation. To start out, the infants only engaged in primarily reflex actions such as sucking, but not long after, they <b>would</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> objects and put them in their mouths. When they do this, they modify their reflex response to accommodate the external objects into reflex actions. Because the two are often in conflict, they provide the impetus for intellectual development. The constant need to balance the two triggers intellectual growth.|$|E
25|$|The Phillies announced, {{following}} the 2009 World Series, that they <b>would</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> their 1-year, $9million option on starting pitcher Cliff Lee, who posted a 4–0 {{record in the}} previous postseason. General manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. informed pitcher Brett Myers, who had started and relieved in 2009 and sustained several injuries, that the Phillies would not pursue him for a new contract if he filed for free agency. Myers had started the last three opening days for the Phillies. Starting pitcher Pedro Martínez and infielder Miguel Cairo also filed for free agency on November 6, the first possible date. Philadelphia also informed third baseman Pedro Feliz that they declined {{to pick up his}} option for the 2010 season, which would have retained him for $5.5million. The Phillies signed free-agent catcher Brian Schneider to replace Paul Bako behind Carlos Ruiz on the depth chart, and replaced Feliz at third base with Plácido Polanco, who played second base for Philadelphia from 2002 to 2005, and was a Gold Glove-winning second baseman for the prior two seasons with the Detroit Tigers. Polanco had previously played third base in college, when playing with the St. Louis Cardinals, and in Philadelphia when David Bell was injured and Chase Utley took over at second base.|$|E
