40|$|Background: Amidst {{continued}} {{calls for}} more research investigating {{the relationship between the}} use ofantibacterial <b>wash</b> <b>products</b> and antibiotic and antibacterial resistance in human-source bacteria, this study aimed todescribe susceptibilities in staphylococcal skin isolates from community users of antibacterial <b>wash</b> <b>products,</b> compared toisolates from non-users. Methods: Qualified and randomly selected participants (n= 210) comprised three equal groups: 1) those that frequently usedwash products containing triclosan; 2) those that frequently used products containing triclocarban; 3) control group that usedno antibacterial <b>wash</b> <b>products.</b> A forearm swab sample was collected from each participant and processed for coagulasenegativeStaphylococcus species and S. aureus (SA). Standard antibiotic and antibacterial minimal inhibitory concentration(MIC) testing was performed on all isolates (n= 317). Results: There was no statistically significant difference in antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus isolates from regularantibacterial <b>wash</b> <b>product</b> users compared with non-users. None of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin, and the rateof methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) detected was appreciably less than that reported in the literature for both hospitalinpatient and outpatient isolates of SA. There was also a definitive lack of antibiotic/antibacterial cross-resistance. Conclusion: An extensive community study of resident skin Staphylococcus showed no increased antibiotic resistance inparticipant groups regularly using <b>wash</b> <b>products</b> containing triclocarban (TCC) or triclosan (TCS), as compared withparticipants using <b>wash</b> <b>products</b> containing no TCC or TCS. This adds to and confirms previous yet limited community datashowing lack of evidence that the use of antibacterial <b>wash</b> <b>products</b> facilitates antibiotic resistance andantibiotic/antibacterial cross-resistance...|$|R

The most easily recognized members of the soap line were Gold Dust Washing Powder and Gold Dust Scouring Soap. They were marketed in boxes and containers prominently featuring the brand's well known trademark, the Gold Dust Twins.

50|$|Due to {{the sealed}} {{nature of the}} bag all this waste begins to {{decompose}} anaerobically releasing methane gas, water and sludge waste whilst also killing harmful pathogens such as E-Coli. The methane gas is released and captured using the valve {{at the top of}} the outlet end of the bag, this gas can be used for cooking, lighting and heating (although CART currently intend to use the gas solely for cooking.) The water is released through the outlet pipe, this water is known as ‘High nutrient’ or ‘Black’ water. Less than 10% of the products are solids and therefore only need removing from the bag every few years, these solids can be used as a high nutrient fertiliser for fruit trees or for plants where the fertiliser does not come into direct contact with the crop. The black water is mixed with grey waters, such as shower or washing water (N.B CART only uses organic, bio-degradable <b>washing</b> <b>products</b> to ensure no toxins are introduced to the cycle.) This water is filtered through sand and charcoal and used to irrigate the food gardens. Excess water, together with runoff from the gardens is collected in the Dam, from which it can be used to water gardens in the dry season or filtered further making it safe for drinking (see water cycle).|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{studying}} {{the effects of}} health care personnel hand <b>wash</b> <b>products</b> is described. The fingernail regions {{of the hands of}} volunteers are inoculated with a mixture of Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens, and the areas are dried for a standard time. After routine hand washing, each fingernail region is individually scrubbed with an electric toothbrush which moves longitudinally to the handle into collection fluid contained in a petri dish. The test bacteria in the fluid are then enumerated. (Bacillus subtilis spores may be included as tracers to show degree of physical removal of the procedure.) This method has several advantages over the frequently used glove juice technique. Experimental designs with large numbers of volunteers, multiple sampling sites, and many hand <b>wash</b> <b>products</b> may be performed. Ten sampling sites (fingers) are available, versus the two gloved hands for testing products. (Efficiency is almost 100 % in the recovery of spore tracers placed on the fingernails.) Many commercial health care personnel hand <b>wash</b> <b>products</b> containing antimicrobial agents substantive to the skin do not rapidly reduce numbers of inoculated bacteria in the fingernail regions to any greater extent than nonantimicrobial hand <b>washes.</b> <b>Products</b> containing isopropanol or ethanol are very effective in decreasing bacteria in areas around and under the fingernails...|$|R

5000|$|Rumours {{that the}} Nazis {{produced}} soap from {{the bodies of}} concentration camp inmates circulated widely during the war. Germany suffered a shortage of fats during World War II, {{and the production of}} soap was put under government control. The [...] "human soap" [...] rumours may have originated from the bars of soap being marked with the initials RIF, which was interpreted by some as Reichs-Juden-Fett ("State Jewish Fat"); in German Blackletter font the difference between I and J is only in length. RIF in fact stood for Reichsstelle für industrielle Fettversorgung ("National Center for Industrial Fat Provisioning", the German government agency responsible for wartime production and distribution of soap and <b>washing</b> <b>products).</b> RIF soap was a poor quality substitute product that contained no fat at all, human or otherwise. Rumors about the origins and meaning of [...] "RIF" [...] soap extended into the concentration camps themselves. Naphtali Karchmer, in his book Solitary in the Overwhelming Turbulence: Five Years as Prisoner-of-War in East Prussia, describes his years in captivity as a Jewish-Polish POW. The author writes about gray, rectangular, low-quality pieces of soap he and other POWs received with the letters [...] "RIF" [...] inscribed on a center depression. When one of the POWs complained about the low-foam, smooth soap, the lady of the household answered it was made of [...] "Rein Juden Fett" [...] (pure Jewish fat), when asked [...] "out of human fat?", she answered [...] "No, just Jews".
