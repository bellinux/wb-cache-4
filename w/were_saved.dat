5|$|Exact French {{casualties}} {{are difficult}} to calculate, but of the 1,300 aboard Droits de l'Homme, 103 {{are known to have}} died in the battle and just over 300 <b>were</b> <b>saved</b> from the wreck, indicating the deaths of approximately 900men on the French ship between the morning of 14January and the morning of 18January.

This would give a toll of only about 400. A menhir at Plozévet, with an inscription carved in 1840 gives a death toll of six hundred.|$|E
