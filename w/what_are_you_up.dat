500|$|Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime: Nimoy reprises {{the role}} of the older Spock from the {{original}} Star Trek timeline, credited as [...] "Spock Prime". He was a longtime friend of Abrams' parents, but became better acquainted with Abrams during filming. Although Quinto watched some episodes of the show during breaks in filming, Nimoy was his main resource in playing Spock. Abrams and the writers met Nimoy at his house; writer Roberto Orci recalled that the actor gave a Who are you guys and <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to?' vibe" [...] before being told how important he was to them. He was silent, and Nimoy's wife Susan Bay told the creative team he had remained in his chair after their conversation, emotionally overwhelmed by his decision after turning down many opportunities to revisit the role. Had Nimoy disliked the script, production would have been delayed for it to be rewritten. Nimoy later said, [...] "This is the first and only time I ever had a filmmaker say, 'We cannot make this film without you and we won't make it without you'". He was [...] "genuinely excited" [...] by the script's scope and its detailing of the characters' backstories, saying, [...] "We have dealt with , but never with quite the overview that this script has of the entire history of the character, the growth of the character, the beginnings of the character and the arrival of the character into the Enterprise crew." [...] Abrams commented, [...] "It was surreal to direct him as Spock, because what the hell am I doing there? This guy has been doing it for forty years. It's like 'I think Spock would...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes--Merrett--I won. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to--writing lines? You {{may as well}} save {{yourself}} the trouble. They won't be any good." [...] Dunstable stared.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Cosmopolites always do. Now {{answer my}} questions. <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to?' and Dare {{as he spoke}} played with the pistol again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Vincent!" [...] Mrs. Wingfield exclaimed, {{starting}} up, [...] "what {{has happened}} to <b>you?</b> <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> dressed <b>up</b> like that for? Is anything the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Ingleby laughed drowsily and {{stretched}} his aching limbs. [...] "I really believe I am, though I scarcely felt it until this moment. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> sitting <b>up</b> for, Hetty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come!' said Fledgeby. 'I won't {{press that}} just now. But I {{want to know}} this, and I will know this, mind you. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nat Poole, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to!" [...] cried Dave, indignantly, and, leaping forward, {{he caught}} the other youth by the {{shoulder}} and whirled him around. [...] "You let Professor Potts alone!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The boys {{took the}} little silver plates from their pockets {{and handed them}} silently to Captain Manley, who read aloud, to the {{surprise}} of those around him,--"'To Tom' and 'Peter,' they are alike except the names. 'To Tom Scudamore, presented by the passengers in the Highflyer coach on the 4th of August, 1808, as a testimony of their appreciation of his gallant conduct, by which their property was saved from plunder.' Why, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> this, <b>you</b> young pickles, <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to on the 4th of August last year?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, tranquilly, [...] "I {{contrive}} {{to pay my}} debts as {{the usual}} thing, but we'll let that slide. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> at <b>up</b> here in the bush?" ...|$|R
6000|$|His face {{remained}} expressionless. [...] "I don't believe it. Can such maidens {{come out}} of Roaring Fork--nit! But I don't mean that. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing <b>up</b> here in this wilderness?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hi! hi! <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to?" [...] cried Ralph, as {{he dropped}} the bar, and rushed {{over to the side}} of the bridge. [...] "Do you want to run into the stonework?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} watched her a moment. [...] "How you DO like to tuck us {{in and then}} sit up yourself! What {{do you want to}} do, anyway? <b>What</b> <b>ARE</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to, mummy?" ...|$|E

5000|$|... "It's saying, {{stand up}} to rock stars. That's about {{choosing}} your enemies, too. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> gonna stand <b>up</b> for and <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> gonna stand <b>up</b> against? I love the notion of standing up to rock stars. Because they {{are a bunch of}} fucking megalomaniacs." [...] —Bono on the lyrical meaning behind [...] "Stand Up Comedy".|$|R

6000|$|FRANK. He's rector here. I'm {{living with}} my people this autumn {{for the sake}} of economy. Things came to a crisis in July: the Roman father had to pay my debts.

6000|$|GIUSEPPE (piteously, as {{he places}} {{the light on}} the table). Excellency: <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> looking <b>up</b> at just now--out there? (He points across his {{shoulder}} to the vineyard, but is afraid to look round.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Flynn pondered. [...] "Tell my landlady in {{the morning}} that I’ve took your back room," [...] he said. [...] "What a fortunit thing it is I’m out o’ work. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> walking <b>up</b> and down like that for, Bill? Back coming on agin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Sam!" [...] said Psmith cordially, [...] "this is well met! I {{remember}} you. Yes, indeed, I do.

6000|$|... "I've just {{finished}} the Hillyard case {{and they gave}} me a vacation. So I came here to see my little girl. I didn't know she was being neglected, Josie. I shall take better care of her after this. My visit to Cragg's Crossing is perfectly natural, for I was born here. But you? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to, Josie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{went in with}} {{my light}} and found him, in bed, very wide awake, but very much at his ease. [...] "Well, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>up</b> to?" [...] he asked with a grace of {{sociability}} in which {{it occurred to me}} that Mrs. Grose, had she been present, might have looked in vain for proof that anything was [...] "out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anne, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to? There's {{something}} going on that I don't understand. The whole air here tonight {{has been charged with}} electricity. Leslie sits like the muse of tragedy; Owen Ford jokes and laughs on the surface, and watches Leslie with the eyes of his soul. You seem all the time to be bursting with some suppressed excitement. Own up. What secret have you been keeping from your deceived husband?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Sam!" [...] he said cordially, [...] "this is great. Now for our {{interesting}} experiment.

6000|$|... "Why, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{bringing}} that <b>up</b> here for?" [...] he asked. [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> diving; for I see your clothes are dripping with water?" ...|$|R

6000|$|In fact, Mr Fledgeby sped on his errand {{of mercy}} through the streets, at so brisk {{a rate that}} his feet might have been winged by all the good spirits that wait on Generosity. They might have taken up their station in his breast, too, for he was blithe and merry. There was quite a fresh trill in his voice, when, {{arriving}} at the counting-house in St Mary Axe, and finding it for the moment empty, he trolled forth {{at the foot of}} the staircase: 'Now, Judah, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to there?' ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was clear}} to me that after that I must as people say [...] "have things out" [...] with Rachel. But before I could do {{anything}} of the sort the Fürstin pounced upon me. She made me sit up that night after her other guests had gone to their rooms, in the cosy little turret apartment she called her study and devoted to the reading of whatever was most notorious in contemporary British fiction. [...] "Sit down," [...] said she, [...] "by the fire in that chair there and tell me all about it. It's no good your pretending you don't know what I mean. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to with her, and why don't you go straight to your manifest destiny as a decent man should?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The drawing-room at Knight Sutton Hall was in {{that state}} of bustle {{incidental}} to the expectation of company, which was sure to prevail wherever Mrs. Langford reigned. She walked about, removing the covers from chairs and ottomans, shaking out curtains, adjusting china, and appealing to Mrs. Frederick Langford in various matters of taste, though never allowing her to move to assist her. Henrietta, however, often came to her help, and was certainly acting {{in a way to}} incur the severe displeasure of the absent queen, by laying aside Midas's robes to assist in the arrangements. [...] "That picture is crooked, I am sure!" [...] said Mrs. Langford; and of course she was not satisfied till she had summoned Geoffrey from the study to give his opinion, and had made him mount upon a chair to settle its position. In the midst of the operation, in walked Uncle Roger. [...] "Hollo! Geoffrey, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to now? So, ma'am, you are making yourself smart to-day. Where is my father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|JULIA. Is it, indeed, too bad? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing <b>up</b> {{here with}} that woman? You scoundrel!

6000|$|... "My eye!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Whose clothes have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> stealing? <b>What</b> have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>up</b> to, eh? Committing a {{burglary}} or a murder?" ...|$|R
