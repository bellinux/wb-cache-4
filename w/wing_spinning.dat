50|$|In qualifying, Senna took pole {{ahead of}} Prost, Mansell, Berger, Boutsen and Piquet. However, Senna was unhappy at the pole being {{located on the}} dirty side of the track and thus the second place being on the racing line which should give the second-placed driver the {{advantage}} into the first corner. He went to FISA president Jean Marie Balestre to change the side on which pole was located, but was refused. After this, {{he decided that he}} would go for any gap into the first corner if Prost had the advantage. At the start, Prost did have the advantage and Senna went for the gap. Prost did not know it and drove the normal racing line. Senna's left front touched Prost's rear <b>wing,</b> <b>spinning</b> both of them into the gravel trap. The world championship was sealed.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} fluid flows over {{axisymmetric}} bodies {{has increased in}} recent times, {{as they can be}} used to model flows over a swept <b>wing,</b> <b>spinning</b> projectiles and aeroengines amongst other things. A better mathematical understanding of the transition from laminar to turbulent flow within the boundary layer could lead to an improvement in the design of such applications. We consider a compressible fluid flow over a rotating cone, defined by half-angle ψ. The mean flow boundary-layer equations are derived and we conduct a high Reynolds number asymptotic linear stability analysis. The flow is susceptible to instabilities caused by inviscid crossflow modes (type I) and modes caused by a viscous-Coriolis balance force (type II). Both are considered, along with the effects of changes in the cone half-angle, the magnitude of the local Mach number and the temperature at the cone wall. A surface suction along the cone wall is also analysed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The grand living room is under a hexagonal copper dome roof and ventilator specifically copied from the Arizona Biltmore Hotel's Aztec ballroom.|$|R
50|$|This {{method of}} {{launching}} {{can be performed}} only on a special type of glider - a Discus Launch Glider (DLG). To launch the model into the air, the pilot holds the model by {{the tip of a}} <b>wing,</b> <b>spins</b> 360°, rotating the model around their body and then releases hold of the model allowing it to launch at high speed and climb to height. Although DLGs are a fairly new type of model glider, they are gaining popularity due to their ease of launching and efficient flight characteristics. DLG models are used in the F3K contest class, as defined by the FAI.|$|R

5000|$|Recently, decoys {{have been}} {{introduced}} that provide lifelike movement that adds to the attraction for waterfowl. Shakers are decoys with a small electric motor and an offset weighted wheel. As the wheel turns it causes the decoy to [...] "shake" [...] {{in the water and}} create realistic wave rings throughout the decoy spread. <b>Spinning</b> <b>wing</b> decoys are also fitted with an electric motor and have wings made of various materials. As the <b>wings</b> <b>spin</b> an optical illusion is created simulating the wing beats for landing birds. These decoys can be quite effective when hunting waterfowl and have been banned in some states. Other types of movement decoys include swimming decoys and even kites formed like geese or ducks. The use of UV paint has also been suggested for decoys. Unlike humans, it is possible for wildlife to see UV colors and decoys so patterned may appear more authentic.|$|R

40|$|The {{spin and}} {{recovery}} {{characteristics of a}} 1 / 13 -scale model of the NASA AD- 1 oblique-wing research aircraft at wing-skew positions of 0, 25, 45, and 60 deg (right wing forward) were investigated. Spins were obtained for all wing-skew positions tested. For the unskewed <b>wing</b> position, two <b>spin</b> modes were possible. One spin mode was very steep and recoveries were obtained within 1 turn or less by rudder reversal. The second spin mode was flat and fast; the angle of attack was about 75 deg and the spin rate was about 145 deg/sec (2. 5 seconds per turn). For the skewed <b>wing</b> positions, <b>spins</b> were obtained only {{in the direction of}} the forward-skewed wing (right <b>wing</b> forward). No <b>spins</b> were obtained to the left when the wing was skewed with the right wing forward. Recoveries should be attempted by deflecting the rudder to full against the spin, the ailerons to full with the spin, and movement of the wings to 0 deg skew. If the wing is skewed, the recovery may not be effected until the wing skew approaches 0 deg...|$|R

40|$|Periodicity is at {{the core}} of the {{recognition}} of many actions. This paper takes the following steps to detect and measure periodicity. 1) We establish a conceptual framework of classifying periodicity in 10 essential cases, the most important of which are flashing (of a traffic light), pulsing (of an anemone), swinging (of <b>wings),</b> <b>spinning</b> (of a swimmer), turning (of a conductor), shuttling (of a brush), drifting (of an escalator) and thrusting (of a kangaroo). 2) We present an algorithm to detect all cases by the one and the same algorithm. It tracks the object independent of the object’s appearance, then performs probabilistic PCA and spectral analysis followed by detection and frequency measurement. The method shows good performance with fixed parameters for examples of all above cases assembled from the Internet. 3) Application of the method, completely unaltered, to a random half hour of CNN news has led to an 80 % score. 1...|$|R

50|$|Part {{of their}} {{function}} is to direct the turbulent wakes of the front <b>wing</b> and <b>spinning</b> front wheels away from downstream aerodynamic surfaces. In this capacity, they separate different components of this mixture of flows, and direct them either outside and around the sidepods, or direct flow towards the radiator inlets. As such, the configuration of bargeboards can have significance with respect to cooling. They also help direct flow behind the front wheels, reducing the wake drag created by the wheel profile.|$|R

2500|$|The fifth {{match of}} the night had Titán defend his Mexican National Welterweight Championship against {{challenger}} Averno following several weeks of Averno humiliating the champion during Best {{two out of three}} falls Six-man tag team matches. Averno had Mephisto in his corner for this important match while Titán had Super Halcón, Jr. as his corner man for the match. The experienced Averno dominated most of the first fall, winning it after using his Devil's <b>Wings</b> (<b>Spinning</b> lifting sitout double underhook facebuster), finishing move to put the champion at a disadvantage. The second fall saw Titán skills to defeat Averno, pushing the match to a third and deciding fall. The third fall saw both wrestlers fight outside the ring, including Titán throwing Averno off the ramp to the floor and moments later Averno throw Titán into the steel barricade surrounding the ring. The impact against the steel was so severe that doctors came to ringside to examine Titán's shoulder. Moments later he was allowed to continue to wrestle, but did not use the arm much {{during the rest of the}} match. In the end Titán was able to overcome a Devil's Wings off the top rope, and then managed to apply the Tirabuzon (Spanish for [...] "Corkscrew", an Abdominal stretch) that forced Averno to submit for the third and final fall. The fans showed their appreciation for the action packed entertaining match by throwing money into the ring, a tradition in Lucha Libre after a great match.|$|R

40|$|A central {{challenge}} {{to the study of}} animal aerodynamics has been the measurement offerees generated by flapping wings. Relative to wings of other birds, hummingbird wings are of particular interest in that the smaller species operate in more viscous regimes (5000 <Re < 10 000) for which substantial drag and reduced lift:drag coefficients might be expected. Lift and drag forces were measured on mounted hummingbird wings and <b>wing</b> models <b>spinning</b> in continuous tip wise revolution about the wing base. Lift coefficients tended to increase as wing models became more realistic (i. e. with sharpened leading edges and with substantial camber). Lift:drag ratios of real wings were substantially higher than those of wing models, suggesting morphological contributions of feathers to lift enhancement and drag reduction. At Re = 5000, high values of the lift:drag ratio (8 - 16) at low angles of attack suggest that wings of hummingbirds are exceptionally good at producing lift. Key words: aerodynamics, angle of attack, camber, hummingbird, leading edge, model wing...|$|R
