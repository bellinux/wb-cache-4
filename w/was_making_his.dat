5|$|The {{race was}} won by Australian driver Will Power for Team Penske. Power <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> race return after an {{incident}} during a practice {{session at the}} 2009 Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma, which left him with two broken vertebrae in his back. Second place went to Ryan Hunter-Reay, who <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> first start for Andretti Autosport, and third place went to another returnee, A. J. Foyt Enterprises' Vitor Meira. Meira <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> first start since suffering similar injuries to Power, during the 2009 Indianapolis 500.|$|E
5|$|After {{his third}} {{successive}} victory, with his win over Henning Svendsen in March 2006, Wallhead {{made his first}} title defense of his House of Pain Welterweight title just two weeks later. His opponent was John Phillips who <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> second professional appearance. Wallhead defeated Phillips to retain the title, after a TKO victory due to elbows.|$|E
5|$|Despite making eight {{changes to}} the {{starting}} eleven Norwich started their League Cup campaign brightly with an entertaining 6–3 win at home to Bury with Johan Elmander scoring two of the six goals. The third round of the cup saw Norwich win away at Watford 3–2. Norwich were two goals down on 55 minutes but a goal from Josh Murphy, who <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> professional début, on 77 minutes inspired an extra time comeback. Chris Hughton again made eight changes for the fifth round of the cup which saw Norwich travel to Manchester United where two late goals resulted in a one-sided looking 4–0 defeat.|$|E

5|$|England beat Scotland 7–2 in April 1955, {{and this}} time Matthews linked up much better with Revie, and 40-year-old Matthews was largely {{credited}} for the outstanding margin of victory. In this game Duncan Edwards <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> England debut; when Matthews made his, Edwards had not even been born. Matthews went on England's unsuccessful tour of the continent in 1955, as the selectors erratic choices helped to ensure a 1–0 defeat to France, a 1–1 draw with Spain, and a 3–1 defeat to Portugal. Left out against Denmark, {{he was back in}} the team in October for a 1–1 draw with Wales.|$|E
5|$|Following {{several more}} troubled months, Jackson {{ended up in}} the hospital; he had {{collapsed}} while rehearsing for a concert in New York. Presley arrived to meet her ill husband, and yet another heated debate ensued. The argument ended after Jackson warned her that she <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> heart rate go up and asked her to leave. She obliged, and was admonished by a doctor and Jackson's mother Katherine along the way. Presley subsequently returned to Los Angeles. Upon being discharged from hospital, Jackson went to Disneyland Paris to recover.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Soult <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> own plans. He {{knew that}} Blake {{intended}} {{to join forces}} with Beresford, but {{he thought that the}} Spanish divisions were still several days march away. Based on that erroneous premise, Soult decided that his best course of action would be to turn the Allies' southern flank, thus driving a wedge between the two parts of Beresford's army. Soult hoped that as a result he could defeat his opponents in detail, overcoming Beresford's force and then turning south to deal with Blake's divisions.|$|E

5|$|Mertens {{added to}} his {{silverware}} {{at the start of}} the following season as PSV beat Ajax 4–2 to lift the Johan Cruyff Shield. On 30 September 2012, Mertens and Jürgen Locadia, who <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> Eredivisie debut, both scored hat-tricks as PSV defeated VVV-Venlo 6–0. Mertens ultimately scored 14 league goals, and 16 across all competitions as PSV ended the season as runners-up to Ajax in the Eredivisie. He also aided his side's cause with a further 17 assists. It would be his final season in the Eredivisie, however, as at the conclusion of the campaign PSV accepted an offer from Serie A side Napoli for his signature. Mertens departed Eindhoven having made 88 appearances and scored 45 goals over the course of two seasons.|$|E
5|$|The trophy was {{presented}} to Milan captain Paolo Maldini in the Guest of Honour's box, as UEFA President Michel Platini favoured {{a return to the}} past tradition of the winning captain receiving the trophy among the fans. It had become customary in recent years to have the presentation on a hastily constructed podium in the centre of the pitch. This {{was the first time that}} the trophy {{was presented}} to a winning captain by a UEFA president who had actually played against him in the past; during Michel Platini's final seasons with Juventus, the then-teenager Paolo Maldini <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> professional début with Milan.|$|E
5|$|Ajax {{opened the}} scoring {{in the third}} minute when Cees de Wolf, who <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> debut for Ajax, scored. A throw-in by Cruyff was headed into the air, Liverpool goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence came to collect the ball. Realising he could not reach it, he moved back towards his goal, but de Wolf outjumped defender Chris Lawler to head {{the ball into the}} Liverpool goal. The {{conditions}} were so poor, that the crowd celebrated in stages. Those closest to the goal celebrated immediately, while those {{at the other end of}} the stadium reacted to these celebrations. Liverpool striker Hunt had a chance to score in the 12th minute, but his shot was saved by Ajax goalkeeper Gert Bals. Following the goal Ajax continued to attack, midfielder Sjaak Swart ran past three Liverpool players before passing the ball to Klaas Nuninga, whose shot was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Lawrence. However, Lawrence dropped the ball near Johan Cruyff, who scored to give Ajax a 2–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|André faced Hogan for {{the title}} on the February 5, 1988 {{broadcast}} of The Main Event, with Dave Hebner as the scheduled referee. André pinned Hogan to win the championship and handed the belt to DiBiase. The pinfall was controversial, however, as Hogan's shoulders {{were not on the}} mat when the referee made the three count. After the match, the real Dave Hebner, who looked identical to referee that had officiated the match, ran to the ring to attack the impostor referee. Hulk Hogan then threw the impostor out of the ring onto DiBiase and his bodyguard Virgil. According to the storyline, DiBiase had paid an unnamed referee to get plastic surgery to look exactly like Dave Hebner. In reality, the second referee was Dave's twin brother Earl Hebner, who <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> on-screen debut with the WWF.|$|E
5|$|Criss Angel {{was born}} on December 19, 1967, at Hempstead General Hospital in Hempstead, on Long Island, New York. He is of Greek descent. Angel was raised in Elmont until fourth grade, when {{his family moved to}} East Meadow, New York. His father, John Sarantakos, owned a {{restaurant}} and doughnut shop. He developed an interest in magic at age seven and performed his first show at the age of twelve, for which he was paid $10. His main early influence was Harry Houdini. By fourteen, Angel was performing throughout high school at restaurants in East Meadow, including the Wine Gallery. Angel's first major illusion <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> mother float in their family den. Early in his career he was helped by animal breeder and reality-television host Marc Morrone, who helped Angel find and train a set of doves for his act.|$|E
5|$|General George S. Patton {{himself had}} a gunfight {{when he was}} a young second {{lieutenant}} chasing Pancho Villa all over northern Mexico in 1916. Patton and 10 enlisted men had been sent to San Miguelito Ranch to look for Villa, who had recently raided the city of Columbus, New Mexico. Patton positioned his men by the south gate and <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> way up to the north gate when a trio of Villa's men came into the ranch on horseback. Patton drew his obsolete single-action Colt Peacemaker revolver and shot two of the men. The first man had been fatally wounded in the exchange and tried to draw his pistol before Patton killed him with a single shot. After his troops took down the remaining outlaw, Patton tied the three dead men to the hood of his touring car and drove the bodies back to his commanding officer.|$|E

5|$|McCall joined Everton at a {{time when}} its former triumphant side of the mid-1980s had broken up, {{following}} the ban on English sides competing in Europe, which marked the start of a period of underachievement at Goodison Park. His Everton debut came in a 4–0 victory over Newcastle United on 27 August 1988 against his former teammate Hendrie, who <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> debut for Newcastle. McCall also returned to Valley Parade for a League Cup tie, but his Everton side were knocked out by Bradford 3–1 on 14 December 1988. He started 29 league games in 1988–89 as well as another four substitute appearances, but failed to score in the league. He was also a substitute in the 1989 FA Cup Final when he scored Everton's equaliser in the Merseyside derby against Liverpool to take the game into extra-time. He scored another equaliser during extra-time, but Liverpool's own substitute Ian Rush also scored two to secure a 3–2 victory for Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Schneider started Vancouver's {{next game}} against the Calgary Flames. For the second-straight game, Vancouver lost a two-goal lead in a game which {{eventually}} went to a shootout. In contrast to his first start, Schneider had a strong game, making 34 saves {{by the end of}} overtime. In the shootout, he stopped four of the five shooters he faced, earning the Canucks their first win of the season. Two nights later, as they began their first road trip, the Canucks played a rematch with the Ducks in Anaheim. Schneider made the start and earned some redemption, stopping all 30 Anaheim shots, helping the Canucks to the 5–0 win and earning his fifth career shutout. Following the win, Schneider started the next game, a 4–1 loss to the San Jose Sharks. Luongo started the next four games, finishing off the month of January and beginning February. Vigneault joked that he <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> starting goaltender decisions based on coin tosses. He further noted that the two goaltenders were team guys and they would do what was asked of them and never complain. The coin became a running joke for Vigneault and the Canucks in general, as Ryan Kesler stated he flipped it before announcing his return from injury.|$|E
5|$|When the Germans {{launched}} {{the invasion of}} Crete on 20 May, Kippenberger, {{like most of the}} defenders of the island, was surprised at the sight of hundreds of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) descending under parachutes. He quickly recovered and <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> way to his headquarters, when a burst of gunfire from a paratrooper was directed his way. After twisting his ankle in avoiding the gunfire, he stalked and killed the paratrooper with a shot to the head. His brigade was positioned east of Maleme airfield, on the Galatas plains. It was well positioned to counterattack scattered paratroopers who were beginning to consolidate into a good starting position from which an attack on the airfield could be launched. His request to do so was denied by the acting divisional commander, Brigadier Edward Puttick. An attack launched later without Kippenberger's knowledge failed although he believed the outcome could have been different if his troops had been involved.|$|E

5|$|With {{his enemy}} {{visible from the}} deck of his {{flagship}} by 06:30, Howe recalled his frigates and ordered his fleet to press on all sail {{in the hope of}} engaging the rear of the scattered French line. By 10:35 Howe's continued pursuit <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> own battleline ragged, but he pressed on in the belief that Villaret intended to use the weather gage to outrun him and escape. To counter this, Howe ordered his fastest ships into a flying squadron under Admiral Thomas Pasley. This squadron was significantly faster than the majority of the vessels in either fleet and rapidly closed with the French rear. The first shots of the engagement were fired at 14:30 by HMS Russell, commanded by John Willett Payne, which managed some long-distance fire at the rearmost French ships on the opposite tack. Fire was returned by the French but without significant effect. In an attempt to hold off Pasley's squadron, at 17:00 the French first rate 110-gun Révolutionnaire exchanged places with the smaller third rates {{at the rear of the}} line and engaged the pursuing British van. This manoeuvre was apparently conducted on the initiative of Captain Vandangel of Révolutionnaire without orders from Admiral Villaret or his political observer Jean Bon Saint-André.|$|E
5|$|Davidson's {{career was}} then {{transformed}} after Australia's veteran fast bowling spearheads Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall retired and were dropped respectively after the tour. Davidson led an inexperienced pace {{attack on the}} tour of South Africa in 1957–58—his new ball partner Ian Meckiff <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> debut. In the First Test, he took 6/34, his maiden Test five-wicket haul, after narrowly evading being expelled for breaking a curfew. Davidson went on to take a total of 9/82 in the Fifth Test and end the career-transforming series with 25 wickets at 17.00 as Australia won 3–0. Although he scored few runs in the Tests, Davidson scored four of his nine career first-class centuries during the tour. During the 1958–59 home series against England, Davidson took 24 wickets at 19.00, including a total of 9/95 in the Second Test as Australia won 4–0. During the 1959–60 eight-Test tour of the Indian subcontinent, Davidson overcame conditions unfavourable to fast bowling to take 41 wickets at 17.78 as Australia won four matches and lost one. In the Second Test against India in Kanpur, Davidson took his career-best match and innings bowling figures with 5/31 and 7/93. In the second innings, he bowled for an entire day's play without interruption and lost 11kg during the match. In a career total of six Tests in India, Davidson took 30 wickets {{at an average of}} 15.77.|$|E
5|$|On Monday Night Football, the Bears {{traveled}} west to {{face the}} 2–6 San Diego Chargers. The two teams last met in 2011 at Soldier Field, the Bears winning 31–20, though their last meeting in San Diego was in 2007, which the Chargers won 14–3, and the last MNF game in San Diego was a Chargers 20–7 victory in 1984; in eleven games, the Bears led the series 6–5. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears offense could capitalize on a defense that allowed the most yards after the catch in the NFL. Additionally, offenses often started drives at 32-yard line, ranked 31st in the league, while the Chargers also had the least points off turnovers with seven. The Chargers were also allowing 6.34 yards per play, the second-worst in the NFL. To attack, the offense would balance passes that focused on favorable receiver/cornerback matchups and run with Jeremy Langford, who <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> first career start with Matt Forte out. Defensively, the Bears faced an offense struggling with injuries, particularly at the line: of the five positions, four have seen two or more players starting. However, quarterback Philip Rivers excelled despite the injuries, having thrown for 18 touchdowns and 7.9 yards per pass, {{both of which were}} {{among the highest in the}} NFL; Rivers' performance had also enabled him to be in position to overtake Peyton Manning's single-season passing yards record. The Chargers had the top-ranked offense in the NFL, and also ranked first in yardage after the catch. Another offensive player that the Bears faced was tight end Antonio Gates, who led the league in career touchdowns with 101. However, the San Diego running game was struggling, with 3.6 rushing yards per play, which ranked 30th in the league. Special teams-wise, both teams were among the worst in the NFL: the Chargers were ranked 30th in average return yardage allowed, while the Bears were 31st; the former also allowed a league-high ten returns of 30–39 yards. For the Chargers' punt return unit, they had only one yard in 2015. San Diego also had league-worsts in starting yard line after kickoffs with 19.3 yards, drives starting within their own 20-yard line (11) and average starting area (21). Forte, receiver Eddie Royal, safety Harold Jones-Quartey, Shea McClellin, Hroniss Grasu, Tayo Fabuluje and defensive lineman Ziggy Hood were inactive.|$|E
