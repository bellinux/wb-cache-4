5|$|Apple Computer {{announced}} an intention to acquire NeXT on December 20, 1996. Apple paid $429million in cash, which {{went to the}} initial investors and 1.5million Apple shares, which went to Steve Jobs, who was deliberately not given cash {{for his part in}} the deal. The main purpose of the acquisition <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> NeXTSTEP as a foundation to replace the dated classic Mac OS, instead of BeOS or the in-development Copland. The deal was finalized on February 7, 1997, bringing Jobs back to Apple as a consultant, who was later appointed as interim CEO. In 2000 Jobs took the CEO position as a permanent assignment.|$|E
5|$|As an {{alternative}} to the time-consuming task of creating a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the walkways behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would be vulnerable to arrowfire. A safer option for those assaulting a castle <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry. Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection for those inside, a siege tower could overlook the interior of a castle, giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Bede wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica, {{there were two}} common ways of {{referring}} to dates. One <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> indictions, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date {{would have to be}} given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the Anno Domini method invented by Dionysius Exiguus. Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in De Temporum Ratione, his work on chronology, is the main reason why it is now so widely used. Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle, contained in De Temporum Ratione, was developed from Dionysius Exiguus’ famous Easter table.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the missile and the need for extensive testing prior to launch, the V-2's designers at the Peenemünde Army Research Center favoured using heavily defended fixed sites where the missiles could be stored, armed, and fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant before launching. But the German Army and the V-2 project's head, Major-General Walter Dornberger, were concerned that the sites would be vulnerable to aerial attack by the Allies. The Army's preferred option <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Meillerwagens, mobile firing batteries, which presented a much smaller target for the Allied air forces.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the class}} was {{designed}} with reconnaissance, small scale minelaying and special operations in mind, it does not possess any offensive weapons such as torpedoes.

The initial plan <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the eveningone for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.|$|E

5|$|Diệm {{reportedly}} saw {{the poll}} {{as an opportunity}} to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could frame and justify his refusal to participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist authoritarianism. Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and championed the referendum as a first step in nurturing democracy. His support base <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this as a means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{there are}} two {{practical}} ways of producing hydrogen in a renewable industrial process.

5|$|F. Nelson Blount {{was killed}} when his private {{airplane}} hit a tree during an emergency landing, in Marlboro, New Hampshire, on August 31, 1967. By that time {{a good deal of}} Blount's collection was controlled by the Steamtown Foundation and had been relocated to Bellows Falls. Blount owned several corporations and one, the Green Mountain Railroad (GMRC), controlled the tracks that lay between Walpole, Bellows Falls and Chester, Vermont, which Steamtown <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> for its excursions. When Blount died most of the controlling stock of the GMRC was transferred {{to the president of the}} railroad, Robert Adams.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot piston design. The idea <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified {{around the perimeter}} of the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover that it was just as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E

5|$|However the Eleans, Messenians and Spartans {{remained}} passive throughout 210 BC, and Philip {{continued to}} make advances. He invested and took Echinus, using extensive siegeworks, having beaten back an attempt to relieve the town by the Aetolian strategos Dorimachus and the Roman fleet, now commanded by the proconsul Publius Sulpicius Galba. Moving west Philip probably also took Phalara {{the port city of}} Lamia, in the Maliac Gulf. Sulpicius and Dorimachus took Aegina, an island in the Saronic Gulf, which the Aetolians sold to Attalus, the Pergamene king, for thirty talents, and which he <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> as his base of operations against Macedon in the Aegean Sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, MGM hired Hilliard {{away from}} UA. His first {{assignment}} was to fix their problematic recording amplifiers whose overall phase shift measured {{out to a}} voice-distorting 1500 degrees. Hilliard's solution <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> higher linearity transformers obtained from Lansing Manufacturing Company, in consultation with founder Jim Lansing. Earlier, Hilliard had befriended a laboratory associate of his wife's, Dr. John Blackburn, and in 1934, he helped Blackburn get a position as design engineer at Lansing Manufacturing. The following year, Hilliard and his team at MGM solved the problem of recording Nelson Eddy's strong operatic baritone alongside Jeanette MacDonald's flat and weak soprano voice, picking up an Academy Award for Sound Recording on the duo's first film together: Naughty Marietta.|$|E

5|$|In {{the light}} of {{lessons learned from the}} partial Canadian success during Operation Windsor, Charnwood was to be {{launched}} on a broad front to increase the pressure on the German defences and disperse their defensive fire. SHAEF planners had advised, on 10 June, {{that the best way to}} break a stalemate <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> air power to support an attack; this method was to be used for Charnwood as Montgomery enlisted the aid of RAF Bomber Command. Heavy bombers would attack Caen on the night preceding the assault, with 15% of the total bomb load being delayed action bombs set to explode when the ground attack was launched. A second wave of light bombers would follow the heavies and a third wave of American bombers would attack on the morning of the operation.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{has been}} a leader in laser-driven {{inertial}} confinement fusion (ICF) since the initial concept was developed by LLNL employee John Nuckols in the late 1950s. The basic idea <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a driver to compress a small pellet known as the target that contains the fusion fuel, a mix of deuterium (D) and tritium (T). If the compression reaches high enough values, fusion reactions begin to take place, releasing alpha particles and neutrons. The alphas may impact atoms in the surrounding fuel, heating them {{to the point where they}} undergo fusion as well. If the rate of alpha heating is higher than heat losses to the environment, the result is a self-sustaining chain reaction known as ignition.|$|E
