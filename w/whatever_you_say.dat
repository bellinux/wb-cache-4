2500|$|... "Emena Thes" [...] {{is a power}} ballad {{with hard}} rock influences. The song begins with a piano {{introduction}} and follows the traditional verse-chorus format. The romantic ballad, a style Rouvas has become notable for over the years of his career, lyrically finds him asking the night and the stars what is to become of a troubled relationship. Rouvas professes his love to his lover, who still has not realized that she {{is in love with}} him, with the hook saying [...] "Wherever you go, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> I am the one you want".|$|E

6000|$|... --Well now, he mused, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> yourself. I think I'll {{trouble you}} for some fresh {{water and a}} half glass of whisky.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, speak by all means, Mr. Wilding. <b>Whatever</b> <b>you</b> may <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> need have no {{fear that}} any of us can doubt your good {{intentions}} to ourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little, {{except that}} I must be under it at moonrise. See and read, since <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> may <b>say</b> of yourself, <b>you</b> are, I think, no traitor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I'll wait {{a little}} longer till we reach the next stream, but then, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> may <b>say,</b> I really must drink, for I can bear this thirst no longer.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you mean?" [...] I {{asked with}} {{increasing}} interest. [...] "Tell {{me exactly what}} you mean. <b>Whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> I will hold sacred, of course." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{had to be}} broken." [...] He {{took more}} courage at her words. [...] "But I've only come to do <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> {{and not to be}} an--annoyance to you----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold your tongue," [...] {{said the}} {{inspector}} to the boy. [...] "Now, Smilash, {{do you wish}} to make any statement? Be careful, for <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> may be used against you hereafter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you want me to do, No-oot-ko," [...] {{returned}} the Indian girl, with a bright look, [...] "but I know that <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> are <b>saying</b> must be kind, for you've got such a nice face." ...|$|R
6000|$|VIVIAN. My dear fellow, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> may <b>say,</b> it {{is merely}} a {{dramatic}} utterance, and no more represents Shakespeare's real views upon art than the speeches of Iago represent his real views upon morals. But {{let me get to}} the end of the passage: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may know}} a good deal," [...] he said, [...] "or think you do,--girls {{nowadays}} read and talk of most surprising things,--but London {{is not a}} safe place for a young girl, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> may <b>say,</b> especially a young girl without enough money to live on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{exceedingly}} sorry--exceedingly sorry," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "to see this occur. I place myself at your service, Mr. Maloney. What you need shall be furnished. <b>Whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> shall be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{give you}} ample warning. At the least little {{consciousness}} {{in the region}} of the pericardium, off will go a note by a district messenger, and when you come I'll do <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say.</b> There!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{thought for}} a space, and then removed his boot and sat with it on his knee. [...] "Of course!... all that he said was wrong--quite wrong. Right is right and {{cheating}} is cheating, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'It must be old Tecumseh's--or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> call him--birthday,' <b>says</b> I. 'Or do {{they feed}} him every day? I thought gods only drank vanilla on Mount Catawampus.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good," [...] {{said the}} captain, turning away. [...] "Only don’t blame me, <b>whatever</b> happens. <b>You</b> can’t <b>say</b> I have not warned you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You think {{then that}} I am bound to listen patiently to <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> choose to <b>say</b> to me, however unbecoming {{it may be}} from one in your {{position}} to one in mine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Knightley {{shook his}} head at her. Her father fondly replied, [...] "Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} to say, Ziska? <b>Whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> do not abuse him. It is my affair, not yours. You may {{think what you}} like of me for taking such a husband, but {{remember}} that he is to be my husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> though {{reason may}} be {{altogether}} on your side, it will not shake my confidence, one bit. I know that Jack is alive, and I believe firmly, although of this I am not absolutely sure, that he will, someday, be restored to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{will never}} do, O'Hearn. <b>Whatever</b> <b>you</b> have to <b>say</b> {{must be said}} clearly, and in the {{simplest}} manner. Follow to the library, where I will hear your report. Joyce, you will accompany us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then leave a letter, and {{say that}} you'll wait for an answer. Write to Miss Hotspur <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> like to <b>say</b> {{in the way of}} a love-letter, and put it under cover to Sir Harry--open." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Mary," [...] {{she said}} tentatively, [...] "you wouldn't mind giving us some tea? We {{did try to}} get some, but the shop was so crowded, {{and in the next}} one there was a band playing; and most of the pictures, at any rate, were very dull, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> may <b>say,</b> William." [...] She spoke with a kind of guarded gentleness.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't understand, laddie. You're not {{a married}} man. I mean to say, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> {{for or against}} marriage--personally I'm all for it and {{consider}} it a ripe egg--the fact remains that it practically makes a chappie a spent force as a cooer. I don't want to dish you in any way, old bean, but I must firmly and resolutely decline to coo." ...|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT [hugely self-satisfied]. I think I've {{done the}} trick this time. I just {{gave them a}} bit of {{straight}} talk; and it went home. They were greatly impressed: everyone of those men believes in me and will vote for me when the question of selecting a candidate comes up. After all, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> Larry, they like an Englishman. They feel they can trust him, I suppose.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> Jenkins. If you're sure o' the way back, as I've {{no doubt}} you are, why, there couldn't be greater fun than {{to go after the}} buffalo on our own account. And--I say, look there! Isn't that somethin' like them on the top o' the far bluff yonder? A fellow like you, wi' sharp sailor-eyes, {{ought to be able to}} make them out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, my good creature, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> have to <b>say</b> to me, {{out with}} it at once! I don't want to hurry you needlessly; but these are {{business}} hours, and I have other people's affairs to attend to besides yours.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Whatever,</b> Parson Dick, <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> The {{world will}} get each blessed day [...] Still {{more and more}} askew, And fall apart at last. Great snakes! What {{skillful}} tinker ever takes [...] His tongue to turn a screw? ...|$|R
6000|$|Clive. I {{wonder at}} it. For {{you are in}} the world, and you love the world, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> may <b>say.</b> And I wonder that one of your {{strength}} of mind should so care for it. I think my simple old father is much finer than all your grandees: his single-mindedness more lofty than all their bowing, and haughtiness, and scheeming. What are you thinking of, as you stand in that pretty attitude--like Mnemosyne--with your finger on your chin? ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{is a very}} {{inconvenient}} {{habit of}} kittens (Alice had once made the remark) that, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> to them, they ALWAYS purr. 'If they would only purr for [...] "yes" [...] and mew for [...] "no," [...] or any rule of that sort,' she had said, 'so that one could keep up a conversation! But how CAN you talk with a person if they always say the same thing?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Beatrice, do {{not tell}} {{anything}} to Lady Arabella as though it came from me; I do not want anything to be told to her, either of me or from me. Say what you like to me yourself; <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> will not anger me. Indeed, I know what you would say--and yet I love you. Oh, I love you, Trichy--Trichy, I do love you so much! Don't turn away from me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, there's {{no mistake}} at all, this time," [...] the {{inspector}} said quietly, slipping {{a pair of}} handcuffs unobstrusively into his pocket as he spoke. [...] "If you come along with me without any unnecessary noise, we won't trouble to iron you. But you'd better say {{as little as possible}} about the charget just now, for <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> may be used in evidence at the trial against you." ...|$|E
50|$|There {{were many}} cases in Greek and Neo-Assyrian {{cultures}} where social inferiors would stand before their superiors armed {{only with a}} magical stone set in a ring. They were hoping that the rings would increase their goodwill and help them build favorable relationships with the hierarchy."A little ring for success and for charm (charis) and for victory… The world has nothing better than this. For when you have it with you, you will always get <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> ask from anybody. Besides, it calms the angers (orgai) of kings and master. Wearing it, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> may <b>say</b> to anyone, <b>you</b> will be believed, {{and you will be}} pleasing to everybody”.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you suppose}} that she'll {{give up the}} man she loves because you don't like him? Is that the way girls live now-a-days? She won't run away with him, because she's not one of that sort; but unless you're harder-hearted than I take you to be, she'll make your life a burden to you. And as for betraying you, that's nonsense. You've no right to say it. I'm not going to quarrel with <b>you</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> may <b>say,</b> but you've no right to say it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we won't say {{anything}} more about your affair, Nat, if you don't like it; but we sha'n't think any the less, because we are all proud of <b>you,</b> and <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> may <b>say,</b> {{it was a very}} plucky action. I know that I would rather stand up against the biggest Frenchman than face one of those savage hounds. And how is the arm going on? I see you still have the arm of your jacket snipped open and tied up with ribbons, and you keep it in a sling." ...|$|R
