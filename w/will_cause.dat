5|$|As the Sun expands, it will {{swallow the}} planets Mercury and Venus. Earth's fate is less clear; {{although}} the Sun will envelop Earth's current orbit, the star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> the planets' orbits to move farther out.

5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike.

At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> it to tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied {{in the direction of the}} turn. At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E

It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the cyanide ion is released.

If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle will become statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.|$|E

5|$|According to {{an article}} on The Conversation written by Robert Merkel, Heartbleed {{revealed}} a massive failure of risk analysis. Merkel thinks OpenSSL gives more importance to performance than to security, which no longer makes sense in his opinion. But Merkel considers that OpenSSL should not be blamed as much as OpenSSL users, who chose to use OpenSSL, without funding better auditing and testing. Merkel explains that two aspects determine the risk that more similar bugs <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> vulnerabilities. One, the library's source code influences the risk of writing bugs with such an impact. Secondly, OpenSSL's processes affect the chances of catching bugs quickly. On the first aspect, Merkel mentions {{the use of the}} C programming language as one risk factor which favored Heartbleed's appearance, echoing Wheeler's analysis.|$|E

The trio are {{to drive to the}} Nuclear Plutonium Store, where isotopes for all Britain's power stations are housed, and plant explosives to detonate at 12:30p.m.; this <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> a nuclear explosion of unprecedented scale and devastate half of England.

The {{electrical generator}} plant’s instalation needs water as a media to cool the boiler. Because of that PLTU Tambak Lorok {{has some kind of}} side effect by forming some kind of heat wastewater which temperature reachs about 37 o C. When the heat wastewater is disposed to some near water site, the temperature could be risen vastly that it could affect all sorts of physical and chemical character which also has it own affect to the water quality and the water organism lives. Phytoplankton which’s a part of the food chain system for sea organisms could be used as some kind of biology indicator to watch over the polluting that caused by thermal discharge. For knowing the intensity of the polluting, polluting index is used with Shanon-Wiener’s Diversity Index. Based in Shanon-Wiener’s Diversity Index and using phytoplankton as the indicator, Semarang Tanjung Emas’s port’s pool is currently in a medium polluted state with diversity index 1. 48.

From the analysist of physical-chemical parameter changes to the diversity index we could assume that each time the temperature is increased by 1 o C it <b>will</b> <b>causes</b> a decreasing water quality index as far as 0. 03.

5|$|Both {{the player}} and the {{opponent}} have stamina meters, both {{displayed on the}} top of the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out. Faster knockdowns <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> that boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being knocked down (resulting in a knockout or KO) or if they are knocked down three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO). The player can also recover some stamina while the opponent is down by pressing the buttons on the controller.|$|E
