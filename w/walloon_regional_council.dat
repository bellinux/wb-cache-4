40|$|This study investigates {{factors that}} may explain <b>regional</b> <b>council</b> {{operative}} goal effectiveness. <b>Regional</b> <b>council</b> operative goals are viewed as the critical tasks and activities performed by the <b>council.</b> Three <b>regional</b> <b>council</b> policy council roles and three professional staff activities represent the dependent variables. <b>Regional</b> <b>council</b> effectiveness on these roles and activities is evaluated by local government officials.;Three models of organizational effectiveness, the operative goal, systems resource, and participant satisfaction, are used to develop an explanation of <b>regional</b> <b>council</b> effectiveness. Together, these models suggest that <b>regional</b> <b>council</b> operative goal effectiveness is an outcome of resources exchanged between <b>regional</b> <b>councils</b> and their constituencies. Local governments contribute resources such as information, time, and money to <b>regional</b> <b>councils</b> in exchange for <b>regional</b> <b>council</b> technical assistance, especially {{in the form of}} help with local grants and planning. The models also suggest that <b>regional</b> <b>council</b> effectiveness is dependent on local official satisfaction with council assistance {{and the extent to which}} local governments use alternate sources to technical assistance.;Research arguments were tested using data from 12 <b>regional</b> <b>councils,</b> 86 county board chairpersons, and 167 municipal majors. Indicators of resources exchanged had positive and significant effects on <b>regional</b> <b>council</b> effectiveness. Local official satisfaction with <b>regional</b> <b>council</b> technical assistance also had signficant effects. A modest negative relationship was found between local government utilization of alternatives and <b>regional</b> <b>council</b> effectiveness.
