He resumed his songwriting career shortly before his December 1980 murder, which Ono witnessed at close range. She has stated that the couple <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> going out to dinner after spending several hours in a recording studio, but were returning to their apartment instead, because Lennon wanted to see Sean before he was put to bed. Following the murder, Ono went into complete seclusion for an extended period.|$|E

50|$|He {{encounters}} the man {{who told}} him of his wife's letter, and he thinks briefly about how he hates travelling through the cursed forest. Josh then sees the student, who <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how her parents will hate her once they find out that she dropped out of school. When Josh sees the two ballerinas, they both <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> that without the other, they could be stars. Then he sees the four going to the rave.

Josh then meets Jane, who <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> her next project, and how half- dead people can be used. She then snaps out of her dream, thinking that she might need counselling. Next, Josh sees the two Romanian generals. One <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how he lost his friends in war because his gun jammed, the other <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> marrying the woman he loves and setting up his own business. The next man he sees is the ticket collector, who <b>is</b> strangely <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the train derailing. Unable to see Yeli, Josh then sees the German businessman, who wants to embezzle his company's funds. Lastly, he sees Kate. She <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> {{the fact that she}} is pregnant, a fact Josh didn't know. Viktor then appears by her side, saying that she is the same as his wife Mary. Kate then turns into gas, Viktor sees Josh, and he runs away.|$|R

5|$|By early 1960, James Kinne was contemplating divorce, {{partially}} {{because of his}} wife's spendthrift habits and {{partially because}} he strongly suspected she was being unfaithful to him. He spoke to his parents {{about the possibility of}} divorce on March 18, 1960, telling them that Sharon had agreed to give him a divorce if he allowed her to keep the house and the couple's daughter and paid her $1,000, but the elder Kinnes, devout Mormons, urged James to stay in his marriage. Sharon, too, <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> ways out of the marriage; according to John Boldizs, she once offered him $1,000 to kill her husband or find someone who would, although he later claimed that she may have been joking.|$|E

2500|$|The analogy he {{provides}} {{to explain his}} theory is that of wood and fire. Wood, he argues, is potentially hot (just as a human <b>is</b> potentially <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> a universal), and therefore requires something else which is already hot (such as fire) to actualize this. This means that for the human intellect to think about something, the First Intellect must already <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it. Therefore, {{he says that the}} First Intellect must always <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> everything. Once the human intellect comprehends a universal by this process, it becomes part of the individual's [...] "acquired intellect" [...] and can be thought about whenever he or she wishes.|$|R
25|$|Several strips made {{allusions to}} Wally's disappearance, {{including}} one featuring Becky Howard's car having a POW/MIA bumper sticker and her placing a U.S. flag on an unidentified grave. In the July 12, 2009, strip, it is finally shown that Wally {{is alive and}} in full military uniform; a backstory revealed that Funky had gotten a call from his ex-wife, Cindy, informing him that Wally was alive {{and that she had}} conducted an interview that was to air on the news that evening. It was revealed that Wally had been held as a prisoner of war in Iraq for the past decade (possibly taken hostage around the time of Lisa's death), and—unaware that he was presumed dead and that Becky had remarried—stated during that interview that what kept him sane during his time in captivity <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> his wife and family. Funky visits the Howards to reveal that Wally was alive and in good health. In the August 9, 2009, strip, it was revealed that the grave Becky had visited all these years was that of Wally's assumed remains. Wally has made occasional appearances since his return to Westview, and made his first appearance as a central character in a storyline that began February 1, 2010, strip.|$|E
25|$|Ching Leung – Leung is a 27-year-old renowned lawyer. He is Sum’s boyfriend {{towards the}} middle of the series. He is a moody but {{vigilant}} and caring figure who forever strives to do his best. Although he is a kind person, he has an inability to stay faithful and succumbs. At one point he had an affair with Sheung Joi Sum's best friend Shui Mak Mak, but he kept it quiet and reconciled with Sheung Joi Sum without admitting anything about the matter. Eventually information would slip and Sheung Joi Sum actively demands to know who was the other woman, but Ching felt exposing this matter would ruin everything and insists for her to drop the matter since he admitted his mistakes and assures Sheung Joi Sum it would never happen again. Sheung Joi Sum wasn't satisfied with such an answer and whenever he tries to comfort her, Tong Chi On would be around and he becomes jealous. After the big secret was exposed, everyone parted ways for some time and Leung would try to patch things between him and Sheung Joi Sum. Despite the fact that they broke up, Leung continues to love Sum. This is shown when he continues to write in his blog, Days without Sheung Joi Sum, three years after the break-up. He also helps Sheung Joi Sum think of ideas to defend Ling Lei. He eventually dies of a car crash in the end, because he <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> Sheung Joi Sum's decision to forgive him or not. Although he could be saved, he refuses to go to the hospital, using his final moments to tell Sheung Joi Sum ways to defeat Wong Sau-Kam. Sheung Joi Sum, who forgave Leung and is willing to renew their relationship, was greatly sadden by his death.|$|E
