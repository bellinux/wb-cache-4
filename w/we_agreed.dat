Groening felt that the episode was a thirty-minute advertisement for Brooks' show The Critic (which had moved to Fox from ABC for its second season), and was created by former The Simpsons showrunners Al Jean and Mike Reiss, and whose lead character Jay Sherman appears in the episode. He hoped Brooks would pull the episode because [...] "articles began to appear in several newspapers around the country saying that [...] created The Critic", and removed his names from the credits. In response, Brooks said [...] "I am furious with Matt, he's been going to everybody who wears a suit at Fox and complaining about this. When he voiced his concerns about how to draw The Critic into the Simpsons' universe he was right and <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> to his changes.

When asked about choosing the premiere date for the show, GSN’s Executive Vice President of Programming, Amy Introcaso-Davis, said [...] "Divided is informed by the fractured social landscape, which in turn, reflects the political divide in this country....launching Divided so close to the inauguration, much like a question in the show, was hotly debated! Ultimately <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> it was a good time to show that although people have many disagreements, it is to everyone’s benefit to unite."

On March 30, 2017, a special edition of the show aired with three contestants instead of the usual four, resembling the format on the original British series.

I kept asking John to tap into his inner Mexican and be able to saturate the greens and the purples and the pinks and the oranges. The classic Japanese woodblock print The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai was a common motif in the ocean battles; Del Toro recalled, [...] "I would say 'Give me a Hokusai wave'… we use the waves and weather in the movie very operatically." [...] The director asked that Knoll not necessarily match the lighting from shot to shot: [...] "It's pretty unorthodox to do that, but I think the results are really beautiful and very artistically free and powerful, not something you would associate with a big sci-fi action movie." [...] Del Toro considers the film's digital water its most exciting visual effect: [...] "The water dynamics in this movie are technically beautiful, but also artistically incredibly expressive. <b>We</b> <b>agreed</b> on making the water become almost another character.

500|$|In September 1976, Genesis {{relocated}} to Relight Studios in Hilvarenbeek, The Netherlands with Hentschel to record Wind & Wuthering. It {{was put together}} in {{a short amount of}} time and a considerable amount of material was written beforehand, of which the most suitable songs were picked for development. Rutherford spoke of the band's conscious effort to distance themselves from songs inspired by fantasy, something that their past albums [...] "were full of". The band spent roughly six weeks writing the album with a basic form of each track put down in twelve days. Additional recording and production work was done at Trident Studios that October. Hackett, having already released a solo album, enjoyed the greater amount of control over the recording process that working within a group could not provide. He felt his songs, including [...] "Please Don't Touch" [...] which he later released on his second album Please Don't Touch!, were rejected from the final track order in favour of material that Banks, in particular, had put forward. Collins spoke of the situation, [...] "We just wanted to use what <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> was the strongest material, irrespective of who wrote it". Wind & Wuthering was released in December 1976 and reached No. 6 the UK and No. 26 in the US. Rutherford's track, [...] "Your Own Special Way", became its sole single and went to No. 43 in the UK. Its B-side is [...] "It's Yourself", originally intended for A Trick of the Tail.|$|E
