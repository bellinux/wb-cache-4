5|$|Birds forage singly or {{in pairs}} in summer, {{and more often}} in larger flocks in autumn and winter, during which time {{they are more likely}} to loiter around people and urban areas. They {{occasionally}} associate with Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) or common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) when foraging. Birds have also been encountered with grey currawongs (S.versicolor) and satin bowerbirds (Ptilinorhynchus violaceus). The species has been reported stealing food from other birds such as the Australian hobby (Falco longipennis), collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus), and sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita). Pied currawongs will also harass each other. A 2007 study conducted by researchers from the Australian National University showed that white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis) nestlings became silent <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> recorded sound of a pied currawong walking through leaf litter.|$|E
5|$|Ibrox Park had {{the worst}} fan safety record in Britain before its {{complete}} redesign and renaming in 1997. Two fans died in September 1961 when a barrier collapsed on Stairway 13, resulting in a crush. Stairway 13 was a popular, often overcrowded, and very steep exit from the East Terracing due to its proximity to Copland Road subway station and parking areas for the Rangers supporters' coaches. After this incident, Rangers installed safety measures, but further injuries were sustained in crushes on Stairway 13 in both 1967 and 1969. On 23 October 1968, the main stand at Ibrox was hit by fire. Just seven months later there was another fire, which destroyed more than 200 seats behind the directors box. The worst disaster to yet affect football in Britain happened on Stairway 13 after the Old Firm game on 2 January 1971, when 66 people died of asphyxiation due to another crush on Stairway 13. The game itself ended in a 1–1 draw, with Colin Stein scoring a late equalising goal for Rangers. This led to a widespread belief that the crush had been caused by fans who had left the game early, but had turned back <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> roar that greeted the Rangers goal. A public inquiry discounted this initial story. It established that the crowd had been travelling {{in the same direction}} when the crush happened, with it perhaps being precipitated by some bending over to pick up items that had been discarded during the goal celebrations. The downward force of the crowd leaving the stadium meant that when people started to fall there was no means of preventing a crush.|$|E
25|$|On November 22, 1963, a {{group of}} {{executives}} (including Executive Producer Allen M. Potter and director Tom Donovan) met at the Young & Rubicam ad agency in New York to discuss the show's opening story, the death of William Matthews, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news of another death in Dallas: the assassination of President Kennedy.|$|E

25|$|At a coroner's inquest Rogers and Kelley both {{insisted they}} were {{seated in the}} living room on the first floor <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> shot that caused Hoey's death. Their {{testimony}} was supported by Yamada, Catalano, and a farmer who was present when he called to collect some wages he was owed. Rogers and Kelley were discharged by the coroner. They had been under $2,500 bail each. The coroner's jury returned an open verdict that Hoey killed herself in the second floor bedroom.|$|E
25|$|The {{others had}} not moved much further <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> shots ring out. A {{raid on the}} shop had been planned, and Tracy had arrived just before the {{soldiers}}. Clancy was at Nelson's Pillar {{when he saw the}} trucks filled with soldiers pass, he surmised that the shop was to be raided, but had no way of warning his comrades. Tracy, along with two civilians, was killed in the incident. McKee only narrowly avoided capture, by escaping on a bicycle during the confusion {{at the time of the}} shooting.|$|E
25|$|Thinking {{they had}} been cut off <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> gunfire from the road back to Hampton behind them, Duryée's men of the 5th New York Infantry withdrew from their {{advanced}} position and headed south {{to the sound of}} the guns, as did the other Union troops from the Vermont and Massachusetts regiments under Lieutenant Colonel Washburn. Those troops were approaching Little Bethel in front of the site of the incident. The Union forces had lost the element of surprise for their attack and delayed the timing of it as well.|$|E
60|$|The {{destination}} {{had been}} altered <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>the</b> state of things at Toulon. The document was purposed {{to be signed}} by the maire, under his official seal.|$|R

25|$|Many Parisians presumed Louis' {{actions to}} be aimed against the Assembly and began open {{rebellion}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news the next day. They were also afraid that arriving soldiers – mostly foreign mercenaries – had been summoned {{to shut down}} the National Constituent Assembly. The Assembly, meeting at Versailles, went into nonstop session to prevent another eviction from their meeting place. Paris was soon consumed by riots, chaos, and widespread looting. The mobs soon had the support of some of the French Guard, who were armed and trained soldiers.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Broughton returned, about 25 minutes later, Bessie Smith was in shock. Time passed {{with no sign}} of the ambulance, so Hugh Smith {{suggested}} that they take her into Clarksdale in his car. He and Broughton had almost finished clearing the back seat <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sound of a car approaching at high speed. Smith flashed his lights in warning, but the oncoming car failed to stop and plowed into his car at full speed. It sent his car careening into Bessie Smith's overturned Packard, completely wrecking it. The oncoming car ricocheted off Hugh Smith's car into the ditch on the right, barely missing Broughton and Bessie Smith.|$|E
25|$|Entering or {{exiting the}} city meant passing {{under the watchful}} eye of the {{soldiers}} on guard duty. At dusk, the gates would be shut, not to be re-opened until sunrise. Fear of an attack was not the only reason for closing the gates at night. In fact, for extended periods, especially in the late 18th century, there was little likelihood of being attacked. Yet even in times of good relations with the neighbouring French, the doors were shut: above all the military authorities feared their troops deserting. This was a constant plague for the Austrian army, as for all Ancien Régime garrisons. Each year, a tenth of the troops would be lost to desertion, often escaping under the cover of darkness. In 1765, barbed wire was placed on the ramparts, to make night-time escapes more difficult. Paradoxically, the gate closure became more a matter of keeping the garrison inside than of protecting the city itself. However, those still outside the walls would have to hurry home <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> Zapestreech—signalling the imminent gate closure—if they wanted to avoid being locked out for the night. The Luxembourgish legend of Saint Nicholas (see below) refers to this.|$|E
50|$|After the assassinations, a {{group of}} {{citizens}} recount what <b>they</b> were doing <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>the</b> President had been killed and lament that even though only a single man died, the nation has changed forever ("Something Just Broke").|$|R

60|$|A little crowd had, by this time, {{collected}} round them; and <b>the</b> women, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>the</b> strangers were shikarees, who {{had come}} up with the intention of killing tigers, brought them bowls of milk, cakes and other presents.|$|R
25|$|Both Rice and Poindexter had alibis for {{the night}} of the bombing, who testified for the defense. Poindexter went to a movie with a girl named Linda Walker, who was the {{daughter}} of a New York City police officer. They were together <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> blast. Rice was at a party from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. at Rae Ann Schmitz's house. She testified as a first year law student and eventually became a member of his legal defense team. Cousins of Duane Peak, Frank and Will Peak, testified that Duane Peak's story of what he did the week before the bombing was a lie. Will Peak provided Poindexter with an alibi {{for the night}} that he was accused of building the bomb in David Rice's kitchen. The jury ignored it all. Norma Aufrecht, who allegedly drove Duane Peak from NCCF headquarters to David Rice's house, did not testify. She was charged with conspiracy to commit first degree murder and accessory after the fact. She would have testified that she did not drive Duane Peak on Sunday, August 16, but she was never deposed by the defense. She fled Omaha in fear and did not return to live there for 10 years after the trial.|$|E
500|$|Early in the First World War, the Royal Navy {{erected a}} signal station on Hirta, and daily {{communications}} with the mainland were {{established for the}} first time in the history of the islands. In a belated response, the German submarine SM U-90 arrived in Village Bay on the morning of 15 May 1918 and, after issuing a warning, started shelling the island. Seventy-two shells were fired, and the wireless station was destroyed. The manse, church, and jetty storehouse were damaged, but there was no loss of life. One eyewitness recalled: [...] "It wasn't what you would call a bad submarine because it could have blowed every house down because they were all in a row there. He only wanted Admiralty property. One lamb was killed... all the cattle ran from one side of the island to the other <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> shots." ...|$|E
500|$|Omayra Sánchez {{lived in}} the {{neighborhood}} of Santander with her parents Álvaro Enrique, a rice and sorghum collector, and María Aleida, along with her brother Álvaro Enrique and aunt María Adela Garzón. [...] Prior to the eruption, her mother had traveled to Bogotá on business. The night of the disaster, Omayra and her family were awake, worrying about the ashfall from the eruption, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sound of an approaching lahar. After it hit, Omayra became trapped under her home's concrete and other debris and could not free herself. When rescue teams tried to help her, they realized that her legs were trapped under her house's roof. Sources differ as to the degree to which Sánchez was trapped. Zeiderman (2009) said she was [...] "trapped up to her neck", while Barragán (1987) said that she was trapped up to her waist.|$|E
60|$|Betsy and Trot, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>the</b> rescue expedition, {{begged the}} Wizard to {{permit them to}} join it and he consented. The Glass Cat, overhearing the conversation, wanted to go also and to this the Wizard made no objection.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the prince and princess had got a good start, and were feeling quite happy, <b>when</b> {{suddenly}} <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sound of a gallop far behind them. The prince sprang from the saddle, and laid his ear to the ground.|$|R
50|$|Flashbulb {{memories}} are clear episodic memories of unique and highly emotional events. People remembering {{where they were}} or what <b>they</b> were doing <b>when</b> <b>they</b> first <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news of President Kennedy's assassination, the Sydney Siege or of 9/11 are examples of flashbulb memories.|$|R
500|$|The stagecoach {{made its}} way through the crowded square at about 10:30am. Kupriashvili gave the signal, and the robbers hit the {{carriage}} with grenades, killing many of the horses and guards, and began shooting security men guarding the stagecoach and the square. Bombs were thrown from all directions. The Georgian newspaper Isari reported: [...] "No one could tell if the terrible shooting was the boom of cannons or explosion of bombs... The sound caused panic everywhere... almost across the whole city, people started running. Carriages and carts were galloping away". [...] The blasts were so strong that they knocked over nearby chimneys and broke every pane of glass for a mile around. Ekaterina Svanidze, Stalin's wife, was standing on a balcony at their home near the square with her family and young child. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> explosions, they rushed back into the house terrified.|$|E
500|$|Having {{collected}} {{water from}} the nearby village, MacLaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> shots. Thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat, they continued on their way, and called out to the other passengers, who they thought were still alive. This alerted the insurgents {{to the presence of}} more survivors; one of the guerrillas told MacLaren's group to [...] "come here". The insurgents then opened fire on their general location, prompting MacLaren and the others to flee. Hill and the Hansens also ran; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their haste, but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge. After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours, they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about 19:45. The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the suitcases strewn around the site, filled their arms with passengers' belongings, then left again.|$|E
500|$|Though Macfadyen enjoyed {{working in}} the series, {{he began to feel}} [...] "very {{sluggish}} and fed up" [...] with playing the same character for two years. When the producers knew Macfadyen planned to leave, they did not know whether or not he would appear {{in the beginning of the}} third series. Howard Brenton, who wrote the series two finale, originally killed Tom off by drowning him while trying to escape onto the North Sea, while labouring under the impression that he was not to return. The producers would have continued the third series without Tom, however <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> actor would be prepared to return for the first two episodes of the third series, they were rewritten to include his character Tom. Brenton had to [...] "unkill him." [...] After a seven-year absence, in October 2011, it was announced that Macfadyen was to make a [...] "fleeting" [...] cameo appearance in the final episode of the series. A Spooks insider stated that his scene [...] "will bring back all the memories of Tom and what the character endured in those first few series." ...|$|E
50|$|On 10 September, the Indian Union Home Secretary {{stated that}} it was not {{necessary}} that the emails claiming responsibility for the Delhi High Court blast were sent by the actual perpetrators and added {{that it could have been}} other people who, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> about <b>the</b> blast, sent the emails.|$|R

500|$|Lincoln's flag-enfolded {{body was}} then escorted {{in the rain}} to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death. The late President lay in state in the East Room, {{and then in the}} Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. For his final journey with his son Willie, both caskets were transported in the {{executive}} coach [...] "United States" [...] and for three weeks the Lincoln Special funeral train decorated in black bunting bore Lincoln's remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities across the North for large-scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands, as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by. Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd to eulogize Lincoln, one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president. Historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but also noted that some Lincoln haters cheered <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news. African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their Moses'. In a larger sense, the outpouring of grief and anguish was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war that had just ended.|$|E
2500|$|Steamers on the Columbia River were {{equipped}} with steam whistles, which often had distinctive tones. [...] Telephones whistle (later installed on Bailey Gatzert) {{could be heard}} and recognized for 15 miles. [...] The whistle was so distinctive {{that it could be}} recognized by the dogs of Cathlamet, Washington, where Captain Scott customarily dropped off the table scraps. [...] <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> whistle, they would gather down at the Cathlamet landing with the expectation of food.|$|E
2500|$|In {{line with}} Sheridan's order, Merritt ordered Devin and Custer to {{dismount}} their men and charge the Confederate works {{as soon as}} they heard the sound of battle from the infantry attack. They were to leave one brigade each on horseback to exploit any breakthrough. Devin's men and Pennington's brigade of Custer's division attacked the fortifications along White Oak Road <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> infantry's attack. Pennington was at Custer's command post where Custer told him to call for his [...] "led horses" [...] so he could support Custer's flank attack, contrary to Merritt's orders that he should attack dismounted along with Devin's men.|$|E
