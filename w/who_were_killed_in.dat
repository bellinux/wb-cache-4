5|$|Libya blocked access on January 24, 2010, {{because of}} videos that {{featured}} demonstrations {{in the city}} of Benghazi by families of detainees <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties. The blocking was criticized by Human Rights Watch. In November 2011, after the Libyan Civil War, YouTube was once again allowed in Libya.|$|E

5|$|The Allied naval bombardments {{disrupted}} {{industrial production}} in the cities targeted, and convinced many Japanese civilians {{that the war was}} lost. Up to 1,739 Japanese were killed in the attacks, and as many as 1,497 were wounded. The only Allied casualties were 32 prisoners of war, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> the bombardments of Kamaishi.|$|E
5|$|A set of plaques {{was added}} to the south of the {{memorial}} in 1949, commemorating the 29,924 Royal Artillerymen <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> the Second World War. Over the years, pollution and water penetration caused damage to the bronzes and stonework. English Heritage conducted a major restoration of the memorial during 2011, completed in time for Remembrance Day. In 1970 the memorial was protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building, and in 2014 it was one of five memorials in London to be upgraded to Grade I status to mark the centenary of the First World War.|$|E

5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Greece {{almost all the}} Jews of Rhodes {{were sent to the}} Auschwitz concentration camp; as a result, most members of Etz Ahayem had close family members <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> the Holocaust.

After the war the scrolls were retrieved and sent to Israel, and a Dr. Nace Cohen was able to procure one of them for Etz Ahayem.|$|E
5|$|Further killings {{occurred}} on 21 February 1992, when four non-Serb civilians were arrested by Croatian Serb {{forces and the}} SDG and killed in the training centre after being interrogated. The four were subsequently buried in a mass grave in Daljski Atar. One more Hungarian civilian was murdered by the Serbian State Security Service—with SDG assistance—after inquiring about her relatives <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> November 1991.

5|$|The Nazi plan to kill Polish Jews {{from across}} the General Government during Aktion Reinhard was overseen in {{occupied}} Poland by SS-Obergruppenführer Odilo Globocnik, the deputy of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler in Berlin. The Operation Reinhard camps reported directly to the Reich Main Security Office (German: Reichssicherheitshauptamt or RSHA for short), which was also headed by Himmler. The staff of Operation Reinhard, most {{of whom had been}} involved in the Action T4 euthanasia programme, used T4 as a framework for the construction of facilities. All of the Jews <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> the Reinhard camps came from ghettos.|$|E
5|$|The first {{academic}} {{accounts of}} the Nanking Massacre included as massacre victims all Chinese who {{were killed by the}} Japanese Army in and around Nanking, including Chinese soldiers <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> action. This definition was supported by Hora and other early scholars. In 1986 Ikuhiko Hata became the first historian to call this definition into question. Hata argued that Chinese troops killed on the battlefield were part of the Battle of Nanking rather than Nanking Massacre, and that only civilians and disarmed POWs should be counted as massacre victims.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest single}} {{memorial}} of the 20th century {{is the war}} memorial, {{to the design of}} Hardy Wilson, dedicated on 14 June 1922. It commemorates more than 50 men associated with St James' <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> the First World War, throughout which the roll of honour was regularly read during the Eucharist. In 2014, St James' was part of a series of commemorations of the bicentenary of the death of the colony's first Governor, Arthur Phillip. On 31 August, a memorial plaque, similar in form to one placed in the nave of Westminster Abbey on 9 July, was unveiled by the 37th Governor, Marie Bashir.|$|E

5|$|Erected as a {{permanent}} memorial to the men of Oldham <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> the First World War, Oldham's war memorial consists of a granite base surmounted by a bronze sculpture depicting five soldiers making their way along the trenches {{in order to go}} into battle. The main standing figure, having climbed out of the trenches, is shown calling on his comrades to advance, and is the same figure used at the Royal Fusiliers War Memorial in London and the 41st Division memorial at Flers in France. The base serves to house books containing the roll of honour of the 1st, 10th and 24th Battalions, Manchester Regiment. The pedestal has two bronze doors at either side.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Brown was {{reportedly}} unhappy over Blair's comments about him, while David Runciman of The London Review of Books suggested there were episodes from Blair's troubled {{relationship with his}} Chancellor that were absent from A Journey. Labour politician Alistair Darling said the book demonstrates how the country can be {{changed for the better}} when a government has a clear purpose, while the New Zealand Listener suggested Blair and his contemporaries had helped to write New Labour's epitaph. Some families of servicemen and women <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> Iraq reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets over the loss of life. Shortly after the release of A Journey, the screenwriter of the 2006 film The Queen, which depicts Blair's first months in office, accused Blair of plagiarising a conversation with Elizabeth II from him.|$|E

5|$|Heydrich's assailants hid in safe {{houses and}} {{eventually}} {{took refuge in}} Ss. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral, an Orthodox church in Prague. After a traitor in the Czech resistance betrayed their location, the church was surrounded by 800 members of the SS and Gestapo. Several Czechs were killed, and the remainder hid in the church's crypt. The Germans attempted to flush the men out with gunfire, tear gas, and by flooding the crypt. Eventually an entrance was made using explosives. Rather than surrender, the soldiers killed themselves. Supporters of the assassins <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> the wake of these events included the church's leader, Bishop Gorazd, who is now revered as a martyr of the Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|In {{the church}} are bronze plaques commemorating the eleven local {{people who died}} in World War I and the six <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> World War II.

There is also a memorial plaque to the local Bilbie family of bell founders and clockmakers inside the church, and just inside the porch, on {{the left of the}} church door, is a stone figure holding an anchor, which was moved to the church from Walley Court with the flooding of the lake. There is an unconfirmed story that this was given to the Gilbert family, then living at the court, by Queen ElizabethI.|$|E
5|$|Before other British {{outposts}} {{had learned}} about Pontiac's siege at Detroit, Native Americans captured five small forts {{in a series of}} attacks between May 16 and June 2. The first to be taken was Fort Sandusky, a small blockhouse on the shore of Lake Erie. It had been built in 1761 by order of General Amherst, despite the objections of local Wyandots, who in 1762 warned the commander that they would soon burn it down. On May 16, 1763, a group of Wyandots gained entry under the pretense of holding a council, the same stratagem that had failed in Detroit nine days earlier. They seized the commander and killed the other 15 soldiers, as well as British traders at the fort. These were among the first of about 100 traders <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> {{the early stages of the}} war. The dead were ritually scalped and the fort—as the Wyandots had warned a year earlier—was burned to the ground.|$|E
