5|$|Chromic acid {{anodizing}} (or Type I anodizing) {{of aluminium}} is another electrochemical process, <b>which</b> <b>does</b> {{not lead to}} the deposition of chromium, but uses chromic acid as electrolyte in the solution.

5|$|A merging draft, BioCode, was {{published}} in 1997 {{in an attempt to}} standardize nomenclature in these three areas, but has yet to be formally adopted. The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed. A revised BioCode that, instead of replacing the existing codes, would provide a unified context for them, was proposed in 2011. However, the International Botanical Congress of 2011 declined to consider the BioCode proposal. The ICVCN remains outside the BioCode, <b>which</b> <b>does</b> not include viral classification.|$|E
5|$|Although 247Bk is {{the most}} stable isotope of berkelium, its {{production}} in nuclear reactors is very inefficient due to the long half-life of its potential progenitor curium-247, <b>which</b> <b>does</b> not allow it sufficient time to beta decay before capturing another neutron. Thus, 249Bk {{is the most}} accessible isotope of berkelium, which still, is available only in small quantities (only 0.66grams have been produced in the US over the period 1967–1983) at a high price of the order 185 USD per microgram.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it is an}} attractive-looking bolete, Caloboletus calopus is not {{considered}} edible on account of its very bitter taste, <b>which</b> <b>does</b> not disappear upon cooking. There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. The bitter taste {{is largely due to}} the compounds calopin and a δ-lactone derivative, O-acetylcyclocalopinA. These compounds contains a structural motif known as a 3-methylcatechol unit, which is rare in natural products. A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003.|$|E

The real backlog is much smaller than the official 107 with 47 uncertain orders: 20 commitments for the A380-specialized lessor Amedeo which commits to production only once aircraft are placed, eight for Qantas which wants to keep its fleet at 12, six for Virgin Atlantic <b>which</b> <b>does</b> not want them anymore and three ex Transaero for finance vehicle Air Accord.|$|E
5|$|As, {{according}} to Bulgarian mythology {{and some other}} traditions, tortoises were the only beings who knew {{the appearance of the}} herb and the location where it grows, such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the tortoise is away. When it returns, the tortoise would be unable to access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, the tortoise would reveal the herb and people would acquire it from the tortoise, <b>which</b> <b>does</b> not need it anymore.|$|E

5|$|Doppler {{redshift}} vs cosmological red-shift: Astronomersoften {{refer to}} the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, <b>which</b> <b>does</b> not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.|$|E
5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, <b>which</b> <b>does</b> not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E
