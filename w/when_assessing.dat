5|$|Fleiss' kappa (named after Joseph L. Fleiss) is a {{statistical}} measure {{for assessing the}} reliability of agreement between a fixed number of raters when assigning categorical ratings {{to a number of}} items or classifying items. This contrasts with other kappas such as Cohen's kappa, which only work <b>when</b> <b>assessing</b> the agreement between not more than two raters or the interrater reliability for one appraiser versus themself. The measure calculates the degree of agreement in classification over that which would be expected by chance. There is no generally agreed-upon measure of significance, although guidelines have been given.|$|E
5|$|The Song dynasty {{had one of}} {{the most}} prosperous and {{advanced}} economies in the medieval world. Song Chinese invested their funds in joint stock companies and in multiple sailing vessels at a time when monetary gain was assured from the vigorous overseas trade and domestic trade along the Grand Canal and Yangtze River. Prominent merchant families and private businesses were allowed to occupy industries that were not already government-operated monopolies. Both private and government-controlled industries met the needs of a growing Chinese population in the Song. Artisans and merchants formed guilds that the state had to deal with <b>when</b> <b>assessing</b> taxes, requisitioning goods, and setting standard workers' wages and prices on goods.|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} shed {{new light}} on classroom dynamics. Although, on average, teachers do not induce more confidence, trust or risk-taking behaviour than an external examiner, the experiment showed that male teachers are beneficial. We also show that high ability pupils {{are more likely to}} exert effort <b>when</b> <b>assessed</b> by the teacher than <b>when</b> <b>assessed</b> by the external examiner. Low ability pupils did not significantly change their behaviour <b>when</b> <b>assessed</b> by the teacher. Surprisingly, contrary to some theoretical literature that links ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status to self-fulfilling beliefs about performance, we do not find that any of these characteristics matter...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} suggests that alterations in brain structure and function are a feature of chronic back pain. Tactile acuity is considered a clinical signature of primary somatosensory representation and offers a simple measure of cortical reorganisation. Clinical interpretation of test scores from an individual patient is hampered by variance in published normative values and less than ideal inter-rater reliability. These problems might be mitigated in people with unilateral back pain by using the patient as their own control and comparing tactile acuity at the painful site to performance at the corresponding position on the non-painful side. The first step in exploring this approach is to quantify the normal side-to-side difference in healthy populations. We pooled data from three previous studies that measured lumbar tactile acuity bilaterally in healthy controls using similar protocols. We calculated the mean and variance of the absolute error between sides, the standard error of measurement and the reliable change index (RCI). The mean difference between sides was 3. 2 mm (± 5. 2) <b>when</b> <b>assessed</b> vertically and 1. 9 mm (± 3. 2) <b>when</b> <b>assessed</b> horizontally. The standard error of measurement was 4. 2 mm <b>when</b> <b>assessed</b> vertically and 2. 7 mm <b>when</b> <b>assessed</b> horizontally. The RCI suggests that differences of greater than 13 mm <b>when</b> <b>assessed</b> horizontally and 17 mm <b>when</b> <b>assessed</b> vertically equate to 95 % confidence that a difference truly exists. Several assumptions related to the application of this approach need to be investigated further...|$|R

5|$|A land tax, {{aimed at}} {{breaking}} up big estates and give wider scope for small-scale farming, was also introduced, while {{coverage of the}} Arbitration system was extended to agricultural workers, domestics, and federal public servants. In addition, {{the age at which}} women became entitled to the old-age pension was lowered from sixty-five to sixty. The introduction of the maternity allowance was a major reform, because it enabled more births to be attended by doctors, thus leading to reductions in infant mortality rates. Compulsory preference to trade unionists in federal employment was also introduced, while the Seaman's Compensation Act of 1911 and the Navigation Act of 1912 were enacted to improve conditions for those working at sea, together with compensatory arrangements for seamen and next of kin. Eligibility for pensions was also widened. From December 1912 onwards, naturalised residents no longer had to wait three years to be eligible for a pension. That same year, the value of a pensioner's home was excluded from consideration <b>when</b> <b>assessing</b> the value of their property.|$|E
5|$|R. v. Kent Police Authority, {{ex parte}} Godden (1972) is an {{instance}} of a United Kingdom case in which an order of prohibition was issued to avert action {{that would not have}} complied with administrative law rules. In July 1970, Godden, a police chief inspector of Kent Police Authority, was examined by the police authority's chief medical officer, who took the view that he was suffering from a mental disorder and thus unfit for duty. Godden was therefore placed on sick leave, although his own specialist found {{that he did not have}} any psychiatric illness. Subsequently, in January 1971, the police authority informed him that it would be appointing the chief medical officer to assess if he was permanently disabled, for the purpose of determining if he should be compulsorily retired. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales found that since the medical officer had previously formed the opinion that Godden was mentally disordered, he could not be impartial <b>when</b> <b>assessing</b> if Godden was permanently disabled. Thus, an order of prohibition should be issued to prohibit him from carrying out this assessment.|$|E

25|$|However, consequentialism {{and virtue}} ethics {{need not be}} entirely antagonistic. Philosopher Iain King has {{developed}} an approach which reconciles the two schools. Other consequentialists consider effects {{on the character of}} people involved in an action <b>when</b> <b>assessing</b> consequence. Similarly, a consequentialist theory may aim at the maximization of a particular virtue or set of virtues. Finally, following Foot's lead, one might adopt a sort of consequentialism that argues that virtuous activity ultimately produces the best consequences.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>assessing</b> rated {{amplifier}} power output, it {{is useful}} to consider the applied load, the signal type (e.g., speech or music), required power output duration (i.e., short-time or continuous), and required dynamic range (e.g., recorded or live audio). In high-powered audio applications that require long cables to the load (e.g., cinemas and shopping centres) it may be more efficient to connect to the load at line output voltage, with matching transformers at source and loads. This avoids long runs of heavy speaker cables.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of formulations containing tea tree oil (TTO) has been assessed in vitro in previous studies. Products that passed the European suspension test guidelines were investigated further in this study, in vivo with volunteers using the European handwashing method (EN 1499) and ex vivo using freshly excised human skin samples. The activity of 5 % TTO in 0. 001 % Tween 80, in a hygienic skin wash (HSW) {{and in an}} alcoholic hygienic skin wash (AHSW) was investigated and {{compared with that of}} a non-medicated soft soap (SS, control). These formulations were assessed against Escherichia coli K 12 as recommended by the European standard. In-vivo results showed that 5 % TTO in Tween 80 and the AHSW were significantly more active than the SS after 1 min of handwashing. <b>When</b> <b>assessed</b> ex vivo, these two products were also significantly more active than the reference soap after 1 min of rubbing. Both methods showed that 5 % TTO in Tween 80 was generally, although not always, more active than a handwash formulation, and that the AHSW was generally more active than the HSW, although this difference was not significant. The formulations tested, as well as the SS, were more active <b>when</b> <b>assessed</b> in vivo than ex-vivo against E. coli, although only the SS and the HSW were significantly more active in vivo.

Nevertheless, the main outcome of the European handwashing method is for the formulation tested to be significantly more active than the SS; both 5 % TTO in Tween 80 and the AHSW achieved this both in-vivo and ex-vivo. TTO in Tween 80 and in formulations met the European in-vivo method requirement...|$|R
