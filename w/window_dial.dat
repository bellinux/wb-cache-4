50|$|Although Kelly won the New York Film Critics Circle Award {{for best}} actress for her {{performances}} in her three big movie roles of 1954, Rear <b>Window,</b> <b>Dial</b> M For Murder, and The Country Girl, she and Garland both received Golden Globe Awards for their respective performances.By the following March, the race between Kelly and Garland for the Oscar was very close. On March 30, 1955, {{the night of the}} Academy Awards telecast, Garland was unable to attend because she was in the hospital having just given birth to her son, Joey Luft. However, she was rumored to be the odds-on favorite, and NBC Television cameras were set up in her hospital room so that if she were announced as the winner, she could make her acceptance speech live from her hospital bed. However, when William Holden announced Kelly as the winner, the technicians immediately dismantled the cameras without saying one word to Garland.|$|E
5000|$|Moments later, {{from his}} high vantage point, Dial spots Jahar {{standing}} {{inside the building}} {{with his back to}} the <b>window.</b> <b>Dial</b> grasps the opportunity and shoots through the glass, fatally hitting Jahar in back of his head. Because of the delay caused by a pair of cops, Winchell is late in bringing the getaway car, and this brings attention to them fleeing the scene. After numerous attempts to stop the car, the police open fire, killing Winchell. The car, now out of control, comes to crashing stop, injuring Dial. But Dial manages to get out of the crashed car. On the run and bleeding profusely, he makes his way to the safe house, where he meets curious 12-year-old neighbor Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who lives with her grandmother (Gemma Jones). Emily helps Dial stop the bleeding. Even though Jahar has been eliminated, the assignment is still considered to be failure by Collins because Dial had been filmed fleeing the scene by a security camera.|$|E

50|$|The Church of England parish {{church was}} built in the mid 12th century. The Norman {{building}} was altered throughout the following millennium. The 12th century building now comprises the current nave, with additions seen in the Forster Chapel and chancel (13th century), the steeple (14th century), and vestry (17th century). The 17th century Jacobean pulpit is an unusual heptagonal design. Various additions were made to the structure in the 14th and 15th centuries, primarily to the walls and ogee <b>windows.</b> A scratch <b>dial</b> was added to the south-west buttress in the 14th century.|$|R
50|$|The dial was a concentric-ring {{astronomical clock}} {{similar to the}} Padua clock of 1434, rather than the {{astrolabe}} type with offset zodiac dial, as found at Prague. The 24 {{hours of the day}} were marked, in Roman numerals, around the edge, with I at the right-hand side, and marked Italian hours. The relative positions of five planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury) were shown, as were the moon's phases and the position of the Sun in the zodiac. The four circular <b>windows</b> around the <b>dial</b> may have contained astrolabe-type devices or orreries.|$|R

40|$|The Part Task Trainer program (PTT) is a {{kinematic}} {{simulation of}} the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) for the orbiter. The {{purpose of the}} PTT is to supply a low cost man-in-the-loop simulator, allowing the student to learn operational procedures which then {{can be used in}} the more expensive full scale simulators. PTT will allow the crew members to work on their arm operation skills without the need for other people running the simulation. The controlling algorithms for the arm were coded out of the Functional Subsystem Requirements Document to ensure realistic operation of the simulation. Relying on the hardware of the workstation to provide fast refresh rates for full shaded images allows the simulation to be run on small low cost stand alone work stations, removing the need to be tied into a multi-million dollar computer for the simulation. PTT will allow the student to make errors which in full scale mock up simulators might cause failures or damage hardware. On the screen the user is shown a graphical representation of the RMS control panel in the aft cockpit of the orbiter, along with a main view window and up to six trunion and guide <b>windows.</b> The <b>dials</b> drawn on the panel may be turned to select the desired mode of operation. The inputs controlling the arm are read from a chair with a Translational Hand Controller (THC) and a Rotational Hand Controller (RHC) attached to it...|$|R
