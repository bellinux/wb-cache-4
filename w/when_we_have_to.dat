Bhutto later said that the day will never arise <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use our knowledge to make and detonate a [...] device and export our technology.|$|E
2500|$|When an {{organization}} offered to sponsor a women's rights convention {{on the condition}} that [...] "no speaker should say anything which would seem like an attack on Christianity", Anthony wrote to a friend, [...] "I wonder if they'll be as particular to warn all other speakers not to say anything which shall sound like an attack on liberal religion. They never seem to think we have any feelings to be hurt <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> sit under their reiteration of orthodox cant and dogma." ...|$|E

[...] Graham had earlier said that [...] "there come times <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight for peace." [...] He went on to say that out of the war in the Gulf may [...] "come a new peace and, as suggested by the President, a new world order." ...|$|E

Thieves, mum,--that is, the regulars,--don't mind us a bit, {{and the women}} is more hardeneder than the men; but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> speak to a lady, it is so often that she goes off like that! I've known 'em do it just at being looked at." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2013, President Tong {{has spoken}} of climate-change induced sea level rise as [...] "inevitable". [...] "For {{our people to}} survive, then {{they will have to}} migrate.

[...] In New York in 2014, per The New Yorker, President Tong told The New York Times that [...] "according to the projections, within this century, the water will be higher than the highest point in our lands". In 2014, President Tong {{finalized}} the purchase of a 20km2 stretch of land on Vanua Levu, one of the larger Fiji islands, 2,000km away. A move described by Tong as an [...] "absolute necessity" [...] should the nation be completely submerged under water.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, indeed; I {{should think}} she would be proud to help with one of your pictures, sir. My sister thinks they are very lovely; and we kept one of them <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sell all the rest," [...] said Jessie, in her eager, frank way.|$|R

These works are no longer done by humans instead performed by machines through automation, which is one of the popular trends in the world of technology. Automation used for home appliances is referred as HOME AUTOMATION. This paper describes a system for efficient home automation without programming by using a 555 timer. It turns on electrical lights and fan whenever a person enters a room using PIR sensor and adjusts the speed of the fan according to room temperature...|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{certainly}} work tolerably hard out there, {{but it is}} {{no great}} credit to us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> choose between that and starvation; and the West is the land of disappointment as well as promise," [...] I answered dryly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now when you're {{willing to}} walk I'll take that out," [...] he said. [...] "Once in every few minutes, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stop to rest I'll {{look at your}} eyes. If you wink, it means you're ready to do as I say." ...|$|E

60|$|Still {{he walked}} on unharmed, past the ashes and the ruins. Not as a conqueror was he come, {{to march in}} triumph. Not to destroy, but to heal.

6000|$|... "That's enough, Sam; don't {{give me any}} of it now. Time {{enough for}} that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get at it. There goes the supper bell. Now, downstairs with you! and let us get through as soon as {{possible}} and be on our way." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And by {{so doing}} have gained just so much experience.

60|$|We were {{a little}} like undertakers, in the Commons, as {{regarded}} Probate transactions; generally making it a rule to look more or less cut up, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> deal with clients in mourning. In a similar feeling of delicacy, we were always blithe and light-hearted with the licence clients. Therefore I hinted to Peggotty that she would find Mr. Spenlow much recovered from the shock of Mr. Barkis's decease; and indeed he came in like a bridegroom.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘The hour {{approaches}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> part,’ said I; ‘and I {{shall be}} obliged {{if you will}} tell your servant to drop me at the nearest point for Dunstable.
