500|$|As {{early as}} 2004, agents working for Afghan {{intelligence}} determined that Bin Laden {{was living in}} a major settled area in Pakistan proper, rather than the semi-autonomous tribal areas on the Afghan-Pakistan border, Amrullah Saleh told The Guardian. Leading Saleh and Afghan intelligence to that conclusion were [...] "thousands of interrogation reports" [...] and the assumption that Bin Laden [...] "a millionaire with multiple wives and no background of toughness would not be living in a tent". [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> he was in the settled areas of Pakistan because in 2005 it was still very easy to infiltrate the tribal areas, and we had massive numbers of informants there. They could find any Arab but not Bin Laden." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{producers}} {{launched a}} nationwide talent hunt to discover new faces for the film, initially refusing to employ established actors. However, the actors {{who came to}} audition were not promising enough for the roles, and the idea was scrapped. Mahesh Bhatt said, [...] "It was a disastrous talent hunt. We discovered that people lacked the courage to audition. Those who are amateurs went for audition ...and people with certain talent were like why should we risk public rejection." [...] When Suri saw some pictures of Aditya Roy Kapur and met him, he found Kapur perfect for the role and cast him to play the male lead. In June 2012, Shraddha Kapoor was signed to play the female lead. Bhatt said, [...] "Yes, Shraddha Kapoor is playing the lead with the two boys Aditya Roy Kapur and Shaad Randhawa. We found her to be very talented. All three actors have extremely challenging dramatic roles." [...] When asked about replacing new actors with known ones, Suri said [...] "People said I couldn't make a film with new actors and expect an audience to come in. But I <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> I wanted Aditya and Shraddha to play my protagonists. My writer Shagufta Rafique and I saw them as the protagonists. See, Aditya and Shraddha may have had unsuccessful films before. But that never took away from their talent." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 1, Bayern {{started at}} odds of 6.1/1 for the 31st {{running of the}} Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita Park. His opponents {{included}} the undefeated gelding Shared Belief, California Chrome, and Tonalist in a field which appeared dominated by three-year-olds. Exiting the gate, Bayern veered sharply to the left, badly hampering Shared Belief and Moreno before taking the early lead. He was tracked throughout the race by the British-trained Toast of New York with California Chrome close behind and maintained his advantage into the straight. In a closely contested three-way finish, Bayern prevailed by a nose from Toast of New York and a neck from third-place California Chrome. Next to finish were Shared Belief, Tonalist, and Candy Boy, meaning that the first six places were filled by three-year-olds. The racecourse stewards conducted an inquiry into the interference caused by Bayern at the start but allowed the result to stand. After the race, Garcia said, [...] "It's an amazing feeling, a dream come true... We let him run, and if anything happens, you make adjustments. In this race, he broke really good and I took advantage. I <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that I didn't do anything. In racing, these things happen." ...|$|E

6000|$|In {{a moment}} the girl had withdrawn, {{and the old man}} stood within the door. 'What! You're hammer and tongs, already, you two?' he said, coolly {{stroking}} his face. 'I thought you would be. I <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> of it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ha!' he said, 'I thought so. That {{was before}} I knew you, but I <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> I couldn't be mistaken. He is light and active, I suppose. But those were slight {{advantages}} compared with yours. Luck, luck! These hang-dog outcasts have it.' ...|$|E

60|$|In {{his heart}} Samuel Block {{believed}} that if this course were adopted he <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> who would be put on shore, if a vote were taken by officers and crew; {{but he was too}} wise to say anything upon this point, and contented himself with positively refusing to send southward any news of the evil omen.|$|E

[...] "I had to say {{something}} to him in the lobby there when we met--something I <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> he couldn't like.

If I could find that treasure! ...|$|E
60|$|Legree, {{like some}} potentates we read of in history, governed his {{plantation}} by {{a sort of}} resolution of forces.

6000|$|Thinkers.—Rather {{an absurd}} word—to call a man a thinker (and he {{repeated}} the word with gay mockery in his tone). When did it come into use? Not until quite our own times, eh?
