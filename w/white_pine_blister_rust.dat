5|$|<b>White</b> <b>pine</b> <b>blister</b> <b>rust,</b> a {{fungal disease}} that infects conifer trees, was accidentally {{introduced}} in British Columbia in 1910 and had reached California by the 1920s. It has since infected many sugar pine {{trees in the}} Yosemite area. The rust is managed by removing plants belonging to the ribes genus, which act as carriers of the fungus.|$|E
5|$|<b>White</b> <b>pine</b> <b>blister</b> <b>rust</b> (Cronartium ribicola) needs two {{alternate}} hosts {{to complete}} its lifecycle. One host is {{plants in the}} genus Ribes. On the blackcurrant, it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves. The fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year. The other host is any of the white pines, in which it causes serious disease and mortality for the North American species that have not co-evolved with the rust.|$|E
5|$|As a crop, the {{blackcurrant}} {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, {{caused by a}} virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite. Another is <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>blister</b> <b>rust</b> which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (blackcurrant included) {{and the other a}} white pine. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease. As a result, the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable, since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America.|$|E

5|$|Blackcurrants {{were once}} {{popular in the}} United States as well, but became less common in the 20th century after currant farming was banned in the early 1900s, when blackcurrants, as a vector of <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>blister</b> <b>rust,</b> were {{considered}} {{a threat to the}} U.S. logging industry. The federal ban on growing currants was shifted to jurisdiction of individual states in 1966, and was lifted in New York State in 2003 through the efforts of horticulturist Greg Quinn. As a result, currant growing is making a comeback in New York, Vermont, Connecticut and Oregon. However, several statewide bans still exist including Maine, New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, and Massachusetts. Since the American federal ban curtailed currant production nationally for nearly a century, the fruit remains largely unknown in the United States, and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels enjoyed in Europe or New Zealand. Owing to its unique flavour and richness in polyphenols, dietary fibre and essential nutrients, awareness and popularity of blackcurrant is once again growing, with a number of consumer products entering the U.S. market.|$|E
25|$|The {{species was}} {{imported}} in 1620 to England by Captain George Weymouth, who planted {{it for a}} timber crop, but had little success because of <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>blister</b> <b>rust</b> disease.|$|E
25|$|Mortality from <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>blister</b> <b>rust</b> in mature pine groves {{was often}} 50–80% {{during the early}} 20th century. The fungus must spend part of its life cycle on {{alternate}} hosts of the Ribes genus, the native gooseberry or wild currant. Foresters proposed that if all the alternate host plants were removed that <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>blister</b> <b>rust</b> might be eliminated. A very determined campaign was mounted and all land owners in commercial pine growing regions were encouraged to uproot and kill all native gooseberry and wild currant plants. The ramifications for wildlife and habitat ecology were of less concern at the time than timber industry protection.|$|E
50|$|The {{whitebark pine}} is a {{keystone}} species in upper subalpine {{forests of the}} northern Rocky Mountains. However, the whitebark pine has been in decline due to <b>White</b> <b>Pine</b> <b>Blister</b> Rust: whitebark <b>pine</b> mortality in some areas exceeds 90%.

50|$|On exposed, dry slopes at high elevations, subalpine <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> forests replace spruce-fir forests. Common {{species of}} the <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> forests include whitebark pine in the {{northern}} Rocky Mountains, limber pine in the central and north-central Rocky Mountains, and bristlecone pine in the southern Rocky Mountains. Typical intervals between fires range from 50 to 300 years. The <b>white</b> <b>pines</b> are tolerant of extreme environmental conditions and can be important postfire successional species. The whitebark pine is a keystone species in upper subalpine forests of the northern Rocky Mountains.

5|$|Over 1,700 {{species of}} trees and other {{vascular}} plants are native to the park. Another 170 species {{are considered to be}} exotic species and are non-native. Of the eight conifer tree species documented, Lodgepole Pine forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. Other conifers, such as Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Whitebark Pine, are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a fungus known as <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>blister</b> rust; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana. Quaking Aspen and willows are the most common species of deciduous trees. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk.|$|R
25|$|Today native wild {{currants}} {{are relatively}} rare plants in New England, and planting wild currants or wild gooseberries is strongly discouraged, or even illegal in some jurisdictions. As an alternative, new strains of commercial currants {{have been developed}} which are highly resistant to <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>blister</b> <b>rust.</b> Mortality in white pines from rust is only about 3% today.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the eastern}} white pine tree is {{somewhat}} resistant to fire, mature survivors are able to re-seed burned areas. In pure stands mature trees usually have no branches on {{the lower half of}} the trunk. The white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi) and <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>blister</b> <b>rust</b> (Cronartium ribicola), an introduced fungus, can damage or kill these trees.|$|E
25|$|Among {{native plants}} of the GYE, whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) is {{a species of}} special interest, {{in large part because}} of its {{seasonal}} importance to grizzly bears, but also because its distribution could be dramatically reduced by relatively minor global warming. In this case, researchers do not have a good long-term data set on the species, but they understand its ecology well enough to project declining future conservation status. A more immediate and serious threat to whitebark pines is an introduced fungal rust disease, <b>White</b> <b>Pine</b> <b>Blister</b> <b>Rust</b> (Cronartium ribicola), which is causing heavy mortality in the species. Occasional resistant individuals occur, but in the short to medium term, a severe population decline is expected.|$|E

The Yellowstone Sand Verbena is a rare flowering plant found only in Yellowstone. It is closely related to species usually found in much warmer climates, making the sand verbena an enigma. The estimated 8,000 examples of this rare flowering plant all make their home in the sandy soils on the shores of Yellowstone Lake, well above the waterline.|$|R
5000|$|Resistance to the <b>blister</b> <b>rust</b> is genetic, {{and due to}} Western <b>white</b> <b>pine's</b> genetic {{variability}} {{some individuals}} are relatively unaffected by the rust. The Forest Service has a program for locating and breeding rust-resistant Western <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> and sugar pine. Seedlings of these trees have been introduced into the wild.|$|R
500|$|In North America, {{there is}} a need for this fruit to have {{resistance}} to <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>blister</b> <b>rust.</b> New cultivars such as 'Crusader', 'Coronet' and 'Consort' have been developed there by crossing R. nigrum with R. ussuriense and these show resistance to the disease. However the quality and yield of these varieties are poor as compared to non-resistant strains and only Consort is reliably self-fertile. Back-crossing these varieties to a parent have produced new strains such as 'Titania' that have a higher yield, better disease resistance, are more tolerant of adverse weather conditions and are suitable for machine harvesting. [...] Two new releases from a black currant breeding program in British Columbia, Canada, 'Blackcomb' and 'Tahsis', were selected for their immunity to <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>blister</b> <b>rust</b> and their frost tolerance.|$|E
500|$|While {{the flora}} of Grand Teton National Park is {{generally}} healthy, the whitebark pine, {{and to a}} lesser degree the lodgepole pine, are considered at risk. In the case of the whitebark pine, an invasive species of fungus known as <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>blister</b> <b>rust</b> weakens the tree, making it more susceptible to destruction from endemic mountain pine beetles. Whitebark pines generally thrive at elevations above [...] and produce large seeds that are high in fat content and an important food source for various species such as the [...] grizzly bear, red squirrel and Clark's nutcracker. The species {{is considered to be a}} keystone and a foundation species; keystone in that its [...] "ecological role (is) disproportionately large relative to its abundance" [...] and foundation in that it has a paramount role that [...] "defines ecosystem structure, function, and process". Whitebark pine has generally had a lower incidence of blister rust infection throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem than in other regions such as Glacier National Park and the Cascade Range. The incidence of blister rust on whitebark pines in Yellowstone National Park is slightly lower than in Grand Teton. Though blister rust is not in itself the cause of increased mortality, its weakening effect on trees allows native pine beetles to more easily infest the trees, increasing mortality. While general practice in National Parks is to allow nature to take its course, the alarming trend of increased disease and mortality of the vital whitebark pine trees has sparked a collaborative effort amongst various government entities to intervene to protect the species.|$|E

Data were also recorded on {{portions of the}} crown killed by <b>blister</b> <b>rust</b> caused by Cronartium ribieola Fisch. Statistical tests revealed a significant association between the bark beetles Dendroetonus ponderosae Hopkins and Pityogenes fossifrons (LeConte), and the root pathogen Armillariella mellea. (Vah!. ex Fr.) Karst and between beetles and all root diseases. Ninety-two percent of the trees attacked by bark beetles had root diseases, and 97 % had either root diseases or <b>blister</b> <b>rust.</b> A discriminant analysis correctly classified 88 % of the sample trees into two categories, trees infested with D. ponderosae or trees not infested with D. ponderosae, using the variables age (stump), diameter at 1. 3 m in height, and percentage of the primary roots infected with pathogens. Major pathogenic organisms isolated from the roots included A. mellea, Phaeolus sehweinitzii (Fr.) Pat., Resinicium bieolor (Fr.) Parm., Vertieicladiella spp., and a Europhium strain.

40|$|Summary Interspecific hybrids between eastern <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus strobus L.) and Himalayan blue pine (P. wallichiana A. B. Jacks.) were {{developed}} in Ontario, Canada, to introduce <b>blister</b> <b>rust</b> (Cronartium ribicola Fisch.) resistance genes to P. strobus. There is concern that introducing <b>blister</b> <b>rust</b> resis-tance has resulted in reduced cold hardiness of the progeny compared with non-hybridized eastern <b>white</b> <b>pine.</b> To test the efficacy of backcrossing with P. strobus to improve cold hardi-ness, 1 -year-old seedlings from hybrid crosses differing in P. strobus genome composition were artificially freeze-tested. In Experiment 1, unhardened seedlings were allowed to accli-mate to progressively lower temperatures in a growth room, whereas in Experiment 2, seedlings were hardened outdoors under natural weather conditions in Sault Ste Marie, Ontario. Needle cold injury was determined by calculating relative elec-trical conductivity based on post-freezing electrolyte leakage. Results indicated that needle fascicles from unhardened seed-lings of all genotypes in the greenhouse tolerated – 5 °C for 3 hours {{with little or no}} injury. Cold hardiness increased in par-allel with declining growth room minimum temperature over the 7 -week period of hardening. Cold hardiness was improved for hybrid crosses with increased Pinus strobus genome composition in Experiment 2, but the results were less conclu...|$|R
