Despite this, Shannon calls Brendon {{the next day and}} invites him, Jason, and their friend Melissa to his {{birthday}} party, which Brendon resentfully accepts. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> arrive at Shannon's party, they see that no one has arrived. Shannon laments about how his bullying ways have caused no one he knows to actually like him, and the kids sympathize with the bully. However, Shannon then reveals that there are several kids at the party, who come out from hiding spots and ridicule Brendon, Jason, and Melissa for being swindled. As their retaliation, the children steal Shannon's lawn gnome and depart from the party.|$|E

Williams says that it was assumed by everyone that [...] "the music would come back also and be part of the cast ... it would require new music, certainly, but the signature music of Jaws should be used as well". He compares this to [...] "the great tradition" [...] for repeating musical themes in Hollywood serials such as Roy Rogers and The Lone Ranger. In addition to the familiar themes, Szwarc says Williams also composed a [...] "youthful counterpoint to the shark that is always around <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> are sailing or going out to sea.

The name of the baseball announcer, Denis Conroy, was used because that is the name of writer Larry Doyle's uncle. Dan Castellaneta ad libbed Homer singing [...] "Hitler is a jerk, Mussolini...."

[...] He also praised the episode's guest voice actors, citing in particular Bill Hader's character Mickey as [...] "very odd, but so much fun"; Bonaime gave [...] "Bob Fires the Kids" [...] an overall grade of 8.3 out of 10. Jen Johnson, writing for Den of Geek, also cited Mickey as a highlight of the episode, stating: [...] "I would say that I hope {{this is the end}} of Mickey and the chaos he brings to the Belcher family, but [...] was just too much fun.

500|$|Stone said he {{felt the}} episode {{solidified}} major characteristics embodied by the Chef character, particularly {{the fact that he}} is one of the only adults in South Park who always understands the truth of any given situation and believes the children almost all of the time. Stone said, [...] "It's like the parents are all nuts that live in the town. The boys are kind of the most sane and Chef is really the only one in town who believes the kids when they say (something) is happening, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> are actually right and it's the town that's crazy." [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was also the first episode in which Liane Cartman, Eric Cartman's mother, was portrayed as a promiscuous woman who was previously a crack whore and is willing to engage in pornographic sex for money; during the episode, she is mentioned and actually featured on the cover of [...] "Crack Whore Magazine", much to Cartman's shock and dismay.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{all of the}} controversy, Mann {{was never}} charged with the taking or selling of child pornography, even though, {{according}} to Edward de Grazia, law professor and civil liberties expert, “any federal prosecutor {{anywhere in the country}} could bring a case against [...] in Virginia, and not only seize her photos, her equipment, her Rolodexes, but also seize her children for psychiatric and physical examination.” Mann always put her children's well-being first. Before she published Immediate Family, she consulted a Virginian Federal prosecutor who told her that some of the images she was exhibiting could have her arrested. She decided to postpone the publication of the book in 1991. In an interview with New York Times reporter, Richard Woodward, she said “I thought the book could wait 10 years, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> won’t be living in the same bodies. They’ll have matured and they’ll understand the implications of the pictures. I unilaterally decided.” The children apparently did not like this decision and Mann and her husband arranged for Emmett and Jessie to talk to a psychologist to be sure their feelings were honest and so that they understood what the publication would do. Each child was then allowed to vote on which photographs were to be put in the book. To further protect the children from “teasing,” Mann told Woodward that she wanted to keep copies of Immediate Family out of their home town of Lexington. She asked bookstores in the area not to sell it and for libraries to keep it in their rare-book rooms. Dr. Aaron Esman, a child psychiatrist at the Payne Whitney Clinic believes that Mann is serious about her work and that she has “no intention to jeopardize her children or use them for pornographic images.” He says that the nude photographs don’t appear to be erotically stimulating to anyone but a “case-hardened pedophile or a rather dogmatic religious fundamentalist.” Mann states, [...] "I didn't expect the controversy over the pictures of my children. I was just a mother photographing her children as they were growing up. I was exploring different subjects with them." ...|$|E

I decided that the receiver was a whole lot worse than the thief, and that it shouldn't happen again. And it didn't. I turned out next day and threw my feet as well as the next one.|$|E
