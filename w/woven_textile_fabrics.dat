40|$|Author's {{final draft}} after peer reviewBallistic impact onto {{flexible}} <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{is a complicated}} multi-scale problem given the structural hierarchy of the materials, anisotropic material behavior, projectile geometry-fabric interactions, impact velocity and boundary conditions. Although this subject has been an active area of research for decades, the fundamental mechanisms such as material failure, dynamic response, multi-axial loading occurring at the lower length scales during impact are not well understood. This paper reviews the recent advances in modeling and experiments of Kevlar ballistic fibrils, fibers, yarns and flexible <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> pertinent to the deformation modes occurring during impact and serves to identify topics worthy of further investigation that will advance the basic understanding of the phenomena governing transverse impact. This review also explores on aspects such as homogeneous versus heterogeneous behavior of yarns consisting of individual fibers and the inelastic transverse behavior of the fiber which is not considered in the previous review papers on this topic.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{determination}} of the geometric structural parameters of a glass textile reinforcement, which is embedded into an epoxy polymer matrix, by micro-computed tomography (CT). Therefore, four different glass fabrics were investigated. The CT images of the composites feature a good contrast between glass reinforcement and polymer matrix. The resolution is high enough for the determination of the geometric structural parameters: wavelength of warp and fill yarn, amplitude of warp and fill yarn, width of warp and fill yarn, height of warp and fill yarn and the gap between two adjacent warp and fill yarns. The micro-computed tomography shows a high potential for an efficient measurement of the three dimensional geometric structural properties of laminated <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics...</b>|$|E
40|$|The interrelationships among spatial {{distribution}} in the red, green, and blue channels of texture images of differently <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> are investigated. A computational model for color mapping is developed based on the channel proportionality found in the investigation. The computational model developed has two modes: gray-to-color mapping (GCM) and color-to-color mapping (CCM) that deal with different images. For the GCM mode, the {{spatial distribution}} of luminance is known. The algorithm needs to deduce data in three channels for a color image from 1 -D spatial distribution of luminance. Whereas in the CCM mode, the information {{for each of the}} three channels is known. Numerical and psychophysical experiments are carried out to evaluate the accuracy of the color mapping algorithm quantitatively. Satisfactory color accuracy of the mapped images was obtained according to the results of both numerical calculation and visual experiment.

40|$|In Part II of this work, {{quasi-static}} {{tensile properties}} of four aeronautical grade carbon-epoxy composite laminates, {{in both the}} as-received and pre-fatigued states, have been determined and compared. Quasi-static mechanical properties assessed were tensile strength and stiffness, tenacity (toughness) at the maximum load and for a 50 % load drop-off. In general, as-molded unidirectional cross-ply carbon fiber (tape) reinforcements impregnated with either standard or rubber-toughened epoxy resin exhibited the maximum performance. The materials also displayed a significant tenacification (toughening) after exposed to cyclic loading, resulting from the increased stress (the so-called wear-in phenomenon) and/or strain at the maximum load capacity of the specimens.

40|$|<b>Woven</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> were {{designed}} and constructed from hydrophilic and hydrophobic spun yarns to give planar substrates containing amphiphilic microchannels with defined orientations and locations. Polypropylene fibers were spun to give hydrophobic yarns, and the hydrophilic yarns were spun from a poly(ethylene terephthalate) copolyester. Water wicking rates into the fabrics were measured by video microscopy and longitudinal wicking tests from single drops and from reservoirs. Intra-yarn microchannels in the hydrophilic polyester yarns {{were shown to}} selectively transport aqueous fluids, with the flow path governed by {{the placement of the}} hydrophilic yarns in the fabric. Simultaneous wicking of an aqueous and hydrocarbon fluid into the hydrophilic and hydrophobic microchannels of an amphiphilic fabric was successfully demonstrated. The high degree of interfacial contact and micron-scale diffusion lengths of such co-flowing immiscible fluid streams inside amphiphilic fabrics suggest potential applications as highly scalable and affordable microcontactors for industrial liquid-liquid extractions. The efficiency of liquid-liquid extractions carried out with the amphiphilic fabrics was evaluated. Solvent extraction efficiencies were shown to reach up to ~ 98 %.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 310 - 327). Within {{the last}} decade, {{a new class}} of civil engineering materials referred to as High Performance Fibre Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCC) has been developed. As a subset in this new field, additions of polypropylene (PP) fibres, in the form of <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics,</b> have proved most successful as reinforcement to cementitious matrices, leading {{to the development of a}} novel composite material: so called "Textile Concrete" (TC). Although the strength and modulus of PP are not very high, careful design through the appropriate placement and high fibre volume fraction of a textile format, has led to sufficient strength and stiffness, while at the same time high toughness has been achieved. In particular the development of a fibrillated core fibre to which is attached an outer layer of ultrasonically welded, or bonded "fluffy" PP fibres, has been most successful, and is a unique feature. These outer fluffy layers provide excellent physical bonding characteristics to the cement matrix, thus overcoming the intrinsic hydrophobic nature and otherwise weak matrix bonding of PP fibres. In South Africa where TC has found ready application, the composite is produced from a fine grained cementitious matrix and a PP textile commercially known as CemForce...|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the history of}} industrial fabrics and investigates how certain of these fabrics have developed to meet the changing demands of their end-uses. It also examines how <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> are increasingly competing with the traditional engineering materials as new fibres and filaments allow an ever increasing range of properties; improved fabric engineering techniques are also ensuring that industrial fabrics are more suited to their end-uses. To aid fabric engineering a greater knowledge is required of fabric structure and mechanics, so developments in this field are examined. To help improve fabric research of this type, realistic physical testing methods are required both to test the usefulness of mathematical models, and to simulate conditions experienced in use. Due to certain restrictions {{of this type of}} testing, a suitable selective fabric extension measuring device is required so that problem areas such as clamping effects can be avoided. The. lack ofa suitable device to help overcome problems such as this has been a long standing difficulty, so {{the development of a new}} fabric extension gauge was one of the main objects of this work. Before such a device could be developed research first involved a survey of many of the previous extension measuring devices, however, as expected nothing suitable emerged. After considering many ideas for possible new devices, it was decided to try and develop a gauge using the relatively new material PVDF piezo polymer film. This is a thin, low modulus film which develops an electrical charge proportional to a CHANGE in mechanical stress, and which can be easily cut to any desired dimensions. Initial attempts to develop a suitable extension measuring device were not completely successful, but when suitable following circuitry was found, and a proper mounting procedure determined, the new gauge appeared very promising. When it was considered that a suitable extension measuring device was available, the next task involved the design of a biaxial tensile and shear testing machine for the new Clothworkers' Textile Hechanics and Structures Laboratory. It was considered that the availability of a suitable selective extension measuring device was of paramount importance before the design of the new tester could be considered. This apparatus was based essentially on, the proven principles of Yendell's and Bassett's testers, but a number of unique features were to be added, such as independently controlled clamps, and the ability to cycle in shear. The principles involved in the design of the mechanical hardware are described, as also are certain original recommendations which have been suggested for the second stage of the project in which the sophisticated control, measurement and analysis techniques will be developed...|$|E

Attention is paid to the determination of effective elastic properties of the yarn via homogenization based on the Mori-Tanaka averaging scheme and the 1 st order numerical homogenization method adopting a suitable representative computational model. The latter approach is then employed to simulate the response of the yarn when loaded beyond the elastic limits. The required mechanical properties of individual material phases are directly measured using nanoindentation with in-build scanning probe microscopy.

40|$|Automatic {{inspection}} of <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fabric</b> is discussed. Two significant problems are addressed: (a) texture feature extraction; Fourier transform features {{are found to}} be well matched to the spatially periodic nature of the woven pattern; moreover, they are shift invariant; (b) detector design; maximum likelihood type detectors are inappropriate since we cannot hope to enumerate all defect classes, hence a Neyman-Pearson approach is adopted, i. e. flaw detection is via measured deviation from nominal. The performance of the system is evaluated on samples of denim fabric containing real defects. 1 Introduction As with most manufacturing industry [14] the textile industry can benefit from automated visual inspection (AVI).

The technique also has potential for self-calibration, and hence a capability for adaptive operation.

The consumption of compressed air in air-jet weaving depends on different process variables. In this study, the effect of weft yarn count, reed count, fabric width and loom speed on the compressed air consumption of air-jet loom was determined using response surface methodology. Fabric width was found to be the most dominant factor affecting the air consumption followed by loom speed, reed count, and weft yarn count respectively. A statistical model for predicting the compressed air consumption on air-jet loom was developed. The prediction ability and accuracy of the developed model was assessed by the fitted line plot between the predicted and actual air consumption values. The prediction model may be used for optimizing the production planning, estimating the share of compressed air cost in weaving a particular fabric style, and in identifying any air wastages in the weaving shed by comparing the actual compressed air consumption with that predicted by the model which was developed under controlled conditions without any air leakages...|$|R

The colour difference values for the pairs with texture patterns are equal to 5. 0 CIELAB units in lightness direction. The texture level was represented by the half-width of histogram, which is called texture strength in this study. High correlation was found between texture strength and visual colour difference for textured colour pairs, which indicates that an increasing of 10 units of texture strength in luminance would cause a decreasing of 0. 25 units visual difference for the five colour centers.

Finite element modeling of unit cell at mesoscopic level has been recommended over employing costly experimental setup for such sophisticated materials. The unit cell is identified based upon its ability to enclose the characteristic periodic repeat pattern in the fabric weave. Modeling of unit cell and its analysis for this new model are developed using an open source software, TexGen and a commercially available finite element software ABAQUS®. The scope of altering weave pattern and yarn characteristics is facilitated in this developed model. Several parametric {{studies were carried out}} in order to ascertain the effectiveness of the model and to investigate the effects of various geometric parameters such as yarn spacing, yarn width, fabric thickness and fibre volume fraction on the mechanical behavior of woven composites. Present analysis reveals that the values of Young's and shear modulus increased with increasing in the fabric parameters such as yarn width and fabric thickness. On the other hand it is decreased when the spacing between the yarns increased. A good comparision was obtained between the predicted results and available experimental and theoretical data in open literature for the developed unit-cell model and its suitability is tested for multi-scale analysis. The potential advantage of the present scheme lies in its ability which permits the textile modeling from building of <b>textile</b> <b>fabric</b> model to its solution including mesh generation undertaken using an integrated scripting approach thus requiring far less human time than traditional finite element models...|$|R

Depending on the weaving pattern, composite reinforcements can be characterized into two groups: uniform fabric and near-net shape fabric. Uniform fabric can be treated as an assembly of its smallest repeating pattern also called a unit cell; {{the latter is a}} single component with complex structure. Due to advantages of cost savings and inherent toughness, near-net shape fabric has gained great success in composite industries, for application such as turbine blades.
