In 1857 Planché was invited to arrange the collection of armour formerly belonging to his friend Sir Samuel Meyrick for the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, a task which he repeated in South Kensington in 1868. Concerned {{by the state of}} the armour in the Tower of London, Planché wrote several reports on the subject between 1855 and 1869.

He diagrammed every camera angle and move to make the scenes visually appealing and hold the viewers' attention. First assistant director Bruce Carter examined the script and created a complex timeline to make shooting easier.

Carlos Ross of THEM Anime Review said that Spike's portrayal <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that worked in the film, and DVD Talk's Neil Lumbard, alongside general praise of the characters, positively noted the further exploration of his personality.

While George is considered [...] "moronic" [...] and [...] "idiotic", he is helpful, loyal, and is aware he is not very intelligent, describing himself as [...] "thick as a whale omelette". In a 2008 retrospective, co-star Stephen Fry said George's keenness for self-improvement <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> he felt made the character likeable.

As he was also directing The Voyage Home, he was looking to give Whitney a larger role. By this time, she had hoped that Rand had moved over to become a counselor – an idea originally suggested by a fan. Alongside Majel Barrett as Christine Chapel, the duo were given four pages of dialogue initially which was trimmed down to one scene in the final film.

500|$|The episode {{contains}} {{a scene in}} which the survivors pull a bloated walker out of a well in order to prevent contamination of the water. Such attempts prove to be unsuccessful, as all of the water retention severs the walker in half. Greg Nicotero, the special effects director for The Walking Dead, collaborated with KNB Efx Group to produce the sequence. Nicotero {{received a phone call from}} staff members of the company two hours after leaving production offices. They devised and expressed plans of creating a scenario in which a walker falls into a well. Nicotero worked with KNB Efx Group in several other films in the past. [...] "One of the things we've noticed—looking at some morgue research and cadaver research—is that everything gets really swollen," [...] he articulated. [...] "The liquid saturates the skin so much that it swells up, and the skin starts to split. That <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that we really wanted to play up." [...] A costume was sculpted using a body and a head cast. It was composed of three layers; a thin skin-like substance covers the exterior of the suit, followed by a layer of silicone and a layer of foam in the costume's center. A mask that was previously utilized in the action horror film Grindhouse (2007) was used as part of the costume. Nicotero inserted water balloons between the silicone and foam layering. He explained that as the performer begins to move, the liquid transfers from one side of the costume to another. Nicotero added: [...] "If we made it out of foam latex, it would've been stiff. But we used silicone that was heavily plasticized—which means that the silicone was really soft." [...] The suit weighed approximately sixty pounds.|$|E
500|$|PSXextreme praised Cloud's {{redesign}} in Kingdom Hearts {{as one of}} {{the best}} in the game, describing it is a [...] "hybrid" [...] of his and Vincent Valentine's designs. According to AnimeFringe, Cloud's appearance in Kingdom Hearts <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that excited Final Fantasy VII fans the most. His development in Advent Children was praised by DVD Talk {{as one of the}} best parts from the film. James Mielke of 1UP.com commented that Cloud's guilt over Aerith's death was effective enough to move viewers, but regarded such scenes as [...] "manipulative". Michael Beckett, writing for RPGamer, referred to Cloud overcoming Aerith's death as central to the film, and called his fight sequences [...] "the most creative and impressive scenes". Mielke also described the characters as [...] "beautiful; perfect almost", commenting that Cloud possessed [...] "unbreakably perfect hair". Briana Lawerence of Mania Entertainment, however, listed Cloud second in her article [...] "10 Male Headaches of Anime", criticizing his feeling of guilt about Aerith's death. Joystiq's Andrew Yoon opined that the director's cut version of the film provides more depth to Cloud's development, taking advantage of its longer runtime by better [...] "humanizing [...] ". A 2010 GamesRadar article showcasing classic game character redesigns contrasted Cloud's appearances in Advent Children and Final Fantasy VII, stating that the move away from low polygon models necessitated the change, and commenting that Square Enix alters the design with each title he features in. In 2014, IGN held a poll for fans to vote for the most favorite Final Fantasy character of all time, as well as individually in each title. Over 2 million votes were cast in. Cloud ranked number one of all the characters. He also took the same place in the Final Fantasy VII title alone as well.|$|E

Francis Ford Coppola's minimal production duties came from American Zoetrope; Burton only {{became aware of}} Coppola's involvement during the editing process when he was sent a copy of Sleepy Hollows trailer and saw Coppola's name on it. Burton, coming off the troubled production of Superman Lives, was hired to direct in June 1998. [...] "I had never really done something that {{was more of a}} horror film," [...] he explained, [...] "and it's funny, because {{those are the kind of}} movies that I like probably more than any other genre." [...] His {{interest in}} directing a horror film influenced by his love for Hammer Film Productions and Black Sunday—particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages. As a result, Sleepy Hollow is a homage to various Hammer Film Productions, including Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, and other films such as Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, various Roger Corman horror films, Jason and the Argonauts, and Scream Blacula Scream. The image of the Headless Horseman had fascinated Burton during his apprenticeship as a Disney animator at CalArts in the early 1980s. [...] "One of my teachers had worked on the Disney version as one of the layout artists on the chase, and he brought in some layouts from it, so that was exciting. It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that maybe shaped what I like to do." [...] Burton worked with Walker on rewrites, but Rudin suggested that Tom Stoppard rewrite the script to add to the comical aspects of Ichabod's bumbling mannerisms, and emphasize the character's romance with Katrina. His work went uncredited through the WGA screenwriting credit system.|$|E

[...] At the time, he “had not been considered a commercially viable player in the mainstream white American market.” But after delivering one of the most electric performances of the night, and having been the act to most involve the audience, “his performance at Monterey Pop was therefore a natural progression from local to national acclaim,...the decisive turning-point in Otis Redding’s career.” [...] His act included his own song [...] "Respect" [...] and a version of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Satisfaction." [...] Redding and his backing band (Booker T. & the M.G.'s with the Mar-Keys horn section) opened with Cooke's [...] "Shake", after which he delivered an impulsive speech, asking the audience if they were the [...] "love crowd" [...] and looking for a big response.
