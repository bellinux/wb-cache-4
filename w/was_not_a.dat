5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code {{on the grounds that}} the case <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> good test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E
