40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{physiological}} {{effects of a}} single kettlebell <b>workout</b> to a high-resistance circuit <b>workout</b> in resistance-trained males. Methods: 12 resistance trained healthy males (age: 24 ± 2. 97 years; height: 1. 75 ± 0. 064 m; body mass: 75. 99 ± 8. 46 kg) participated in this study. Participants had a familiarization visit and two subsequent experimental visits (kettlebell workout; circuit <b>workout).</b> The kettlebell <b>workout</b> consisted of 12 -minutes of standardized kettlebell swings. The circuit <b>workout</b> consisted of three sets of 6 repetitions of smith machine squats, bench press, leg curl, and lat pulldown. Heart rate, rectal temperature, skin temperature, blood lactate, rating of perceived exertion, muscle pain, and thermal sensation were measured throughout. Statistical analysis was done using one-way repeated measures ANOVA and a one-sampled T-test both with alpha set at 0. 05. Results: More work was performed in the kettlebell swing <b>workout</b> compared to circuit <b>workout</b> (p 3 ̆c 0. 006). Heart rate was significantly higher throughout exercise for kettlebell (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) compared to circuit <b>workout.</b> Core temperature was significantly higher post-exercise in kettlebell compared to circuit <b>workout</b> (KB: Post-exercise = 38. 03 ± 0. 342 ˚C; CW: Post-exercise = 37. 43 ± 0. 341 ˚C, respectively; p 3 ̆c 0. 008). Rating of perceived exertion, and thermal sensation were significantly higher during kettlebell than circuit <b>workout</b> (both p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Muscle pain was significantly higher the last two measurements of exercise in kettlebell than the circuit <b>workout</b> (p 3 ̆c 0. 006). Conclusion: The findings show that the kettlebell swing <b>workout</b> tended to be perceptually harder, increasing feeling of heat stress, muscle pain, and had a higher sustained heart rate during exercise compared to the circuit <b>workout...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Cross-X is an {{exercise}} modality being marketed as an effective tool for toning the legs and buttocks, {{as well as providing}} a cardiovascular <b>workout.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the physiological responses of a 20 -minute <b>workout</b> on the Cross-X machine. Subjects (N= 16) performed a maximal treadmill exercise test and two separate sessions on the Cross-X. The first session was a 10 -minute practice session to familiarize the subjects to the machine. The second session was a 20 -minute <b>workout</b> along with the provided DVD that was separated into the Beginner portion and Intermediate portion. HR and %HRmax were significantly different (p<. 05) between the Beginner and the Intermediate portions of the <b>workout</b> (106 bpm, 58 % of HRmax and 113 bpm, 62 % of HRmax, respectively). Also, ratings of perceived exertion were significantly different between the two portions of the <b>workout</b> (9. 6 and 10. 3, respectively). The results show that although the Cross-X <b>workout</b> did not meet all ACSM recommendations for a cardiovascular <b>workout,</b> it can still provide a sufficient cardiovascular <b>workout</b> for lower fit individuals...|$|R

5|$|As {{both sides}} {{failed to reach}} an agreement, the NBA {{canceled}} the preseason and all games through December.

The lockout also affected the economy due largely to NBA cities losing revenue generated by games as well as television networks losing ratings and advertisement revenue.|$|E
