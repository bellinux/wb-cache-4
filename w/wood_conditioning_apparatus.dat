40|$|Withania somnifera Dunal (Indian Ginseng) has {{recently}} been shown to impair ethanol self-administration. In order to gain further insights {{on the ability of}} the Withania somnifera standardised root extract (WSE) to affect the motivational properties of ethanol, this study investigated whether WSE may also affect ethanol (2 g/kg) -elicited conditioned place preference (CPP) and aversion (CPA). To this end male CD- 1 mice were conditioned under two distinct schedules: in backward conditioning experiments ethanol was administered before mice were placed in the <b>conditioning</b> <b>apparatus</b> (CPP) while, in forward conditioning experiments, ethanol was administered immediately after removing mice from the apparatus (CPA). Following these schedules, mice developed significant CPP and CPA, respectively. Administration of WSE significantly impaired both the acquisition (50 and 100 mg/kg) and the expression (50 mg/kg) of CPP and CPA without affecting spatial memory (50 mg/kg), as determined by a two-trial memory recognition task. Overall, the study highlights the ability of WSE to interfere with both positive and negative motivational properties of ethanol and suggests that the effects of WSE may target both ethanol's motivational properties and underpinning associative learning mechanisms. In conclusion, these results cast new light on Withania somnifera as an agent potentially useful to counteract distinct aspects of ethanol effects...|$|R
40|$|In humans, {{individuals}} particularly {{attracted to}} sensation and novelty seeking {{may have an}} increased vulnerability to abuse drugs. In rodents, behavioral and neurochemical evidence show that the processes mediating novelty reward and drug reward overlap. Therefore, access to novelty might provide an alternative learning history that has potential to compete with conditioned drug reward. The purpose of this dissertation, therefore, was {{to test this hypothesis}} in rats using a place conditioning procedure with cocaine and novelty. Briefly, rats were initially conditioned with cocaine to prefer one side of an unbiased place <b>conditioning</b> <b>apparatus.</b> In the subsequent phase, half of the rats had repeated access to a novel object on their initially unpaired (no-drug) side. Both groups were then tested on separate days for preference in a drug-free state and in the cocaine-drug state. One objective of this dissertation was to aid understanding of the complex interaction between novelty reward and drug reward. This goal was met by the findings that conditioned novelty reward competed with cocaine reward in a manner that was sensitive to cocaine dose, drug-state, and retention intervals. More so, competition by novelty was more likely to occur with lower cocaine doses, shorter retention intervals, and without unpaired exposure to the environmental cues. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to use multiple doses of cocaine to determine the extent of this competition and to determine whether novelty’s impact on cocaine reward was maintained over an abstinence period. In Experiment 1, rats were conditioned with cocaine (7. 5, 20, or 30 mg/kg ip) to prefer one side of an unbiased place <b>conditioning</b> <b>apparatus</b> relative to the other. In a subsequent phase, all rats received alternating daily confinements to the previously cocaine paired and unpaired sides of the apparatus. During this phase, half the rats had access to a novel object on their initially unpaired side; the remaining rats did not receive objects. The ability of novelty to compete with cocaine in a drug free and cocaine challenge test was sensitive to cocaine dose. In Experiment 2, a place preference was established with 10 mg/kg cocaine and testing occurred after 1, 14, or 28 day retention intervals. Findings indicate that choice behaviors mediated by cocaine conditioning are reduced with the passing of time.

The dopamine system participates in the reward effects of opiate use and the aversive effect of opiate abstinence. The amygdala is an essential neural substrate for associative learning of emotion. To establish a model of conditioned place aversion (CPA) in morphine-treated rats, we used different visual and tactual cues as conditioned stimuli (CS) within a <b>conditioning</b> <b>apparatus.</b> An injection of naloxone served as the unconditioned stimulus (US). The 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) lesion technique was used to investigate the effects of the dopaminergic system of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) on naloxone-induced CPA. Rats were rendered physically dependent via administration of increasing doses of morphine delivered via intraperitoneal injection. Doses increased by 20 % each day for 14 days, starting from an initial dose of 6 mg/kg. All rats also received a low dose of naloxone (0. 1 mg/kg) by injection 4 hours after morphine treatment on days 11 and 13 to induce CPA in a biased two-compartment conditioned place apparatus. Morphine-dependent rats with sham lesions were found to develop significant CPA after naloxone treatment. Bilateral 6 -OHDA lesions of the CeA impaired the acquisition of CPA but had no effect on locomotor activity.

40|$|Previous {{work in our}} {{laboratory}} {{has shown}} that diabetic rats self-administer more nicotine compared to healthy controls, possibly because diabetic animals find nicotine more rewarding. This study further compared the rewarding effects of nicotine in diabetic and control rats using conditioned place preference (CPP) procedures. CPP examines whether animals prefer a side of the chamber where they previously received nicotine as compared to a neutral side. Diabetes was induced using streptozotocin (STZ), a drug that is toxic to insulin producing cells in the pancreas. STZ- or vehicle-treated rats (n= 11 - 16) were tested for their initial preference for the 2 compartments of our <b>conditioning</b> <b>apparatus.</b> During <b>conditioning,</b> the rats were injected with nicotine (0. 2 mg/kg, SC) and were placed into their initially non-preferred side. On alternate days, they received saline and were placed into their initially preferred side. After 8 days of conditioning, the rats were re-tested for their preference for 5 consecutive days. Following this extinction period, all rats were re-tested for their preference following an injection of nicotine (0. 2 mg/kg, SC) to compare whether nicotine reinstated extinguished CPP. Diabetic rats displayed stronger nicotine-induced CPP and a slower extinction of this effect as compared to controls. Nicotine did not reinstate extinguished CPP in either group. Along with our self-administration data, these findings support our hypothesis that the rewarding effects of nicotine are enhanced in diabetic rats. Taken together, we suggest that strong rewarding effects of nicotine may contribute to enhanced tobacco abuse in patients with diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Rationale. It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that major differences between mice of the C 57 BL/ 6 J and DBA/ 2 J inbred strains for amphetamine-induced place conditioning (preference and avoidance, respectively) are evident in standard housing conditions but abolished by temporary restricted feeding. This gene-experience model may be usefully exploited to dissect behavioral phenotypes related to place conditioning induced by addictive drugs. Objectives. This study evaluated a number of behavioral phenotypes related to amphetamine-induced place preference for strain differences (C 57 BL/ 6 J vs DBA/ 2 J) susceptible to be abolished by temporary food restriction. Methods. Mice of the two inbred strains were tested for: (1) conditioned taste aversion and place preference induced by amphetamine within the same dose-range; (2) preference for a novel compartment 24 h after a single exposure to only one of two compartments; (3) amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization and conditioned hyperactivity; and (4) locomotor activity during exploration of a novel environment. Results. The two strains showed consistent taste aversion at doses of amphetamine that promoted opposite strain-dependent place conditioning. Both strains spent more time exploring the novel rather than the known compartment of the place <b>conditioning</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Instead, only mice of the C 57 strain showed amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization and conditioned hyperactivity. However, temporary food restriction did not affect strain differences for these phenotypes.

These results relate individual differences for amphetamine-induced place conditioning with locomotor response to amphetamine and novelty...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to assess the {{validity}} of the phenomenon of "animal neurosis," the behavior of cats exposed to the type of conflict Masserman specified as being critical to the development of "experimental neurosis " was contrasted with that of cats simply confined in the <b>conditioning</b> <b>apparatus</b> for the same length of time. Comparison of the groups {{on the basis of the}} "symptoms" Masserman considered "neurotic " did not yield any evidence of neurotic behavior. It was concluded that cats do not become neurotic following exposure to conflict and that Masserman's findings are best explained as artifacts of the experimental procedures he employed. Although interest in experimentally induced "animal neuroses " has declined significantly in the past two decades, these phenomena remain little understood and many workers are unsure of their validity and relationship to the clinical neuroses of humans (Sarason, 1972). The intent of this study was to evaluate "experimental neurosis " in cats, as reported by Masserman (1943). Masserman's work represents but a small proportion of that available, but it is significant in several respects. First, although in need of reevaluation (Smart, 1965; Wolpe, 19 S 2), Masserman's results are frequently quoted by the dynamically oriented in mustering support for "conflict " interpretations of neurosis in humans. Second, his interpretation of the experimental neuroses remains unchanged (Masserman, 1967), and his work continues to be accepted with few reservations (Manning, 1967).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Much {{attention}} has been paid to the associative processes that are necessary to fuse together representations of the various compo-nents of an episodic memory. In the present study, we focus on the processes involved in the formation of lasting representations of the individual components that make up a fear-conditioning episode. In one-trial contextual fear conditioning experiments, weak conditioning to con-text occurs if the shock is delivered immediately following placement of the animal in a novel <b>conditioning</b> <b>apparatus,</b> a phenomenon known as the immediate shock deficit. We show that the immediate shock deficit in mice may be alleviated by pre-exposure to either the context or shock. In using this approach to temporally dissect a contextual fear-conditioning task into its constituent representational and associative processes, we are able to examine directly the processes that are important for formation of lasting representations of the context conditioned stimulus (CS) or uncon-ditioned stimulus (US). Our data indicate that the formation of a lasting representation of the context or shock engages protein synthesis-depen-dent processes. Furthermore, genetic disruption of cAMP-responsive ele-ment binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor that regulates the synthesis of new proteins required for long-term memory, disrupts the formation of lasting context memories. We go on to show that the stress hormone epinephrine modulates the consolidation of a context memory, and reverses consolidation deficits in the CREB-deficient mice. Finally we show that disrupting either NMDA or calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) function impairs consolidation of context memories. Together, these data suggest that this approach is particularly suited for the characterization of molecular and cellular processes underlying the formation of stimulus representations. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that neurons of the mammalian medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) modulate different behavioral outputs, including several memory types. This behavioral modulation is, at least in part, {{under the control of}} the D 1 -like Dopamine (DA) receptor (D 1 / 5 R) which comprises D 1 and D 5 -specific subtypes (D 1 R and D 5 R, respectively). Here, combining a set of behavioral assays with pharmacology, we determined whether the activation of D 1 / 5 R in the mPFC during almost neutral or weak negative-valence experiences induces aversive behaviors. The intra mPFC bilateral infusion of the D 1 / 5 R agonist SKF 38393 (6. 25 μg/side) immediately after exposing rats to the white compartment of a place <b>conditioning</b> <b>apparatus</b> promotes a incubated-like aversive memory when tested 7 days thereafter, but it was not seen 24 h after conditioning. No signs of fear or changes in the anxiety state were observed after the exposure to the white compartment. This aversive response is observed only when the experience paired with the mPFC D 1 / 5 R activation has a context component involved. By using specific agonists for D 1 R or D 5 R subtypes we suggest that D 5 R mediate the induction of the aversive behavior. No aversive effects were observed when the D 1 / 5 R agonist was infused into the dorsal hippocampus (HP), the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) or the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of rats exposed to the white compartment. Taken together, our present findings endorse the idea that activation of mPFC D 1 / 5 R is sufficient to induce incubated-like aversive memories after exposing rats to an apparent neutral or weak negative-valence environment and that mPFC might be considered a key brain region involved in providing adaptive emotional behaviors in response to an ever-changing environment...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The role of {{dopamine}} D 1 receptors and Extracellular signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) in {{the motivational}} properties of drugs {{can be studied}} by place-conditioning. Recent advances {{have shown that the}} motivational properties of ethanol, determined by place-conditioning, are mediated by its metabolic conversion into acetaldehyde. To date, the role of D 1 receptors and ERK activation in acetaldehyde-elicited place preference has not been determined. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the role of D 1 receptors blockade and MEK inhibition in the acquisition of acetaldehyde-elicited conditioned place preference. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to repeated pairings with 1 compartment of the <b>conditioning</b> <b>apparatus</b> immediately following acetaldehyde (20 mg/kg i. g.) or ethanol (1 g/kg i. g.) administration. The D 1 receptor antagonist, SCH 39166 (50 microg/kg s. c.), was administered 10 minutes before acetaldehyde or ethanol administration. In order to study the role of activated ERK in the acetaldehyde-elicited place preference, rats were administered the MEK inhibitor, PD 98059 (1, 30, and 90 microg i. c. v.), 10 or 30 minutes before acetaldehyde. To verify the specificity of these effects, we also studied whether PD 98059 pretreatment could affect morphine (1 mg/kg s. c.) -elicited place preference. RESULTS: Both acetaldehyde and ethanol elicited significant place preferences and these were prevented by pretreatment with SCH 39166. In addition, pretreatment with PD 98059, dose (30 and 90 but not 1 microg i. c. v.) and time (10 but not 30 minutes before) dependently, prevented the acquisition of acetaldehyde- and significantly reduced the acquisition of morphine-elicited conditioned place preference. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that acetaldehyde and ethanol elicit conditioned place preference and demonstrate that D 1 receptors are critically involved in these effects. Furthermore, the finding that PD 98059 prevents the acquisition of acetaldehyde-elicited conditioned place preference highlights the importance of the D 1 receptor-ERK pathway in its motivational effect...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhen {{consolidated}} {{memories are}} reactivated, they become labile and, to persist, must undergo a new stabilization process called reconsolidation. During reactivation, memory {{is susceptible to}} pharmacological interventions that may improve or impair it. Spermidine (SPD) is an endogenous polyamine that physiologically modulates the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in mammals by binding on the polyamine-binding site at the NMDA receptor. While polyamine agonists and antagonists of the polyamine binding site on the NMDA receptor respectively improve and impair early consolidation, {{it has not been}} defined whether these agents alter memory reconsolidation. Male Wistar rats were trained in a fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>apparatus</b> using a 0. 4 mA footshock as unconditioned stimulus. Twenty four hours after training, animals were re-exposed to the apparatus in the absence of shock (reactivation session). Immediately after the reactivation session, SPD (1 – 30 mg/kg, i. p.) or the antagonist of the polyamine-binding site at the NMDA receptor, arcaine (0. 1 – 10 mg/kg, i. p.), were injected, and the animals were tested in the same apparatus 24 h later. Freezing scores at testing were considered a measure of memory. While SPD (3 and 10 mg/kg) improved, arcaine (1 and 10 mg/kg) impaired memory reconsolidation. These drugs had no effect on memory if they were administered in the absence of reactivation, or 6 h after reactivation session. Arcaine (0. 1 mg/kg, i. p.) prevented SPD (3 mg/kg) -induced improvement of memory reconsolidation. Accordingly, SPD (1 mg/kg) prevented arcaine (10 mg/kg) -induced impairment of memory reconsolidation. The amnesic effect of arcaine was not reversed by arcaine administration prior to test, ruling out state dependence in this effect. These results suggest that systemic administration of polyamine binding site ligands modulate memory reconsolidation...|$|R

Place preferences were measured in early adolescent [postnatal day (PND) 35], late adolescent (PND 45) and young adult (PND 60) rats by injecting either 0, 5 or 20 mg/kg cocaine and conditioning them to environmental cues in a 2 -chamber place <b>conditioning</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Significant cocaine preferences were found for all ages at the high dose.

In Experiment 2, it was hypothesized that age-related differences in cocaine CPP may be mediated by differences in the mesolimbic dopaminergic (DA) system throughout development.

This study compared the rewarding effects of nicotine in adolescent, adult, and adult rats pre-exposed to nicotine during adolescence using conditioned place preference (CPP) procedures. Male Wistar adolescent (postnatal day [PND] 28 - 42) and adult (PND 60 - 72) rats were tested for their initial preference for either of two distinct compartments of our <b>conditioning</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Six days later, conditioning was conducted over eight days where rats received nicotine (0, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8 or 1. 2 mg/kg; sc, base; n= 8 - 14 per group) in their initially non-preferred side on one day and saline in the other compartment on alternate days. Following conditioning, rats were tested for CPP. A subsequent study compared CPP produced by various doses of d-amphetamine (0, 0. 5, 1. 0 or 2. 0 mg/kg, base; n= 8 - 14 per group) in adolescent and adult rats. This was done in order to compare developmental differences to another psychostimulant drug with rewarding properties. In a final study, we prepared adolescent rats with subcutaneous pumps that delivered nicotine (4. 7 mg/kg/per day; base) for 14 days. These rats were conditioned later as adults (n= 9 - 14 per group) using the same nicotine doses and conditioning procedures as described previously. Nicotine produced CPP in an inverted U-shaped dose-response manner in both age groups. However, adolescents displayed a larger upward shift in CPP that was significant across a larger range of doses relative to adults. These results appear to be nicotine-specific, since there were no developmental differences to CPP produced by d-amphetamine. Pre-exposure to nicotine during adolescence decreased the aversive effects of the highest nicotine dose in adult rats. Our findings support the hypothesis that adolescence is a period of enhanced vulnerability to nicotine. ...|$|R

Consequently, the company became well known for both its instrumentation and its machinery diagnostic engineers.|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} peeled veneers is {{generally}} quoted considering 3 main criteria: surface roughness, thickness variations and lathe checking. This last criterion impacts on mechanical properties of byproducts. It {{is well known}} that lathe checking occurrence can be reduced applying a good hygrothermal treatment of the round-wood before peeling coupled with optimised setting of pressure bar on the peeling lathe. It is also well known that thicker the veneer is and more difficult it is to reduce lathe checking and the other veneer defects. The tendency being to manufacture more eco-friendly engineering wood products using less glue, it is of interest to design such products with thicker layers and so less glue lines. But using ticker veneers should lead to a deterioration of final products mechanical properties. To quantify this effect, we have made 20 - 21 mm thick LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) boards of beech (Fagus sylvatica) with various compositions (veneers 1, 3 or 5 mm thick). In order to obtained veneers enclosing different grades, several bolts of a same tree have been peeled following 4 different modalities changing <b>wood</b> <b>conditioning</b> temperature (20 / 70 °C) and pressure bar settings (bar acting or not). The quality of all the veneers has been quantified before gluing. In total, 12 sets of boards have been produced for non destructive and destructive mechanical tests. The main results of these exploratory experiments are: - a quite low weakening of LVL mechanical properties when increasing veneer thickness. - the non destructive prediction of MOE by vibration seems not so good on LVL with thick veneers, {{especially in the case of}} edgewise loading, probably because of the presence of important lathe checks. - in some configuration, and especially when using thick veneers, it could be benefit to load LVL flatwise rather than edgewise. - for the measurement of shear strength on LVL, the 5 -point bending test increases its efficiency when increasing veneer thickness. To properly order in a hierarchy the different veneer criteria impacting on LVL mechanical properties, new tests should be repeated on different LVL boards homogeneous for given criteria of veneer qualit...|$|R
30|$|This {{study focused}} on solute {{diffusing}} into cell walls in solution-impregnated <b>wood</b> under <b>conditioning.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} was to clarify the effect of relative humidity (RH) of the conditioning on solute diffusivity in the impregnated wood. Water evaporation, swelling, and shrinkage of wood samples impregnated with an aqueous solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer were examined under conditioning at an RH of 11, 32, 55, or 80  % followed by drying under vacuum. Dried samples were observed using a micro-focus X-ray computed tomography instrument. The total amount of PEG polymer diffusing into cell walls during conditioning increased with RH. Theoretical interpretation indicated that this was caused by an increase in polymer (solute) diffusivity as the amount of water (solvent) in samples increased. Temporal variability of the evaporation rate of water and of the swelling rate of the sample also were examined. Solute diffusivity, which was similar at each RH at the beginning of conditioning, decreased during conditioning; this decrease was greater at lower RH values due to a higher evaporation rate.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrevious {{exposure}} to the training context disrupts glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) antagonist-induced amnesia, indicating that novelty is necessary for such an amnestic effect. While {{there are reports that}} novelty-related release of opioids cause amnesia, no study has addressed whether the amnestic effect of NMDAr antagonists involve opioid mechanisms. In this study we investigated whether pharmacological manipulation of the opioid system immediately after context pre-exposure alters the amnestic effect of arcaine, a NMDAr antagonist. Adult male Wistar rats were habituated (pre-exposed) to a fear <b>conditioning</b> training <b>apparatus</b> or to a different context (open field). Immediately after pre-exposure, animals were injected with saline or naloxone (0. 5 mg/kg, i. p.) or anti-beta-endorphin antibody (1 : 500, i. c. v.). Forty eight hours after pre-exposure session, all animals were subjected to fear conditioning acquisition protocol and saline or arcaine (30 mg/kg, i. p.) was administered immediately after training. Testing was carried out 24 h later, and freezing responses due to re-{{exposure to}} the training apparatus were recorded. Pre-{{exposure to the}} training apparatus prevented the impairment of memory induced by post-training arcaine. Administration of naloxone or anti-beta-endorphin antibody, immediately after pre-exposure to the training apparatus, reinstated the amnesic effect of post-training arcaine. The results suggest that endogenous opioid mechanisms are involved in the pre-exposure-induced loss of the amnestic effect of arcaine...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the design and}} fabrication of an experimental facility that was built to produce a turbulent plane wall jet. The target flow was two-dimensional with a uniform profile of the mean streamwise velocity and a low turbulence level at the slot exit. The design requirements for a flow <b>conditioning</b> <b>apparatus</b> that could produce this flow were determined. The apparatus was then designed and constructed, and measurements of the fluid flow were obtained using particle image velocimetry (PIV). The first series of measurements was along the slot width, the second series was along the slot centerline and the third was at 46 slot heights off the centerline. The Reynolds number, based on the slot height and jet exit velocity, of the wall jet varied from 7594 to 8121. Data for the streamwise and transverse components of velocity and the three associated Reynolds stress components were analyzed and {{used to determine the}} characteristics of the wall jet. This experimental facility was able to produce a profile of the mean streamwise velocity near the slot exit that was uniform over 71 % of the slot height with a streamwise turbulence that was equal to 1. 45 % of the mean velocity. This initial velocity was maintained to 6 slot heights. The fully developed region for the centerline and the off-centerline measurements was determined to extend from 50 to 100 slot heights and 40 to 100 slot heights, respectively. This was based on self-similarity of the mean streamwise velocity profiles when scaled using the maximum streamwise velocity and the jet half-width. The off-centerline Reynolds stress profiles achieved a greater degree of collapse than did the centerline profiles. The rate of spread of the wall jet along the centerline was 0. 080 in the self-similar region from 50 to 100 slot heights, and the off-centerline growth rate was 0. 077 in the self-similar region from 40 to 100 slot heights. The decay rate of the maximum streamwise velocity was - 0. 624 within the centerline self-similar region, and - 0. 562 within the off-centerline self-similar region. These results for the spread and decay of the wall jet compared well with recent similar studies. The two-dimensionality was initially assessed by measuring the mean streamwise velocity at 1 slot height along the entire slot width. The two-dimensionality of this wall jet was further analyzed by comparing the centerline and off-centerline profiles of the mean streamwise velocity at 2 / 3, 4, 50, 80, and 100 slot heights, and by comparing the growth rates and decay rates. Although this facility was able to produce a wall jet that was initially two-dimensional, the two-dimensionality was compromised downstream of the slot, most likely due to the presence of return flow and spanwise spreading. Without further measurements, it is not yet clear exactly how the lack of complete two-dimensionality affects the flow characteristics noted above...|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} focused on solute {{diffusing}} into cell walls in solution-impregnated <b>wood</b> under <b>conditioning,</b> process of evaporating solvent. The amount of the diffusion {{is known to be}} determined by the solute diffusivity and the solute-concentration difference between cell walls and cell cavities. Purpose of this paper was to clarify the effect of temperature only on the solute diffusivity that is directionally related to the thermal vibration of the solute molecule. The cross-cut block of hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa), polyethylene glycol (PEG 1540), and water was employed as wood sample, solute, and solvent, respectively. The sample impregnated with a 20 mass% solution was conditioned at 20, 35, or 50  °C to finish the solute diffusion evaluated using the dimension of the sample that was conditioned followed by drying in a vacuum. To unify the solute-concentration difference, for all temperatures, the equilibrium moisture content was unified and the solvent-evaporation rate was controlled in three ways during conditioning. The solute diffusivity was higher in order of 35, 50, and 20  °C, which was evaluated by the solute diffusion at the same evaporation rate. It is clarified that the diffusivity increases with increasing the dimension of cell walls rather than with increasing the thermal vibration of solute molecule.|$|R
