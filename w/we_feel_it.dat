Managing director Keith Edelman revealed plans were at an exploratory stage, and added: [...] "It would be in pre-season, around late July, and tickets would be reasonably priced. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> could be a really exciting event." [...] Details of the tournament were formally announced on 1 May 2007, with Italian champions Inter Milan, French side Paris Saint-Germain and German outfit Hamburg confirmed as participants. Hamburg's qualification into the Intertoto Cup meant they withdrew from the competition; the club were subsequently replaced by Spain's Valencia.|$|E

500|$|Brown {{initially}} nicknamed Sedna [...] "The Flying Dutchman", or [...] "Dutch", after {{a legendary}} ghost ship, because its slow movement had initially masked its presence from his team. For an official {{name for the}} object, Brown settled on [...] "Sedna," [...] a name from Inuit mythology, which Brown chose partly because the Inuit were the closest polar culture {{to his home in}} Pasadena, and partly because the name, unlike Quaoar, would be easily pronounceable. On his website, he wrote, [...] "Our newly discovered object is the coldest, most distant place known in the Solar System, so <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> is appropriate to name it in honor of Sedna, the Inuit goddess of the sea, who is thought to live {{at the bottom of the}} frigid Arctic Ocean." [...] Brown also suggested to the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Minor Planet Center that any future objects discovered in Sedna's orbital region should also be named after entities in arctic mythologies. The team made the name [...] "Sedna" [...] public before the object had been officially numbered. Brian Marsden, the head of the Minor Planet Center, said that such an action was a violation of protocol, and that some members of the IAU might vote against it. However, no objection was raised to the name, and no competing names were suggested. The IAU's Committee on Small Body Nomenclature formally accepted the name in September 2004, and also considered that, in similar cases of extraordinary interest, it might in the future allow names to be announced before they were officially numbered.|$|E

[...] This denial persuaded Puglisi of the need to challenge church authorities. [...] "We can, we must criticize the church when <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> doesn't respond to our expectations, because it's absolutely right to seek to improve it," [...] he said. With his trademark humour, Puglisi added: [...] "But we should always criticize it like a mother, never a mother-in-law!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Berger's brief remarks began a {{tradition}} of essentially hostile commentary in books on human geography {{and other parts of}} the humanities, that tend to treat normal features of historic portraiture as somewhat sinister, in a view emphasizing negative aspects of the English 18th century. By 2004 it was described as [...] "a painting that has become so widely cited by human geographers that <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> has become the one cultural artefact no self-respecting commentary on the practice of human geography can afford to ignore". [...] According to another geographer:"Mr and Mrs Andrews, then, is an image on which geographers are agreed: it is a symptom of the capitalist property relations that legitimize and are sanctioned by the visual sweep of a landscape prospect".|$|E
2500|$|Since Griswold, some {{judges have}} tried to use the Ninth Amendment to justify judicially {{enforcing}} rights that are not enumerated.

[...] However, Justice William O. Douglas rejected that view; Douglas wrote that, [...] "The Ninth Amendment obviously does not create federally enforceable rights." [...] See Doe v. Bolton (1973). [...] Douglas joined the majority opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe, which stated that a federally enforceable right to privacy, [...] "whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The A-League has two trophies {{which are}} competed for during the season: the Premier's Plate and the A-League Trophy. The Premier's Plate is {{awarded to the}} A-League Premiers, the regular season winners, and the A-League Trophy is awarded to the A-League Champions, {{the winner of the}} Grand Final. Both pieces of {{silverware}} were designed by Sydney design company D3 Design. The A-League Trophy is nicknamed the [...] "Toilet Seat" [...] due to its shape. Where as the Premier's Plate follows a traditional trophy design, the A-League Trophy differs. In 2005, John O'Neill, FFA CEO commented during the unveiling of the A-League Trophy, [...] "We have a new national league and <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> is important to re-define the conventional view of a trophy to reflect this". Clive Solari of D3 Design explained the trophy's design, saying [...] "We wanted our trophy concept to embody the historical significance of sport in a contemporary design. So we looked to history to see how great achievements have been rewarded across all types of games for thousands of years. The winners of the world's original sporting competition, the Olympic Games, were presented with a laurel wreath on their heads. We used this model as a basis for a unique, cutting-edge design – our trophy is a modern and versatile translation of the wreath. The winners can hold it above their heads as a symbol of success".|$|E
