5|$|The Ama are Japanese skin divers, {{predominantly}} women, who traditionally {{dive for}} shellfish and seaweed {{wearing only a}} loincloth and <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> action for at least 2,000 years. Starting in the twentieth century, they have increasingly been regarded as a tourist attraction. They operate off reefs near the shore, and some perform for sightseers instead of diving to collect a harvest. They have been romanticized as mermaids.|$|E

50|$|Another AGA study <b>was</b> used <b>in</b> {{assessing}} the cultural adaption of Filipinos <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. Navy. Three groups of Filipinos {{were compared to}} similarly composed groups of Americans: those who were newly recruited to the U.S. Navy, those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Navy between 1 and 10 years, and those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Navy from 11 to 25 years. The results indicated that cultural adaptation occurred most in domains such as “Work” and “Service.” Cultural adaptation occurred least in domains such as “Family,” “Friends,” “Society,” “Interpersonal Relations,” and “Religion.” These domains are most influenced by tradition and early socialization. This study also revealed that cultural adaption is also a function {{of time spent in}} the host environment. The change from the first group (new recruits) to the second group (those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Navy 1-10 years) is faster than the change from the second group to the third group (those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Navy 11-25 years).|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from {{paedophile}} investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognized them from Praia de Luz. Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year. Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.|$|E

25|$|The lack {{of celebrity}} was symbolised in earlier series by the {{presence}} of a minor, and often somewhat cult, celebrity, locked up in a cage in the dungeon of the Bungalow. In later series, the celebrity would sit in the attic. In both cases they would say nothing and often do nothing. Some people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the cage or the attic included Vince Earl, Sarah Greene, John Kettley, Hugo Myatt (as Treguard from Knightmare), Su Pollard, Bodger and Badger, and Peter Simon.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, an {{estimated}} 14 {{million people live}} in families in which the head of household or the spouse is in the United States without authorization. Illegal immigrants arriving recently before 2012 tend to be better educated than those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the country a decade or more. A quarter of all immigrants who have arrived in recently before 2012 have at least some college education. Nonetheless, illegal immigrants as a group {{tend to be less}} educated than other sections of the U.S. population: 49 percent haven't completed high school, compared with 9 percent of native-born Americans and 25 percent of legal immigrants.|$|E
25|$|Immigrant {{status in}} the United States is a {{predictor}} for breastfeeding adherence. In particular, the Hispanic paradox {{plays a role in}} the high breastfeeding rates observed among Hispanic/Latina women in the United States. Breastfeeding initiation rates among this population are higher for less acculturated immigrants; Hispanic women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the United States for longer are less likely to breastfeed. This disparity does not depend on age, income level, or education level; more acculturated Hispanics are likely to cite the same reasons for bottle-feeding as native-born white women do. In many cases, the connection that Hispanic women feel to their culture and its values can strongly influence their decision regarding breastfeeding.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the tit-for-tat {{strategy}} has been of beneficial use to social psychologists and sociologists in studying effective techniques to reduce conflict. Research has indicated that when individuals <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> competition {{for a period of}} time no longer trust one another, the most effective competition reverser is the use of the tit-for-tat strategy. Individuals commonly engage in behavioral assimilation, a process in which they tend to match their own behaviors to those displayed by cooperating or competing group members. Therefore, if the tit-for-tat strategy begins with cooperation, then cooperation ensues. On the other hand, if the other party competes, then the tit-for-tat strategy will lead the alternate party to compete as well. Ultimately, each action by the other member is countered with a matching response, competition with competition and cooperation with cooperation.|$|E

25|$|Each bill {{goes through}} several stages in each house {{including}} consideration {{by a committee}} and advice from the Government Accountability Office. Most legislation is considered by standing committees which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as Agriculture or Appropriations. The House has twenty standing committees; the Senate has sixteen. Standing committees meet at least once each month. Almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must {{be open to the}} public unless the committee votes, publicly, to close the meeting. A committee might call for public hearings on important bills. Each committee is led by a chair who belongs to the majority party and a ranking member of the minority party. Witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill. Then, a bill may go to what's called a mark-up session where committee members debate the bill's merits and may offer amendments or revisions. Committees may also amend the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. After debate, the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house. If a bill is tabled then it is rejected. If amendments are extensive, sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so-called clean bill with a new number. Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used. Generally, members <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power.|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Ernest W.

[...] John Kaspar, a White Citizens' Council organizer who had achieved notoriety for starting a race riot in Clinton, Tennessee, declared that [...] "almost one hundred percent of all psychiatric therapy is Jewish and about eighty percent of psychiatrists are Jewish ... one particular race is administering this particular thing." [...] He argued that Jews were nationalists of another country who were attempting to [...] "usurp American nationality".|$|E
500|$|All {{the costumes}} {{in the film}} were {{designed}} by Mona May, who had previously worked on Clueless, The Wedding Singer, and The Haunted Mansion.

She {{became involved in the}} project during the time when the animators are designing the faces and bodies of the characters as they had to [...] "translate the costumes from two-dimensional drawings to live-action human proportion". Her goal was to keep the designs [...] "Disneyesque to the core but bring a little bit of fashion in there and humor and make it something new". However, May admitted this was difficult [...] "because they're dealing with iconic Disney characters <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the psyche of the viewing audience for so long".|$|E
