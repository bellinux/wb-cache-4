500|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, Taylor decided to remove the Kazon as the series' primary antagonists, having found the effort to develop the alien species to be unsuccessful. She felt that they never grew into a {{compelling}} adversary, despite their appearances in multiple episodes. Taylor argued that the Kazon limited the potential of the series, saying: [...] "It created the curious implication that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> still in space, when our franchise is that we are going at incredible speeds toward the Alpha Quadrant – we keep running into the same people over and over again! It was just an oddity, and I don't think the Kazon have served us well." [...] While discussing their role in the future episodes, she explained that it was her [...] "intention to leave them behind and to find new and I hope more interesting aliens".|$|E
2500|$|In 1930 Stout said: [...] "Aviation in the U.S. {{has been}} stagnating for two years. We are all copying. Aviation has shown no {{progress}} ... {{comparable to that}} made in radio and talking pictures. Think how many copies have {{been made of the}} plane Colonel Lindbergh used on his flight across the Atlantic ... of other famous planes. None of us are building the plane that the public wants to buy, and that proves <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> still." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you aware}} that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> {{on the top of}} a hill," [...] Lois said, [...] "and that {{everybody}} for a good many miles round has a perfectly clear view of us?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> on {{the front}} porch, close to each other, and I think <b>we</b> <b>were</b> holding each other's hands, when Mrs. Carson came back. As she {{approached}} she looked at us inquiringly, plainly wishing to know why <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> side by side before her door {{as if we had}} some special object in so doing.|$|R
60|$|She {{had raised}} herself from her couch, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> face to face.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} here to refresh myself," [...] she said to Mackinnon one evening--to Mackinnon and myself; for <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> together.|$|R
6000|$|... "And the North Star ahead {{almost over}} your {{starboard}} bow means that we're steering a course, north, northwest, or maybe north by west, for I doubt if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> {{more than ten}} degrees westward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Trefusis, {{extending}} his hand--Erskine at first {{thought for a}} hearty shake--"give me half-a-crown towards the cost of our expedition here to-day to assert {{the right of the}} people to tread the soil <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> upon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those were trees!" [...] he said. [...] "That panel's {{over four}} feet across, I {{measured}} it once. I dare say the pine {{it was cut}} from grew right where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing,</b> before the land was cleared to build the house." ...|$|E
5000|$|... waslike <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{on a pair}} of Boeing 747 engines. It {{cracked the}} {{foundations}} and broke windows in neighbouring buildings. Billy Thorpe ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{before the}} fire-place. He left me, {{and walked away}} slowly with his head down, {{apparently}} intending to leave the room.|$|R
60|$|We {{waited to}} give him time to cross the hall and drive away. The Count {{approached}} us while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> near the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't quite know. At {{first sight}} I {{should say that}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> {{on the lip of}} a crater of some vast extinct volcano. Look how it curves to north and south and at the slope running down to the lake." ...|$|E
6000|$|SHE [jumping up distractedly] If you {{say that}} again I shall do {{something}} I'll be sorry for. Here <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> <b>standing</b> {{on the edge of}} a frightful precipice. No doubt it's quite simple to go over and have done with it. But can't you suggest anything more agreeable? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, maybe. But {{you come}} on! We are {{out for a}} walk, and here <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> stock-still {{in the middle of}} the {{sidewalk}} with folks all around us. Come on! If you don't come I will leave you;" [...] and Nellie started on, dragging Tom with her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I do not know," [...] she answered, so tremulously {{that the}} words {{scarcely}} reached us, though <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{only a few feet}} away.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed much}} as if fortune {{had at last}} consented to smile upon us, for <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{directly}} in front of the great man.|$|R
6000|$|... "What does it mean, Macumazahn?" [...] she asked, {{when the}} pair had gone by, as they thought unobserved, since <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{where they could}} not see us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Silly way {{of putting}} it, I know," [...] said Father Brown apologetically. [...] "Sounds like a fairy tale. But poor Armstrong was killed with a giant's club, a great green club, too big to be seen, and which we call the earth. He was broken against this green bank <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> on." ...|$|E
60|$|I do not {{say that}} we have done so; but we may; for human nature is just the same now as it was then; and {{therefore}} it is as well for us to look round--at least once now and then, and see whether we too are in danger of falling, while we think that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> safe.|$|E
60|$|MR. A. Will {{you take}} my word, dear child--the word {{of one who}} can dare humbly to say he has proved it, {{so as to be}} as sure as of the floor <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> on, that that Rock exists; and God grant that you may, in prayer and patience, be brought to rest on it once more.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> by {{the great}} marble fireplace, and Canaples was resting one of his feet upon the huge brass andirons. He made a gesture of impatience as I spoke.|$|R
60|$|It {{was perhaps}} twenty minutes later, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{together}} {{at the edge of}} the woods. She wanted me to come to the house to take breakfast with them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is it you, Checco?' we whispered, for {{the guard}} {{of the gate}} might have heard us. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> in a little plot of waste ground, ten yards from the walls.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> {{high above}} {{the ground in the}} loggia into which our apartments open, and I point across the soft haze of the public gardens to a tall white mass of University {{buildings}} that rises with a free and fearless gesture, to lift saluting pinnacles against the clear evening sky. [...] "Don't you think that rather more beautiful than--say--our National Gallery?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is the {{entrance}} {{we will try}} first," [...] Stanley said, pointing to one some ten feet from the ground. [...] "You see there were once some steps leading up to it. No doubt, where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> there was a temple built against the face of that rock; and probably that doorway led {{into one of the}} priests' chambers." ...|$|E
60|$|Ever since grey dawn, in {{the lower}} of the two islands, just above where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing,</b> there has been great clamour, {{and the sound of}} many workmen. The great {{pavilion}} brought there yester eve is being raised, and carpenters are busy nailing tiers of seats, while ’prentices from London town are there with many-coloured stuffs and silks and cloth of gold and silver.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{apart from}} the others, and she was sipping a cup of spiced wine that the host had mulled for her. She {{looked at me with}} a {{tolerant}} smile.|$|R
60|$|Paul was of {{the same}} opinion, even {{going so far as}} to declare that he had noted on coming ashore the gum tree which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> near while holding the consultation.|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed to}} lose all {{patience}} with me. She snatched the book out of my hand, and opened it before me on the table by which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> side by side.|$|R
6000|$|... --Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in {{the hands}} of the jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are the signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nation's vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction. Old England is dying.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly she paused. [...] "Look," [...] she said, [...] "now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> in Guayana again. And {{over there}} in Brazil, and up there towards the Cordilleras, it is unknown. And there are people there. Come, let us go and seek for my mother's people in that place. With grandfather, but not the dogs; they would frighten the animals and betray us by barking to cruel men who would slay us with {{poisoned}} arrows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it?" [...] said Molly. [...] "I'm so {{glad you}} like it. I always feel as if I had invented {{everything}} round here. It hurts me if people don't appreciate it. Once I took Sir Thomas Blunt up here. It was as much as I could do to induce him to come at all. He simply won't walk. When we got to where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> now, I pointed and said: 'There!'" ...|$|E
60|$|My {{mother took}} no note of my exclamation, but her brow darkened. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{together}} on the lawn {{in front of the}} house and she was in the shadow of a tall cypress tree.|$|R
60|$|Again {{there came}} the hilarious roar from the room, and almost {{with the very}} noise of it, a big, panting apoplectic old gentleman {{came out of the}} inner house into the hall where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing.</b>|$|R
60|$|Now <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> in {{the clear}} sunlight, but as I said the words a wind stirred the palm-trees and the shadow from one of them fell full upon me, and she who was very quick, noted it.|$|R
