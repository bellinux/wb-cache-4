"When I {{originally}} {{wrote the}} liner notes, {{it was about}} 5,000 words longer and included all {{the reasons why the}} songs didn't make it, which I thought was kind of interesting.

5000|$|Despite {{opposition}} from Scottish Football Association {{with regard to}} Scottish players playing on a British team, Little was strongly in favour of participating in the Great Britain team at the 2012 London Olympics: [...] "I don't see why <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> stop a player from playing at a massive tournament like the Olympics, it's the biggest sporting event ever.

5000|$|I try {{to not let}} {{the show}} get too {{political}}. To me, it's more social than political I guess you'd say, because that's funnier. I don't really like political reference humor that much. Although I liked the episode [...] "Hank's Bully" [...] where Hank's talking to the mailman and he says, 'Why <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> lick a stamp that has Bill Clinton on it?' To me that's just like more of a character thing about Hank than {{it is a political}} joke or anything. I don't want to do a bunch of stuff about the war, particularly.|$|E
50|$|Twenty years ago, after {{killing his}} brother, Sardar Rajpal flees from his {{hometown}} in Shillong and re-locates {{to the rural}} area of Assam along with his adopted daughter, Meena. He asks his wife, Kamla, to send their son, Shankar, {{so that he can}} employ him and get him married to Meena. Shankar arrives and he is welcomed by Sardar who employs him and introduces him to Meena. A few days later another young man shows up at his door claiming to be Kamla's son. A baffled Sardar also welcomes him, and puts both the young men under observation in order to find who the real Shankar is. The question remains why <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> impersonate Shankar, and what will happen to Sardar himself after the Police catch up with him for killing his brother 20 years ago.|$|E
5000|$|Hank thinks {{very highly}} of Texas. He thinks that Texas is {{superior}} to all other states in the U.S or at least Hollywood. This is sort of satirical on the stereotype or at least exaggeration of Texan's state pride. In the episode [...] "Returning Japanese Part 1", Hank says [...] "Peggy, I've already chosen the country for our summer vacation, America. And the state, Texas. And the town, Denton. I don't care what their police did to that cyclist. It's still a great town." [...] That was his response to Peggy's ideas for their summer vacation. Later in the episode, he also says to his father Cotton, [...] "Dad, {{there is no other}} place I'd rather be," [...] after Cotton said, [...] "Hank, you work at a gas station; fuel this thing up and fly me back to Texas!". A recurring gag throughout the series is Hank's contempt for big cities and urban areas, once comparing a youth oriented shopping center to [...] "Hell, or Dallas", and, regarding San Antonio, asking [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> live there?" [...] as he and Bobby watched a weather girl screw up on camera.|$|E
5000|$|Agnes Henningsen {{who became}} a trainee with Mary Steen in 1895 {{provides}} a lively description of Mary Steen in her memoirs Byen erobret, published in 1945: [...] "Everything about Mary Steen was powerful and energetic.

I concluded: 'So I won't {{be able to take}} those children, Miss Steen. The only thing I <b>want</b> is <b>to</b> be a photographer.' She stood up, gesturing meaningfully: 'Start tomorrow.'" ...|$|R
50|$|Immanuel Kant famously {{criticized the}} golden rule for not being {{sensitive}} to differences of situation, noting that a prisoner duly {{convicted of a crime}} could appeal to {{the golden rule}} while asking the judge to release him, pointing out that the judge <b>would</b> not <b>want</b> <b>anyone</b> else <b>to</b> send him to prison, so he should not do so to others. Kant's Categorical Imperative, introduced in Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals, is often confused with the Golden Rule.|$|R
500|$|The pastime gained {{attention}} in a humorous article written by Don Katz, entitled [...] "King of the Ferret Leggers," [...] in the October 1987 issue of Outside magazine. Katz described ferrets as [...] "having claws like hypodermic needles and teeth like number 16 carpet tacks". James Howard of The Fresno Bee said Katz failed <b>to</b> explain why <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{participate in a}} sport such as ferret-legging, but the article [...] "offers {{a glimpse into the}} human need to challenge the edges of human endurance".|$|R
5000|$|Nolan came to {{prominence}} in 2000 as the runner {{up in the}} first series of the British reality show Big Brother. Her life as a lesbian ex-nun was central to the majority of the titillation in the first series in contrast with later series when, said the Irish Independent in 2007, [...] "the freakshow has ratcheted to the point where Nolan would be deemed far too Waltons Mountain for Big Brother". She was present for a part of reality television history when Craig Phillips took on 'Nasty Nick' Bateman and his manipulative interferences. People ask her: [...] "Are you Anna from Big Brother?" [...] She used to deny this after losing interest but now she embraces her past. She describes her time in Big Brother as follows: [...] "There were moments when I wanted to leave due to boredom, or people irritating me, or missing people at home. Did I enjoy it? It wasn't about enjoying it, it was about getting through it." [...] Prior to entering Big Brother, Nolan thought nobody would watch the show as she had discussed it with two friends and [...] "One of them said, 'Why on earth <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> watch that?' and we changed the subject". In June 2010, RT√â Ten named Nolan as one of its [...] "Top 10 BB Housemates".|$|E
5000|$|Writing for Variety, Andrew Barker {{called it}} [...] "generally {{entertaining}} yet fundamentally unnecessary" [...] and concluded: [...] "Even {{when one is}} inclined to admire the cleverness with which the remake revisits and reincorporates Poltergeists themes, it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint a single moment where it improves on them, and the aura of inessentiality hangs thick over the proceedings". Neil Genzlinger gave the film a mostly positive review in The New York Times, writing: [...] "The new Poltergeist might well be the scariest movie 13-or-unders have yet seen, just as the original was for their parents back in 1982. Those parents might find it an enjoyable trip down memory lane, {{even if they do}} now recognize it as largely a well-served collection of horror-movie tropes". Eddie Goldberger echoed that sentiment in The New York Daily News, writing [...] "It doesn't approach the original--really, how could it? But the new Poltergeist is a fun, worthy horror entry." [...] Tirdad Derakhshani wrote in The Philadelphia Inquirer: [...] "It's not exactly a scary film, but it does provide an enjoyable ride. It's good fun. But it left me befuddled", adding: [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> remake Poltergeist in the first place?". Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Mike McCahill called the film [...] "an efficient scare-machine". Bilge Ebiri wrote in New York magazine: [...] "This new Poltergeist isn't anything special... But it's not a travesty, and that feels like cause for brief celebration".|$|E
40|$|Why {{does anyone}} do science? Why <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do science?

5000|$|Pan's People {{performed}} {{at a time}} when the BBC routinely wiped the videos of the Top Of The Pops shows to save money on new tapes and because it was not thought that <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> watch the shows again. However, organisations such as the BFI and Kaleidoscope have spent time searching archives and as a result many recorded dance routines have been rediscovered. More recently they have found roughly 40 lost dances on home video tapes and have extracted digital footage from the very fragile analog tapes. Estimated video survivals by year: ...|$|R
40|$|If {{the foreign}} {{exchange}} market behaved as it is assumed to do in economics textbooks, with ubiquitous rational expectations the driving force, it is indeed difficult to imagine why <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> allow the exchange rate to float (at least for countries that do not satisfy the conditions {{to be part of}} an optimum currency area). Since most economists like to assume that their models do indeed describe the real world, to some reasonable approximation, {{it is not difficult to}} understand the appeal of floating to the profession. ...|$|R
40|$|In a 2012 blog post, MIT‚Äôs Daron Acemoglu and Harvard‚Äôs James Robinson call {{attention}} to a ‚Äúfancy school‚Äù built in a small village in Sierra Leone and financed by Chinese development aid. They ask a pointed question: ‚ÄúWhy <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> build a wonderful school {{in the middle of}} what Africans call ‚Äòthe bush‚Äô?‚Äù As Acemoglu and Robinson explain, ‚ÄúYoni is the home village of Sierra Leone‚Äôs president, Ernest Bai Koroma. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} consanguineous {{marriage}} raises both interest and unease in Western societies. For {{those who are}} wondering, that big word means ‚Äúmarrying your cousin‚Äù. But why <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> marry a cousin when {{there are so many}} other potential partners out there? In generational terms this mode of thought is actually quite recent, and until the middle of the 19 th century first cousin marriage was common in most Western countries, in part due to the shortage of available unrelated spouses in many outlying areas...|$|E
40|$|Why <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{appear as}} an expert witness in a legal proceeding? The very thought conjures images of embarrassment, humiliation, or at least extreme anxiety. Yet, increasingly, {{scientists}} and other professionals are finding themselves listed as expert witnesses and asked to submit to interrogation by deposition and in many instances to direct and cross-examination at trial. Environmental health scientists may be sought as expert witnesses in many types of litigation, including "toxic torts " (where someone is seeking damages for injury or disease from a chemical exposure), zoning or land use issues involving hazardous wastes o...|$|E
50|$|Holmes goes to Gelder & Co. {{and finds}} out that the busts {{were part of a}} batch of six, but other than that, the manager can think of no reason why they should be special, or why <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> destroy them. He recognizes Beppo‚Äôs picture, and {{describes}} him as a rascal. He was imprisoned for a street-fight stabbing a year earlier, but has likely been released now. He once worked at Gelder & Co., but has not been back. His cousin still works there. Holmes begs the manager not to talk to the cousin about Beppo.|$|R
5000|$|Franco {{said in the}} {{interview}} that he only did the two cannibal films for the money, {{and said that he}} had no idea why <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> watch such films. He said that Sabrina Siani was the worst actress he ever worked with in his life (second only to Romina Power) and that Sianis only good quality was her [...] "delectable derri√®re", which he shows off to good effect in this film. The film also starred child actress Anouchka (Lesoeur), who was the producers daughter and appeared in several of his Eurocine productions around this time.|$|R
