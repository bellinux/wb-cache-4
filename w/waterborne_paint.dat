Honda revised the vehicle's name from NS-X to NSX before final production and sale. The NSX went on sale in Japan in 1990 at Honda Verno dealership sales channels, supplanting the Honda Prelude as the flagship model. The NSX was sold under Honda's flagship Acura luxury brand starting in November 1990 in North America and Hong Kong.Upon its official release, the NSX design concept showcased Honda's technology, and measured only 1170 mm in height, making it only 141.3 mm taller than the Ford GT40, an extreme GT racing car designed and funded solely to win at LeMans. The Japanese car maker's race track innovations and competitive history were further exemplified on the road by the NSX's ultra-rigid, ultra-light all aluminium monocoque chassis and front and rear double wishbone suspension, with forged control arms connected to forged alloy wheels. The car additionally boasted the world's first {{production car}} engine with titanium connecting rods, forged pistons, and ultra high-revving capabilities - the redline was at a lofty 8,300 rpm - all traits usually associated with track and race engineered motor cars. The NSX exterior had a dedicated 23-step paint process, including an aircraft type chromate coating designed for chemically protecting the aluminium bodywork and a <b>waterborne</b> <b>paint</b> for the base coat to achieve a clearer, more vivid top color and a smoother surface finish.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn Italian buildings, {{especially}} dwellings, {{walls are}} very often plastered with gypsum plaster for levelling purposes. The gypsum plaster is generally covered with <b>waterborne</b> wall <b>paint</b> for decoration which represents a barrier {{for the water}} absorption or desorption. To know the hygric performance of a room in such real conditions, the water transfer properties of the painted gypsum must be known. Wall paints can be roughly divided into waterborne and solvent borne <b>paints.</b> <b>Waterborne</b> wall <b>paints</b> are increasingly being used for their low odour and fast environmental friendly drying. The newer <b>waterborne</b> <b>paints</b> are based on aqueous dispersions of synthetic vinyl-type binders, such as polyvinylacetate or polyvinylpropionate (co-) polymers, and acrylic polymers. Moreover, paints containing volatile organic components have recently been prohibited by the European Commission for professional indoor use. The pressure to reduce volatile organic components and the industrial trend towards friendlier products with low toxicity of the product formulation led to the current expansion of waterborne types of coating. In building physics literature, knowledge is lacking about the moisture transfer properties of <b>waterborne</b> wall <b>paints.</b> Also the behavior of painted substrates has not been examined sufficiently. The role of the paint constituents in the moisture transfer properties is unclear. This lack of knowledge is partly caused {{by the lack of}} simple measuring techniques. Also the moisture behavior of the gypsum {{plays an important role in}} controlling the relative humidity, as the experimental activity in the paper for measuring its hygroscopic properties (Moisture Buffer Value) highlights. Painting gypsum is not done to prevent deterioration of the substrate as usually done for wood; gypsum is mainly painted for decorative reasons: this can also be a means to control the moisture transfer properties of the gypsum. Anyway, aim of the present study is not the numerical modelling or measuring of <b>waterborne</b> <b>paints,</b> but their influence once applied to the gypsum substrate, of which the hygroscopic properties where calculated when coated and uncoated. The numerical simulation using an whole building HAM-transfer model is then used to simulate the hygroscopic performance of a room in different conditions...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} workers’ exposures to emerging waterborne coatings used in automotive refinishing systems and observe other work practices associated with using these products. Methods: Ten auto body shops in King County, Washington that use waterborne coatings were recruited to participate in this study. Based on reviews of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) from commonly used waterborne basecoats, 14 target compounds were selected to characterize exposures to components of these products. Task-based personal air sampling was conducted on 11 painters when applying basecoats. Sampling results were summarized and compared to MSDSs and historical exposure studies of solvent-based paints. Painters’ work practices were also recorded to determine other possible routes of exposure. Work practices recorded included the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), gun-cleaning procedures, waste disposal, and paint booth maintenance. Results: Breathing zone concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons and polar volatile organic compounds were typically below their respective method limits of quantitation (MLOQ). On average, 11 % (SD= 16 %) of the aromatic hydrocarbon samples and 23 % (SD= 19 %) of the polar compound samples exceeded their respective MLOQs. All analyte concentrations had threshold limit value (TLV) parametric exceedance fractions below 0. 03, and National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) odor parametric exceedance fractions below 0. 05. VOC exposures when spraying waterborne paints were up to 56 times lower than historical studies on VOC exposures to solvent-based paints. Procedures for cleaning paint guns and disposing of <b>waterborne</b> <b>paint</b> wastes varied between shops. Several shops disposed of waste in the municipal solid waste stream without chemical characterization, in violation of state regulations. Painters were observed using lacquer thinner to clean their <b>waterborne</b> <b>paint</b> guns, which is not recommended by manufacturers. Painters were also observed handling waterborne waste with inadequate exposure controls. We observed that the air flow rates in spray booths typically failed to meet OSHA requirements. Conclusions: Workers’ exposures to target compounds when applying waterborne basecoats were typically below their respective MLOQs and regulatory limits. The typical PPE worn by painters should be adequate to protect painters from possible exposures. This study also shows that the <b>waterborne</b> <b>paint</b> exposures during spraying are lower than the historical exposures due to spraying solvent-based paints. However, without maintaining adequate airflow in the paint booths and adequate guidelines for all aspects of handling the paints, workers can still be at risk of exposures to waterborne paints and other chemicals used during non-spraying operations. Therefore, more information is needed on the chemical composition of the waste generated from <b>waterborne</b> <b>paint</b> systems to establish best practices for spray gun cleaning and waste disposal...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGround-level ozone, {{worldwide}} recognised amongst key pollutants {{responsible for}} smog {{and a significant}} pulmonary irritant is formed in troposphere via a photolytic process from nitrogen oxides (NOx). Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) during their decomposition in the atmosphere interact with NOx and thus affect ozone formation. Their interactions are not equal and have been quantified in Maximum Incremental Reactivities (MIR). Using MIR, calculated was ozone formation potential of VOCs emitted from an aromatic solvent-containing paint that is used for marking of roads in Kraków, Poland. To simulate possible environmental benefits of using alternative materials, analysis was then extended to model paint without aromatic solvent and a <b>waterborne</b> <b>paint.</b> Ozone formation potential of the road marking paint currently used as standard in Kraków was calculated {{to be more than}} twice the amount of VOCs it emits: 240 kg of solvents evaporating from one tonne of paint might cause formation of over 550 kg of ozone – in Kraków that means up to 42 tonnes of tropospheric ozone annually. Elimination of the aromatic solvent would not lead to lesser VOC emissions, but decrease ozone production capability by about 50 %. Further reductions could be realised with <b>waterborne</b> <b>paint</b> – VOC emissions lowered by 79 % and potentially formed ozone reduced by up to 93 %. A cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) performed on the three analysed paints demonstrated that durability is the main environmental impact factor. Assuming service life achieved at our test field, where modern waterborne paints applied at 600 μm wet film and reflectorised with properly selected high-performance glass beads complied with the specification for two years, they definitely are more sustainable choices as compared to solventborne materials.

Therefore, the binders used in the formulations of the paints included organic types (styrene acrylate) and inorganic types (silicones and silicates) in different mixtures.

Recent benchmark data for validating 1 -D HAM simulation models proposed in international projects are based on numerical and analytical data, while well-documented and accurate data are scarce. In IEA Annex 41 new numerical models have been implemented and used to simulate the HAM interaction between indoor air and hygroscopic materials during transient changes in indoor humidity due to internal moisture gains.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that modern artists use many types of paint in their work, and they {{frequently}} experiment with products outside of those sold by art supply retailers. As a result, museums acquire paintings that are highly variable in composition.

For this study, a selection of white paints commonly used in the United Kingdom was prepared for chemical and mechanical analysis. The aim was to identify their compositions and relate this information to their respective mechanical properties. Several materials were included in the analysis: an artists' emulsion, household (matte, eggshell, silk) emulsions, an artists' alkyd, household alkyds, a traditional oil, and a water-mixable oil.

Different (model) biocides were incorporated in a biocide/nano-clay composite and subsequently the release of the biocides was monitored under different environmental conditions. In addition, the biocide/clay material was formulated into a model finishing material (gypsum) to evaluate the antifungal activity. Intercalation of biocides in modified nano-clays was found to significantly prolong the release of the biocide and prevent premature leaching of the biocide from the building material. Release rate of the biocide could be tuned by selection of the type of modification used for the nano-clay platelets. Even after prolonged leaching up to 45 days in artificial rain tests, gypsum samples containing biocide/clay composites did not show any fungal growth, whereas gypsum samples containing pure biocide had lost their antifungal activity after exposure to artificial rain for 7 days or more, demonstrating the potential of this technology for practical applications. The presented approach is very versatile, and may be used for a large variety of biocides and is envisioned to be applicable to different construction and finishing materials, including <b>waterborne</b> <b>paints.</b> To optimize the performance in a specific application area, the leaching or release process of the nano-clays should be known in the different application materials, and consequently requires alternative testing methods, e. g. methods which characterize the fungal growth as a function of release in more detail. Although correlation with practice requires further investigation, the presented method gives a good first indication for prolonged protection of building materials. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.

Waterborne coatings are sensitive to humidity, thus, their barrier properties with respect to permeation of moisture needs to be determined.

40|$|The {{contamination}} {{of air and}} water {{is one of the}} major concerns towards the development of a sustainable world in the 21 st century. In this context many efforts are devoted to the design of photocatalytic paints able to degrade chemical and biological impurities present in air and water. In this work, the photocatalytic activity of hybrid films formed from the blends of pure acrylic or core/shell fluorinated/acrylic waterborne dispersions and photocatalytic titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticle dispersions was first assessed. The films show photocatalytic activity (inactivation of the Escherichia coli bacteria under UV irradiation) at the substrate-film interface, but very reduced activity in the air-film interface due to the substantially lower amount of the TiO 2 nanoparticles in the vicinity of this interface. In a second step, the fluorinated/(meth) acrylic core-shell hybrid dispersions were used as binders in the formulation of <b>waterborne</b> photocatalytic <b>paints</b> and the stability of the paints, in terms of gloss retain and color change, was assessed during 5000 hours of accelerated weathering tests (QUV-B). Although a decrease in gloss retention and increased color change occurs during the first 1000 hours of exposure, no further change of these properties takes place, which is an excellent indication of stable photocatalytic paints...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the more}} serious issues facing today’s global {{community}} is preservation of the environment. A major part of this preservation effort is limiting the amount of contaminates introduced {{into the air and}} water of the planet. The paint industry shares these concerns and {{over the past two decades}} has made much progress in bringing more environmentally friendly products to the marketplace (Chatta 1980; Padget 1993; Nabauurs et al. 1996; Bhabe and Athawale 1997). Of prime concern has been the removal or reduction of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in paint and coatings formulations, as these substances can contribute to air pollution. Approaches to limiting VOC content have included the introduction of very high solids (> 75 %) liquid coatings, powder or “solventless ” coatings, and <b>waterborne</b> (latex) <b>paints</b> and coatings. In this report we will concentrate on very high solids types of coatings. Very high solids coatings can be achieved by using low molecular weight polymers which are soluble in high concentration in the chosen solvent. The resulting solution must have a viscosity in the appropriate range for the desired end use of the coating. Another approach to very high solids coating formulations is the use of reactive materials as solvents. Such materials become part of the polymeric film left behind when the coating dries or cures and does not contribute to VOC. Utilization of this approach yields formulations that are nearly solvent free. In order to be used as a reactive solvent a molecule must have at least one and preferably two or mor...|$|R
40|$|The {{emissions}} from Þve commonly used building products were studied in small-scale test chambers {{over a period}} of 50 days. The odor intensity was assessed by a sensory panel and the concentrations of selected volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of concern for the indoor air quality were measured. The building products were three ßoor coverings: PVC, ßoor varnish on beechwood parquet and nylon carpet on a latex foam backing; an acrylic sealant, and a <b>waterborne</b> wall <b>paint</b> on gypsum board. The impacts of the VOC concentration in the air and the air velocity over the building products on the odor intensity and on the emission rate of VOCs were studied. The emission from each building product was studied under two or three di⁄erent area-speciÞc ventilation rates, i. e. di⁄erent ratios of ventilation rate of the test chamber and building product area in the test chamber. The air velocity over the building product samples was adjusted to di⁄erent levels between 0. 1 and 0. 3 m s~ 1. The origin of the emitted VOCs was assessed in order to distinguish between primary and secondary emissions. The results show that it is reasonable after an initial period of up to 14 days to consider the emission rate of VOCs of primary origin from most building products as being independent of the concentration and of the air velocity. However, if the building product surface is sensitive to oxidative degradation, increased air velocity may result in increased secondary emissions. The odor intensity of the {{emissions from}} the building products only decayed modestly over time. Consequently, it is recommended to use building products which have a lo...|$|R
40|$|Moisture level inside {{buildings}} is a {{key factor}} influencing the durability of construction, indoor air quality, thermal comfort and energy performance. Numerical simulation {{can be used to}} predict the hygric inertia of a room, but reliable material data are needed as inputs for the model. Although the advancement of numerical models for whole building HAM (Heat Air and Moisture) transfer, a general need for more experimental data able to quantify the hygroscopic performance of porous building material remains. Recent benchmark data for validating 1 -D HAM simulation models proposed in international projects are based on numerical and analytical data, while well-documented and accurate data are scarce. In IEA Annex 41 new numerical models have been implemented and used to simulate the HAM interaction between indoor air and hygroscopic materials during transient changes in indoor humidity due to internal moisture gains. Some experimental data obtained in dynamic humidity regime are presented in this study. The goal is to validate models that represent the moisture buffering of hygroscopic materials in contact with indoor air. In order to fit the experimental data with numerical simulation and to determine the most influencing hygroscopic material properties in HAM modeling, a sensitivity analysis on the numerical fitting of measured properties relevant for indoor moisture buffering, such as the water vapour permeability and the sorption isotherm was carried out. Material data have been monitored using a climate chamber device especially designed for this purpose. In Italian buildings, especially dwellings, walls are very often plastered with gypsum plaster for levelling purposes. The gypsum plaster is generally covered with <b>waterborne</b> wall <b>paint</b> for decoration which represents a barrier for the water absorption or desorption. In order to assess the hygric performance of a room in real conditions, the influence of the water transfer properties of the painted gypsum on the whole building HAM dynamic simulation is assessed considering both an uncoated and a coated room using a waterborne pain...|$|R
