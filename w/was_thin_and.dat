500|$|Philitas of Cos ( [...] ; , Philītas ho Kōos; [...] – [...] ), {{sometimes}} spelled Philetas ( [...] ; , Philētas; see Bibliography below), was {{a scholar}} and poet {{during the early}} Hellenistic period of ancient Greece. A Greek associated with Alexandria, he flourished {{in the second half}} of the 4th centuryBC and was appointed tutor to the heir to the throne of Ptolemaic Egypt. He <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> <b>and</b> frail; Athenaeus later caricatured him as an academic so consumed by his studies that he wasted away and died.|$|E
500|$|Philitas <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> <b>and</b> frail, and {{may have}} {{suffered}} and died from a wasting disease. He seems to have died in Cos sometime in the 280sBC. His pupil Hermesianax wrote that a statue of him was erected under a plane tree {{by the people of}} Cos, depicting him as [...] "frail with all the glosses". His contemporary Posidippus wrote that Philadelphus commissioned a bronze of Philitas in old age from the sculptor Hecataeus, which [...] "included nothing from the physique of heroes. No,... he cast the old man full of cares." [...] The 3rd centuryAD Roman author Aelian skeptically passed along a story that Philitas was so thin that he put lead weights in the soles of his shoes to avoid being blown away by a stiff wind.|$|E
500|$|Despite William Plomer's {{original}} {{thought about}} the state of the manuscript, editors Jonathan Cape were concerned enough about the story to pass the manuscript to Kingsley Amis to read on holiday, paying him £35/15 shillings for his thoughts and advice, although Amis' subsequent suggestions were not used by Cape. Cape had taken the step because they thought the novel <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> <b>and</b> [...] "feeble". Raymond Benson has noted that the thinness comes from a lack of the rich detail and descriptions which are normally present in Fleming's work, but which are missing from The Man with the Golden Gun; Benson suggests that these details were normally worked into the second draft by Fleming, but their absence shows that no such additional work was done on this occasion. The Man with the Golden Gun was published posthumously, eight months after its author's death.|$|E

The fuselage had twin vertical stabilizers to increase lateral stability. The power plant of the Z-1 {{was to have}} been the Daimler-Benz DB 601 but, owing to shortages from priority allocation for Bf 109E and Bf 110 fighter production, it was allocated Bramo 323 A-1 power plants. The Bramos could only reach 352km/h (220mph) at 1,070 m (3,500ft). The limited performance of the Bramo 323s ensured the Do 17 could not reach 416km/h (260mph) at 3,960 m (13,000ft) in level flight when fully loaded. The range of the Do 17Z-1 at ground level was this increased to 1,370km (850nm) at 4,700 m (15,500ft).

500|$|Critical {{reception}} for the episode was generally negative. MTV writer Josh Wigler noted the week's Fringe case for [...] "delivering an absolutely grotesque {{mystery of the}} week — even if the actual plot surrounding the worms <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> <b>and</b> unimportant in the long run". He believed {{the best part of}} the episode was John Noble's performance, as [...] "he kills you with laughter just as easily as he kills you with tears," [...] but disliked the focus on Astrid, believing the focus would have been better spent on Olivia. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called the case [...] "pretty X-Files-ish" [...] and Walter's storyline [...] "the true heart of the hour." [...] Other critics also spotlighted Noble's acting. AOL TV's Jane Boursaw believed the worms were [...] "seriously freaky" [...] and the opening scene [...] "cringe"-worthy. Writing for the magazine New York, critic Tim Grierson called the focus on Walter the episode's best moments, but wrote that after the audience [...] "adjusted to the ew factor, the plot wasn't all that interesting. The story line about rich, ailing Americans paying Chinese gangsters for miracle cures appeared to be a ripped-from-the-headlines commentary on hot-button issues like human trafficking and illegal immigration, but the execution just seemed silly." ...|$|E
500|$|In Virginia, Bret {{produced}} relatively light rainfall, peaking at [...] in Big Meadows, {{a section}} of Shenandoah National Park. At the time of Bret's landfall, portions of the Mid-Atlantic states were experiencing a strong drought, though the amounts of precipitation were not enough for farmers in Virginia to save their crops. In Virginia Beach, local street flooding and a brief tornado were reported. Minor beach erosion occurred in the area due to tides reaching about [...] above normal. One fatality was confirmed in North Carolina when a woman was killed after getting stuck in rip currents at Nags Head. Offshore, two boats lost contact with the Coast Guard during the approach to land, one of which washed up at Cape May, New Jersey {{and the other on}} the Virginia coast.

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} negative. GameSpot writer Jeff Sengstack said the {{expensive}} budget and long production history [...] "do not necessarily translate into high quality gaming". He complimented the graphics and music, but considered [...] " [...] generally unchallenging, the characters weak, the violence over-the-top, and the script just lame". Mike Hall of the Albuquerque Journal compared Phantasmagoria to big-budget films with multimillion-dollar budgets and multiple production delays that ultimately failed, like Cleopatra and Waterworld. He said the graphics were beautiful, {{but the game}} ended too quickly, the plot <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> <b>and</b> the puzzles were too easy to solve. The Escapist writer Brendan Main said the game fell short of its ambition to change how gamers experienced horror media, and the juxtaposition of real-life actors on settings that were [...] "ordinary, pixilated fare" [...] was [...] "odd and unflattering". A one-star review in The Video Games Guide, published in 2013, [...] "now seems {{little more than a}} flawed, though ambitious, white elephant". In a 2014 review, IGN writer Kosta Andreadis said the game's special effects were still effective, and that Phantasmagoria wisely builds suspense and saves the violent content {{for the end of the}} game. But he said it was ultimately [...] "less a bad game than a bad horror film" [...] and said the execution, [...] "although technically interesting, is extremely goofy, full of ludicrous situations, weird plot turns, bizarre dialogue, and dated costume choices".|$|E

This [...] "Proto-Moomin," [...] then called Snork or Niisku, <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> <b>and</b> ugly, with a long, narrow nose and devilish tail. Jansson said that she had designed the Moomins in her youth: after she lost a philosophical quarrel about Immanuel Kant with one of her brothers, she drew [...] "the ugliest creature imaginable" [...] on the wall of their outhouse and wrote under it [...] "Kant". This Moomin later gained weight and a more pleasant appearance, but in the first Moomin book The Moomins and the Great Flood (originally Småtrollen och den stora översvämningen), the Immanuel-Kant-Moomin is still perceptible. The name [...] "Moomin" [...] comes from Tove Jansson's uncle, Einar Hammarsten: when she was studying in Stockholm and living with her Swedish relatives, her uncle tried to stop her pilfering food by telling her that a [...] "Moomintroll" [...] lived in the kitchen closet and breathed cold air down people's necks.|$|E
2500|$|The German pillboxes at Bellevue {{were able}} to fire on the 198th Brigade, because the attack by the 148th Brigade {{on the right of}} the 49th Division stalled in the swamp astride the Ravebeek and only a few parties managed to get across. The {{creeping}} barrage <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> <b>and</b> moved at [...] in six minutes, which proved too fast for the infantry. The barrage was lost on the right flank, at the marshy edges of the Stroombeek and German riflemen and machine-gunners fired through the British barrage, particularly from Bellevue and the Yetta Slopes. [...] "Peter Pan" [...] on the left was captured by the 146th Brigade and by [...] the first objective (red line) had been reached. An attempt by following waves to leap-frog through the troops on the red line failed, due to the volume of fire from the Bellevue pillboxes. One attack got to within [...] of Bellevue and a later attempt at a flanking attack was stopped by machine-gun fire. The attack on the Yetta Houses, was also raked by machine-gun fire and on the left stopped [...] short of the objective.|$|E
2500|$|The Americans went an undefeated 8–0 and {{averaged}} 116 points per game, winning {{by an average}} margin of 32.1 points—the fifth highest in US Olympic history. Team USA trailed {{in the fourth quarter}} only once, against Lithuania in the opening round. James became the leader of the team with Bryant—who would turn 34 in August 2012—stepping back. James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed. After winning the gold, Team USA coach Mike Krzyzewski said James [...] "is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now". Durant scored a United States Olympics record of 156 points in the tournament. He also made 34 three-point field goals, breaking the previous United States mark of 17; Anthony (23) also exceed the old record. Bryant was not in peak condition early, but he played himself into shape and was a key contributor in the final three games. While Chandler was the team's only true center—Davis <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> <b>and</b> had no professional experience—Krzyzewski also played Love, James or Anthony as Team USA's de facto center.

2500|$|Three {{principal}} volcanoes {{comprise the}} southern segment {{along with several}} smaller edifies. The largest and youngest principal volcano, Mount Garibaldi, is a dissected stratovolcano that began its formation 250,000years ago. This eruptive period built a broad composite cone made of dacite and breccia. Parts of this [...] "proto-Garibaldi" [...] or ancestral volcano are exposed on Garibaldi's lower northern and eastern flanks and on the upper [...] of Brohm Ridge. Around where Columnar Peak and possibly Glacier Pikes are now located, a series of coalescing dacite lava domes were constructed. During the ensuing long period of dormancy, the Cheekye River cut a deep valley into the cone's western flank that was later filled with a glacier. After reaching its maximum extent the Cheekye Glacier and Cordilleran Ice Sheet were covered with volcanic ash and fragmental debris from Garibaldi. This period of growth began with the eruption of the Atwell Peak plug dome about 13,000years ago from a ridge surrounded by the ice sheet. As the plug dome grew, massive sheets of broken lava crumbled as talus down its sides. Numerous Peléan pyroclastic flows accompanied these cooler avalanches, forming a [...] fragmental cone and an overall slope of 12to 15degrees. Some of the glacial ice was melted by the eruptions, forming a small lake against Brohm Ridge's southern arm. The volcanic sandstones seen today atop Brohm Ridge were created by ash settling in this lake. Glacial overlap was most significant on the west and somewhat to the south. Subsequent melting of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet and its component glaciers initiated a series of avalanches and mudflows on Garibaldi's western flank that moved {{nearly half of the}} original cone's volume into the Squamish Valley where it covers [...] to a thickness of about [...] Gaps left by melting ice caused minor to moderate cone distortion where the Cordilleran Ice Sheet <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> <b>and</b> major distortion where it was thick. The ice was thickest in and thus cone distortion was greatest over the buried Cheekye valley. Later volcanism occurred from Dalton Dome, which forms Garibaldi's western summit. Lava flows mantled the landslide headwall on Garibaldi's western flank. Around the same time, a voluminous dacite lava flow from Opal Cone travelled [...] down Ring Creek on Garibaldi's southeastern flank without encountering any residual glacial ice. These latest eruptions of Mount Garibaldi occurred in the early Holocene shortly after remains of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreated in regional valleys between 10,700and 9,300years ago.|$|E
