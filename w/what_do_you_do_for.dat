5000|$|Emmylou Harris {{covered the}} song on her 1977 album Luxury Liner, and Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard took the song to {{number one on}} the country charts in July 1983 on their duet album Pancho & Lefty. In the biopic Be Here To Love Me, Nelson states that when he asked Van Zandt what the song was about Van Zandt replied that he didnt know. Nelson also recalls how his album with Haggard was nearly {{completed}} but he felt they didnt have [...] "that blockbuster, you know, that one big song for a good single and a video, and my daughter Lana suggested that we listen to Pancho and Lefty. I had never heard it and Merle had never heard it." [...] Lana Nelson returned with a copy of the song and Nelson cut it immediately with his band {{in the middle of the}} night but had to retrieve a sleeping Haggard, who had retired to his bus hours earlier, to record his vocal part. Van Zandt appears in the video for the song playing one of the Mexican federales. [...] "It was real nice they invited me," [...] Van Zandt told Aretha Sills in 1994. [...] "They didn’t have to invite me and I made I think $100 dollars a day. I was the captain of the federales. And plus I got to ride a horse. I always like that. It took four and a half days and that video was four and a half minutes long...The money goes by a strange life, or elsewhere. I mean it doesn’t come to me. But money’s not the question. I would like if I could write a song that would somehow turn one five-year-old girl around to do right. Then I’ve done good. That’s what I care about." [...] The royalties would provide Van Zandt with some badly needed income, though by all accounts he remained impervious to the songs success. One story involving the song that Van Zandt loved to tell was when he got pulled over for speeding in Berkshire by two policeman, the first a blue-eyed Aryan type with a crew cut, and his partner a bronze, dark eyed Mexican. Although his drivers license was up-to-date, the inspection sticker had expired, and the bedraggled singer found himself in the back of the police cruiser. As Van Zandt recounted on Austin Pickers, [...] "We got stopped by these two policeman and...they said <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> a living?, and I said, Well, Im a songwriter, and they both kind of looked around like pitiful, pitiful, and so on to that I added, I wrote that song Pancho and Lefty. You ever heard that song Pancho and Lefty? I wrote that, and they looked back around and they looked at each other and started grinning..." [...] The policemen explained that their police-radio code names were Pancho and Lefty and they let Van Zandt off with a warning. The song is probably Van Zandts most recognizable and has become a staple for aspiring folksingers and country bar bands alike. Steve Earle told John Kruth in 2007, [...] "You wont find a song thats better written, that says more or impresses songwriters more." [...] In the film Be Here To Love Me, Kris Kristofferson recites the opening lines of the song - Livin on the road my friend was supposed to keep you free and clean, now you wear your skin like iron and your breaths as hard as kerosene - and then marvels, [...] "And I could think, That was me!" [...] Bob Dylan, whose album The Times They Are A-Changin had a major impact on Van Zandt, performed the song as a duet on television with Willie Nelson at Nelsons 60th birthday concert in 1993, which Andy Greene of Rolling Stone remembers as [...] "the highlight of the night".|$|E

(In this town you don’t have to explain which one.) The second part was more difficult: ‘‘ [...] . in environmental engineering. ’ ’ This led to the inevitable reply of ‘‘Oh really! Um [...] . what’s that?’’ It was a few decades ago that my reply would have been ‘‘sanitary engineer’ ’ making the ensuing explanation would have been somewhat easier. Sanitary engineers had a defined job of protecting human health and preventing the spread of disease by treating wastewater and producing potable water. But environmental problems expanded to encompass more than just clean water, and engineers took up the task of clean-ing up the environment. These increased responsibilities re-sulted in title changes from sanitary to environmental. For ex-environmental science’ ’ and ‘‘geoenvironmental engineering’’ at universities that already had civil and environmental engi-neering programs. At first, I felt that these programs were out to steal our title. Many of these programs went on to duplicate courses we already taught in our department, like ‘‘environ-mental chemistry’ ’ and ‘‘environmental microbiology. ’ ’ I as-sumed that since we were the first to change our name that we owned the word ‘‘environment. ’ ’ Then I thought some more. For example, did we similarly own chemistry or micro-biology in these course titles? Stewardship over the environment has expanded to a greater role than just civil and environmental engineers can be ex-pected to fill. There are now several programs in the United States that have the title ‘‘Chemical and Environmental En-gineering. ’ ’ These departments are particularly well poised to generate students that will tackle the translation of our process industry to a green-process industry.

But- I predict I will {{be clear}} {{tomorrow}} seein’ as which a cold front, with low strato-cumulus and swelling cumulonimbus passed, followed by a high broken condition of alto stratus (understand?) (I don’t) but anyhow {{it should be clear}} with the weather we had today it should have rained itself out. But let’s not talk about the weather, let’s talk about us. Well, I couldn’t get hold of the C. O. today, all the nowboats were being used for official business, so I had to stay on my side of the street. So I’m going to nail him on the line tomorrow morning. We still haven’t gotten any mail in, this is pitiful. I haven’t got any questions to answer, and there’s no news, so I guess I’ll just have to tell you how much I love you and miss you; - and gosh baby, that’s a job. Oh, one thing, we did wade to the movin’-pictures tonight. The local theater (as they call it) is equipped with the finest 16 mm projector available, the only thing is they can’t get any 16 mm (mm= millimeter) film, so we have to suffer through colossal productions of some two-bit company that frowns on knee length dresses. Tonight the might spectacle was “The Dancing Pirate”. The Dancing pirate was some (I can’t spell it) bent 4 -F who could dance about as well as Ricky. What a show. Oh well, there’s only 11 more days to go. The last class they had here in March fired exactly 400 rounds per pilot, and they’re all in combat now, I guess. It’s a fine thing. It takes them {{about a year and a}} half to teach you to fly the airplane, and then they expect you to learn the most important thing, that might mean your neck someday, in 17 days!

I love you my darling and miss you terribly. If I don’t see you this weekend I will Sunday the 1 st sometime. That will be Easter Sunday won’t it? I hope I can be with you then darling.

40|$|Contract farming- a safer option? CUE: For {{small-scale}} farmers, {{increasing their}} production of cash crops {{can be a}} big risk. For while food crops can be eaten, cash crops are only valuable if they can be sold, and sold for a good enough price to repay the costs of production, harvesting, packaging and transport. Millions of farmers remain at a subsistence level of production, because for them the risk of growing a crop that they cannot sell is too great. But some have found {{a way out of this}} poverty trap through contract farming. In Tanzania, for example, the Multi-flower company has made contracts with numerous small-scale farmers, who produce flower seeds for export to Holland. Lazarus Laiser spoke to Evaline Swai, a buyer for Multi-flower to find out whether contract farming had proved to be a successful way for their small-scale growers to cultivate and market a cash crop. Evaline begins by explaining what happens when a farmer applies to have a contract with the company. IN:		?The first one is the farmer ? OUT:		? We can?t buy your product? DUR?N	 4 ? 27 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: A secure market - one of the important benefits of contract farming. Transcript Swai	The first one is the farmer must have land, half an acre or one acre and so on. After ensuring that the farmer has land for any crops, we explain to them about flower seeds production, price, cultivating flower seeds, is it easy or difficult. All that information we give to our farmers, and later on some they agree to grow flower seeds. Laiser	Do you have anywhere to sign? Swai	Yes we have a contract, which we sign between the farmer and our company. Laiser	What happens if the supplier or the grower fails to supply the products to you? Swai	It is not normal to bring the stock seed and plant and not supply to our company. But if the weather problem is the one that can affect the supplier to supply the seeds, we can see ourselves. Because our field officer after delivering the flower seeds to our grower, the job of the field officer is to follow that grower, in order to give him the lesson in how to grow, how to cultivate. So when our field officer visits that farm, he can know what problems are facing that farmer. But if it is farmer negligence, we come back to our contract. We can give him the information about ?<b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> our production? You will break your contract! So watch out! Do this and this!? But this problem has not occurred in our production contract. Laiser	Now is it easy for you to fail to buy the product from the grower? Swai	No, never. Because the contract shows everything: the quantity what we can expect from him, the price of that variety, maybe the month of harvesting, and so on. Everything is in our contract. So if we can refuse to purchase the product from our farmer, the contract is what he can use to stop us. Laiser	What can you say about the advantages and disadvantages of contract farming? Swai	First of all advantages, you cannot lose the market, your market is clear. Secondly you minimise your production costs. The stock seed you can receive without any payment, because we offer the stock seed to our growers free-of-charge. Also they can get how to plant from our field officers free-of-charge. Even if disease occurs on your farm you can call in the field officer from Multi-flower company, and he will come to give you advice. Thirdly, when you make a rotation for flower seeds with other crops, it is very good, because the land will be made fertile when you grow flower seeds. Laiser	Disadvantages? Swai	Maybe, maize and beans, the people watch the market. They can store the crops until the price is high, but the flower seeds you can?t. You have to harvest and sell it to the company immediately, for the same price. Laiser	What do you think about this way of farming? Do you think it is a very good way for the farmers, that they are benefiting too? Swai	Contract farming is very good because it is helping all the sides. For the company, to keep the farmer not selling to other companies. For the grower, the standard marketing - not for the price to be higher or lower, it will be standard; if it is 10, 000 per kilo it?s 10, 000 per kilo. Without a contract, maybe you can harvest 1000 kg of flower seeds, and the company tells you ?We can?t buy your product?. End of track. For subsistence farmers who want to start growing cash crops, the danger that they will not find a good market may be a strong disincentive. Contract farming may be one solution, as it guarantees that farmers will have a market.
