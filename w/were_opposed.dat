5|$|Activist groups {{interpreted}} {{his comments}} as warnings to President George W. Bush {{about the implications}} of nominating Supreme Court justices who <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> to the Roe v. Wade decision. Specter maintained that his comments were a prediction, not a warning. He met with many conservative Republican senators, and based on assurances he gave them, he was recommended for the Judiciary Committee's chairmanship in late 2004. He officially assumed that position when the 109th Congress convened on January 4, 2005.|$|E

5|$|Berkman {{eventually}} {{broke with}} Most and aligned {{himself with the}} autonomists. The autonomists, an anarchist group associated with Josef Peukert, emphasized individual freedom. They feared the domination of the anarchist movement by a single individual and opposed the establishment of anarchist organizations. Consequently, the autonomists <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> to Most. Soon, Berkman {{was working for the}} autonomists' publications, Der Anarchist and Die Autonomie, but he remained committed to the concept of violent action as a tool for inspiring revolutionary change.|$|E
5|$|Citizens in {{the south}} <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> to a {{centralised}} government, and to the decrees of its rule, which resulted in rebellion. Prior to the revolution France had been divided into provinces with local governments. In 1790 the government, the National Constituent Assembly, reorganised France into administrative departments in order to rebalance the uneven distribution of French wealth, which had been subject to feudalism under the monarchical Ancien Régime.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the promise}} of the design, many {{operational}} officers <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> to the use of volatile hydrogen peroxide aboard ship. Ultimately, the Mark 16 went into limited production while work on the Mark 17 was suspended in 1941, but resumed in 1944. Admiral Ernest King favored focusing research efforts on electric torpedoes so work on the oxygen system was downgraded. As such, the U.S. Navy made no combat use of the oxygen torpedo design during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Halfway {{through the}} year South Katanga was further divided into the provinces of Katanga Oriental and Lualaba (also known as the new South Katanga). Though they <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> to such divisions, many Katangese leaders from the secession joined the new provincial governments. A new {{constitutional}} commission was established, and in March 1964 it recommended that the Congo switch from its parliamentary system to a presidential model of government.|$|E
5|$|In November, Lyn {{stated that}} they wanted to {{purchases}} the shares in Ullevaal from NFF, who {{stated that they}} were now worth NOK10 million. NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares. NFF stated that they <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> to private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should be reflected in the share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOK4.4 million plus interest.|$|E
5|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, creatures known as Sarnathians ruled the Earth, {{centring}} their values on torture of other creatures that <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> to their rule. Their {{aim was to}} rule the universe using a mysterious orb that granted them great power. Thousands of years later, the orb became too powerful and eventually caused a tear in the inter-dimensional fabric of the Realm of Reality and the Realm of Unreality, thus rendering the Sarnathians extinct.|$|E

5|$|The Susan B. Anthony {{dollar is}} a United States dollar coin minted from 1979 to 1981, when {{the series was}} {{suspended}} due to poor public acceptance, and then again in 1999. Proposed as a smaller replacement for the cumbersome Eisenhower dollar, several shapes and compositions were tested, but all <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> by the vending machine industry, a powerful lobby affecting coin legislation. Finally, a round planchet with an eleven-sided inner border was chosen for the smaller dollar.|$|E
5|$|A CeSID poll in June 2015 {{conducted}} {{with the support of}} the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) indicated that only 12 percent of those polled supported for NATO membership, down from 25 percent in 2012, and 73 percent <b>were</b> <b>opposed.</b> The minor Liberal Democratic Party and Serbian Renewal Movement remain the most vocal political parties in favor of NATO membership. Although Serbia aspires to join the European Union, Serbia may seek to maintain military neutrality, joining neither NATO nor the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO).|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Rahman {{helped the}} British to retain Sudanese support during the First World War, when they <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> to the Turkish Empire, despite his being a Muslim leader. He lent his support again during {{a crisis in}} 1924 when there were anti-British riots in Egypt and the British Governor-General of the Sudan was assassinated. Meanwhile, he grew wealthy from cotton production, for which his {{supporters}} provided labor, and influential among the intelligentsia. The British administration distrusted him. When Governor General Sir Geoffrey Archer paid a formal and friendly visit to Abd al-Rahman in March 1926, Archer was dismissed and Abd al-Rahman was placed under travel restriction.|$|E

5|$|After the siege, Maltese {{military}} engineer Girolamo Cassar drew up {{plans to}} reduce Mdina's size by half {{and turning it}} into a fortress, but these were never implemented due to protests by the city's nobles. The city's main gate was reconstructed in the early 17th century, but the next major alterations were not made until the 1650s, when the large De Redin Bastion was built at the centre of the land front. Despite these modifications, by 1658 there were also proposals to abandon or demolish the entire fortress due to its state of disrepair, although these plans <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> by the locals. In the late 17th century, some of Mdina's medieval double walls began to be encased in sloping ramparts.|$|E
5|$|After {{these talks}} with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna {{to present the}} {{proposed}} concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It {{soon became clear that}} opinion was split: most of the younger izinDuna <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> to the idea of any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, {{but there was also a}} case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the last}} male {{member of the}} House of Árpád, Andrew was elected king {{after the death of}} King Ladislaus IV in 1290. He was the first Hungarian monarch to issue a {{coronation}} diploma confirming the privileges of the noblemen and the clergy. At least three pretenders—Albert of Austria, Mary of Hungary, and an adventurer—challenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew's maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> to his rule.|$|E

5|$|Despite Germany's reorganization, their {{manpower}} {{was still}} incomparable {{to that of}} the Western Allies. While Germany's Army Group B was able to increase their armored strength from 100 to 239 vehicles, these <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> by 2,300 Allied tanks. Field Marshal Model reported that only 6,500 replacements had been sent to cover the 75,000 casualties suffered during the month of September. General Eisenhower commanded three army groups, totaling eight field armies with 55 divisions; these provided a two-to-one advantage in artillery guns and a twenty-to-one advantage in tanks, and could count on almost 14,000 combat aircraft, as compared to the Luftwaffe's 573.|$|E
5|$|Elections {{were held}} in early October from which all {{political}} parties were barred from participating. Castillo Armas was the only candidate; he won the election with 99% of the vote, completing his transition into power. Castillo Armas became affiliated with a party named the Movimiento de Liberación Nacional (MLN), which remained the ruling party of Guatemala from 1954 to 1957. It was led by Mario Sandoval Alarcón, and was a coalition of municipal politicians, bureaucrats, coffee planters, {{and members of the}} military, all of whom <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> to the reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution. In the congressional elections held under Castillo Armas, it was the only party allowed to run.|$|E
5|$|Home Rule was the {{key issue}} in British {{politics}} in the late 1880s. The debate revolved around granting Ireland more powers to govern themselves. William Ewart Gladstone, the Liberal Prime Minister, proposed the First Home Rule Bill in April 1886, aiming to devolve power to Ireland. The Conservatives <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> to the Bill, and were joined {{by a number of}} Liberal members in defeating the Bill. This caused a split in the Liberal party, the creation of the Liberal Unionist Party, and a fresh general election, just a year after the last. At the 1886 general election, the Conservatives entered government with Lord Salibsury as Prime Minister. They formed a majority with the Liberal Unionists.|$|E
