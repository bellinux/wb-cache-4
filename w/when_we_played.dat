It was a crowd favourite, with Ray Davies later claiming to feel a connection with the crowd as he performed the song.

500|$|In May 1912 Diaghilev's company {{returned}} to Paris. Monteux was the conductor {{for the two}} outstanding works of the season, Vaslav Nijinsky's ballet version of Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune, made with the composer's approval, and Fokine's Daphnis et Chloé to a score commissioned from Ravel. Monteux later recalled [...] "Debussy was behind me <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> L'après midi d'un faune {{because he did not}} want anything in his score to be changed on account of the dancing. And when we came to a forte, he said 'Monteux, that is a forte, play forte'. He did not want anything shimmering. And he wanted everything exactly in time".|$|E

500|$|Novelist Salman Rushdie {{joined the}} band {{on stage in}} London's Wembley Stadium on 11 August 1993, despite the death fatwā against the author {{and the risk of}} {{violence}} arising from his controversial novel The Satanic Verses. In reference to the novel's satanic references, Rushdie, when confronted by Bono's MacPhisto character, observed that [...] "real devils don't wear horns". In 2010, Clayton recalled that [...] "Bono had been calling Salman Rushdie from the stage every night on the Zoo TV tour. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> Wembley, Salman showed up in person and the stadium erupted. You [...] tell from Larry's face that we weren't expecting it. Salman was a regular visitor after that. He had a backstage pass and he used it as often as possible. For a man {{who was supposed to be}} in hiding, it was remarkably easy to see him around the place." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} Milan players {{who had played}} in the 2005 final were delighted with the victory after they lost two years previous. Kaká claimed victory was all the sweeter as a result: [...] "What {{happened}} then was strange, just six minutes <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> not so good and we paid for that." [...] Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso echoed his teammates sentiments: [...] "The defeat two years ago will stay me for a lifetime, {{but this is a}} different story. It's our turn to celebrate now." [...] Striker Filippo Inzaghi, who missed the final in 2005, was delighted to have scored the goals that won the final for Milan: [...] "I've scored quite a few times in Europe, but scoring in the Champions League final is something special." [...] Milan President and owner Silvio Berlusconi was equally delighted about the success, adding that [...] "the fortune we lacked in Istanbul we had with us tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pour Me", {{the last}} soft {{song on the}} album, is a dark ballad that has been often {{compared}} to Eminem's [...] "Stan". Johnny3Tears stated that, [...] "We were messing around with chord progressions and that came out like a more major chord style than we were used to it. It's melodic and poppy sounding. We're talking about drinking obviously because all of us sometimes drink too much. It's one of those basic every day things that people go through but they don't know how to voice it or others around them don't know to voice it. It's almost like you're looked down upon, but no one actually talks about it." [...] "Tendencies", which is the closing track for the standard edition of the album, is a high tempo alternative metal song about murder. Johnny3Tears said, [...] "When we wrote Tendencies, I {{wanted to make a}} song that kids would just go nuts to <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> it. Kids start moshpits at our shows. Not every song we have is the best mosh song, so I wanted to make a song kids could go crazy for." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the match, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier {{claimed he}} had a premonition that goalkeeper Dudek would be {{the hero of the}} final: [...] "I told Jerzy three days ago 'I can feel you will be the hero. You were too unlucky <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> them, today he was man of the match. But {{football}} can be like that. Sometimes you can be at the bottom and then be a hero again. I just had a feeling. I'm a great believer that when you have the right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he made some mistakes and we had to support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games and we had to keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|E
500|$|Springsteen and {{the band}} {{returned}} to the U.S. to make their first-ever appearance at the Bonnaroo Music Festival, as the headlining act on June 13, 2009. Playing before festival audiences who were not guaranteed to be fans of his music was largely new to Springsteen, but after a slow start the show captured {{over most of the}} Bonnaroo audience. [...] The following night, Springsteen joined the recently reunited and headlining Phish for three songs, [...] "Mustang Sally", [...] "Bobby Jean", and [...] "Glory Days". [...] Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio said later, [...] "I got to play with Bruce. That's my hero." [...] The Bonnaroo performance of [...] "Outlaw Pete" [...] was included on a Fuse TV show of festival highlights, and the performance of [...] "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" [...] included a bit with Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog singing along that was included on a Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien segment. [...] Springsteen subsequently reflected, [...] "We played festivals {{for the very first time}} on this tour, and that was one of the greatest experiences of all of them. That was an eye-opener. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> Glastonbury [...] you come out and there's like 100,000 kids in their 20s and under. It was fun playing on bills with other bands, and it's something I'd do again in the future." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} nine {{seasons with}} Cleveland, Doby was traded on October 25, 1955, to the Chicago White Sox for Chico Carrasquel and Jim Busby. Chicago {{was looking for}} a consistent home run hitter after finishing the season with 116 home runs as a team. [...] "The search is over for a long ball hitter. We've certainly needed a consistent one—and we've been eying Doby for some time", said White Sox vice president Chuck Comiskey. White Sox manager Marty Marion believed Doby's bat would be a welcome addition to his club when he said, [...] "The guy used to murder us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> Cleveland. He'll {{make a big difference in}} the number of one-run and two-run decisions we might lose." [...] After winning a doubleheader against the Yankees on June 22, 1956, Doby and the White Sox swept New York, the first time since the 1945 season the Yankees had been swept in a four-game series. The White Sox won eight straight games, the longest winning streak in the AL to that point in the season, and had done so with the help of Doby's six home runs during the eight-game stretch. [...] "You know, when we dealt for Doby, we weren't worried about Larry. We knew he'd come through", Comiskey said. Doby finished the season with a [...]268 batting average and led the team with 24 home runs and 102 RBIs. Chicago finished 1956 in third place in the AL with an 85–69 record.|$|E

And they were the best two months ever man!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The show {{features}} a laugh track, something Ullman was hesitant about using. [...] "That's a very BBC thing to do. I hate {{things like that}} on a show. But <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> it, it kind of worked. It makes it sound like you're connecting with people. Comedy has gotten a bit cold lately, and neurotic and depressed. This is a nice BBC One family show. It's not too arch or bleak." [...] All laughter is genuine and was captured via live screenings before a studio audience at BBC Radio Theatre.|$|E
2500|$|When the University of Washington {{claimed to}} be the {{football}} champions of the Northwest, Rheinschild, whose team played Washington to a tie, disputed the claim and challenged them to a rematch in Pullman. [...] Rheinschild added, [...] "Can Washington lay claim to the championship over W.S.C. <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> them to a standstill on their own grounds, held them to a 6 to 6 score and were outplaying them in the last 10 minutes of the game, so that nothing but the expiration of time prevented us from scoring a touchdown?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Early in his cricketing career Matthews was {{regarded}} [...] "as a bowler who fielded energetically and could bat a bit" [...] and a [...] "complete extrovert, dressing to shock". He was usually {{referred to as}} Greg, but his teammates [...] nicknamed him 'Mo', [...] "short for 'misère', which he always called <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> five hundred". Matthews enjoyed clubbing and ignored the midnight curfew imposed by New South Wales fast bowler Geoff Lawson as [...] "these were his socialising hours and the time he came to life", and his mantra was [...] "'live each day as if it's your last'".|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} issued in the United Kingdom in October 1970, where its sales were {{enhanced}} {{by the success of}} the [...] "Paranoid" [...] single. [...] "That single attracted screaming kids", Iommi recalled in the liner notes to Reunion in 1998. [...] "We saw people dancing <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> it and we decided that we shouldn't do singles for a long while after that to stay true to the fans who'd liked us before we'd become popular." [...] Paranoid US release was delayed until January 1971, as the Black Sabbath album was still on the charts {{at the time of its}} UK release. Paranoid reached No.12 in the US in March 1971 with virtually no radio airplay.|$|E
2500|$|Bret Harris, {{author of}} Ella, Ella, Ella, criticised Campese's {{positional}} play at full-back, and praised New Zealand's backs, in particular All Black centre Steve Pokere, for their tactical kicking. In My Game Your Game Campese defended his 'general play', but highlighted this Test as his 'first bitter experience' playing rugby union at Test match level: [...] "My first bitter experience was in 1983, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> the All Blacks at the Sydney Cricket Ground in a one-off Bledisloe Cup game. My general play was fine, {{but we had}} gone into the game without a recognised goal-kicker. Our regular fullback Roger Gould was injured and yours truly was given the job. None out of four was the end result and the All Blacks won the Test 18–8, despite Australia scoring two tries to one. The press had a great time with that one." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Attack" [...] {{had been}} around for a while and the band was unconvinced of its worth. The song proved to be {{somewhat}} problematic, and was nearly excluded from the album. During an interview in 2005, Jared Leto said [...] "'Attack' was a song that wasn't scheduled to be recorded at all. I'd been playing it – I'd play it in the desert in Morocco, I was playing it in Thailand – I was playing it everywhere." [...] When Jared tried performing the song {{with the rest of the}} band, something was wrong. [...] "On acoustic it was great; but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> it as a band, it just fell flat on its face." [...] "As soon as the bass got in there…" [...] Matt Wachter continued. [...] "Yeah, so it was either replace Matt or throw the song out." [...] Jared played it acoustically for Josh Abraham; [...] "I was playing it outside of the studio one night on acoustic guitar and Josh walked out and, as a joke, I said 'Hey, you wanna hear a hit song?' I was just talking. I started playing the verse and went into the chorus and he stopped me on the first chorus and said 'It's the best song you have. You have to record it'. So we all got in a circle and something about it changed. Something about us changed. And it became the first song on the record and the first single off our album. So he did a great job on encouraging us to do that song. And now I really love it." [...] Jared told Josh Abraham that night [...] "This song deserves to be a hit just so we can tell this story." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 23, 2012, {{two days}} {{following}} the incident at the iHeartRadio Music Festival, Green Day announced that Armstrong was seeking treatment for an unspecified substance abuse problem. As a result, scheduled appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Ellen DeGeneres Show were canceled. According to Claudia Suarez Wright, Tre Cool's ex-wife {{and the mother of}} Armstrong's godson, Armstrong had been drinking heavily in Las Vegas prior to the iHeartMusic Festival, following approximately one year of sobriety. Armstrong gave an interview to Rolling Stone in March 2013 in which he admitted, [...] "I've been trying to get sober since 1997, right around Nimrod". Armstrong discussed how during the 21st Century Breakdown tour in 2009–2010, [...] "There were meltdowns on that tour that were huge". Armstrong detailed his addiction and in particular how it had escalated in the months prior to the release of the Trilogy albums and the performance at iHeart stating that during the summer while touring in Europe, [...] "I was at my pill-taking height at that time, medicating the shit out of myself". Armstrong gave details of a gig at Irving Plaza in New York just over a week before the iHeart incident he [...] "Threw back four or five beers before we went on and probably had four or five <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played.</b> Then I drank my body weight in alcohol after that. I ended up hungover on the West Side Highway, laying in a little park." [...] Green Day subsequently canceled all remaining concert dates for 2012 and early 2013 as Armstrong continued dealing with his personal problems. In late December, the band announced they would return to touring at the end of March. Armstrong later admitted that the substances he had been abusing were alcohol and prescription pills for anxiety and insomnia.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s the Athletics chant of {{the school}} (adapted by the Christian Brothers from their Australian schools) was urangabe, urangabe, urangabe uranga/Woolagalla, woolagalla, rumba/Flay them, beat them, yah mung do!/Christies, Christies, blue, gold, blue. One old boy, at SPC in the mid 1950s, has written that the Christian Brothers (being then [...] "Aussies") were not much {{interested}} in Rugby but {{were more interested in}} cricket, [...] "square-bashing" [...] and athletics. However, John Tamihere, at St Peter's in the 1970s, remembers the Christian Brothers (by then mostly Kiwi) being very enthusiastic about Rugby. He has written that if the Christian Brothers wanted a boy for the First XV, the boy didn't have much say in the matter. [...] "They would walk around the school grounds at lunchtime sizing up" [...] likely candidates to see if they might be any good. They picked out one boy because he looked usefully tall. [...] "I'd rather play soccer", the boy protested, [...] " ... but next minute there he was in the lineout, leaping." [...] Under such pressure, Tamihere played for the college First XV (in 1975 and 1976) although he would have preferred to play Rugby League for the Point Chevalier Pirates and later for the Glenora Bears as his brothers did. He said that the college First XV at that time was composed of [...] " ... not bad players", and they were [...] " ... always competitive". [...] "We didn't win a lot, {{but on the other hand}} we never really got hammered". [...] "St Peter's used to play St Kentigern's, who were led out onto the field by their pipe band. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> Anglican King's College there was no doubt this was a Catholic versus [...] "Proddy" [...] battle, though some of our toughest games were against other Catholic schools like St Paul's and Sacred Heart. If you think Māori society was tribal, you should have seen those Catholics". There is also strong traditional Rugby rivalry with other schools such as De La Salle College, Auckland Grammar School, Kelston Boys' High School, Mt Albert Grammar School and the North Shore school, Rosmini College (The Battle of the Bridge). An annual senior rugby fixture between Auckland Grammar and St Peter's (The Battle of the Overbridge) is played for the Henry Cooper-Br. Paddy Ryan Rugby Challenge Cup in memory of headmasters in office in 1962 when St Peter's beat Grammar for the first time. [...] Amongst the college's Rugby highlights was winning by the First XV of the New Zealand Secondary School's Top Four Championship and the Auckland Secondary Schools Premiership in 1987. [...] The latter feat was repeated in 1988. The college won the Auckland Championship and the New Zealand First XV Knock out competition undefeated in 2000. The college has held the Moascar Cup (national school 1st XV rugby honour) twice, in 1977 and 2000.|$|E
