5000|$|The {{conveyance}} {{took the}} form of the record of a fictitious lawsuit, compromised or terminated by the acknowledgment of the existing owner (known as the deforciant, impedient or tenant, depending on the original writ used to levy the fine) that the land in question was the rightful property of the claimant (the plaintiff, querent or demandant). In reality, the deforciant had already agreed to sell the land, and the plaintiff to buy it: the suit was, in other words, a collusive action between the two parties. In the most common means of levying a fine, the plaintiff would bring a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>covenant</b> alleging that he and the deforciant had entered into a covenant to transfer some real property, but the deforciant had not held up his end of the bargain. In all actions used to levy a fine, before the court could render judgment, and typically on the same day the writ was returned, the parties would seek leave of the court to compromise, and then compromise on terms where the deforciant admitted that the real property was the right of the plaintiff. [...] A fine was said to be [...] "levied".|$|E
50|$|Litigants {{began to}} turn from the praecipe <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>covenant</b> and debt to the ostensurus quare <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> trespass. By {{the middle of the}} 14th century the royal courts were {{recognising}} that a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> trespass would lie even without an allegation that the defendant had acted vi et armis contra pacem regis (with force and arms against the King's Peace). This action became known as trespass on the case.|$|R
50|$|Assumpsit ("he has undertaken", from Latin, assumere), or more fully, {{the action}} of assumpsit, {{was a form of}} action at common law.

5000|$|Courts began {{recording}} their proceedings in plea {{rolls and}} filing writs from their foundation {{at the end}} of the 12th century. Most files were kept by the Custos Brevium (established by 1246) but files <b>of</b> <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>covenant</b> were kept by the chirographer because of their association with feet of fines, which were kept separately by the chirographer (established by King John's reign).|$|R
5000|$|Over time, {{the royal}} courts {{began to take}} notice of other cases. These early writs were in the praecipe form: they {{commanded}} that the defendant perform a certain act or else appear and explain why he had not done so. Examples include the <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>covenant,</b> debt and account. Such writs demanded something as of right. The royal courts were initially only concerned with complaints of wrong if the wrong involved a forcible breach of the King's Peace. Such wrongs were enforced by a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> trespass vi et armis contra pacem regis. During the 14th century the royal courts gradually allowed actions which did not involve breaches of the King's Peace. Instead, the plaintiff would set out his 'special case' in an extra clause, specifying the damage sustained which justified the bringing of an action. This {{was known as a}} trespass on the case. From the trespass on the case developed many other forms of action. Apart from the actions which dealt with real property, other significant forms of action include: ...|$|R

50|$|The {{suit was}} brought for breach <b>of</b> <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> {{warranty}} of title to a tract of land in Kansas. Plaintiff in error was defendant below. Its title was derived from grants of public land {{to aid in the}} construction of a railway to the Pacific. The tract was within the location of the railroad grants, but was excepted from those grants by reason of a homestead entry and possession. Subsequent to this entry and possession, the party so in possession took title from the railroad company, and the homestead entry was cancelled. The alleged paramount adverse title was derived from a patent from the United States issued on a homestead entry made subsequent to these proceedings. The Supreme Court of Kansas found that there was a breach of the warranty, and rendered judgment accordingly. This <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> error was brought to review that judgment.|$|R
