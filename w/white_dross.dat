50|$|<b>White</b> <b>dross</b> from primary {{aluminium}} production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially. The process produces aluminium billets, together with a highly complex waste material. This waste is difficult to manage. It reacts with water, releasing a mixture of gases (including, among others, hydrogen, acetylene, and ammonia), which spontaneously ignites on contact with air; contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas. Despite these difficulties, the waste {{is used as a}} filler in asphalt and concrete.|$|E

The chemical composition was determined using the energy dispersive analysis (EDS) technique while the specific heat were measured isothermally using micro-reaction calorimeter (μRC) from 303. 15 K to 353. 15 K at an interval of 5 K. The molar specific heat is extrapolated to elevated temperatures from 363. 15 K to 1323. 2 K {{based on a}} linear model that is developed from the measured range and in house elemental specific heat model. Also, the thermal conductivity and enthalpy of the dross was predicted using the JMatPro software and the aluminum component phase change has been determined. The EDS shows that the composition of metallic aluminum found in the dross was high with the inclusion of other impurities and this metallic aluminum can still be further recycled in order to acquire considerable amount of aluminum in the secondary recovery process. The determined weight percentage of chemical composition of the aluminum dross consists of Al (42. 52 %); C (6. 09 %); O (22. 82 %); Mg (15. 54 %); Fe (10. 15 %); Nb (0. 51 %) and K (2. 37 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Aluminum <b>white</b> <b>dross</b> is a {{valuable}} material principally due to its high metallic aluminum content. The aim of this work {{is to develop a}} method for quantitative analysis of aluminum <b>white</b> <b>dross</b> with high accuracy.

The crystalline phases aluminum, corundum, spinel, defect spinel, diaoyudaoite, aluminum nitride, silicon and quartz low were identified by X-ray diffraction. The quantitative phase analysis was performed by fitting the X-ray diffraction profile with the Rietveld method using the GSAS software. The following quantitative results were found: 77. 8 % aluminum, 7. 3 % corundum, 2. 6 % spinel, 7. 6 % defect spinel, 1. 8 % diaoyudaoite, 2. 9 % aluminum nitride, and values not significant of quartz and silicon...|$|E
40|$|A borra branca Ã um resÃduo gerado durante a produÃÃo do alumÃnio, que contÃm Ãxidos que podem ser utilizados na indÃstria dos refratÃrios e cimentos. A borra de alumÃnio, se nÃo for inertizada, Ã perigosa para a saÃde humana e contaminante do meio ambiente. Neste trabalho, a borra de alumÃnio foi submetida a tratamento tÃrmico seguido de moagem e classificaÃÃo por peneiramento. Para melhorar as propriedades mecÃnicas das peÃas obtidas a partir da borra de alumÃnio, foram formuladas duas misturas com adiÃÃo de partÃculas de reforÃo inorgÃnicas eletrofundidas. Neste caso, a mulita do tipo TP- 325, com porcentagens variando entre 5 e 35 % e a outra com alumina do tipo AL-L 280 variando entre 20 e 30 % em peso, sendo comparadas com a borra pura (matriz cerÃmica). O resÃduo e as cargas inorgÃnicas foram caracterizados por fluorescÃncia de raios x difraÃÃo de raios x e anÃlise termogravimÃtrica. As misturas dos pÃs foram submetidas a prensagem uniaxial, utilizando uma pressÃo de compactaÃÃo de 30 MPa num molde em forma de barra e estas foram sinterizadas a 1400 ÂC com uma taxa de aquecimento de 5 ÂC/min, permanecendo nesta temperatura durante 2 horas. Em seguida determinaram- se as propriedades fÃsico-mecÃnicas tais como: retraÃÃo linear de queima, absorÃÃo de Ãgua, porosidade aparente, massa especÃfica aparente, tensÃo de ruptura Ã flexÃo em trÃs pontos e microscopia eletrÃnica de varredura. Os resultados obtidos indicam que a mistura com mulita eletrofundida a 15 %, promoveu um maior fechamento dos poros no material, causando assim um aumento na resistÃncia mecÃnica em relaÃÃo a mistura com alumina. A adiÃÃo desse reforÃo inorgÃnico Ã matriz cerÃmica (borra pura) demonstra um alto potencial de aplicaÃÃo como matÃria-prima para a indÃstria de materiais refratÃrios conformados. ABSTRACT <b>White</b> <b>dross</b> is a reject {{generated}} during aluminium production. It contains several oxides {{that can}} be useful to the refractories and cement industries. However, <b>white</b> <b>dross</b> can be hazardous both to {{human health and the}} environment. In this work, <b>white</b> <b>dross</b> was evaluated as a prospective raw material for the production of refractories. For this purpose, the dross was subjected to calcination followed by comminution and classification. In order to improve the mechanical properties of the refractory, two different kinds of electrofused particles were used separately as reinforcement: mullite and alumina. Particles of the TP- 325 mullite were added to the <b>white</b> <b>dross</b> powder in proportions varying from 5 to 35 % weight. The AL-L 280 alumina particles were added to another batch of refractories, in two different amounts (20 and 30 % wt.). All materials were characterized by X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. Mixtures of residual powder and particles were compression molded as prismatic bars under a pressure of 30 MPa. Pressed bars were sintered in air at 1400 ÂC for 2 h, and the heating rate was 5 ÂC/min. Mechanical and physical properties of the sintered parts were determined by means of linear shrinkage, water absorption, apparent porosity, density, MOR (three-point bending) and SEM analysis. The results obtained in this work indicate that the mixtures of <b>white</b> <b>dross</b> and 15 % mullite allowed for a better compaction and density, producing parts with higher mechanical strength than the mixtures with alumina. Pyrometric cone tests at 1400 ÂC show the refractoriness of the parts up to that temperature. Therefore, under the conditions of this research work, <b>white</b> <b>dross</b> with additions of mullite particles {{has proven to be a}} prospective candidate for the production of refractory parts...|$|E

40|$|Dross is the {{inevitable}} waste product {{generated by the}} world-wide primary and secondary aluminium industries. Around 3. 5 million tonnes of <b>white</b> <b>dross</b> and 0. 85 million tonnes of black dross are produced per year. Drosses are classified depending on metal content. <b>White</b> <b>dross</b> contains 40 % and black dross contains 10 % of aluminium. About half of the <b>white</b> <b>dross</b> is currently landfilled along with {{almost all of the}} black dross, and the annual cost to the UK industry of landfilling this waste is about £ 90 million per year. There is no commercially viable method of recovering the aluminium, which is potentially recyclable from these drosses, and no current conventional process has the custom-built capability to avoid their disposal to landfill. The practice of landfilling aluminium dross has raised problems for both industry and environment, because of potential leaching of heavy metals into groundwater from the landfill. The black dross has been physically and chemically characterised. The results show that the dross contains mostly metallic aluminium, aluminium nitride, alumina, sodium chloride, potassium chloride and silica with almost 50 % of the dross being a mixture of sodium chloride and potassium chloride. A counter current leaching process has been developed to recycle the salts back to the secondary furnace. The environmental impact of black dross has been investigated using simulated landfill conditions. Leachability studies were carried out using water, and other leach media to model the following conditions: humic acid-containing systems, acid rain (pH 2. 5), and acetic acid solutions (pH 5). Up to 60 % of the dross was leached out in all media with the production of the saline solution providing the major impact. Only small amounts of aluminium were leached out under all these condition. No leachability behaviour was detected once the black dross was washed. So landfilling washed black dross can minimise both environmental and economical problems. Black dross residue, after washing with water, is enriched with alumina. Added value chemicals (of > 95 % purity) including aluminium hydroxide, alumina, aluminium chloride, aluminium nitrate, aluminium sulphate and aluminium carboxylates have been prepared using the washed black dross. Preliminary calculations have shown that the technology developed to recycle black dross to added-value chemicals is economically viable. A methodology has been developed which enables low grade alumnium waste, black dross, to be treated, commercially viable chemicals to be prepared, reagent use to be minimised through recycle and the diversion of millions of tonnes of furnace residue from landfill.

40|$|Abstract. Brazil {{has one of}} the world’s most {{important}} Bauxite deposits, the raw material for the aluminium extraction metallurgy. This work is focused on finding a suitable application for the <b>white</b> <b>dross</b> residue (WDR), a second-generation waste material produced during the metal recovery from the slag left after the primary extraction of aluminium from the ore. A commercial lime-silica based glass frit was used, to which WDR additions were made (up to 30 wt. %), aimed at studying the devitrification process of the glasses produced. Such mixtures were melted at temperatures varying from 1100 to 1500 °C and the resulting fritted glasses were heat treated at 900 °C. The starting materials and the mixtures thereof were characterized before and after thermal treatment by differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction and fluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy. The results obtained showed that the WDR is easily incorporated into the glass matrix and causes easy devitrification after short heat treatment periods at low temperature...|$|E
