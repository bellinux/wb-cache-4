Afterwards, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife. Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament. Goebbels and Bormann {{were two of the}} witnesses.|$|E
5|$|In {{his foreign}} policy, Prime Minister Tătărescu {{balanced}} two different priorities, attempting {{to strengthen the}} traditional military alliance with Poland which was aimed at the Soviet Union, and reacting against the growing regional influence of Nazi Germany by maintaining the relevancy of the Little Entente and establishing further contacts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{election}} as president in 1960, Kennedy chose Cooper {{to conduct a}} then-secret mission to Moscow and New Delhi to assess {{the attitudes of the}} Soviet government for the new administration. Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship. On the mission, Cooper discovered that the Soviets disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally. Cooper concluded in his report to Kennedy that there was little potential for harmonious relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> After meeting with Secretary Khruschev, Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and confessed that he should have taken it even more seriously. Cooper supported Kennedy's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962, but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> if possible.|$|E
50|$|In foreign relations, the SRVN became {{increasingly}} aligned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union by joining the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), and signing a Friendship Pact, {{which was in}} fact a military alliance, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. Tension between Vietnam and China mounted along with China's rivalry <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and conflict erupted with Cambodia, China's ally. Vietnam was also subject to trade embargoes by the U.S. and its allies.|$|R
50|$|Vytautas Vasiliauskas (born October 21, 1930) is a Lithuanian {{citizen who}} was a {{collaborator}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Russian occupation regime and who worked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Ministry of State Security. He was convicted of genocide {{for his role in}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> murder of Lithuanian resistance fighters.|$|R

5|$|After the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet {{victory in the}} Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943), Goebbels began {{to recognize that the}} war could no longer be won. Following the Allied {{invasion of}} Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, either <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.|$|E
5|$|Chinese and North Vietnamese {{documents}} {{state that}} relations between them worsened in 1973–75. A Vietnamese document claimed that China hindered the eventual reunification, while Chinese documents {{claimed that the}} source of the conflict was Vietnamese policy towards the Spratly and the Paracel Islands. However, the core issue for the Chinese was to minimize Vietnam's cooperation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> Increasing Soviet/Vietnamese cooperation left China ambivalent about reunification.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943, the Polish government-in-exile led by Sikorski {{insisted on}} {{bringing}} {{the matter to}} the negotiation table <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> and on opening {{an investigation by the}} International Red Cross. Stalin, in response, accused the Polish government of collaborating with Nazi Germany and broke off diplomatic relations with it. The Soviet Union also started a campaign to get the Western Allies to recognize the pro-Soviet government-in-exile of the Union of Polish Patriots led by Wanda Wasilewska. Sikorski died in an air crash in July—an event that was convenient for the Allied leaders.|$|E

Latvia managed to sign a trade agreement with Germany in 1926 and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1927. Similarly, Lithuania signed a trade agreement with Germany in May 1926. Lithuania {{was the key to}} improved relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. In exchange for Soviet recognition of Lithuania's claim to Vilnius, the countries signed a non-aggression pact in September 1926.|$|R

5|$|Many Polish writers collaborated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> writing pro-Soviet propaganda. They {{included}} Jerzy Borejsza, Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, Kazimierz Brandys, Janina Broniewska, Jan Brzoza, Teodor Bujnicki, Leon Chwistek, Zuzanna Ginczanka, Halina Górska, Mieczysław Jastrun, Stefan Jędrychowski, Stanisław Jerzy Lec, Tadeusz Łopalewski, Juliusz Kleiner, Jan Kott, Jalu Kurek, Karol Kuryluk, Leopold Lewin, Anatol Mikułko, Jerzy Pański, Leon Pasternak, Julian Przyboś, Jerzy Putrament, Jerzy Rawicz, Adolf Rudnicki, Włodzimierz Słobodnik, Włodzimierz Sokorski, Elżbieta Szemplińska, Anatol Stern, Julian Stryjkowski, Lucjan Szenwald, Leopold Tyrmand, Wanda Wasilewska, Stanisław Wasilewski, Adam Ważyk, Aleksander Weintraub and Bruno Winawer.|$|E
5|$|Other Polish writers, however, {{rejected}} the Soviet persuasions and instead published underground: Jadwiga Czechowiczówna, Jerzy Hordyński, Jadwiga Gamska-Łempicka, Herminia Naglerowa, Beata Obertyńska, Ostap Ortwin, Tadeusz Peiper, Teodor Parnicki, Juliusz Petry. Some writers, such as Władysław Broniewski, after collaborating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> {{for a few}} months, joined the anti-Soviet opposition. Similarly, Aleksander Wat, initially sympathetic to communism, was arrested by the Soviet NKVD secret police and exiled to Kazakhstan.|$|E
5|$|The Underground State's {{military}} arm, Armia Krajowa, officially disbanded on 19 January 1945 {{to avoid}} armed conflict <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> and a civil war. Over {{the next few}} years the communists solidified their hold on Poland, falsifying elections, persecuting the opposition and eliminating it as a political power. Remnants of the armed resistance (NIE, Armed Forces Delegation for Poland, Freedom and Independence) that refused to lay down their weapons and surrender to the communist regime continued to hold out for several years as the cursed soldiers, fighting the Soviet-backed communist forces until eradicated.|$|E

5|$|With the {{situation}} in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning {{to take advantage of}} the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941. By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.|$|E
5|$|A {{pressing}} issue {{not resolved}} by Wilson {{was the question}} of policy towards Bolshevik Russia. The U.S. had been among the nations that had sent troops there after the Russian Revolution. Afterwards, Wilson refused to recognize the Russian SFSR. Under Harding, Commerce Secretary Hoover, with considerable experience of Russian affairs, took the lead on policy. When famine struck Russia in 1921, Hoover had the American Relief Administration, which he had headed, negotiate with the Russians to provide aid. Soviet leaders (the U.S.S.R. was established in 1922) hoped in vain that the agreement would lead to recognition. Hoover supported trade <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> fearing U.S. companies would be frozen out of the Soviet market, but Hughes opposed this, and the matter was not resolved under Harding's presidency.|$|E
5|$|Another {{meeting on}} the issue was called on 6 December 1966, {{attended}} by Johnson, McNamara, the deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, Walt Rostow of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Joint Chiefs. Rostow took {{the side of the}} JCS and it appeared that development would start. However, McNamara once again outlined the problems and stated that the simplest way to close the ABM gap was to simply build more ICBMs, rendering the Soviet system impotent and a great waste of money. He then proposed that the money sidelined by Congress for deployment be used for initial deployment studies while the US attempted to negotiate an arms limitation treaty. Johnson agreed with this compromise, and ordered Secretary of State Dean Rusk to open negotiations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{believed}} that Britain's refusal {{to end the}} war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later. He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> or failing that, to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and {{articles}} took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone. By the beginning of 1945, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> on the Oder River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the Rhine, he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable. Berlin had {{little in the way of}} fortifications or artillery (or even Volkssturm units, 'civilian soldiers'), as almost everything had been sent to the front. Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward. He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose the confidence of his Führer.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese {{forces in}} Manchukuo had {{sporadic}} border clashes with the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic. The Japanese doctrine of Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> this policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and Japan adopted {{the doctrine of}} Nanshin-ron, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the United States and the Western Allies.|$|E

25|$|One {{political}} theorist, James Blight, has {{analyzed the}} behavior of EXCOMM's members {{in the midst of}} <b>the</b> impending crisis <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. He suggests that the thought of war <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union instilled a sense of fear in the committee members so that their deliberations became more productive as they reacted to this emotion. Blight argues that EXCOMM's focus of attention shifted: as the possibility of war <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union became more probable, the committee members became less concerned <b>with</b> removing <b>the</b> missiles from Cuba and instead focused their energy on avoiding a nuclear war.|$|R

According to the official history of the ASTP, Lunney's performance during Apollo 13 and during the Soviet negotiations had recommended him to Chris Kraft, who was by then director of Johnson Space Center. In 1973, Lunney became manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, a position which gave him {{responsibility for the}} Apollo spacecraft used during Skylab missions, as well giving him more authority in his role as head of the ASTP.|$|E
5|$|The Polish Army {{pushed back}} {{and came in}} contact with the Lithuanians in the contested Suwałki Region. The {{diplomatic}} negotiations broke down. The Lithuanians claimed to be defending their borders, while Poland did not recognize the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty and claimed that the Lithuanians had no rights to these territories. Poland also accused the Lithuanians of collaborating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> and thus violating the declared neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. In the ensuing hostilities, the towns of Suwałki, Sejny, and Augustów changed hands frequently. The diplomatic struggle, both directly between the two states and in the League of Nations, intensified.|$|E

Petr Veliky was in Helsinki in March 1918 when the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their naval base at Helsinki or have their ships interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. The ship reached Kronstadt in April 1918 and was hulked on 21 May 1921.
