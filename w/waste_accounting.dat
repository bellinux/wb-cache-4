50|$|South Africa's mining {{industry}} {{is the largest}} single producer of solid <b>waste,</b> <b>accounting</b> for {{about two-thirds of the}} total waste stream. Tens of thousands of deaths have occurred among mine workers as a result of accidents over the last century. There have been several deaths and debilitating diseases from work-related illnesses like asbestosis. For those who live next to a mine, the quality of air and water is poor. Noise, dust, and dangerous equipment and vehicles can be threats to the safety of those who live next to a mine as well. These communities are often poor and black and have little choice over the placement of a mine near their homes. The National Party introduced a new Minerals Act that began to address environmental considerations by recognizing the health and safety concerns of workers and the need for land rehabilitation during and after mining operations. In 1993, the Act was amended to require each new mine to have an Environmental Management Program Report (EMPR) prepared before breaking ground. These EMPRs were intended to force mining companies to outline all the possible environmental impacts of the particular mining operation and to make provision for environmental management.|$|E

40|$|Aims: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the composition of dental waste coming from six dental health services in Isfahan, Iran. Materials and Methods: From 45 public dental clinics in Isfahan, six public dental health services were selected (three dental clinics and three dental centers). Waste collection took place from October to December 2011. During this period, three samples were collected from each dental clinic and were divided to pre-determined groups manually. Results: In dental centers, the amount of infectious, non-infectious and domestic-type <b>waste</b> <b>accounting</b> for 45. 07 %, 12. 15 % and 42. 78 %, respectively. Whereas in dental clinics the production rates of infectious, non-infectious and domestic-type <b>waste</b> <b>accounting</b> for 52. 2 %, 8. 58 % and 39. 22 %, respectively. Conclusion: Overall, according to the results it can be said that integration of infectious and hazardous waste with general waste leads to the amount of infectious waste appears much greater than it actually is. The collection and disposal of amalgam and other hazardous dental solid waste should be regulated as soon as possible and to decrease the costs of dental waste management the uncontaminated recyclable items, which contained approximately 33 % of total dental waste should be recycled or reused if possible...|$|E

Quantification of loss {{was based on}} weight or volume, consistent with direct measurement methods of the Food Loss and <b>Waste</b> <b>Accounting</b> and Reporting Standard 2016 and qualitative techniques were used to identify the drivers of the loss and contextualise the findings. Postharvest loss {{was found to be}} between 40. 3 % (55. 34 t) and 55. 9 % (29. 61 t) of the total harvestable product. It was determined that between 68. 6 % and 86. 7 % of undamaged, edible, harvested tomatoes were rejected as outgrades and consequently discarded due to product specifications. Between 71. 2 % and 84. 1 % of produced tomatoes were left in the field and not harvested. This study highlights significant factors contributing to high levels of food loss and waste. Edible products are being removed from the commercial food supply chain, rejected as outgrades deemed cosmetically defective due to market-based decisions. With only 44. 1 % and 59. 7 % of the harvestable crop reaching the consumers of the two supply chains, respectively, it is perhaps more appropriate to describe a food “waste” chain as opposed to a food “supply” chain...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the biggest}} and most serious issues faced by a nation due to the impacts of {{urbanization}} an population explosion is the rate of waste generation. Per capita generation in Peninsular Malaysia is approximately 1. 2 kg of municipal solid waste (MSW) everyday which amounts to 18, 000 tonnes. Application of various tools to determine the efficiency of a system has been very helpful in minimizing costs and optimizing a desired system. This study was conducted to design an integrated solid waste management system and to determine the best integrated technology in terms of efficiency, cost and performance. SWPlan software was utilized to determine the appropriate waste management approaches including waste reduction, recycling, composting, waste-to-energy conversion, landfill disposal and others. The software was able to determine the capital operating cost and management costs, by taking into consideration the possible revenues from alternate options of waste disposal. Among the options which were examined included refuse derived fuel (RDF) conversion, recycling activities and other by-products from waste treatment options such as composting. In order to evaluate the potentials of SWPlan, information on population density, waste composition and amount were defined according to data obtained from waste management studies conducted earlier. Results indicated that waste generated by communities in Selangor in particular and Malaysians in general composed of a high percentage of organic <b>waste,</b> <b>accounting</b> for approximately 46 % of the total tonnage. The option of composting, including yard waste composting and MSW composting were derived from the software application as it was found to offer the best system with the consideration of cost and energy efficiency. Findings also indicated the possibility of implementing RDF conversion to divert the waste stream which not only reduced the disposal cost but also generated significant amounts of revenue for waste managers. The other viable application is recycling. The application of SWPlan to MSW management in Malaysia optimized the economical aspects of the management and would reduce the existing environmental impacts due to improper waste disposal system currently practiced in the country...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} method for estimating the tonnage and composition of non-hazardous industrial waste (NHIW) flows in the United States. For thirty years, {{it has been an}} accepted fact that NHIW is generated at a rate of 6. 9 billion Mg per year, making it the largest waste flow in the country by more than an order of magnitude. However, this value was generated in 1985, has not been updated since, and is thought to account largely for the weight of dilute process water disposed in surface impoundments rather than solid waste generated by industry. To address this data gap, and lacking the resources to collect new, national-scale information, I propose an approach by which three independent estimates of NHIW generation based on existing data are used to corroborate each other at the industry sector level. The individual estimates are compared in triangulation so as to control for the errors, uncertainties and other validity concerns unique to each. The methods are: forecasting from historical waste accounts, modeling industrial materials flows to calculate lost mass, and up-scaling state-level data reported to the Pennsylvania Residual Waste Program. I apply the triangulation method to three industrial sectors for the year 2010, yielding estimates of (all in million Mg) 9. 7 - 14. 9 from pulp and paper, 21. 2 - 24. 7 from iron and steel, and 0. 96 - 1. 24 from petroleum refining. These values suggest that the total quantity of NHIW is measured in {{the hundreds of millions of}} Mg, not the billions as claimed by the prevailing EPA account. It therefore appears that NHIW generation rates are comparable to those of municipal solid waste. Accurate <b>waste</b> <b>accounting</b> based on reliable, repeatable, and efficient methods is an important tool for characterizing current environmental challenges and understanding trends and the effects of key drivers. Waste accounts are also essential for developing and tracking progress on sustainability strategies like industrial symbiosis, in which wastes like NHIW are used as substitutes for raw materials throughout the economy. The method developed here satisfies these needs and answers what has been an open question for nearly three decades. by Jonathan Seth Krones. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|As India grows, {{driven by}} its success in {{information}} technology and services, there is another revolution waiting {{to happen in the}} Retail sector dependent on whether the Government of India can unshackle the various inefficiencies that are keeping this industry constrained. Retail in India is estimated at nearly US$ 400 billion and is growing at a CAGR of 9 percent (AT Kearney GRDI 2010). 96 percent of this sector remains un-organized and constitutes a workforce that have taken to self-employment for daily subsistence due to an overcrowded agriculture sector and lack of employment opportunities for lesser skilled workers in the manufacturing or services sectors. Food and groceries form nearly 60 percent of India's retailing followed by, among others, clothing and footwear at a distant 9 percent of retail. Despite the size of this market, retail and its food supply chain remains unorganized and inefficient. A lack of investment, technology and process control in the agriculture supply chain leads to tremendous <b>waste</b> <b>accounting</b> for nearly 25 - 30 % of fruits and 10 % of grains produced. Also, the related and supporting industries for food processing, cold chains and crafts remain nascent. In a grim reflection on the situation, a politician in India recently remarked that Indian consumers buy shoes in air-conditioned stores but food on the streets. Despite this scathing but accurate comment, the debate on whether to organize retail remains unresolved. This debate is further complicated by intellectual and political debate on the impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), by large international retailers like Wal-Mart, on the fate of small retailers. Interestingly, both these questions have been on the table of policy makers in India for more than 15 years and the Government has so far only allowed some FDI in 'single-brand' retailing and 'wholesale trading' of retail goods. While the incumbent Congress party led Government has voiced many reasons to organize retail and allow FDI in multi-brand retailing, public opinion in response to a discussion paper released by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) - Ministry of Commerce & Industry - has been negative. In my quest to decipher whether India should organize and allow FDI in multi-brand retail, I have analyzed all the opinions received by the DIPP. I posit that the data is skewed and not sufficient to form the basis of a policy decision. I have also conducted an extensive literature review on the impact of Wal-Mart on small retailers to understand the potential impact it can have on India. Despite the concerns, I conclude that this change can be managed to India's advantage and that opening of the retail sector to FDI is an imperative, not an option. by Ashish Kumar Das. Thesis (M. B.

40|$|Since the 1970 s, Canada has {{formulated}} various strategy {{measures to}} accelerate the development of energy efficiency systems and renewable energy technologies and has made significant progress. "From 1990 to 2003, Canada's energy efficiency improved by an estimated 13 %, or 883. 3 Â petajoules, saving Canadians almost $ 13. 4 Â billion in 2003 alone and reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions by 52. 3 Â megatonnes". In 2000, about 17 % of Canadian primary energy supply came from renewable sources (with hydroelectric, combustible renewables and waste). Canada {{is a leader in}} devising and implementing energy options for sustainable development. However, the nation still has great scope for furthering energy efficiency and more use of renewable energy. Canada has a higher aggregate intensity [...] absolute energy use per capita or per unit of GDP [...] than most International Energy Agency (IEA) countries, ranking second and fourth, respectively. In 2000, Canada used only a small amount of renewable energy (without hydroelectric, combustible renewables and <b>waste),</b> <b>accounting</b> for 1. 3 % of its primary energy supply. Canada has made little use of wind power compared to other industrialized countries. By June 2004, Canada's installed capacity was 341 Â megawatts (MW), compared to 13, 407 Â MW installed by late 2003 in Germany, the country with the largest installed capacity. Canada's current small-scale hydroelectric capacity is about 2000 Â MW. Canada also has a few grid-connected wood-waste-fired power plants operational or under construction, with a maximum capacity of 60 Â MW. By 1999, Canada was generating 85. 3 Â MW of electricity from captured municipal landfill gas. It is also worth noting that solar power is now finding niche applications in Canada, despite the fact that its cost remains relatively high (although falling). Canada is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol. It has committed to reducing its emissions to 6 % below 1990 levels by 2008 - 2012. But Canada's emissions level was already 24 % above 1990 levels by 2003. As nearly 90 % of all anthropogenic GHG emissions in Canada result from the production and consumption of fossil fuels, meeting the Kyoto target will challenge all Canadian governments and the energy industry to develop new and more effective strategies for speeding the development of sustainable energy to limit GHG emissions. There is an urgent need for analyzing current strategies of sustainable energy in Canada and examining the issues of these strategies. In theory and practice, however, there has so far been no a clear, integrated and comprehensive strategy framework for sustainable energy in Canada. Nor a clear definition of sustainable energy strategy was formulated. In this paper, we attempted to define sustainable energy strategy as the energy strategy aiming at improving energy efficiency and promoting renewable energy. Based on the definition above, we formulated an analytical framework for developing the strategies of sustainable energy. In the analytical framework, (1) sustainable energy strategy embraces strategic objectives, measures and management; (2) sustainable energy strategy is divided into two major groups: energy efficiency strategy and renewable energy strategy; (3) strategy measures of energy efficiency are classified as ten types; and (4) strategy measures of renewable energy are classified as four types. We have employed the framework to analyze current strategic objectives, strategic measures and policy and management strategies concerning sustainable energy in Canada and examine the issues of these strategies.
