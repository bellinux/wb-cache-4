[...] Morrison described it as [...] "one of those songs <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{the light at the}} end of the tunnel... I don't think I can elaborate on it any more than that." [...] The words in the song: [...] "Talkin' to Huddie Ledbetter/Showin' pictures on the wall" [...] appear to be based on Morrison's real life custom of carrying around a poster of Lead Belly and hanging it on the wall wherever he lived.

500|$|Palpatine's {{role in the}} prequel films {{required}} McDiarmid to play {{two dimensions}} of the same character. Recalling the initial days of shooting The Phantom Menace, McDiarmid stated, [...] "Stepping onto the set of Episode I {{for the first time}} was like going back in time, due to my experience in Jedi. Palpatine's an interesting character; he's conventional on the outside, but demonic on the inside [...] he's on the edge, trying to go beyond what's possible." [...] McDiarmid added another layer to the character in Attack of the Clones. He noted, [...] " [...] is a supreme actor. He has to be even more convincing than somebody who isn't behaving in a schizophrenic fashion, so he's extra charming, or extra professional [...] and for those who are looking for clues, that's almost <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> them."

2500|$|Blane's goal of live {{performances}} was not totally successful, and the theater had relied {{more and more}} on music acts to fill the schedule. Ultimately, on Monday, August 20, 1990 the management of the theater was assumed by Steven Harris of Windstorm Productions, a 30-year-old Atlanta-area concert promoter.

"Wolf fence" [...] algorithm: Edward Gauss {{described}} this simple but very useful and now famous algorithm in a 1982 article for communications of the ACM as follows: [...] "There's one wolf in Alaska; {{how do you}} find it? First build a fence {{down the middle of the}} state, wait for the wolf to howl, determine which side of the fence it is on. Repeat process on that side only, until you get to the point <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the wolf." [...] This is implemented e.g. in the Git version control system as the command git bisect, which uses the above algorithm to determine which commit introduced a particular bug.|$|E

The view from the bridge overlooks Trowell Garden Centre <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the original stone built lock keepers cottages, 1&2 Swansea Cottages, Trowell, built in 1794–95. The name Swansea for the bridge and cottages originates from the fact that this particular part of the canal is where large quantities of swans used to congregate. Due to the lack of water in 1980 a decision was taken by the garden centre and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) to relocate them.|$|E

2500|$|One {{significant}} {{feature of}} this episode {{is the creation of}} another Doctor. Unlike the multiple Doctors of stories such as The Three Doctors, The Five Doctors and The Two Doctors, where his previous incarnations were played by actors or depicted in old footage, this Doctor is identical in appearance to the Tenth Doctor. In the accompanying Doctor Who Confidential for this episode, Davies explains [...] "This is so busy and so mental and so epic and universal in scale that of course you need two Doctors to solve it." [...] Phil Collinson, Graeme Harper, and David Tennant discuss the use of the double, a musician named Colum Regan who is a very good physical match for Tennant. Collinson explains that while with an unlimited budget they would use Tennant in every shot, [...] "we only have a certain number of effects shots <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the two Doctors together, so we have to pick those carefully." ...|$|E
