5|$|S.S.C. Napoli was {{expelled}} from the professional league in 2004. Thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F., the sports title was transferred to Napoli Soccer (later the new Napoli) in the same year, while the old Napoli was liquidated. On the eve of bankruptcy, the club was in deep financial trouble to achieve positive operating income (excluding <b>windfall</b> <b>profit</b> from players trading). At that time the club was using cash plus player swap to boost short term profit (€28,329,090 in 2000–01; €17,721,534 in 2001–02 season), but also increased the long term cost (as amortization) by purchasing players. In the second last season before bankruptcy, the club was partially saved by the non-standard accounting practice of amortization. {{it was due to}} Silvio Berlusconi, owner of Milan and prime minister of Italy, introducing Italian Law 91/1981, Article 18B. Napoli dramatically reduced the amortization from €33,437,075 to €1,659,088 + €4,660,123, due to €46,601,225 of the intangible asset (player contracts), which was deferred to amortize in 10-year installments, instead of varying from 1 to 5 years by the length of player contract. However, the practice was unable to save the club from the financial aid from a sugar daddy, when the owner withdrew.|$|E
25|$|A.C. Fiorentina S.p.A. {{was unable}} to {{register}} for 2002–03 Serie B due to financial difficulties, and then the sports title was transferred to a new company thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F., while the old company was liquidated. At that time the club was heavily relying on <b>windfall</b> <b>profit</b> from selling players, especially in pure player swap or cash plus player swap that potentially increased the cost by the increase in amortisation of player contracts (an intangible assets). For example, Marco Rossi joined Fiorentina for 17billion lire in 2000, {{but at the same}} time Lorenzo Collacchioni moved to Salernitana for 1billion lire, meaning the club had a player profit of 997 million lire and extra 1billion lire to be amortised in 5-years. In 1999, Emiliano Bigica also swapped with Giuseppe Taglialatela, which the latter was valued for 10billion lire. The operating income (excluding <b>windfall</b> <b>profit</b> from players trading) of 2000–01 season was minus 113,271,475,933 Italian lire (minus €58,499,835). It was only boosted by the sales of Francesco Toldo and Rui Costa in June 2001 (a profit of 134.883billion lire; €69.661million). However, it was alleged they were to transfer to Parma for a reported 140 million lire. The two players eventually joined Inter Milan and A.C. Milan in 2001–02 financial year instead, for undisclosed fees. Failing to have financial support from the owner Vittorio Cecchi Gori, the club was forced to windup due to its huge imbalance in operating income.|$|E
25|$|Though {{real estate}} is still his most {{preferred}} asset class, Trump became an active financial market investor in 2011 following disappointment from depressed American real estate market and various investments in the Federal Reserve's interest yields on CDs were next to nothing. Trump stated {{that he was not}} enthusiastic to be a stock market investor, but that prime real estate at good prices was hard to find at that time and that stocks and equity securities were cheap and generating good cash flow from dividends. He profited from 40 of the 45 stocks he purchased which he sold in 2014, making it almost a 90% success rate in capital appreciation in addition to millions in earned dividends.

25|$|After {{the club}} failed to qualify to Europe {{at the end}} of 2009–10 Serie A, as well as lack of player profit, Fiorentina {{turnover}} was decreased from €140,040,713 in 2009 to just €79,854,928, despite the wage bill also falling, la Viola still made a net loss of €9,604,353. In the 2011 financial year, the turnover slipped to €67,076,953, as the club's lack of capital gains from selling players and 2010 financial year still included the instalments from UEFA for participating 2009–10 UEFA Europa League. Furthermore, the gate income had dropped from €11,070,385 to €7,541,260. The wage bill did not fall much and in reverse the amortisation of transfer fee had sightly increased due to new signings. La Viola had savings in other costs but counter-weighted by huge €11,747,668 write-down for departed players, due to D'Agostino, Frey and Mutu, but the former would counter-weight by co-ownership financial income, which all made the operating cost remained high as worse as last year. Moreover, in 2010 the result was boosted by acquiring the asset from subsidiary (related to AC Fiorentina) and the re-valuation of its value in separate balance sheet. If deducting that income (€14,737,855), 2010 financial year was net loss 24,342,208 and 2011 result was worse with €8,131,876 only in separate balance sheet. In 2012, the club benefited from the sales of Matija Nastasić and Valon Behrami, followed by Stevan Jovetić and Adem Ljajić in 2013. In 2014, due to €28.4million drop from the <b>windfall</b> <b>profit</b> of selling players, the club recorded their worst financial results since re-foundation, despite the fact the club maintained the same level of <b>windfall</b> <b>profit,</b> the result was still worse than in 2013. Moreover, Fiorentina also revealed that the club had a relevant football net income of minus €19.5million in the first assessment period of UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations in the 2013–14 season (in May 2014). (aggregate of 2012 and 2013 results), which within the limit of minus €45million, as well as minus €25.5million in assessment period 2014–15 (aggregate of 2012, 2013 and 2014 results). However, as the limit was reduced to minus €30million in assessment period 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 season, the club had to achieve a relevant net income of positive €5.6million in 2015 financial year. La Viola sold Juan Cuadrado to Chelsea in January 2015 for €30million fee, to make the club eligible to 2016–17 edition of UEFA competitions.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 Inter and Roma {{were the}} only two Italian clubs that were sanctioned by the UEFA due to their {{breaking}} of UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations. As a probation to avoid further sanction, Inter agreed to have a three-year aggregate break-even from 2015 to 2018, with the 2015–16 season being allowed to have a net loss of a maximum of €30million, followed by break-even in the 2016–17 season. Inter was also fined €6million plus an additional €14million in probation. Inter also made a financial trick in the transfer market in summer 2015, in which Stevan Jovetić and Miranda were signed by Inter on temporary deals plus an obligation to sign outright in 2017, making their cost less in the loan period. Moreover, despite heavily investing in new signings, namely Geoffrey Kondogbia and Ivan Perišić that potentially increased the cost in amortization, Inter also sold Mateo Kovačić for €29million, making a <b>windfall</b> <b>profit.</b> On 21 April 2017, Inter announced that their net loss (FFP adjusted) of 2015–16 season was within the settlement agreement allowed limited of €30million. However, UEFA also announced that the reduction of squad size of Inter in European competitions would not be lifted yet.|$|E

40|$|Grandfathering is {{currently}} the main principle for the initial allocation of tradable CO 2 emission rights under the European cap-and-trade scheme. Furthermore, political feasibility often requires non-restrictive emission caps. Grandfathering under lax cap is unjust, biased and brings polluters unintended <b>windfall</b> <b>profits.</b> Still, in any post-Kyoto international CO 2 regime, lax caps may be critical in coaxing binding emission targets out of more countries, {{especially those in the}} less-developed world. This paper argues that there is a certain quantity of emission rights between the initial and the optimal emissions, the grandfathering of which brings polluters zero <b>windfall</b> <b>profits</b> or zero <b>windfall</b> losses. Our theoretical concept of zero-windfall grandfathering can be used to demonstrate the <b>windfall</b> <b>profits</b> that have emerged at company level during the first EU trading period. It might thus encourage governments to embrace auctioning, and to combine it with grandfathering as a legitimate tool in the initial allocation of emission rights in later trading regimes...|$|R
40|$|The great {{variability}} of mineral and energy prices has motivated some governments to incorporate a <b>windfall</b> <b>profits</b> tax into their mineral taxation regimes. <b>Windfall</b> <b>profits</b> taxes are {{a means for}} governments to capture additional mineral revenue when mineral prices are considered higher than some historic level. Governments {{need to be aware}} of the effects of such contingent taxes on the exploration, development and operating decisions of mining companies. Mining companies need to be able to calculate the full impact of <b>windfall</b> <b>profits</b> taxes on the economics of their projects. This paper examines the valuation of a multi-phase copper-gold project in the presence of a <b>windfall</b> <b>profits</b> tax. Real options Monte Carlo simulation is used to characterise the different exposures of the mine owner and of the government to the risky cash flow streams that they receive from the project. The results highlight that Monte Carlo simulation paired with the real option valuation method is able to account appropriately for the differing risk exposures, while the traditional discounted cash flow valuation model is not. Our key conclusion for governments and mining companies is that the impact of contingent tax and royalty terms can and should be assessed using advanced valuation techniques, and the results used to improve contract designs under the constraint of actual and perceived fiscal system stability...|$|R
