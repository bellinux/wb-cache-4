5|$|Sloped, {{vertical}} or upside-down welding {{requires more}} operator skill, and often necessitates {{the use of}} an electrode that solidifies quickly to prevent the molten metal from flowing out of the <b>weld</b> <b>pool.</b> However, this generally means that the electrode melts less quickly, thus increasing the time required to lay the weld.|$|E
5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the <b>weld</b> <b>pool)</b> and adding filler metal. The filler rod is {{withdrawn from the}} <b>weld</b> <b>pool</b> each time the electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld. Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator maintain {{some distance from the}} arc while staying inside the gas shield. If held too close to the arc, the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle. As the weld nears completion, the arc current is often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks {{at the end of the}} weld.|$|E
5|$|In GMAW {{the primary}} cause of {{porosity}} is gas entrapment in the <b>weld</b> <b>pool,</b> which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on the workpiece, as well as from an excessively long or violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped {{is directly related to the}} cooling rate of the <b>weld</b> <b>pool.</b> Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity. To reduce it, the workpiece and electrode should be clean, the welding speed diminished and the current set high enough to provide sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. Preheating can also help reduce the cooling rate in some cases by reducing the temperature gradient between the weld area and the base material.|$|E

5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the <b>weld</b> <b>pool</b> and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller <b>weld</b> <b>pool</b> gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (<b>weld</b> <b>pool)</b> that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E

When the existence of surface active element (e. g. the content of S is about 0. 02 - 0. 04 % in steel) change the sign of surface tension temperature coefficient to positive, undercut always occurs in TIG moveless welding, and not occurs when the content of S in iron is very low (e. g.

5|$|Filler metals {{are also}} used in nearly all {{applications}} of GTAW, the major exception being the welding of thin materials. Filler metals are available with different diameters and are made {{of a variety of}} materials.

5|$|Once the arc is struck, the welder {{moves the}} torch {{in a small}} circle to create a welding pool, the size of which depends {{on the size of}} the {{electrode}} and the amount of current.

5|$|Weld spatter, {{while not}} {{affecting}} {{the integrity of}} the weld, damages its appearance and increases cleaning costs. It can be caused by excessively high current, a long arc, or arc blow, a condition associated with direct current characterized by the electric arc being deflected away from the <b>weld</b> <b>pool</b> by magnetic forces.

5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a wire brush or chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} <b>weld</b> <b>pool,</b> whether from the atmosphere or the shielding gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary, and welding in volatile air should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal. In addition to melting the base metal, a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material (the <b>weld</b> <b>pool)</b> that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material. Pressure may also be {{used in conjunction with}} heat, or by itself, to produce a weld. Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.|$|E
5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up {{on the end of the}} electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger <b>weld</b> <b>pool.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of parameters of {{tungsten inert gas}} arc welding on the morphology, microstructure, tensile property and fracture of welded joints of Ni-base superalloy have been studied. Results show that the increase of welding current and the decrease of welding speed bring about the large amount of heat input in the <b>welding</b> <b>pool</b> and the enlargement of width and deepness of the <b>welding</b> <b>pool.</b> The increase of impulse frequency has the same effect on the microstructure compared with the increase of welding current. The effect of welding parameters on the tensile strength and fracture was analyzed. It is found that the root of welding joint is unwelded when the welding current is lower, so that the strength and elongation of welded joint are inferior. And the more welding defects in the welding zone and the more hard and brittle phase precipitates in the overheated zone when the welding current is too high. Consequently, the strength and plasticity go up first and then go down, i. e. they have a peak value with welding current increasing. In addition, the decrease of impulse frequency is beneficial to the strength of the welded joint...|$|R
40|$|In-process {{nondestructive}} evaluation of welds is of major importance for automated weld processing. Real-time evaluation of defect formation makes possible on-line rewelding and adjustment of process parameters. Measurements of physical parameters related to weld quality may also give information important {{for understanding the}} weld process and for improvements of weld quality. In this study we implement industrial radiography for real-time weld process monitoring and testing. X-ray penetrating radiation is used for volume observation in the <b>welding</b> <b>pool</b> and the heat-affected zone during the weld process.

5|$|Spray {{transfer}} GMAW was {{the first}} metal transfer method used in GMAW, and well-suited to welding aluminium and stainless steel while employing an inert shielding gas. In this GMAW process, the weld electrode metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to the workpiece, essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of short circuit transfer the weld electrode metal transfer transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies. Since this vaporized spray transfer variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit transfer, {{and as a result}} of the higher heat input and larger <b>weld</b> <b>pool</b> area (for a given weld electrode diameter), it is generally used only on workpieces of thicknesses above about 6.4mm (0.25in).|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} arc welding, {{because it}} affords {{greater control over}} the weld area than other welding processes, can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness—all equipment and materials used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a stainless steel wire brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first grit blasting the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit. These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used, because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current. To maintain a clean <b>weld</b> <b>pool</b> during welding, the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{processes}} that may be used to produce ERW pipes. Each of these processes leads to coalescence or merging of steel components into pipes.

500|$|Further {{developments}} in welding steel with GMAW {{led to a}} variation known as short-circuit transfer (SCT) or short-arc GMAW, in which the current is lower than for the globular method. As {{a result of the}} lower current, the heat input for the short-arc variation is considerably reduced, making it possible to weld thinner materials while decreasing the amount of distortion and residual stress in the weld area. As in globular welding, molten droplets form on the tip of the electrode, but instead of dropping to the <b>weld</b> <b>pool,</b> they bridge the gap between the electrode and the <b>weld</b> <b>pool</b> {{as a result of the}} lower wire feed rate. [...] This causes a short circuit and extinguishes the arc, but it is quickly reignited after the surface tension of the <b>weld</b> <b>pool</b> pulls the molten metal bead off the electrode tip. This process is repeated about 100 times per second, making the arc appear constant to the human eye. This type of metal transfer provides better weld quality and less spatter than the globular variation, and allows for welding in all positions, albeit with slower deposition of weld material. Setting the weld process parameters (volts, amps and wire feed rate) within a relatively narrow band is critical to maintaining a stable arc: generally between 100 and 200 amperes at 17 to 22 volts for most applications. Also, using short-arc transfer can result in lack of fusion and insufficient penetration when welding thicker materials, due to the lower arc energy and rapidly freezing <b>weld</b> <b>pool.</b> Like the globular variation, it can only be used on ferrous metals.|$|E
500|$|To {{strike the}} {{electric}} arc, the electrode {{is brought into}} contact with the workpiece by a very light touch with the electrode to the base metal then is pulled back slightly. This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and the consumable electrode, and causes droplets of the electrode to be passed from the electrode to the <b>weld</b> <b>pool.</b> Striking an arc, which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition, can be the hardest skill for beginners. The orientation of the electrode to workpiece is where most stumble, if the electrode is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece the tip will likely stick to the metal which will fuse the electrode to the workpiece which will cause it to heat up very rapidly. The tip of the electrode needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece, which allows the <b>weld</b> <b>pool</b> to flow out of the arc. [...] As the electrode melts, the flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases. In addition, the flux provides molten slag which covers the filler metal as it travels from the electrode to the <b>weld</b> <b>pool.</b> Once part of the <b>weld</b> <b>pool,</b> the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies. Once hardened, it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld. As welding progresses and the electrode melts, the welder must periodically stop welding to remove the remaining electrode stub and insert a new electrode into the electrode holder. This activity, combined with chipping away the slag, reduces {{the amount of time that}} the welder can spend laying the weld, making SMAW one of the least efficient welding processes. In general, the operator factor, or the percentage of operator's time spent laying weld, is approximately 25%.|$|E
500|$|Also, {{because of}} the large <b>weld</b> <b>pool,</b> it is often limited to flat and {{horizontal}} welding positions and sometimes also used for vertical-down welds. It is generally not practical for root pass welds. When a smaller electrode is used in conjunction with lower heat input, its versatility increases.
