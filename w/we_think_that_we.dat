We must learn to teach the best attitude to what is not yet known. This also may take centuries to acquire but we cannot escape this new challenge, nor do we want to." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Official PlayStation Magazine UKs {{interview}} about Uncharted 4, Richmond discusses {{some of the}} new directions that the franchise could take in the future, as well as maintaining fan interest and going too far. According to Richmond, Nate still has plenty more to give and the studio would continue to create new Uncharted experiences as long as fans want it. Speaking to VentureBeat, Richmond pointed out that the studio never set out to make a trilogy. Instead it has always [...] "sort have seen it as a stand-alone adventure", with each game existing as a self-sustaining gaming experience. [...] "We have always said that if <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can make something new and interesting, if the fans still want them, then we can make another one".|$|E

"We {{have been}} talking together, master; and <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> if <b>we</b> were to call out that they might take the bodies away, without any {{interference}} by us, they would do so. Several officers of rank have fallen there, {{and it is our}} custom always to carry off the dead, when it is possible." ...|$|R

60|$|I do not {{say that}} we have done so; but we may; for human nature is just the same now as it was then; and {{therefore}} it is as well for us to look round--at least once now and then, and see whether we too are in danger of falling, while <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are standing safe.|$|E

40|$|How can <b>we</b> <b>think</b> all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{actually}} do <b>think?</b> What {{is the nature}} of human knowledge, and what are its limits? What is mind-independent reality like? What is a person, and what are the identity conditions for persons? This course examines these and related questions in the philosophical writings of Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Reid. Emphasis is on a philosophical understanding of the theories of cognition and reality developed in these texts...|$|R
5000|$|Alder {{suggested}} that {{awareness of the}} band's previous releases informed the new album: [...] "The idea with Darkness in a Different Light was to do something similar to Parallels, not necessarily musically, but in theory. Catchy songs, big choruses—that was the idea. Sure, <b>we</b> sometimes <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> won't ever make an album as big as Parallels, but I think our new album is different than anything else out there right now. We look to the future".|$|R

He is an American citizen-- nothing more and nothing less." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{reason we}} {{all like to}} think so well of others {{is that we are}} all afraid for ourselves. The basis of {{optimism}} is sheer terror. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are generous because we credit our neighbours with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find good qualities in the high-wayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets. I have the greatest contempt for optimism.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr President, {{will you}} take tea, coffee, cocoa, chocolate, or {{preserved}} dates? There are muffins and crumpets, dry toast, buttered toast, plum-cake, seed-cake, peach-fritters, apple-marmalade, and bread and butter. There are put-up fruits of all kinds, of which you really wouldn't know that they hadn't come this moment from graperies and orchard-houses; but we don't {{put them on the}} table, because <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can't eat quite so much dinner after them." [...] This was the invitation which came from a young naval lad who seemed to be about fifteen years old.|$|E

40|$|A brief {{article about}} the habitat of Tibetan nature and culture. Several decades of logging {{operations}} and the more recent mass tourism development have combined to have major socioeconomic and ecological impacts on the communities in northwest Yunnan. As the result, the intrinsic connections between nature and the local communities have become fragile and threatened.

60|$|How many errors do we {{pass through}} on our road to truth, errors a thousandfold more {{dangerous}} than truth is useful? And by what marks are we to know truth, when <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have found it? And above all, if we do find it, who of us {{can be sure that}} he will make good use of it? If celestial intelligences cultivated science, only good could result; and we may say as much of great men of the stamp of Socrates, who are born to be the guides of others.[162] But the intelligences of common men are neither celestial nor Socratic.|$|E
60|$|We {{white people}} think that we know everything. For instance, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{understand}} human nature. And so we do, as human nature appears to us, with all its trappings and accessories seen dimly through the glass of our conventions, leaving out those aspects of it which we have forgotten or {{do not think it}} polite to mention. But I, Allan Quatermain, reflecting upon these matters in my ignorant and uneducated fashion, have always held that no one really understands human nature who has not studied it in the rough. Well, that is the aspect of it with which I have been best acquainted.|$|E

"Now, Mr Lynch," [...] {{continued}} the parson, {{as soon as}} the unfortunate man would listen to him, [...] "as I before told you, I am in doubt--we are all in doubt--whether or not a jury would hang you; and <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall do more good to the community by getting you out of the way, than by letting you loose again after a trial which will only serve to let everyone know how great a wretch there is in the county.

30|$|<b>We</b> <b>think</b> {{there is}} an important, unarticulated reason why music has {{remained}} mostly {{on the margins of}} healthcare to date. That reason is that the terms in which music is expected to prove itself are incommensurate with what music is, with what it can do, and how it helps. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> until <b>we</b> are more able to address this question, opponents of music and health can insist <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have yet to find the ‘smoking gun’ (apologies for using a munitions metaphor). One could imagine a future in which the music, health and well-being ‘moment’ had passed….|$|R
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis is forcing Europe {{to become an}} ever closer union. Governments are still balking at the idea and many EU citizens continue to be rather sceptical.

6000|$|But is life, indeed, a {{thing for}} all infidel levities, and we, its misdeemed beneficiaries, so utterly fools and infatuate, that what we take to be our strongest tower of delight, only stands at the caprice of the minutest event--the falling of a leaf, the hearing of a voice, or the receipt of one little bit of paper {{scratched}} over with a few small characters by a sharpened feather? Are we so entirely insecure, that that casket, wherein we have placed our holiest and most final joy, and which we have secured by a lock of infinite deftness; can that casket be picked and desecrated at the merest stranger's touch, when <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> alone hold the only and chosen key? ...|$|E
60|$|Could it be {{that all}} her fate must be {{resolved}} in so short a time? Since first the notion that Mr Whittlestaff {{had asked her to}} be his wife had come upon her, she had thought of it day and night. But, as is so usual with the world at large, she had thought altogether of the past, and not of the future. The past was a valley of dreams, which could easily be surveyed, whereas the future was a high mountain which it would require much labour to climb. When <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will make our calculations as to the future, it is so easy to revel in our memories instead. Mary had, in truth, not thought of her answer, though she had said to herself over and over again why it should not be so.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We Cyclopes,' {{said the}} giant, 'do {{not care for}} Zeus or the Gods, for <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are better men than they. Where is your ship?' Ulysses {{answered}} {{that it had been}} wrecked on the coast, to which the man made no answer, but snatched up two of the twelve, knocked out their brains on the floor, tore the bodies limb from limb, roasted them at his fire, ate them, and, after drinking many pailfuls of milk, lay down and fell asleep. Now Ulysses had a mind to drive his sword-point into the giant's liver, and he felt for the place with his hand. But he remembered that, even if he killed the giant, he could not move the huge stone that was the door of the cave, so he and his men would die of hunger, when they had eaten all the cheeses.|$|E

40|$|Benjamin's {{writings}} {{have always}} been directed by the task of understanding the changes of modernity and the transformations of the subjective position it implies. Many of his most famous texts concern the loss of traditional experience, the concept {{of history and the}} decline of the aura. We want to show in this paper that all the aforementioned concerns have in common a certain construction of history that determines the place of the subjects. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> all the crisis Benjamin identifies in modernity are first of all political crisis conditioned by the construction of the history those politics believe in. The analysis of the Tragic Drama does not contradict this thesis. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> indeed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can understand Benjamin’s target in this text by showing the specific construction of history it involves...|$|R

6000|$|... "And what next?" [...] Madame Goesler, as she thus interrogated him, {{was leaning}} across towards {{him from the}} sofa on which she was placed, with both her elbows resting on a small table before her. We all know that look of true {{interest}} which the countenance of a real friend will bear when the welfare of his friend is in question. There are doubtless some who can assume it without feeling,--as there are actors who can personate all the passions. But in ordinary life <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can trust such a face, and that we know the true look when we see it. Phineas, as he gazed into Madame Goesler's eyes, was sure that the lady opposite him was not acting. She at least was anxious for his welfare, and was making his cares her own. [...] "What next?" [...] said she, repeating her words {{in a tone that}} was somewhat hurried.|$|E
60|$|There is an incessant {{influx of}} novelty into the world, {{and yet we}} {{tolerate}} incredible dulness. I need only suggest what kind of sermons are still listened to in the most enlightened countries. There are such words as joy and sorrow, but they are only the burden of a psalm, sung with a nasal twang, while {{we believe in the}} ordinary and mean. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can change our clothes only. It is said that the British Empire is very large and respectable, and that the United States are a first-rate power. We do not believe that a tide rises and falls behind every man which can float the British Empire like a chip, if he should ever harbor it in his mind. Who knows what sort of seventeen-year locust will next come out of the ground? The government of the world I live in was not framed, like that of Britain, in after-dinner conversations over the wine.|$|E

I have the greatest contempt for optimism. As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature, you have merely to reform it. As for marriage, of course that would be silly, but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women. I will certainly encourage them. They have the charm of being fashionable. But here is Dorian himself. He will tell you more than I can." ...|$|E
50|$|Uddhacca is not {{the same}} as what we mean by “restlessness” or “agitation”, used in {{conventional}} language. When we use the word restlessness <b>we</b> usually <b>think</b> of aversion and unpleasant feeling. However, uddhacca arises with each akusala citta, not only with citta rooted in aversion, dosa-mūla-citta, but also with citta rooted in attachment, lobha-mūla-citta, and citta rooted in ignorance, moha-mūla-citta. When there is uddhacca we are forgetful as to kusala, we are unable to apply ourselves to any kind of kusala. Even when there is pleasant feeling, for example, when we are attached to a quiet place, there is restlessness, uddhacca, which arises together with lobha-mūla-citta. <b>We</b> may <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are calm at such a moment, but we have actually “mental excitement”.|$|R
60|$|We {{never read}} of Pompeii but <b>we</b> <b>think</b> of <b>that</b> soldier; <b>we</b> can not write of Pompeii without the natural impulse to grant {{to him the}} mention he so well deserves.

Had he been a policeman he would have staid, also--because he would have been asleep.|$|R
30|$|Quality {{consideration}} {{and the possibility}} of polarization and contention organized into non-overlapping factions of users are clearly important contextual factors that may inject powerful and realistic non-linear elements in the hierarchical order of the Wikipedia edit network.
