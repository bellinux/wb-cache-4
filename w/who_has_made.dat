5|$|Pliny's {{purpose in}} writing the Natural History was to cover all {{learning}} and art so far as they are connected with nature or draw their materials from nature. He says:My subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, nay barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor {{one in which the}} mind is eager to range: there is not one of us <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> the same venture, nor yet one among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, George thinks Liz {{is breaking}} the rules by taking a personal call; he gets angry and wrestles the handset from her. Later, Andy is upset that he listened to Chloe in her final moments, and Liz, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> a complaint about George's conduct, tells him that she took a call from an ex-soldier, in tears because his mother committed suicide {{following the death of}} her cat. Andy realises that the man's mother is the caller from the previous night. George advises that Andy will not face any repercussions, and asks Andy to help Michael, new to the centre, with his first call. Chloe calls in and speaks to Michael, again claiming that she has taken an overdose. Andy snatches the phone and shouts at Chloe, hanging up on her.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} recordings of the different versions, especially of the Berlioz adaptation featuring a female Orfeo. The British contralto Kathleen Ferrier and American mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne were especially notable interpreters. In recent years, recordings and stage productions of the Vienna version of the opera have featured countertenors {{in the role of}} Orpheus. Countertenors Derek Lee Ragin, Jochen Kowalski, René Jacobs, James Bowman, and Michael Chance have recorded Orfeo ed Euridice. The role of Orfeo has also been performed and recorded by tenors and even baritones such as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> three recordings of the role. Until recent times, most recordings of all versions were cut or altered in some way.|$|E
5|$|Arsène Lupin III, the {{grandson}} of the fictional gentleman thief, Arsène Lupin, is considered the world's greatest thief, known for announcing his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to the owners of his desired items. His right-hand man and closest ally is Daisuke Jigen, an expert marksman who can accurately shoot a target in 0.3 seconds. Although Lupin and Jigen frequently work as a two-man team, they are often joined by Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a master swordsman whose sword can cut anything, or Fujiko Mine, a femme fatale and Lupin's love interest. Although Fujiko usually works together with the others, she occasionally exploits Lupin's interest in her to steal the treasure for herself. Lupin and his gang are constantly chased by Inspector Koichi Zenigata of the ICPO, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> it his life's work to arrest them, pursuing Lupin across the globe.|$|E

5|$|The {{first player}} {{to score a}} century in the tournament was Pakistan's Moin-ul-Atiq, who made 105 against Bangladesh in the third edition (1988). In the same match, his team mate Ijaz Ahmed scored 124 not out. India's Navjot Singh Sidhu and Sachin Tendulkar were the lone centurions of the 1990 and 1995 tournaments, respectively. The 2008 edition saw 13 centuries—the highest for a tournament—while no centuries were made in 1986 and 1988. Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya holds the record for most number of centuries, with six, {{followed}} by his compatriot Kumar Sangakkara, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> four. Virat Kohli (India) and Shoaib Malik (Pakistan) follow these two with three centuries each. Sangakkara's three centuries in the 2008 tournament is a record for a single edition. Pakistani batsman Shahid Afridi made two centuries in the 2010 edition while playing as a captain, {{the most in the}} tournament history. His second century, which came against Bangladesh when he made 124 at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, is the fastest in terms of balls faced in Asia cup matches. Kohli's 183 against Pakistan in 2012 is the highest individual score as of 2014. Lahiru Thirimanne's (Sri Lanka) 108 against Pakistan in the final of the 2014 edition is the most recent century.|$|E
