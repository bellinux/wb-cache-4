5|$|Following the Japanese ship-naming conventions, Kawachi and Settsu {{were named}} after ancient Japanese provinces, both now {{a part of}} Osaka prefecture. The only {{significant}} action performed by either ship during World War I <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> bombarded German fortifications in October–November 1914 during {{the final stage of}} the Battle of Tsingtao. They were both assigned to the First Squadron until they were refitted in 1917 and 1916 respectively. Upon their completion of their refits, both ships were assigned to the Second Squadron. On 12 July 1918, Kawachi was sunk in an accidental magazine explosion in Tokuyama Bay that killed over 600 crewmen. Stricken from the Navy List on 21 September 1918, the wreck was later partially dismantled although most of the hull was abandoned in place to serve as an artificial reef.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} cup {{competition}} won by Bristol Rovers is the 1972 Watney Cup, when they beat Sheffield United in the final. The club {{also won the}} Division Three (South) Cup in 1934–35, as well as winning or sharing the Gloucestershire Cup on 32occasions. The team has never played in European competition; the closest Rovers came <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> missed out on reaching the international stage of the Anglo-Italian Cup in the 1992–93 season on a coin toss held over the phone with West Ham United.|$|E
5|$|Staley met guitarist Jerry Cantrell at a {{party in}} Seattle around August 1987. A few months before that, Cantrell had watched a concert of Staley's then-band, Alice N' Chains, in his {{hometown}} at the Tacoma Little Theatre and was impressed by his voice. Cantrell was homeless after being kicked out of his family's house, so Staley invited Cantrell to live with him at the rehearsal studio Music Bank, and the two struggling musicians became roommates. Alice N' Chains soon disbanded, and Staley joined a funk band. Cantrell's band, Diamond Lie, broke up and he wanted to form a new band, so Staley gave him the phone number of Melinda Starr, the girlfriend of drummer Sean Kinney, so that Cantrell could talk to him. Cantrell called the number and set up a meeting with Kinney. Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank and listened to Cantrell's demos, who mentioned that they needed a bass player to jam with them, and he had someone in mind: Mike Starr, with whom Cantrell had played in a band in Burien called Gypsy Rose. Kinney then mentioned that his girlfriend was actually Mike Starr's sister, and that he had been playing in bands together with Starr since they were kids. Kinney called Starr and a few days later he started jamming with him and Cantrell at the Music Bank, but they didn't have a singer. Staley's funk band also required a guitarist at the time, and Staley asked Cantrell to join as a sideman. Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join his band, because Cantrell, Starr and Kinney wanted Staley to be their lead singer, so they started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint. The last straw for Staley <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> auditioned a male stripper – he decided to join the band after that. Eventually the funk project broke up, and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis. Two weeks after the band's formation, they were playing a gig at the University of Washington, trying to fill out a 40-minute set with a couple of original material along with Hanoi Rocks and David Bowie covers.|$|E

25|$|Lau et al. {{set up an}} {{experiment}} where subjects would look at an analogue-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, {{and the other was}} given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> physically pressed the button. Results showed the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16ms, and shifted back the 14ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements. Often it is thought that free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.|$|E

The most notable player drafted by the Fire <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> selected Brent Pease with the first overall selection in the quarterbacks draft. Training camp started shortly thereafter, and in mid-March the Fire lost to San Antonio in a controlled scrimmage at San Marcos, Texas.|$|E

His most notable moment with the club <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> won the UEFA Intertoto Cup 2006. Although he played well at Twente, his time there was shrouded in controversy — in March 2005, he was cleared of a seven-game Eredivisie ban for allegedly elbowing FC Groningen forward Martin Drent and in December {{of the same year}} he was involved in a training ground confrontation with team-mate Blaise Nkufo. A week later, Majstorović later came too late for training and he was released because of this lack of discipline by the club.|$|E
25|$|Throughout its existence, Shinhwa has {{achieved}} many successes {{and has been}} awarded many honors. One of their first notable achievement <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> made history in the Korean music industry when they released their sixth album, Wedding on December 6, 2002, becoming the longest-running Korean boy band in existence. Shinhwa is still holding the record as {{they have not yet}} disbanded. In addition to becoming the longest-running boy band in South Korea, Shinhwa holds the record for the only boy band to stay together for a decade and not lose members along the way nor add another one in (Member Andy's departure does not necessarily count as he came back into the group). Just as well, Shinhwa {{is one of the few}} groups to ever have all its members branch out to do solo activities with the group still together. Shinhwa has sold an excess of 5 million records worldwide, an incredible feat for an Asian group and one of the highest album sales in Asia.|$|E
25|$|On August 9, 2007, the Cardinals {{promoted}} Ankiel from Memphis after {{a roster}} spot was vacated by Scott Spiezio's departure. In his first game, Ankiel batted second and played right field. In his first at bat, {{he received a}} prolonged standing ovation from the St. Louis crowd. During the seventh inning, he hit a three-run home run off Doug Brocail to right field to help the Cardinals defeat the San Diego Padres, 5–0. It was his first {{home run in the}} majors since April 2000 (as a pitcher), and made him the first player since Clint Hartung (1947) to hit his first major league home run as a pitcher and then hit a home run as a position player. The player before Hartung who accomplished this was Babe Ruth. After the game, Tony La Russa said that his only happier moment as a Cardinal <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> won the 2006 World Series. Two days later, against the Dodgers on August 11, Ankiel drew three standing ovations. He had three hits, including two home runs and three RBIs and made a spectacular catch in right field.|$|E

25|$|From the 15th {{century in}} the Netherlands onwards, it was more usual to show the non-Biblical subject of the Holy Family resting on the journey, the Rest on the Flight to Egypt, often {{accompanied}} by angels, and in earlier images sometimes an older boy who may represent, James the Brother of the Lord, interpreted as a son of Joseph, by a previous marriage. The background to these scenes usually (until the Council of Trent tightened up on such additions to scripture) includes a number of apocryphal miracles, and gives {{an opportunity for the}} emerging genre of landscape painting. In the Miracle of the corn the pursuing soldiers interrogate peasants, asking when the Holy Family passed by. The peasants truthfully say it <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were sowing their wheat seed; however the wheat has miraculously grown to full height. In the Miracle of the idol a pagan statue falls from its plinth as the infant Jesus passes by, and a spring gushes up from the desert (originally separate, these are often combined). In further, less commonly seen, legends a group of robbers abandon their plan to rob the travellers, and a date palm tree bends down to allow them to pluck the fruit.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan started {{well in the}} ICC Cricket World Cup, {{which was}} held in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, after beating Kenya, Sri Lanka (one of the tournament favourites) and bye a margin, beating Canada. Shahid Afridi clearly stated that his team is capable of {{qualifying}} for the Semifinals. After a huge loss against New Zealand, Pakistan defeated Zimbabwe by 7 wickets. After victory against Zimbabwe Pakistan cemented their shot at playing the ICC CWC 2011 Quarters. One {{of the highlights of}} the tournament for Pakistan <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> beat Australia, who were led by 3 brilliant pace bowlers, Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson. However Pakistan defied the odds and defeated Australia, courtesy of a brilliant bowling display. This saw Australia's record win streak of 27 consecutive world cup games broken which saw them win every game between the 1999 world cup up until this game. In the quarter-finals they played West Indies. Pakistan were ruthless, as they emphatically won against the West Indies side by 10 wickets, due to another brilliant bowling display. In the semi-finals on 30 March, Pakistan had a match with its fiercest rival, India. India managed 260 after they batted first. Not having a good batting line-up along with a slow start to the chase, Pakistan were 29 runs short as India reached the final (India {{went on to win the}} final, by defeating Sri Lanka).|$|E
