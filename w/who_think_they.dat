25|$|In Why F A Hayek is a Conservative, British {{policy analyst}} Madsen Pirie claims Hayek {{mistakes}} {{the nature of}} the conservative outlook. Conservatives, he says, are not averse to change – but like Hayek, they are highly averse to change being imposed on the social order by people in authority <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> know how to run things better. They wish to allow the market to function smoothly and give it the freedom to change and develop. It is an outlook, says Pirie, that Hayek and conservatives both share.|$|E
25|$|Four factors {{exist that}} cause {{a person to}} be optimistically biased: their desired end state, their {{cognitive}} mechanisms, the information they have about themselves versus others, and overall mood. The optimistic bias is seen {{in a number of}} situations. For example: people believing that they are less at risk of being a crime victim, smokers believing that {{they are less likely to}} contract lung cancer or disease than other smokers, first-time bungee jumpers believing that they are less at risk of an injury than other jumpers, or traders <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are less exposed to losses in the markets.|$|E
500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Beatles' break-up, a time when he made many angry utterances, John Lennon trivialised Martin's importance to the Beatles' music. In his 1970 interview with Jann Wenner, Lennon said, [...] " [...] another one of those people, <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> made us. They didn't. I'd like to hear Dick James' music and I'd like to hear George Martin's music, please, just play me some." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{government}} {{attempted to}} use the scandal as a popular distraction, aiming to deflect attention from the strikes and other industrial action. A number of journalists attacked the players who had supported Młynarczyk; the Przegląd Sportowy sports magazine ran the headline [...] "No Mercy for Those Guilty of the Scandal at the Airport" [...] while Tempo, another journal, was similarly severe, proclaiming [...] "This Cannot Be Tolerated". Piłka Nożna condemned the [...] "magnificent men... <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> can do what they want", {{but at the same}} time questioned the conduct of the team's non-playing staff.|$|E
500|$|Given little {{instruction}} from the studio, screenwriter Deborah Moggach spent {{over two years}} adapting Pride and Prejudice for film. She had sole discretion with the early script, and eventually wrote approximately ten drafts. Realising it held [...] "a perfect three-act structure", Moggach attempted to be as faithful to the original novel as possible, calling it [...] "so beautifully shaped as a story – the ultimate romance about two people <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> hate each other but who are really passionately in love. I felt, 'If it's not broken, don't fix it.'" [...] While she could not reproduce the novel's [...] "fiercely wonderful dialogue in its entirety", she attempted to keep much of it.|$|E
500|$|While experts found Bundy's precise {{diagnosis}} elusive, {{the majority}} of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses, and toward antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). [...] Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as [...] "sociopaths" [...] or [...] "psychopaths"), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade; the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but with minimal effect on behavior; and an absence of guilt or remorse. [...] "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", Bundy said, in 1981. [...] "It hurts you ... I guess I am in the enviable position of not {{having to deal with}} guilt." [...] There was also evidence of narcissism, poor judgment, and manipulative behavior. [...] "Sociopaths", prosecutor George Dekle wrote, [...] "are egotistical manipulators <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> can con anybody." [...] "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist. In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: [...] "I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson. [...] "I never thought they existed ... but I think Ted may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all." [...] Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has been proposed as an alternative diagnosis in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis.|$|E

2500|$|The German Millionaires risk format {{features}} an extra lifeline called [...] "Ask One of the Audience", {{in which the}} host will reread the question and ask the audience <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{would be able to}} answer that question to stand up.

[...] Draw to any heart's discontent. It's a free country. For now." [...] The idea also received support from prominent bloggers and bloggers on prominent websites, such as Michael C. Moynihan at Reason magazine's [...] "Hit & Run" [...] blog, who encouraged his readers to send him their drawings. Moynihan stated he planned to select some of his favorite depictions of Muhammad from the protest movement, and then add them to the Reason.com website. Moynihan commented, [...] "In the South Park episode that started all this, Buddha does lines of coke {{and there was an}} episode where Cartman started a Christian rock band that sang very homo-erotic songs. Yet there is one religious figure we can't make fun of. The point of the episode that started the controversy is that celebrities wanted Muhammad's power not to be ridiculed. How come non-Muslims aren't allowed to make jokes?" [...] Moynihan posited that the decision of Comedy Central to enact self-censorship of the South Park episode would have the impact of worsening the situation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, at {{the request}} of Major Lester D. Gardner, Secretary of the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences in New York, Beach drafted a {{statement}} about his relationship with Whitehead. Beach gave permission for changes {{to be made in the}} statement. It was not published, but was edited by Gardner and aviation publisher Earl Findley, a close friend of Orville Wright. Findley and Gardner apparently hoped the statement would help defend Wright brothers primacy in flight against the recent challenge in Stella Randolph's article and book, according to researcher Susan O'Dwyer Brinchman. The statement was sent to Wright, who relied on it in 1945 to rebut renewed publicity about Whitehead. The Beach statement about Whitehead said: [...] "I do not believe that any of his machines ever left the ground under their own power in spite of the assertions of many persons <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> saw him fly." [...] It also said that Whitehead never told Beach he had flown. The statement offered some words of praise, saying that Whitehead [...] "deserves a place in early aviation, due to his having gone ahead and built extremely light engines and aeroplanes. The five-cylinder kerosene one, with which he claims to have flown over Long Island Sound on 17 January 1902 was, I believe, the first aviation Diesel." ...|$|E
