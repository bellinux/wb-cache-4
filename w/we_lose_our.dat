500|$|Lieutenant Halvorsen's {{role in the}} Berlin Airlift was to fly one of many C-54 cargo planes used {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} into the starving city. During his flights he would first fly to Berlin, then deeper into Soviet-controlled areas. Halverson {{had an interest in}} photography and on his days off often went sightseeing in Berlin and shot film on his personal handheld movie camera. One day in July, he was filming plane takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof, the main landing site for the airlift. While there, he saw about thirty children lined up behind one of the barbed-wire fences. He went to meet them and noticed that the children had nothing. Halvorsen remembers: [...] "I met about thirty children at the barbed wire fence that protected Tempelhof's huge area. They were excited and told me that 'when the weather gets so bad that you can't land, don't worry about us. We can get by on a little food, but if <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>our</b> freedom, we may never get it back.'" [...] Touched, Halvorsen reached into his pocket and took out two sticks of gum to give to the children. The kids broke it into little pieces and shared it; the ones who did not get any sniffed the wrappers. Watching the children, so many of whom had absolutely nothing, Halvorsen regretted not having more to give them. Halvorsen recorded that he wanted to do more for the children, and so told them that the following day he would have enough gum for all of them, and he would drop it out of his plane. According to Halvorsen, one child asked [...] "How will we know it is your plane?" [...] to which Halvorsen responded that he would wiggle his wings, something he had done for his parents when he first got his pilot's license in 1941.|$|E

2500|$|Resnicoff is {{frequently}} quoted {{on the impact}} of war and violence on the human spirit, including the distinction he makes between [...] "outrage", a feeling we must value, because it is part of being human (and we must fight against the danger that war and violence can numb us against it), and [...] "rage", where emotions take over, <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>our</b> moral compass, and we become vulnerable to manipulation by others who want us to lose our way. [...] While working for General Wesley K. Clark at the U.S. European Command, Resnicoff worked to expand the concept of force protection to include Spiritual Force Protection: protecting military personnel not only against physical danger, but against threats to their humanity, as well. The book, Stoic Warriors: The Ancient Philosophy Behind the Military Mind quotes his position that [...] "We don't want our people just to come home physically; we want them to come back as close to the human beings they were before they went in." ...|$|E

40|$|Why {{should we}} be {{concerned}} about the fate of literature as we move from a book culture to a screen culture in the digital age? Not primarily because <b>we</b> are <b>losing</b> <b>our</b> sense of story, but because <b>we</b> are <b>losing</b> <b>our</b> sense of the central importance of linguistic narrative. There is a difference. The technologies creating the digital revolution seem to devalue language and increasingly to do away with boundaries, celebrating instead speed and boundless exhilaration. The visual trumps the linguistic, the image and the screen trump the word and the book. As a result, we no longer seem to engage deeply with others or ourselves. We are beginning to move, in other words, from “a reading brain” to “a digital brain,” from a brain capable of deep reading and deep thinking to a brain increasingly addled by spectacle and surface sensation. <b>We</b> are <b>losing</b> <b>our</b> standing as “linguistic beings. ...|$|R
2500|$|Chrétien's {{most notable}} {{achievement}} at Indian Affairs was the 1969 White Paper, {{a proposal to}} abolish the Indian Act. The paper was widely opposed by First Nations groups, and later abandoned. It was the 1969 White Paper that first brought Chrétien to widespread public attention in English Canada. At a press conference announcing the White Paper, Chrétien openly clashed with Indian activists with one First Nations women asking Chrétien [...] "When did <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>our</b> identity?", to which the minister replied [...] "When you signed the treaties", which prompted boos and jeers. Another women from the Iroquois reserve at Brantford asked Chrétien [...] "How can you come here and ask us to become citizens, when we were here long before you?", noting the Crown had granted the Grand River valley to Joseph Brant in 1784, to which Chrétien had no reply. The Cree activist Harold Cardinal in his bestselling 1969 book The Unjust Society attacked Chrétien and Trudeau for the White Paper, accusing them of [...] "cultural genocide" [...] against the First Nations. To counteract such criticism, Chrétien during a 1970 visit to the Northwest Territories adopted from the local orphanage in Inuvik an Inuit boy, whom he named Michel, whose mother was an alcoholic prostitute and whose unknown father {{had been one of}} her johns. As Indian Affairs Minister, Chrétien {{fell in love with the}} far north of Canada, whose beauty moved him, and he vacationed in the north every summer during his time while holding the Indian Affairs portfolio.|$|E

She has accused the Houthis of receiving foreign aid from the Iranian government and objects to what she believes are foreign efforts to leave the Houthis alone since they are also fighting against Al-Qaeda. After the announcement of Houthi integration into the Yemeni military, Karman stated that there shouldn't be integration if the Houthis are unwilling to surrender their weapons. As {{a response to the}} January 2015 events of the 2014-15 Yemeni coup d'état, she spoke out on what she believes is collaboration between former president Saleh and the Houthi rebels to undo the 2011 revolution by ending the transition process.
