5|$|The {{floods and}} mudslides killed {{many people in}} Haiti, {{although}} the exact total will likely never be known. On November19, officials reported 531deaths, and by two days later the total was potentially as high as 2,000. On November24, the death toll reached 824, and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on December21 that Gordon killed 1,122people in the country. Most of the deaths occurred in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel, and Léogâne. Damage was heavier in Haiti than elsewhere along Gordon's track due to poor infrastructure consisting of shacks on flood-prone denuded hills. The country suffers large death tolls from many hurricanes, caused in part by human activity. Large-scale deforestation left Haiti with about 1.4% of its forests as of 2004, leaving denuded mountain slopes that allows rainwater to <b>wash</b> <b>down</b> unimpeded. The lack of tree cover contributed to the devastating floods that caused most of Gordon's deaths.|$|E
25|$|A major {{contributor}} to the environmental degradation and barrier to the regeneration of forests was the grazing of domestic animals. Animals grazed and destroyed land areas unsuitable for cultivation. The consumption of hillside plants and young trees caused erosion, stripping hillsides of soils and eventually exposing bare rock. Silt and gravel would <b>wash</b> <b>down</b> off the hills and mountains creating other problems such as flooding, siltation, and filled-in marshlands.|$|E
500|$|He {{died during}} the 143rd Olympiad (208–204 BC) {{at the age of}} 73. Diogenes Laërtius gives two {{different}} accounts of his death. In the first account, Chrysippus was seized with dizziness having drunk undiluted wine at a feast, and died soon after. In the second account, he was watching a donkey eat some figs and cried out: [...] "Now give the donkey a drink of pure wine to <b>wash</b> <b>down</b> the figs", whereupon he died in a fit of laughter. His nephew Aristocreon erected a statue in his honour in the Kerameikos. Chrysippus was succeeded as head of the Stoic school by his pupil Zeno of Tarsus.|$|E

500|$|Domery {{remained}} hungry, and {{was recorded}} as having eaten the prison cat {{and at least}} 20 rats which had strayed into his cell. Domery also ate the medicines of those prisoners in the camp's infirmary who refused to take them, suffering no apparent adverse effects as a result. It was also recorded that he would regularly eat the prison's candles, and that if his ration of beer was exhausted, he would resort to drinking water to <b>wash</b> <b>down</b> his food. (To {{reduce the risk of}} water-borne disease, troops were issued rations of mildly alcoholic beverages such as small beer and diluted rum, and drinks such as tea and coffee which involved boiling water before drinking.) ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} Cretaceous (roughly 81 to 74 million years ago), molten rock (magma) {{rose to the}} Earth's surface in and near what later became Jefferson County and {{eventually}} formed an intrusive body of granitic rock up to [...] thick and [...] in diameter. This body, known as the Boulder Batholith, extends from Helena to Butte, and is the host rock for the many valuable ores mined in the region. As the granite cooled, it cracked, and hot solutions infiltrated the cracks to form mineral veins bearing gold and other metals. Millions of years later, weathering allowed gold in the veins to <b>wash</b> <b>down</b> to the gravels in Basin Creek, Cataract Creek, and the other creeks near Basin, {{as well as the}} Boulder River.|$|E
2500|$|Fixed {{transfer}} {{stations are}} dedicated facilities installed strategically throughout the municipality {{that serve as}} drop off locations for collected fecal sludge. [...] They may include a receiving station with screens, a tank for holding the collected waste, trash storage containers, and <b>wash</b> <b>down</b> facilities. [...] These may be more appropriate for FSM programs using the [...] "call-for-service" [...] business model.|$|E

2500|$|The Arleigh Burke design {{incorporates}} stealth techniques, {{such as the}} angled {{rather than}} traditional vertical surfaces and the tripod mainmast, which make the ship more difficult to detect, in particular by antiship missiles.

Other NBC defenses include a [...] "countermeasure <b>wash</b> <b>down</b> system".|$|E

50|$|Exhausted {{from his}} ordeal, Sparkes dragged {{himself against the}} flow, finally, making contact with the child and {{managing}} to calm him. At this stage Sparkes was 30 metres from the pipe opening and 3 metres underground.

5000|$|A typical NERV {{installation}} {{would be}} a cooked meat production plant with regularly <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> ovens. The effluent from such a factory would be very high in FOG (fats, oils and grease) but would frequently contain cleaning fluids and biocides. The bacteria in a traditional treatment system would be killed by this kind of shock, rendering the systems useless. Some food plants alternate their <b>wash</b> <b>downs</b> to be acidic and basic to avoid build up of resistant organisms, a properly set-up NERV reactor can deal with this variation.|$|R
