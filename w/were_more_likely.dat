Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be artefacts {{at the end of}} their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E

5|$|When compared, Black signers <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{than were}} White signers to produce signs {{outside of the}} typical signing space and to use two-handed signs. Adverbs {{are most likely to}} use a larger signing space. Less marked forms, such as pronouns, determiners, plain verbs, and nouns, tend to be less likely to be {{produced}} outside the typical signing space. The selection of two-handed signs over one-handed signs was found to have systematic constraints on their production. When the sign could be produced with one or two hands, Black signers often produced the variant that matched the handedness of the following sign; if the following sign was two-handed, they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to produce a two-handed variant, while if the following sign was one-handed, they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to produce the one-handed variant. The use of innovative one-handed forms, though, even in environments which favored them, did not exceed 50 percent.|$|E

Yule et al. found that asexual male participants <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to report having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the heterosexual participants. The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates.

They were bottom-dwelling (nektobenthic) deposit feeders.

Their tails and the feather-like filaments on their posterior thoracic somites also imply that they were active swimmers.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2015 UCLA Law Review-All Rights Reserved. Of the large, public {{companies}} {{that seek to}} remain in business through bankruptcy reorganization, only 70 percent succeed. The assets of the other 30 percent are absorbed into other businesses. Success is important both because it is efficient and because it preserves jobs, communities, supplier and customer relationships, and tax revenues. This Article reports {{the findings of the}} first comprehensive study of the variables that determine whether a business will succeed or fail. Eleven conditions best predict companies' survival prospects. First, a company that even hints in the press release announcing its bankruptcy that it intends to sell its business is highly likely to fail. Second, reorganizations assigned to <b>more</b> experienced judges <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to succeed. Third, companies headquartered in isolated geographical areas <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to fail. Fourth, companies that report greater shareholder equity <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to fail. Fifth, companies with routinely appointed creditors' committees <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to fail. Sixth, companies with debtor-in-possession (DIP) loans <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to succeed. Seventh, companies that prepackage or prenegotiate their plans <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to succeed. Eighth, companies that file in periods of low interest rates <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to succeed. Ninth, larger companies <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to succeed. Tenth, manufacturers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to succeed. Eleventh, companies with positive pre-filing operating income <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to succeed. System participants may be able to improve survival rates by shifting cases to more experienced judges and perhaps also by paying greater attention to the decisions to appoint creditors' committees, to prenegotiate plans, to obtain DIP loans, and to publicly seek alliances...|$|R
