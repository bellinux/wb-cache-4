5|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their first season, going 8–4, their financial status <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story.</b> Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. They were in dire financial straits until the eleventh game of the season, when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting over 73,000 fans.

However, the second innings <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story</b> as his no-ball problem returned with a vengeance. He sent down 12 of them in the space of seven wicketless overs, and with that he left the first-class game for good.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they did}} not make much of an {{impression}} in the inaugural East African Premier League, dominated by the two Ugandan sides, they did dominate in the opening rounds. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story</b> in the 50-over counterpart, the East African Cup, though. They totally dominated the tournament, and except the occasional Ugandan good performance, nearly every franchise appeared minnows in front of them. They topped the group with 28 points from 10 games (6 wins and only two losses), and then won comprehensively in the twice-postponed final against Ugandan side Nile Knights (the other being Rwenzori Warriors) by 84 runs. After they posted a massive 280/5 (Rakep Patel 92, Duncan Allan 65), Pakistani-born Kenyan cricketer Abdul Rehman took 4-32 as their opponents could only manage 196/9.|$|E
25|$|The Razorbacks {{began the}} 2010 {{campaign}} on February 19 with a 10–2 {{victory over the}} Ball State Cardinals. Hogs starter Mike Bolsinger earned the win, and Andy Wilkins provided two hits, 2 RBI, and a solo home run. Every Razorback starting player recorded at least a base hit in the contest. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story</b> in game two, however, as Ball State took a lead {{in the first inning}} and did not relinquish it. Geoffrey Davenport would continue after the shaky start to pitch effectively for four innings, including striking out the side in the fourth. The Razorbacks left twelve runners on base, and committed four defensive errors. Game three was initially delayed fifteen minutes due to rain, but once the game started, Brett Eibner and Drew Smyly pitched well. Designated hitter Monk Kreder, a junior college transfer native to Keller, Texas, collected three hits. Six different Razorbacks scored in the 9–3 victory.|$|E

Fernandinho put the Ukrainians ahead on 25 minutes before Jádson doubled their lead just before half time. David Abraham scored a late consolation {{goal for the}} home team. Sporting CP were the opponents on Matchday 2 (1 October) and despite defending well and causing a few scares {{at the other end}} of the park, Basel were defeated 2–0 at the Estádio José Alvalade. On Matchday 3 (22 October), Barcelona visited Basel and came away with a 5–0 win, but a fortnight later it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story</b> as FCB came away with a respectable 1–1 draw at the Camp Nou, with Eren Derdiyok scoring a late equaliser after Lionel Messi put Barça ahead. On 26 November, Basel travelled to Ukraine to play Shakhtar, where they were thrashed 5–0. Basel then faced Sporting at home on the final Matchday (9 December) and were defeated 1–0.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{painting}} and architecture were not areas of strength for the Abbasid dynasty, pottery <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story.</b> The Islamic {{culture as a}} whole and the Abbasid's, in particular, were at the forefront of new ideas and techniques. Some examples of their work were pieces engraved with decorations and then colored with yellow-brown, green, and purple glazes. Designs were diverse with geometric patterns, Kufic lettering, arabesque scrollwork, along with rosettes, animals, birds, and humans. Abbasid pottery from the 8th and 9th centuries have been found throughout the region, as far as Cairo. These were generally made with a yellow clay and fired multiple times with separate glazes to produce metallic luster in shades of gold, brown, or red. By the 9th century, the potters had mastered their techniques and their decorative designs could be divided into two styles. The Persian style would show animals, birds, humans, along with Kufic lettering in gold. Pieces excavated from Samarra exceed in vibrancy and beauty any from later periods. These predominantly being made for the Caliphs use. Tiles were also made utilizing this same technique to create both monochromic and polychromic luster tiles.|$|E
25|$|Basel's {{place in}} the last 16 was all but secured, {{although}} they still {{had to make sure}} they did not lose to Liverpool in the last game of the first group stage. On the last matchday, Basel were winning 3–0 at half-time through goals from Julio Rossi, Christian Giménez and Timothée Atouba. The second half <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story,</b> however, and Liverpool fought back to draw 3–3. This was still enough for FCB to qualify for the next round. In the last 16, Basel faced Manchester United, Juventus, and Deportivo de La Coruña. They had a poor start, losing back to back games against Manchester United at home and Juventus away. FCB then faced Deportivo in a double-header, with the home side winning 1–0 in both games. Arguably, two of FCB's greatest games came next as they held United to a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford and claimed a 2–1 victory over Juventus at St. Jakob-Park. Despite picking up the same number of points as second-placed Juventus, Basel crashed out on goal difference. Basel finished second in the Swiss Super League that season and won the Swiss Cup after beating Neuchâtel Xamax 6–0 in the final.|$|E

The following year, Grange and his agent formed a rival league and stationed a competing team, led by Grange, in New York. Though the Giants lost $50,000 that season, the rival league folded and was subsumed into the NFL. Following the 1930 season, Mara transferred ownership of the team over to his two sons to insulate the team from creditors, and by 1946, he had given over complete control of the team to them. Jack, the older son, controlled the business aspects, while Wellington controlled the on-field operations. After their initial struggles the Giants financial status stabilized, and they led the league in attendance several times in the 1930s and 1940s.* , The New York Times, December 24, 1940.

25|$|During {{the first}} years of Prohibition, the new law was {{enforced}} in regions such as the rural South and western states, where it had popular support; however, in large urban cities and small industrial or mining towns, residents defied or ignored the law. The Ku Klux Klan was a major supporter of Prohibition; once it was passed they helped with its enforcement. For example, in 1923, Klansmen traded pistol shots with bootleggers, burned down roadhouses, and whipped liquor sellers, and anybody else who broke the moral code. The Prohibition was effective in reducing per-capita consumption, and consumption remained lower for a quarter-century after Prohibition had been repealed. Sale of alcoholic beverages remained illegal during Prohibition, but alcoholic drinks were still available. Large quantities of alcohol were smuggled into the United States from Canada, over land, by sea routes along both ocean coasts, and through the Great Lakes, and alcohol was diverted from the limited exceptions to the Volsted Act: medicinal and religious. While the federal government cracked down on alcohol consumption on land within the United States, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story</b> along the U.S. coastlines, where vessels outside the 3-mile limit were exempt. In addition, home brewing was popular during Prohibition. Malt and hops stores popped up across the country and some former breweries turned to selling malt extract syrup, ostensibly for baking and beverage purposes.|$|E
25|$|The 2002–03 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story</b> for Anaheim. With a {{new head}} coach in Mike Babcock, the Mighty Ducks {{were one of the}} best teams {{during the second half of}} the season, {{finishing}} with a record of 40–27–9–6 for 95 points. At the NHL trade deadline, the team sent Jean-Francois Damphousse and Mike Commodore to Calgary in exchange for Rob Niedermayer. The Mighty Ducks also picked up Steve Thomas from the Chicago Blackhawks for a fifth-round draft pick. After a three-year playoff hiatus, Anaheim qualified for the 2003 playoffs. For the third-straight post-season in which they participated in, however, the Mighty Ducks met the defending Stanley Cup champion Red Wings as the seventh seed. This time, however, Anaheim shocked the hockey world as they swept Detroit in the series, with Steve Rucchin's series-clincher on goaltender Curtis Joseph coming in overtime of Game 4. The Ducks then defeated the top-seeded Dallas Stars in six games in the Western Conference Semifinals, which was noted for Game 1 being the fourth-longest game in NHL history, with the Ducks winning in the fifth overtime period from a Petr Sykora goal. In the Conference Finals, the Ducks made quick work of the upstart Minnesota Wild, allowing only one goal the entire series, to earn their first-ever Western Conference championship and berth in the Stanley Cup Finals. Jean-Sebastien Giguere became a celebrity in Southern California with his outstanding play. Giguere posted a shutout streak in the Western Conference Finals of 217 minutes, 54 seconds. In between the Conference Finals and the Stanley Cup Finals, Giguere appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.|$|E

The Tatuus factory team fielded three drivers, Italian Rino Mastronardi, Norwegian Tommy Rustad and Brazilian Enrique Bernoldi. The team competed in the Eurocup Formula Renault, Tommy Rustad won three races during the inaugural season for the team. The first title for the Tatuus factory team and chassis came in 1996. Enrique Bernoldi won six out of ten races and took the title. Teammate Danilo Cascio was places seventh. David Cook entered a Tatuus customer car in the British Formula Renault championship. In this very competitive championship Cook beat Darren Turner to the 1996 title. Other customer Tatuus chassis were entered in the French Formula Renault, Antoine Brousseau achieved a {{second place in the}} championship. A Tatuus chassis also took the title in the German Formula Renault with driver Alexander Müller. 1997 was a highly successful for the team and the chassis. The team scored a one-two finish in the European championship. Jeffrey van Hooydonk and Max Busnelli were a class on their own securing the first and second place in the championship. The top ten were seven Tatuus and three Martini cars. Three Tatuus customer entries filled the podium in the German championship. Robert Lechner won the title in front of Thomas Mutsch and Michael Schröter. Marc Hynes, driving a customer Tatuus, won the British title. The French championship, however, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story.</b> France, home of Mygale, Martini and Renault, had the most competitive Formula Renault championship. Benoît Tréluyer driving a Tatuus was placed sixth in the championship standings, scoring one win and four podium finishes out of 17 races. Tatuus again was the chassis to beat in the European, British and German championships. Lucas Lasserre managed to achieve a third place in the French championship, behind two factory entered Mygales. Tatuus again dominated the British championship in 1999 with Tatuus chassis winning 12 out of 13 races, Antônio Pizzonia took the title. Tatuus customer entries also won the European and German championships. Lucas Lasserre now took the title in the prestigious French championship. In heavy competition between Mygale, Martini and Tatuus, Tatuus prevailed winning 14 out of 21 races.|$|E

The team's abbreviated practices, held at 4:30 PM each day so as not to conflict with work schedules, also allowed for little in-season improvement. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. Mara had to spend $25,000 of his own money during the season just to keep the franchise alive. [...] This struggle continued until the 11th game of the season when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting more than 73,000 fans—a pro football record.
