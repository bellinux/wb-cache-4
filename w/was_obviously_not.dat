25|$|The {{earliest}} notated {{sources of}} Gregorian chant (written ca. 950) used symbols called neumes (Gr. sign, of the hand) to indicate tone-movements and relative duration within each syllable. A sort of musical stenography {{that seems to}} focus on gestures and tone-movements but not the specific pitches of individual notes, nor the relative starting pitches of each neume. Given the fact that Chant was learned in an oral tradition in which the texts and melodies were sung from memory, this <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> necessary. The neumatic manuscripts display great sophistication and precision in notation and a wealth of graphic signs to indicate the musical gesture and proper pronunciation of the text.|$|E
25|$|The legal {{definitions}} decreed: The {{marriage of}} a Gentile husband and his wife, being a Jewess or being {{classified as a}} Jewess due to her descent, was {{generally considered to be}} a privileged mixed marriage, unless they had children, who were enrolled in a Jewish congregation. Then the husband <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> the dominant part in the family and the wife had to wear the yellow badge and the children as well, who were thus discriminated against as Geltungsjuden. Without children, or with children not enrolled with a Jewish congregation, the Jewish-classified wife was spared from wearing the yellow badge (else compulsory for Germans classified as Jews as of 1 September 1941).|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Zionists who quote the Maharal's commentary on Ketubot, anti-Zionist writers {{have said that}} even if the oaths are to be seen as decrees, it <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> God's intent that the Jewish people should keep trying to return to the Land of Israel and build a state until they hit the right moment. In view of the harsh consequences of failure ("I will declare your flesh ownerless like the gazelles and hinds of the field"), this would be as foolish as playing Russian roulette. Furthermore, the success of the State of Israel so far is not proof that the decree has been annulled, since the future of the state is still uncertain.|$|E

Aside from the well-known Fairlie and Meyer types, the Garratt had contemporary and similarly-designed competition {{in the form of the}} Union-Garratt, Modified Fairlie and Golwé. Of these, the closest was the Union-Garratt, a type originally conceived owing to the perceived necessity for a rigid connection between a bunker or tender and a firebox fed by a mechanical stoker. Though it could be argued that the NZR G class locomotives were Union-Garratts (having their bunkers mounted on the boiler frames, rather than on the hind engine unit), a more concrete example can be seen in the two South African Railways Union Garratts of classes GH and U.|$|E

500|$|The games' {{graphics}} and audio also received praise and criticism from reviewers. IGN's {{review of the}} PSP version of My Spanish Coach noted {{that the fact that}} the game appeared on multiple platforms contributed to its [...] "sparse look and feel" [...] because the games' {{graphics and}} audio were made for the Nintendo DS. Eurogamer praised the games' [...] "clean, crisp visuals" [...] and [...] "jolly accordion music and jolly fiesta music". In contrast, IGN's review of the DS versions of both games called the music [...] "catchy but repetitive" [...] and the graphics [...] "cute but nothing to write home about". GameZone noted that [...] "he visual concept <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> a front runner in [...] conception", and that the audio of neither game [...] " [...] anything remotely special". Nintendo World Report made note of the games' narrator during the lessons, praising its [...] "clear and coherent glory" [...] in terms of pronouncing the words correctly.|$|E

500|$|Cardus did {{not find}} his duties at Shrewsbury onerous. He made {{frequent}} trips to Manchester, for Hallé concerts or to watch Thomas Beecham conduct at the Manchester Opera House. He found time for other work; thus, in 1913, he was the music critic for the northern edition of The Daily Citizen. This short-lived newspaper was an official organ of the early Labour Party; mainly out of admiration for Bernard Shaw Cardus had joined the Independent Labour Party, but quickly lost interest in socialism: [...] "Their creed or system <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> to be {{a means to an}} end but an end in itself". According to Brookes, the influence of Shrewsbury School affected Cardus to the extent that [...] "he playing fields of an English public school were for him a more natural setting than the iconoclastic frenzy of the Lyons café where socialism vied with Richard Strauss for pride of place in the race to modernity". The Daily Citizen paid poorly, and Cardus's association with it soon ended.|$|E

[...] The station buildings were demolished in 1965, but the main station area is now a nature reserve just off Powell Street, called Station Fields and part of the edge of the northbound platform is still in situ. The track running through the station site is, however, still in use.|$|E

2500|$|The anointed {{ones and}} the seventy years (Chapter 9): Daniel reinterprets Jeremiah's [...] "seventy years" [...] prophecy {{regarding}} the period Israel would spend in bondage to Babylon. From {{the point of}} view of the Maccabean era, Jeremiah's promise <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> true – the gentiles still oppressed the Jews, and the [...] "desolation of Jerusalem" [...] had not ended. Daniel therefore reinterprets the seventy years as seventy [...] "weeks" [...] of years, making up 490 years. The 70 weeks/490 years are subdivided, with seven [...] "weeks" [...] from the [...] "going forth of the word to rebuild and restore Jerusalem" [...] to the coming of an [...] "anointed one", while the final [...] "week" [...] is marked by the violent death of another [...] "anointed one", probably the High Priest Onias III (ousted to make way for Jason and murdered in 171 BC), and the profanation of the Temple. The point of this for Daniel is that the period of gentile power is predetermined, and is coming to an end.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{in other}} parts of India, in the eastern state of Odisha the devadasis, also known colloquially as Mahari(s)of the Jagannath temple complex, were never sexually liberal, and have been {{expected}} to remain celibate from the time they became devadasis. However, they did have relationships and children, so this practice <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> strictly adhered to. It is said that the daughters of the Maharis of the Jagannath temple took to other professions such as nursing in the mid 20th century, because of the stigma attached to their inherent profession, which does suggest prostitution. Devadasi is a name given to a group of women who danced in the temple premises. The word devadasi or mahari means [...] "those great women who can control natural human impulses, their five senses and can submit themselves completely to God (Vachaspati)." [...] Mahari means Mohan Nari that is, the woman belonging to God. Sri Chaitanayadev had defined devadasis as 'Sebaets' who served God through dance and music. Pankaj Charan Das, the oldest Guru of Odissi classical dance, who comes from a Mahari family, explains Mahari as Maha Ripu -Ari (one who conquers the five main ripus - enemies).|$|E
2500|$|During {{a hearing}} before the Joint Economic Committee October 4, 2011, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said, [...] "eople are quite unhappy {{with the state of}} the economy and what’s happening. They blame, with some justification, the {{problems}} in the financial sector for getting us into this mess, and they’re dissatisfied with the policy response here in Washington. And at some level, I can’t blame them. Certainly, 9 percent unemployment and very slow growth is not a good situation." [...] On November 2, he again expressed sympathy with frustrations about the economy but also said many of the complaints levied at the Fed, including those made against the steps it took during the financial crisis, are misguided. “The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions,” he said. “A very simplistic interpretation of that [...] was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve banker salaries. That <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> the case.” Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard W. Fisher said that he was [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to the views of the protesters, and added, [...] "We have too many people out of work. We have a very uneven distribution of income. We have a very frustrated people, and I can understand their frustration." ...|$|E

2500|$|These {{protocols}} gave {{rules for}} imperial progresses {{to and from}} certain churches at Constantinople and the imperial palace, with fixed stations and rules for ritual actions and acclamations from specified participants (the text of acclamations and processional troparia or kontakia, but also heirmoi are mentioned), among them also ministers, senate members, leaders of the [...] "Blues" [...] (Venetoi) and the [...] "Greens" [...] (Prasinoi)—chariot teams during the hippodrome's horse races. They had an important role during court ceremonies. The following chapters (84–95) are taken from a 6th-century manual by Peter the Patrician. They rather describe administrative ceremonies such as the appointment of certain functionaries (ch. 84,85), investitures of certain offices (86), the reception of ambassadors and the proclamation of the Western Emperor (87,88), the reception of Persian ambassadors (89,90), Anagorevseis of certain Emperors (91–96), the appointment of the senate's proedros (97). The [...] "palace order" [...] did not only prescribe the way of movements (symbolic or real) including on foot, mounted, by boat, but also the costumes of the celebrants and who has to perform certain acclamations. The emperor often {{plays the role of}} Christ and the imperial palace is chosen for religious rituals, so that the ceremonial book brings the sacred and the profane together. Book II seems to be less normative and <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> compiled from older sources like book I, which often mentioned outdated imperial offices and ceremonies, it rather describes particular ceremonies as they had been celebrated during particular imperial receptions during the Macedonian renaissance.|$|E
