40|$|The {{machine to}} be used as the power source is first {{evaluated}} by means of the usual indirect tests. These tests confirm that the machine has acceptable steady state characteristics for welding and a basic excitation control circuit is employed to give the desired control of the output from the generator. The initial welds made are very unsatisfactory and attempts to improve the weldability by modifying the characteristics of the control circuit are unsuccessful. Only by increasing the time constant of the output circuit through the addition of series inductance can the desired improvements be obtained. At this stage an investigation into the electrical characteristics of the D. C. welding arc is carried out. This reveals the extreme transient nature of the arc load on the generator and design criteria for good weldability can now be employed to achieve satisfactory results. Field excitation of the alternator is varied by means of current feedback from the output circuit which is able to produce high welding currents when using a low voltage reference supply from a battery. The initial evaluation has to be repeated on a new design of alternator and tests indicate that a suitable A. C. reactor in the output from the alternator will produce a more desirable transient response to the arc load. Different types of current control are tried in order to obtain the best type and range of welding characteristics. The design of the most important components which make up the <b>welding</b> <b>generator</b> is discussed and the proposed layout for the complete set is given...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} years, {{globalization}} {{and the necessity}} to reduce production costs have pushed industry to employ more and more manufacturing robotized cells. This trend has been assimilated by arc welding too. The use of robotic systems allows to increase the performance of productive systems by means of reduction in lead-time, reproducibility of processes and increase in quality. However, process automation needs pre-scheduling of manufacturing cell movements and also a setup of different welding parameters, such as power provided by the <b>welding</b> <b>generator,</b> arc length and robot speed, all of which allows to get a joint without defects. An online scheduling of robotic systems brings certainly a delay in production times, whereas offline scheduling allows to maintain the desired production without any production stop. An interface that allows to easily translate the coordinate points established by a simulation software (such as Robcad) in some complete programs that {{can be sent to}} the controller of the manufacturing cell, has been developed. Besides, in order to improve the jointâ€™s quality, an analysis of the joint quality has been carried out by macrographic analysis. The employment of image analysis techniques on the obtained macrographs allowed to translate the morphology of each joint in terms of a matrix. After different morphologies have been distinguished in numerical terms and correlated to the jointâ€™s quality, these data have been introduced as input to the interface. The output, constituted by the program for the controller of the cell and the best welding parameters, under such conditions, has allowed to increase both the cellâ€™s productivity {{and the quality of the}} joints. Therefore, during offline scheduling, the initial phase of loop control of the joint morphology allows to evaluate the best welding parameters both in terms of productivity and joint quality. The same interface allows also to plan the best parameters for different welded joints with varying thickness and typology, which makes the system more eflexible and maintains a high level of productivity. The whole system has been implemented on a robotized cell GMAW Gas Metal Arc Welding Comau, that foresees a welding robot with six degrees of freedom and a position system with other six freedom degrees. Different T fillet joints have been realized at using of weathering steel sheets 5 and 6 mm thick...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A Virtual Machine {{has led to}} a fully {{automatic}} spot welding system. All necessary parameters are created by measuring systems and algorithms running in the Virtual Machine. A hybrid operating circuit allows the Virtual Machine to read the exact process voltage between the tips of the electrodes every 50 Âµs. Actual welding voltage and current allow for the first time reading process impedance, electric power and total energy being transferred to the spot weld. Necessary energy input is calculated by a calorimetric model after measuring the total thickness of the materials to be welded as soon as the welding gun is positioned at the workpiece. A precision potentiometer implemented in the gun delivers the total material thickness within the 0. 1 mm range during the pre-pressure phases.

40|$|The tube to {{tube sheet}} (TTS) <b>welds</b> of steam <b>generator</b> of Fast Breeder Reactor {{is the most}} {{critical}} joint. This is because, sodium flows on shell side and water on tube side. Any failure would thus be catastrophic. Microfocal radiography is an established technique {{that is being used}} for the evaluation of such welds. Using microfocal radiography pores of the order of 25 microns could be detected. Microfocal radiography of TTS joints is primarily accomplished using a backward throw rod anode. Such an arrangement however is beset with its own problems. The angled beam results in uneven beam intensity across the weld. During actual weld radiography, the trailing edge of the beam where intensity is minimum, traverses a longer distance than the leading edge which compounds the problem of density variation. This results in uneven radiographic density and contrast. It is a well-known fact that sensitivity achievable in radiography is a function of radiographic contrast and definition. Radiographic contrast in turn is affected by subject and film contrast. Uneven radiographic contrasts make interpretation complex and sometimes result in unacceptable density variations. To overcome this problem, the authors devised a novel solution. Using appropriately designed and fabricated filters and image processing techniques, authors have successfully developed procedures for ensuring uniformity i...|$|R
