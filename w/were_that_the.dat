5|$|After Final Resolution with Kurt Angle {{retaining}} the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, TNA had {{to determine who}} he would face at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008. On the January 17, 2008 episode of Impact!, Samoa Joe, Christian Cage, and A.J. Styles fought in a Three Way match {{to determine the number}} one contender. Stipulations for the match <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> winner would get a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match against Angle at Against All Odds, however if Styles won he could choose instead of the title match to allow Angle to not have to defend his title for two months. Cage ended up winning the contest, setting up Angle versus Cage at Against All Odds. On the January 24, 2008 episode of Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Joe would be the Special Outside Enforcer at Against All Odds due him being controversially disqualified during the match. Angle defeated Cage at Against All Odds after interference from Tomko.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, most {{researchers}} considered the heterodontosaurids {{as a distinct}} family of primitive ornithischian dinosaurs, but with an uncertain position with respect to other groups within the order. By the early 21st century, the prevailing theories <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> family was the sister group of either the Marginocephalia (which includes pachycephalosaurids and ceratopsians), or the Cerapoda (the former group plus ornithopods), or {{as one of the}} most basal radiations of ornithischians, before the split of the Genasauria (which includes the derived ornithischians). Heterodontosauridae was defined as a clade by Sereno in 1998 and 2005, and the group shares skull features such as three or fewer teeth in each premaxilla, caniniform teeth followed by a diastema, and a jugal horn below the eye. In 2017, similarities between the skeletons of Heterodontosaurus and the early theropod Eoraptor were used to suggest that ornithischians should be grouped with theropods in a group called Ornithoscelida. Traditionally, theropods have been grouped with sauropodomorphs in the group Saurischia.|$|E
5|$|Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland {{were both}} under {{contract}} to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer but the studio had not put them to work in films. With their contracts coming up for renewal, feelings among studio executives <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> studio didn't need two girl singers. Every Sunday would serve as an extended screen test to decide which girl's contract would be renewed.|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} {{problems are}} present in coal mining in China: one <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> capacity in maintaining safety in mining is relatively low; <b>the</b> second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> technology and equipment, technical management, and the technical innovation level are not at a high level; <b>the</b> third <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> waste of resources is relatively serious; <b>the</b> fourth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> added-value and technological-content of products are relatively low; <b>the</b> fifth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> centralization of business is relatively low.|$|R
50|$|For 7 {{year olds}} (Key Stage 1) <b>the</b> general {{expectation}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority of pupils will attain Level 2 in each individual subject.

50|$|Another {{possibility}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{government might}} decide to increase its own spending - say, by building more highways. <b>The</b> idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> additional government spending creates jobs and lowers the unemployment rate.|$|R
5|$|Hastings {{left the}} failed mining {{operation}} in 1899, and travelled to London. Just after he arrived, the Second Boer War broke out, and the British government called for volunteers to join an expeditionary force. The only qualifications required <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> recruit could ride and shoot, and Hastings immediately applied {{to join the}} Suffolk Imperial Yeomanry. He was accepted, and {{after two weeks of}} training the regiment were given horses and boarded the S.S. Goth Castle to South Africa. The ship reached Cape Town after three weeks, and the regiment disembarked. Their horses were considered too weak to be ridden, and so they were instead discharged and either put down or given to other soldiers. Hastings did not enjoy his time in the army; the weather was poor, the orders given were confusing and they were provided with minimal equipment.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Bayern {{purchased}} {{land near}} the Allianz Arena {{with the purpose}} of building a new youth academy. In 2015 the project, estimated to cost €70 million, was started, after overcoming internal resistance. The main reasons for the project <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> existing facilities were too small and that the club, while very successful at senior level, lacked competitiveness with other German and European clubs at youth level. The new facility is scheduled to open in the 2017–18 season.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September, the University of Leicester team {{announced}} that the human remains were a possible candidate for Richard's body, but emphasised the need for caution. The positive indicators <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> body was of an adult male; it was buried beneath the choir of the church; it had severe scoliosis of the spine possibly making one shoulder higher than the other. An object {{that appeared to be}} an arrowhead was found under the spine and the skull had severe injuries.|$|E
40|$|A {{generalized}} gradient projection filter algorithm for inequality constrained optimization is presented. It {{has three}} merits. <b>The</b> first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> amount of computation is lower, since the gradient matrix only {{needs to be}} computed one time at each iterate. <b>The</b> second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> paper uses the filter technique instead of any penalty function for constrained programming. <b>The</b> third <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> algorithm <b>is</b> of global convergence and locally superlinear convergence under some mild conditions...|$|R

5|$|One {{alternative}} was the turbo-electric drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which then drove the propellers. This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which {{used it for}} all dreadnoughts from late 1915–1922. The advantages of this method were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.|$|E
5|$|Originally the {{unlimited}} company Bjorøy og Tyssøy ANS {{had been}} attempted established with capital from locals, but instead the company Fastlandssambandet Bjorøy – Tyssøy AS was established on 29 September 1993. Capital for NOK40,000 was paid by Fjell Municipality, NOK20,000 by Sund Municipality and NOK10,000 by Jack Jahnsen. The plans {{were sent to}} the Ministry of Transport and Communications in October 1992, who started working on a proposal for parliament in January 1993. Issues raised by the ministry <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> loans had been issued in 1987, and whether the land estimated value of the guaranteed real estate was real. The project was presented to the Parliament of Norway, who must approve all toll roads. By then the costs were estimated at NOK61.5 million, including NOK4.5 million in ordinary county grants and NOK30 million in extraordinary county grants. The proposal estimated annual toll collection costs to NOK825,000, with the collection taking place on Bjorøy. It was originally planned that the toll plaza would be manned between 06:00 and 22:00, meaning passing would be free at night.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage {{in some form of}} social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed {{over a period of time}} using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E
30|$|However, VCO 2 -based {{calorimetry}} has two methodological challenges. <b>The</b> first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> method {{requires a}} choice of RQ to be made, and <b>the</b> second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of the estimation is affected by instant variability in measurements of MV and VCO 2.|$|R
50|$|A police lineup is {{a method}} for an {{eyewitness}} to identify a perpetrator by viewing a series of photos, or a live group of suspects. One possible outcome of a lineup <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can correctly identify the criminal. Another outcome <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can correctly state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>is</b> not in the lineup. A third option <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can fail to recognize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> culprit <b>is</b> present. Lastly, the eyewitness can incorrectly select another suspect. The ideal result is to correctly identify the offender, and the worst outcome is to mistakenly identify an innocent.|$|R
50|$|Equivalent {{conditions}} <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> line bundle KX <b>is</b> big, or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> d-canonical map <b>is</b> generically injective (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> a birational map to its image) for d sufficiently large.|$|R
5|$|The United States, Canada and Germany, {{together}} with two unnamed teams, lodged a protest with officials following Williams' successful {{first day of}} competition. The protest alleged that her helmet was illegal, as ridges in it might give her an unfair aerodynamic advantage. In accordance with competition rules, the jury of officials inspected the helmet, and rejected the protest. Their grounds for doing so <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ridges in the helmet were not a separate piece affixed to the helmet, expressly banned by FIBT rules, but rather {{an integral part of}} the helmet, which made the helmet legal. A second protest, filed jointly by the US and Canada on the 19th, was also rejected.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{questions}} raised by Kulakov <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> claimed alpha decay energy of sergenium was many orders of magnitude lower than expected and the half-life given was eight orders of magnitude shorter than what would be predicted for a nuclide alpha decaying with the claimed decay energy, {{but at the same}} time a corrected half-life in the region of 1016years would be impossible as it would imply that the samples contained about 100milligrams of sergenium. In 2003 it was suggested that the observed alpha decay with energy 4.5MeV could be due to a low-energy and strongly enhanced transition between different hyperdeformed states of a hassium isotope around 271Hs, thus suggesting that the existence of superheavy elements in nature was at least possible, although unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The {{cost of the}} Senedd {{increased}} from £12M in 1997 to £69.6M in 2006, an increase of 580%. In a report published in March 2008 by the Wales Audit Office, {{the reason for the}} difference between the two costs <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original estimate of £12M was not based on any detailed design of the final requirements of the building. Extra costs of the building were due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks in the United States.|$|E
30|$|The {{advantage}} of DS theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> evidence can <b>be</b> associated with multiple possible events, for example, sets of events.

25|$|The {{result of}} the 1845 Bill {{submission}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> preamble <b>was</b> proved but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Committee stage in the House of Lords rejected the Bill: this meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> desirability of the line <b>was</b> accepted, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> detail of Moorsom's design was considered unsafe.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{complication}} of AC circuits <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resistance and conductance can be frequency-dependent.

5|$|The essay {{begins by}} declaring that anarchists had {{correctly}} resisted the war from its inception, {{and that the}} authors would prefer a peace brought about by an international conference of European workers. It then submits that German workers would most likely also favor such a conclusion to the war, and presents several reasons why {{it would be in}} their best interest to call for an armistice. These reasons <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> citizens, after twenty months of war, would understand that they had been deceived into believing they were taking part in a defensive war; that they would recognize that the German state had long prepared for such a conflict, and as such it would be inevitably at fault; that the German Empire could not logistically support an occupation of the territory it had captured; and that the individuals living in the occupied territories were free to choose whether or not they would like to be annexed.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} {{to build a}} wind farm, in {{a joint venture between}} United Utilities and Peel Holdings, was announced in 2003. Shortly afterwards a pressure group, The Friends of Scout and Knowle Moor, was formed, and on 9 September 2003 representatives of the group attended a meeting of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury's, Ramsbottom and Tottington Area Board to oppose the plans. At the meeting, the spokesperson for the group said that, although they supported the use of alternative energy, they felt that this was the wrong area. Among the objections <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scheme was contrary to the Unitary Development Plan and the Green Belt, and would adversely affect common land, open countryside and areas of ecological importance and special landscape value. The group also considered that the proposed development would be out of scale with the landscape, adversely affecting peat, water courses and wildlife, and would have a seriously detrimental visual impact, as well as causing a noise nuisance.|$|E
5|$|The {{terms of}} {{surrender}} <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British and their camp followers {{would be allowed}} to withdraw, under French escort, to Fort Edward, with the full honours of war, on condition that they refrain from fighting for 18 months. They were allowed to keep their muskets and a single symbolic cannon, but no ammunition. In addition, British authorities were to release French prisoners within three months.|$|E
40|$|It <b>was</b> {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> p-mode power <b>is</b> substantially suppressed in magnetic regions. One {{possible explanation}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> upper turning point, the acoustic cut-off {{point of the}} solar p-modes is lowered {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field. A related possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> attenuation length scale in the evanescent region is reduced {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field. It <b>is</b> likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> observations sample a different position in the evanescent tails of the eigenfunctions in magnetic regions because of different temperature structures in these regions.

40|$|Reasons for {{prescribing}} antibiotics by official names <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> doctor <b>is</b> {{more likely}} to understand what he <b>is</b> prescribing, <b>that</b> it enables <b>the</b> literature to be internationally understood, and <b>that</b> non-branded products <b>are</b> less costly.

5|$|Across {{the army}} {{boundary}} on the right, the ROK 1st Division continued its attack northwest and {{advanced to the}} edge of Ka-san. The ROK 11th Regiment seized Hill 755 about dark on September 14, and small elements of the ROK 15th Regiment reached the stone ramparts of the Ka-san area at the same time. The ROK and North Korean troops fought during the night and on into the 15th at many points along the high mountain backbone that extends southeast from Ka-san to Hills 755 and 783 and on to P'algong-san. Prisoners taken by the ROK's estimated that there were about 800 North Koreans on this high ridge. The ROK 1st Division later estimated that approximately 3,000 North Koreans were inside Ka-san's walled perimeter and about 1,500 or 2,000 outside it near the crest. At this time the bulk of the NK 1st Division was gradually withdrawing into Ka-san and its vicinity. Indications <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NK 13th Division also was withdrawing northward. Aerial observers on the afternoon of September 14 reported that an estimated 500 North Korean troops were moving north from Tabu-dong. While these signs were hopeful, Walker continued to prepare for a final close-in defense of Taegu. As part of this, fourteen battalions of South Korean police dug in around the city.|$|E

30|$|One {{reason of}} these {{increases}} might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> impact of FTO substrate samples {{on the environment}} is reduced, in which the process was in a nitrogen-filled glovebox while the reported process was in the air.

For ITO, the oxygen hole as carrier reduction causes the decrease of conductivity after annealing. The third reason might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> light transmittance of the FTO substrate was a little higher than <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> ITO substrate.|$|R
