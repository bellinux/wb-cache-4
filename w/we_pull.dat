500|$|The {{music video}} was co-directed by Ray Kay and Beyoncé for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was {{released}} the same month: {{it was one}} of eight videos shot in two weeks for the album. The choreography was done by Danielle Polanco and Jonte' Moaning, who used a 1980s retro set. Beyoncé explained the concept of the video at MTV: [...] "It's probably the most flamboyant video, and the metallic dresses are so beautiful, they added so much color. I had to do a video for this song. Everyone wanted to know what a 'freakum dress' was, and you can't really explain it, you have to see it. Everyone has their own version, so we had so many women — of different races, sizes, shapes, ages — because we all have those dresses <b>we</b> <b>pull</b> out when we need to shut it down." ...|$|E
500|$|New York Times public editor (ombudsman) Elizabeth Spayd {{wrote in}} 2016 that [...] "Conservatives and even many moderates, see in The Times a blue-state worldview" [...] and accuse it of {{harboring}} a liberal bias. Spayd did not analyze {{the substance of}} the claim, but did opine that the Times is [...] "part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country. That in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources." [...] Times executive editor Dean Baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias, but that: [...] "We have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in The New York Times. I want us to be perceived as fair and honest to the world, not just a segment of it. It's a really difficult goal. Do <b>we</b> <b>pull</b> it off all the time? No." ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{explains}} {{what they do}} {{when they get to}} a city: [...] "Sometimes we get to the city that morning. We sometimes come straight to the venue. <b>We</b> <b>pull</b> up, everybody comes out, you shower, then you do your sound check. Then it's time to get ready. Hair, makeup, that's the fun part." [...] Rihanna then shows her dressing room, makeup artists and costumes. She explains how she loves wearing black on stage because she is [...] "good girl gone bad and black is kind of gothic and rock n' roll". Rihanna explains how she is nervous before the beginning of the show because of the atmosphere where all of her fans are screaming her name. According to her, the beginning of the show is up-tempo and loud, before becoming a little bit [...] "mellow" [...] at the middle of it. The show then gets [...] "on party" [...] again with their techno club set-list. The encore consists of [...] "Question Existing" [...] and [...] "Umbrella". According to Rihanna, [...] "Question Existing" [...] is a very personal song which American singer Ne-Yo wrote [...] "on behalf of entertainers". She concluded that it is very hard for her to call herself a superstar. The Documentary Feature ends with Rihanna announcing that in the end of 2008 she will be hitting the studio again and [...] "she won't be away for too long".|$|E

500|$|On {{allowing}} {{directors and}} writers {{to work within}} Marvel's shared universe concept, Joe Russo said that Feige has [...] "big pieces that he knows he wants to build towards, but {{the way that you}} get there is open to interpretation and improv a little bit." [...] For the Russos in The Winter Soldier, they {{had to deal with the}} idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. being infiltrated by Hydra, with Joe saying, [...] "how we get there is all up to us. And I think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film." [...] Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team [...] "come up with conceptually what we want to do" [...] for a film, then we will ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can <b>we</b> <b>pull</b> some of that into this film? That's where you start looking for the interconnectedness, but it's very important early on that the concept be created in a bubble because you have to protect the idea, it has to be driven by storytelling. Kevin's ... always in the mindset of [...] "let's just make this movie now and worry about the next movie when it comes." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, <b>we</b> <b>pull</b> from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E
2500|$|In recent times, a {{combination}} of animal rights groups and law enforcement agencies have drawn new attention to dog fighting and related criminal activities in the United States. A story in the New York Daily News published on June 10, 2007, stated [...] "dog fighting is a multi-million-dollar industry {{that is part of}} an underground subculture that holds its events in secret locations. It is extremely difficult for authorities to prove who has dogs for fighting purposes." [...] A few weeks later, in Buffalo, New York, police and animal control officers at the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter rescued 15 pit bulls believed to be part of dogfighting activities during a two-week period. Authorities found pit bulls — dead and alive — as well as [...] "dogfighting kits", which include harnesses, muzzles, pre-fight training guides, stacks of breeding papers, and even videos on dogfighting. [...] "We have been back to the same house three different times, and each time <b>we</b> <b>pull</b> out more and more dogs," [...] said Animal Control Officer Andrew Kleinfelder. [...] "Even when someone is arrested, a normal pit bull fighting ring has at least 30 people involved. Someone keeps the fights going." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 6 March 2014, Prince Harry {{launched}} Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style {{sporting event}} for injured servicemen and women, {{which was held}} on 10–14 September 2014. Prince Harry met British hopefuls for the Invictus Games at Tedworth House {{for the start of}} the selection process on 29 April 2014. On 15 May 2014, Harry attended a ticket sale launch for Invictus Games at BT Tower, where he made a public tweet on the Invictus Games' official Twitter account as the president of Invictus Games. To promote the Games, Prince Harry was interviewed by BBC Radio 2's Chris Evans along with two Invictus Games hopefuls. He said: [...] "This (Invictus Games) is basically my full-time job at the moment, making sure that <b>we</b> <b>pull</b> this off." [...] The show aired on 31 July 2014. Harry later wrote an article in The Sunday Times about his experiences in Afghanistan: how they had inspired him to help injured personnel and how, after the trip to the Warrior Games, he had vowed to create the Invictus Games. Harry and officials attended the British Armed Forces Team announcement for Invictus Games at Potters Field Park in August 2014, and as president of the Invictus Games, Harry attended all events related to the Games from 8 to 14 September 2014.|$|E
