5|$|The Shishugou Formation {{represents}} {{a variety of}} depositional environments, including alluvial fans and alluvial plains, streams, wetlands, and shallow lakes. During the time when Limusaurus lived, the environment would have been consistently <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>dry,</b> judging by the abundance of coal and carbon-rich deposits. The climate was probably highly seasonal due to monsoonal influences, with warm, wet summers and dry winters. The climate enabled {{the growth of a}} richly forested environment; the forest would have been dominated by Araucaria trees, with the undergrowth being occupied by Coniopteris tree ferns, Anglopteris and Osmunda ferns, Equisetites horsetails, and Elatocladus shrubs.|$|E

However, {{unlike many other}} cities with this climate, Baku does not see extremely hot summers. This is largely because of its northerly latitude {{and the fact that}} it is located on a peninsula on the shore of the Caspian Sea.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{climate change}} is {{substantially}} affecting the spatial pattern of geographical zones, and the temporal and spatial inconsistency of climatic <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> patterns contributes {{to the complexity of}} the shifting of temperature and aridity zones. Eastern Inner Mongolia, China, located in the interface region of different biomes and ecogeographic zones, has experienced dramatic <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> over the past several decades. In this study, the annual accumulated temperature above 10 A degrees C (AAT 10) and the aridity index, two key indicators in geographical regionalization, are used to assess <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> processes <b>and</b> track the movements of temperature and aridity zones from 1960 to 2008. The results show a significant warming at the regional level from 1960 to 2008 with an AAT 10 increase rate of 7. 89 A degrees C center dot d/year (p < 0. 001) in Eastern Inner Mongolia, while the drying trend was not significant during this period. Spatial heterogeneity of <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> distributions was also evident. Analysis of <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> via piecewise regression revealed two separate, specific trends between the first 31 years (1960 - 1990) and the subsequent 18 years (1991 - 2008). Generally, mild <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> very slight wetting occurred prior to 1990, while after 1991 both <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> were significant <b>and</b> enhanced. Continuous <b>warming</b> drove a northward shift of temperature zones from the 1960 s to 2000 s, while aridity zones displayed enhanced temporal and spatial variability. Climate change effects on temperature and aridity zones imply that the patterns of cropping systems, macro-ecosystems, and human land use modes are potentially undergoing migration and modification due to climate change...|$|R

25|$|In On the Temperaments, Galen further {{emphasized}} the importance of the qualities. An ideal temperament involved a balanced mixture of the four qualities.

These last four, named for the humors with which they were associated—that is, sanguine, choleric, melancholic and phlegmatic, eventually became better known than the others. While the term temperament came to refer just to psychological dispositions, Galen used it to refer to bodily dispositions, which determined a person's susceptibility to particular diseases as well as behavioral and emotional inclinations.|$|E
25|$|During wet or snowy weather, snow {{boots are}} worn {{to keep the}} foot <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>dry.</b> They are {{typically}} made of rubber or other water-resistant material, have multiple layers of insulation, and a high heel to keep snow out. Boots may also be attached to snowshoes to increase the distribution of weight over a larger surface area for walking in snow. Ski boots are a specialized snow boot which are used in alpine or cross-country skiing and {{designed to provide a}} way to attach the skier to his/her skis using ski bindings. The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow. Ice skates are another specialized boot with a metal blade attached to the bottom which is used to propel the wearer across a sheet of ice. Inline skates are similar to ice skates but with a set of three to four wheels in lieu of the blade, which are designed to mimic ice skating on solid surfaces such as wood or concrete.|$|E
25|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday morning and afternoon practice sessions took place in <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> conditions. Michael Schumacher was fastest in the first practice session, {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 14.927 seconds; Barrichello had the second fastest time. Häkkinen set the third fastest time although his car's gearbox was changed. Button was fourth fastest, ahead of Villeneuve and Alexander Wurz. The two Jordan drivers were seventh and eighth (with Trulli ahead of Frentzen). Irvine and Nick Heidfeld rounded out the top ten fastest drivers. A electrical failure prevented Coulthard from participating as he was pushed onto the circuit by marshals and Fisichella removed his Benetton's left front wheel in a crash at turn 11. In the second practice session, Coulthard set the fastest lap time of the day, a 1:14.561, one tenth of a second quicker than teammate Häkkinen. Michael Schumacher and Barrichello slipped to third and fourth fastest respectively although both drivers stated that they were pleased with their pace.
