2500|$|This was {{followed}} by Loevy's adaptation of Mr. Mani, a best-selling epic saga by Israeli author A.B. Yehoshua, with a script by longtime collaborator Gilad Evron. The novel is based on five conversations that {{tell the story of}} five generations of a Turkish–Greek-Jewish family, but in a larger sense, {{it is the story of}} Jewish and Israeli identity over the past two centuries. Originally, Loevy was hesitant about adapting the book for television, and asked the author: [...] "You already have a book. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> a movie?" ...|$|E

In 224, when Cao Zhen returned from a campaign, Cao Pi ordered Wu Zhi to host a banquet in his residence in Cao Zhen's honour. During the banquet, Wu Zhi instructed actors to put up a skit to make fun of Cao Zhen and Zhu Shuo (朱鑠), who were fat and thin respectively. Cao Zhen was enraged and he shouted at Wu Zhi, [...] "Are you and your men seeking a fight with me and my men?" [...] Cao Hong and Wang Zhong egged Wu Zhi on by saying, [...] "If you want to make the General (Cao Zhen) admit that he is fat, you have to show that you're thin." [...] Cao Zhen drew his sword, glared at them and said, [...] "I'll kill whoever dares to mock me." [...] When Cao Hong got into trouble later, Cao Zhen told Cao Pi, [...] "If Cao Hong is to be executed, he'll definitely say something nasty about me." [...] Cao Pi replied, [...] "I'll deal with him myself. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to worry?" ...|$|E

[...] The courier replied, [...] "In the carriage." [...] Taishi Ci said, [...] "Are you sure there is no mistake in the addressee's details on the document? Let me see it." [...] The courier {{did not know that}} Taishi Ci was from Donglai Commandery so he showed him the letter. Taishi Ci took out a knife and destroyed the letter. The courier started shouting, [...] "This man destroyed my document!" [...] Taishi Ci pulled him into the carriage and said, [...] "If you didn't show me the document, I wouldn't have been able to destroy it. Regardless of the consequences, neither of us can say he is not responsible for what happened. I suggest we remain silent and escape. By doing this, we can avoid punishment and keep our heads. Otherwise, both of us will be executed." [...] The courier asked, [...] "Your master sent you to destroy this document. Now that you have accomplished your mission, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> still <b>need</b> to go on the run?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "He ordered me to only check whether the document has been delivered. However, I went too far and ended up destroying the document. If I go back, I am afraid that my master will blame me, so I suggest we escape together." [...] The courier was persuaded by Taishi Ci so they fled from Luoyang together.|$|R

5000|$|According to Zhores and Roy Medvedev in The Unknown Stalin (2006), Bukharin's last {{message to}} Stalin stated [...] "Koba, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> me to die?", {{which was written}} in a note to Stalin just before his execution. [...] "Koba" [...] was Stalin's nom de guerre, and Bukharin's use {{of it was a}} sign of how close the two had once been. The note was {{allegedly}} found still in Stalin's desk after his death in 1953.
