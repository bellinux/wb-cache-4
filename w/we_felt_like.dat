According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list. He's in a band that we all mutually respect and <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> he was a person that understood what we were doing and could maintain a focus on what we were trying to attain. But he also has some interesting facets of his own musical personality that we thought would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the positive reception from listeners, Williams said, [...] "We love the reaction that we get [...] They know what we're talking about." [...] Shay Haley, {{a member of the}} band, went on saying, [...] "Me, personally, I'm shocked it's being embraced the way it is. I feel like it sticks out like a sore thumb in comparison to what you hear every day on the radio… It's just our personal observation of what we've seen {{over the past couple of}} years, so <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> making a party record out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{engineers}} who programmed the Apollo training simulator {{had a difficult}} time keeping the simulator in sync with the continuous changes being made to the spacecraft. According to backup astronaut Walter Cunningham, [...] "We knew that the spacecraft was, you know, in poor shape relative to what it ought to be. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we could fly it, but let's face it, it just wasn't as good as it should have been for the job of flying the first manned Apollo mission."

500|$|The {{producers}} met directors Dayton and Faris while producing Election {{and in turn}} {{gave the}} script to them to read in 2001. The directors commented later on the script stating: [...] "This film really struck a chord. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was written for us." [...] The script was purchased from first-time screenwriter Arndt for $250,000 by Marc Turtletaub, one of the film's producers, on December 21, 2001. Yerxa and Berger remained as producers as they were responsible for finding the directors and cinematographer, assisting in the ending re-shoot, and helping bring the film to the Sundance Film Festival.|$|E

5000|$|The {{success of}} Violator {{introduced}} the band {{to a wider}} audience, and this increased exposure led to their 1993 follow-up album Songs of Faith and Devotion debuting atop the charts in both the United States and United Kingdom. [...] "Before this, we'd been going along quite nicely," [...] recalled Andy Fletcher. [...] "Then {{when it came to}} Violator we inexplicably went huge. It was just incredible, and in many ways we never really recovered from that. After that, <b>we</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> wanted to muck it up a bit." ...|$|R
500|$|Along the way, the {{production}} team went through drafts {{where the first}} act included far more detail than what {{ended up in the}} final version, such as a troll with a Brooklyn accent who would have explained the backstory behind Elsa's magical powers, and a regent for whom Lee was hoping to cast comedian Louis C.K. After all those details were thoroughly [...] "over-analyzed", they were excised because they amounted to a [...] "much more complex story than really <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we could fit in this 90-minute film." [...] As Del Vecho put it, [...] "the more we tried to explain things at the beginning, the more complicated it got." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Way Too Cold" [...] was {{produced}} by Hit-Boy, a producer signed to West's label GOOD Music, known for his production on [...] "Niggas in Paris".

500|$|For The Lion Kings {{first film}} trailer, Disney opted to feature a single scene, the entire opening {{sequence}} {{with the song}} [...] "Circle of Life". Buena Vista Pictures Distribution president Dick Cook said {{the decision was made}} for such an approach because [...] "we were all so taken by the beauty and majesty of this piece that <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it {{was probably one of the}} best four minutes of film that we've seen", and Don Hahn added that [...] "Circle of Life" [...] worked as a trailer as it [...] "came off so strong, and so good, and ended with such a bang". The trailer was released in November 1993, accompanying The Three Musketeers in theaters, as only a third of The Lion King had been completed. Audience reaction was enthusiastic, causing Hahn to have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up to the expectations raised by the preview. Prior to the film's release, Disney did 11 test screenings.|$|E
5000|$|Lovett told NME {{that working}} with James Ford for Wilder Mind {{was part of}} trying {{something}} new. [...] "We felt a need for change. Not from Markus Dravs, {{but he was so}} closely attached to those first two records that as we had taken that time off, we wanted to try doing something new. It <b>felt</b> <b>like,</b> if <b>we</b> do our third record with Markus, does that mean we do our ninth and 10th records with Markus? At some point you have to try different things, as <b>we</b> collectively <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was time to try other stuff. Markus knows that we might well make the next record with him. We definitely haven't broken up Dravs, we're just playing the field!" ...|$|R
500|$|Screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who {{had worked}} on the two {{previous}} Transformers films, declined to return for the third film, with Kurtzman declaring that [...] "the franchise is so wonderful that it deserves to be fresh, all the time. <b>We</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we'd given it a lot and didn't have an insight for where {{to go with it}} next". Revenge of the Fallens co-writer Ehren Kruger became the sole screenwriter for Dark of the Moon. Kruger had frequent meetings with Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) visual effects producers, who suggested plot points such as the scenes in Chernobyl.|$|R
5000|$|Fobia's early sound, {{like many}} of the genre, was heavily {{influence}} by 80’s new wave with a few notable exceptions: David Bowie and KISS. Fobia’s music has always embraced the fantastic and eccentric and contains large doses of irony and humor. Fobia steered clear of the political and cultural themes that were embraced by their contemporaries. According to Lozanne, [...] "I think {{it was more of a}} strategy of the record companies. <b>We</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were part of a movement. We didn't dress like the other bands. We didn't sing about the things they were singing about".|$|R
500|$|Since A Thousand Leaves was {{the first}} Sonic Youth album that was {{recorded}} in their own studio, the band had more time and freedom to work on it. As a result, the songs evolved unevenly and were recorded from {{an early stage of}} development. According to guitarist Lee Ranaldo, the album is [...] "a reflection of where we were at the time. We weren't into making anything concise. We were just playing what <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> playing. We really didn't feel like what we needed to be doing was producing another record like Goo." [...] The 11-minute song [...] "Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)" [...] was initially intended to be released on one of the EPs as an instrumental track, but it was ultimately included on the album with vocals. The album was co-produced by the band and Confusion Is Sex producer Wharton Tiers and mastered by Greg Calbi at Masterdisk in New York City.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} {{backed the}} tenth austerity package which went before Parliament on 16 July. The package {{was the first}} in a series of prior actions necessary for negotiations to open up over bailout funding worth 86billion euros. The package came in two parts, with the first being approved on 16 July, and the second on 23 July. The legislation included a rise in VAT across several goods and services, the abolition of the VAT discount for Greek islands, a corporation tax rise from 26% to 29%, a luxury tax on cars, boats and swimming pools, an end to early retirement by 2022, and an increase in the retirement age to 67. Tsakalotos said on 16 July debate, [...] "I don't know if we did the right thing, however, I do know that <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we had no other choice but do what we did." [...] The contentious vote was opposed by 109 out of 201 members of the Central Committee of Syriza, and 32 Syriza MPs voted against the proposals on 16 July. It also led to a cabinet reshuffle on 17 July, but Tsakalotos retained his role as Minister of Finance.|$|E
500|$|McFeely {{said that}} the idea of basing a film on [...] "Civil War" [...] had [...] "been on and off the table for a while" [...] at Marvel Studios, explaining, [...] "it's a {{challenge}} to do it and make sure that all the characters that we've established, and everyone's established in the MCU are serviced and sound correct. Because there's a difference between the characters in [...] "Civil War", which was written in 2006, 2007. The MCU doesn't exist [...] There isn't a Robert Downey, Jr. or Chris Evans who has helped create the character so {{we need to make sure}} that that template gets adjusted". Joe Russo added that the [...] "essence" [...] of [...] "Civil War" [...] was used, such as [...] "the concept of registration, the notion that heroes need to be either monitored or controlled because their power can be scary" [...] being applicable. Anthony Russo expanded, [...] "in a lot of ways [...] can be a political issue, and we didn't want the conflict of the movie to solely exist on that level. We wanted to figure out very personal reasons why everyone's relationship to this idea of registration is going to become complicated. That's what the relationship between Steve and Bucky allowed us to do, to get very personal in terms of why people would lean one way or the other." [...] Executive producer Nate Moore added that [...] "it felt like it was kind of the right time" [...] to adapt [...] "Civil War" [...] given The Avengers, plus many of the Phase Two films ( [...] , The Winter Soldier, and Avengers: Age of Ultron), all dealt with [...] "world-ending experiences. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we had to tell the next step in that story, which is ... what is the world's reaction?" ...|$|E

As a part of Relient K, {{he has been an}} amazing drummer, singer, collaborator, and friend. Before Dave joined the band, we were plagued with drummer turnover.

2500|$|Enigk confessed in an {{interview}} in December 2008 that because the band had already broken up during the recording of LP2, he and Hoerner never sat down to complete the lyrics; [...] "We broke up and <b>we</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were done. We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren’t lyrics! In a lot of cases, we never sat down to write them, because we just wanted {{to get it out of}} the way as fast as possible. So I just sang a lot of gibberish, which makes it really quirky. My favorite is the Japanese translations".|$|R
500|$|Jocelyn Vena from MTV News {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review, writing [...] " [...] {{has found a}} chart-topping formula, combin killer beats with lyrics about super-fun parties and hot pants." [...] Vena commented that, although the song was not groundbreaking and did not stray {{too far away from}} previous singles [...] "Tik Tok" [...] or [...] "Take It Off", that hardly matters as [...] "it's another uber-fun tune about how awesome it is to dance the night away" [...] with an [...] "inspired [...] the recent rash of suicides among gay youth." [...] Jason Lipshutz from Billboard gave the song a positive review; he praised Dr. Luke's production and the song's chorus. Lipshutz commented on the song's similarity to [...] "Tik Tok", writing, [...] "Instead of straying from the 'TiK ToK' formula, 'We R Who We R,' ... smartly maximizes [...] most appealing qualities." [...] The review concluded that the song [...] "demonstrates that [...] still has mileage left in her electro-pop sound as she gears up for her next album." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "companion piece" [...] to Pink's [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] citing their similar subject matter and close releases. Nitsuh Abebe from NY Magazine complimented the song's chorus and trance pop elements. Abebe wrote that the song embodied a [...] "hollowed-out, free-of-yourself feeling", commenting that almost all electronic dance music imbues feelings [...] "that are almost spiritual, that sense of being subsumed and out-of-body". Melinda Newman of HitFix called the song [...] "incredibly stupid, but it has the main ingredients to make it a global hit: an insistent beat and positive lyrics that promise to suspend time and keep us 'forever young,' or better yet, transport us back to a time when <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we were." [...] Newman referred to herself as one of the singer's biggest detractors, but wrote [...] "I like one of her songs--or at least begrudgingly admire its crass charms." [...] In an album review of Cannibal, Newman referred to the song as a [...] "great self-acceptance anthem.' ...|$|E

[...] "We wanted to be doing something at least that was a little bit relevant now; bit of a dry mix, detuned a bit," [...] Tempest said, [...] "So <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we didn't want to do an 1980s album per se, we just wanted to start like a fresh band really."
