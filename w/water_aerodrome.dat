5|$|The Okanagan is {{a region}} {{located in the}} British Columbia Interior of Canada that {{contains}} five airports, four heliports and three water aerodromes. Of the fivecities based in the Okanagan, threeof them contain aviation services. Vernon contains two: the Vernon Regional Airport and Vernon/Wildlife <b>Water</b> <b>Aerodrome,</b> while Kelowna provides the same number: the Kelowna International Airport and Kelowna (General Hospital) Heliport. The Penticton Regional Airport and Penticton <b>Water</b> <b>Aerodrome</b> are situated in Penticton, making a total of twoaviation services offered in the city. Despite this, the Enderby and Armstrong cities contain no aviation services.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{communities}} that are not cities in the Okanagan, many of which also maintain aviation services. Winfield, a town located within the Lake Country district, provides the Winfield (Wood Lake) <b>Water</b> <b>Aerodrome.</b> The West Kelowna district provides twoheliports: the Kelowna (Alpine) Heliport and Kelowna (Wildcat Helicopters) Heliport, while the unincorporated community of Naramata offers the Naramata Heliport. Meanwhile, the towns of Oliver and Osoyoos are home to the Oliver Municipal Airport and Osoyoos Airport. The districts of Peachland and Summerland, along with the town of Oyama in Lake Country, do not provide aviation services.|$|E
5|$|Andreas Hjelmeland {{established}} Førdefly in 1966 as {{the second}} airline based in Sogn og Fjordane. Førdefly never received a concession to operate scheduled services; instead it flew a daily charter flight to Bergen Airport. The airline established a <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome</b> at Øyrane {{at the mouth of}} the river Jølstra. The aerodrome had a passenger and freight terminal, a quay, a hangar and a control tower. The municipality received permission from the Ministry of Transport and Communications in mid 1970 to operate a municipal airport, and chose to use the terminal facilities operated by Førdefly. Construction of the runway cost 1.3 million Norwegian krone and the first aircraft landed on the strip on 14 July 1970. Scheduled services commenced on 1 July 1971, the same day as Florø Airport, Sogndal Airport, Haukåsen and Ørsta-Volda Airport, Hovden opened.|$|E
25|$|Two <b>water</b> <b>aerodromes</b> served Haugesund {{before the}} opening of the airport at Helganes. Haugesund Naval Air Station was in use by the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service from 1918 to 1919. Haugesund Airport, Storesundsskjær was taken into use in 1936 and served various coastal {{seaplane}} services operated by Widerøe, Norwegian Air Lines and West Norway Airlines until its closing in 1956.|$|R
25|$|At first Trondheim {{was mostly}} served by <b>water</b> <b>aerodromes</b> and from 1952 Trondheim Airport, Værnes became Trondheim's main airport. Braathens SAFE {{operated}} scheduled flights to Oslo from 1952 to 1956, {{when they moved}} to Værnes. Lade Airport remained in use until 1965, when it was abandoned {{to allow for the}} area to be redeveloped for industry, shopping, and a sports venue.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>water</b> <b>aerodromes</b> served Haugesund {{before the}} opening of the airport at Helganes. Haugesund Naval Air Station was in use by the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service from 1918 to 1919. Haugesund Airport, Storesundsskjær was taken into use in 1936 and served various coastal {{seaplane}} services operated by Widerøe, Norwegian Air Lines and West Norway Airlines until its closing in 1956.|$|R
5|$|Hammerfest {{was served}} from 1935 by {{scheduled}} seaplanes at a <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome</b> at Rypefjord. Services were interrupted by World War II, but resumed in 1945, lasting until the 1963 opening of Alta Airport. Hammerfest Airport opened on 1 August 1974, along {{with four other}} regional airport in Finnmark and Troms, and was originally served with de Havilland Canada Twin Otters. The de Havilland Canada Dash 7 was introduced in 1983 and a helicopter base was established in 1989. The Dash 8 was introduced in 1995 and the airport was nationalized two years later. A Dash 8 was damaged beyond repair after a hard landing in 2005. Because of the limited space for expansion and unfavorable wind conditions, there is a proposal {{to build a new}} airport at Grøtnes.|$|E
5|$|However, no {{progress}} was made with the airfield for over a decade. Instead, the <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome</b> at Bukta was upgraded. Initially the passengers were transported to the aircraft with a boat, {{but after a few}} years a floating dock was built. Services were only provided during five summer months, from May through September. During the rest of the year, Alta had no airline service; travel time to Oslo was then six days, largely by ship. The route was taken over by Widerøe in 1954, who bought a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter to serve a route from Tromsø via Alta to Hammerfest, Kirkenes and Vadsø. In Tromsø, the routes connected with a Norwegian Air Lines' seaplane service to Oslo. Bukta had 2,000 annual passengers in 1957, and the summer route was flown daily beginning in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plans for}} serving Hammerfest with an airline route was {{launched}} in a government plan from 1933. It proposed that flights in Northern Norway be carried out using seaplanes, and proposed Hammerfest as one of several stops on a route from Trondheim to Vadsø. Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) received the concession to operate all routes in Norway from 1935, resulting in the coastal route from Bergen to Tromsø commencing. The following year a connecting route from Tromsø via Hammerfest to Honningsvåg was subcontracted to Widerøe. The <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome</b> in Hammerfest was located at Rypefjord and consisted of a buoy where the aircraft parked; passengers were transported to the aircraft in a boat. All flights were terminated in 1939 and remained so {{until the end of}} World War II in 1945.|$|E
25|$|Originally Bergen {{was served}} by <b>water</b> <b>aerodromes</b> at Flatøy, Sandviken and Herdla. Financing of Flesland was largely secured through NATO funds and the airport opened on 2 October 1955. Until the 1980s, Bergen was the Norwegian airport used for SAS' {{intercontinental}} flights to New York. New terminals were opened in 1988 and in August 2017. The Bergen Light Rail {{was extended to}} the airport and opened in April 2017.|$|R
50|$|The {{appeal was}} dismissed. The {{evidence}} {{revealed that the}} real object of the by‑law {{was not related to}} zoning and did not fall under any provincial head of power. Rather, its essence was to regulate the location of <b>water</b> <b>aerodromes</b> in the municipality, a matter within the exclusive federal jurisdiction over aeronautics. Since the by‑law was, in pith and substance, about the regulation of aeronautics, it fell outside provincial jurisdiction.|$|R
50|$|In any event, if {{the zoning}} by‑law {{did have the}} effect of prohibiting <b>water</b> <b>aerodromes,</b> it would be {{inapplicable}} to the extent it did so, under the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. A prohibition on aerodromes, even as part of a broad class of land uses, would result in an unacceptable narrowing of Parliament’s legislative options. This would {{have the effect of}} impairing the core of the federal power over aeronautics.|$|R
5|$|The first service {{after the}} war was started by DNL on 13 October 1945 and flew to Tromsø, with onwards {{connection}} to Trondheim and Oslo. The service only lasted until 1948, when it was replaced with a Ju-52 seaplane route with intermediate stops at Vadsø and Hammerfest to Tromsø. The route flew one direction each day, was only operated {{during the summer and}} was plagued with poor regularity. The original <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome</b> was located at Soldatbukta at Prestøya. Later it was moved to the quay {{on the north side of}} Langfjorden, on the other side as Kirkenes. Passengers were therefore freighted across the fjord by boat to the aircraft. The air traffic control moved from Høybuktmoen to Haganes in 1949, but returned in 1963.|$|E
5|$|The first {{airport in}} Alta {{was built by}} the Wehrmacht during the German {{occupation}} of Norway. Alta was {{a central part of}} the German military activity during World War II, resulting in an airstrip being constructed at Elvebakken in 1943. The airport was damaged beyond repair under Operation Nordlicht—the German withdrawal from Finnmark in 1944. During 1945 the Royal Norwegian Air Force operated a seaplane route along the coast of Northern Norway, which included a stop at Alta. However, the route was not resumed the following summer. The municipality started lobbying the air force and the civilian aviation authorities to establish an airline route to Alta. Specifically, they argued that both the <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome</b> at Bukta and an airfield at Altagård/Elvebakken be included in the national plans for future airports. The area at Altagårdsletta was freed up by the military in 1946 and zoned for use as an airport.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1902, May {{once again}} moved, this time further {{west to the}} town of Edmonton, in the North-West Territory. Upon his arrival there, he would {{purchase}} several lots of land on which he would construct a series of cottages, houses and terraces that he would later sell. In Edmonton, he would establish himself as a prominent contractor, building many notable early buildings of the town, and later city. He partnered with Charles W. Sharpe and established the May-Sharpe Construction company. With his firm, buildings he was involved in constructing included the town's first Canadian Northern Railway station, a post office, the Bank of Montreal, Merchants' Bank and Bank of Commerce buildings, the Hudson's Bay Company store, the first provincial penitentiary building, and the residences of city notables Richard Secord, Frank Oliver and Edward Ainslie Braithwaite. He was also involved {{in the construction of the}} Clover Bar railway bridge, for which he set the concrete piers and foundation, as well as the Land Titles Building in Regina, Saskatchewan. From 1909 to 1912, May would also construct the still-standing LeMarchand mansion, atop the North Saskatchewan River Valley as well as assist in the construction of McDougall United Church. The LeMarchand mansion construction however would bankrupt him and force him to move to a cottage on Koney Island on Cooking Lake, beside the present day Edmonton/Cooking Lake <b>Water</b> <b>Aerodrome</b> in Strathcona County, until his debts were settled. In 1921, he did work at Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, as superintendent of the Windsor Transportation Company.|$|E
25|$|The first {{proposals}} for an airport in Tromsø {{was presented in}} 1918 by Det Norske Luftfartsrederi, who intended to operate air route to Northern Norway. They conducted surveys in 1919, but filed for bankruptcy the following year without their plans being carried through. A 1922 report from Blehr's Second Cabinet proposed <b>water</b> <b>aerodromes</b> {{as far north as}} Harstad, but not Tromsø. Five years later the city was included in the plans for future airline routes. The plans went unsubstantiated until the mid-1930s.|$|R
50|$|Before {{satellite}} navigation {{was available for}} civilian aviation, the requirement for large land-based navigation aid (NAVAID) facilities generally limited the use of instrument approaches to land-based (i.e. asphalt, gravel, turf, ice) runways (and those on aircraft carriers). GNSS technology allows, at least theoretically, to create instrument approaches to any point on the Earth's surface (whether on land or water); consequently, there are nowadays examples of <b>water</b> <b>aerodromes</b> (such as Rangeley Lake Seaplane Base in Maine, United States) that have GNSS-based approaches.|$|R
50|$|Originally Bergen {{was served}} by <b>water</b> <b>aerodromes</b> at Flatøy, Sandviken and Herdla. Financing of Flesland was largely secured through NATO funds and the airport opened on 2 October 1955. Until the 1980s, Bergen was the Norwegian airport used for SAS' {{intercontinental}} flights to New York. A new terminal opened in 1988. The terminal {{is too small}} for today's traffic. A new terminal is scheduled for completion in 2017, and Bergen Light Rail was extended {{to the airport and}} opened in April 2017.|$|R
25|$|There is also regular BC Ferries service between Skidegate and Alliford Bay on Moresby Island. Floatplane {{services}} {{connect to}} facilities {{such as the}} Alliford Bay <b>Water</b> <b>Aerodrome</b> and Masset <b>Water</b> <b>Aerodrome.</b>|$|E
25|$|The main {{airport is}} Inuvik (Mike Zubko) Airport. There {{is also a}} general {{aviation}} airport, Inuvik/Shell Lake <b>Water</b> <b>Aerodrome.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome</b> was {{physically}} located at two different {{locations in the}} bay of Nørvevika. The first was named Nørvevik and the second Sørneset. Sørneset is a headland situated {{on the island of}} Nørvøya, between the Nørvevika and Nørvesundet. The <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome</b> consisted of a buoy, a slipway, a hangar and a barracks used for offices. In addition there was a small floating dock. From 1966 the aerodrome also featured a helipad.|$|E

50|$|Until 1995, the municipality's {{zoning by-law}} {{did not allow}} for <b>water</b> <b>aerodromes</b> or {{aeronautics}} in general to be conducted on Lac Gobeil. The by-law was amended to allow such activity {{for part of the}} lake, but not the part in which the aerodrome in question was operating. The municipality applied for an injunction ordering the company to cease its aviation activities on Lac Gobeil on the ground that operation of the aerodrome and the associated business in that zone violated the by‑law.|$|R
25|$|Early in {{the twentieth}} century, the port of Libau became a central point of {{embarkation}} for immigrants traveling to the United States. By 1906 the direct ship service to the United States was used by 40,000 migrants per year. Simultaneously, the first Russian training school of submarine navigation was founded. In 1912 {{one of the first}} <b>water</b> <b>aerodromes</b> in Russia was opened in Libau. In 1913, 1,738 ships entered Libau, with 1,548,119 tones of cargo passing through the port. The population had increased from 10,000 to over 100,000 within about 60 years.|$|R
25|$|The first {{airport in}} Kristiansand was a <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome</b> {{situated}} in the city center. It was built by the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service in 1918. A government commission recommended on 21 October 1920 that Kristiansand receive a water airport {{as part of a}} nationwide investment program. However, nothing came of the plans for more than a decade. Moving of the military <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome</b> was proposed several times, although this was never carried out before the construction of Kjevik.|$|E
25|$|Prince Rupert is {{also served}} by the Prince Rupert/Seal Cove <b>Water</b> <b>Aerodrome,</b> a {{seaplane}} facility with regularly scheduled, as well as chartered, flights to nearby villages and remote locations.|$|E
25|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{to operate in}} Bergen was a demonstration flight by Carl Gustav Cederström on 25 September 1911. The first airport in the Bergen area was Flatøy Air Station, built by the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service {{on the island of}} Flatøy. The <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome</b> was established in 1919, it remained in use until 1940. Norway's first scheduled airline service was started by Det Norske Luftfartsrederi between Bergen, Haugesund and Stavanger in 1920, and operated out of Bergen Airport, Sandviken, a <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome</b> just north of the city center. The aerodrome became the Bergen base for both Norwegian Air Lines and Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap.|$|E
25|$|Bergen {{had been}} {{served by the}} {{military}} Bergen Airport, Flatøy since the 1920s and from 1934 Bergen Airport, Sandviken, both <b>water</b> <b>aerodromes.</b> Following the establishment of Gressholmen Airport in Oslo in 1927, Parliament appointed a state committee in 1930 to consider suitable locations {{for the construction of}} more airports. Bergen was one of the cities for which an airport was considered. Bergen Municipal Council appointed a committee in 1933 to find a suitable location. The committee looked for suitable sites for a land airport, and considered both Flesland and Herdla as suitable sites.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} list contains airports, heliports, or <b>water</b> <b>aerodromes</b> {{that are}} located in the Okanagan region of British Columbia, Canada. It includes the airport name, location, type, usage, codes of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO airport code) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA airport code), as well as the Transport Canada location identifier (TC LID) code, and coordinates of the airport's location. ICAO and IATA codes are not given for airports which were closed or converted to general aviation before being issued such codes.

25|$|The German forces {{chose to}} not use Jonsvatnet {{as a primary}} {{civilian}} <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome.</b> Instead it constructed such a facility at Trondheim Airport, Hommelvik and moved civilian flights there. Construction of a <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome</b> on Jonsvatnet commenced in May. The Valset area {{was taken over by}} the Luftwaffe and used as a recreational area for German soldiers. The airport was gradually expanded with a major complex of floating wharfs with three connectors to land. There were also built auxiliary installations. The work was completed in 1942. However, Jonsvatnet remained a reserve airport, with Ilsvika and Hommelvik remaining the primary water aerodromes. From 1943 there were upgrades to the defenses and communications systems, including the construction of four antenna masts.|$|E
25|$|The <b>water</b> <b>aerodrome</b> {{is located}} at Valset on the short of Litjvatn, a bay of Jonsvatnet. Since 1967 it was {{operated}} by Trondheim Flyklubb, who in later years had two Cessna 180 aircraft stationed. The season lasted from May through October and saw between 80 and 120 flight hours per month during the season.|$|E
25|$|The {{plans were}} {{approved}} by the municipal council in February 1936, allowing construction of the 18,000-Norwegian krone project to commence. Two-thirds of the investments went to building the floating wharfs. The terminal cost NOK4,600, NOK600 was used for an outhouse and a tool shed. NOK700 was invested in providing water and sewer lines to the site and the last NOK100 was used to upgrade the road. This was in contrast {{to most of the}} other <b>water</b> <b>aerodromes</b> along the coast, which lacked a wharf to which the aircraft could dock. The airport and the DNL route with the three-engine Junkers Ju 52 Havørn were opened on 7 June 1936. The first season there were three weekly round trips. Havørn crashed with the mountain of Lihesten on 16 June, killing all on board in the Havørn Accident. Therefore, Ternen was put into service on the route until a new Ju 52, Falken, entered service on 28 June. The service was only flown for the summer.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, an {{overturned}} firetruck discharged PFOS {{fire retardant}} onto the airport apron and surrounding soil. PFOS {{was added to}} Annex B of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in May 2009 and {{has been shown to}} cause chronic kidney disease amongst people and animals exposed to larger quantities. Traces of spilt PFOS later entered the island's water supply although quantities were not high enough to make it unsafe to drink. Because the airport is at the highest point in the island the accident highlighted the vulnerability of the water supply to airport effluence and other <b>water</b> pollutants. <b>Aerodrome</b> works have subsequently involved environmental engineering projects to better contain and divert contaminated effluence away from the water supply. As part of the Airport 2040 development, a new drainage system is being installed and this will allow airport effluence to be contained in a manner which does not affect water supplies in the future.|$|R
25|$|For most of {{the twentieth}} century, the fishing {{industry}} sustained the people of Hartley Bay. Today, however, with {{the decline of the}} fishing industry, employment has diversified, with tourism playing a significant role. For example, several Hartley Bay residents work at nearby fishing lodges during the summer as guides. Air service is through Hartley Bay <b>Water</b> <b>Aerodrome.</b>|$|E
