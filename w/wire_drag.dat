50|$|On 11 August 1917 {{south of}} Langemarck, Belgium, during {{the attack on}} a {{strongly}} held enemy position and his platoon having been held up by heavy machine-gun fire, Private Loosemore crawled through partially cut <b>wire,</b> <b>dragging</b> his Lewis machine-gun with him and single-handed dealt with a strong party of the enemy, killing about 20 of them.

50|$|Cutting {{speed and}} wire {{temperature}} combine {{to determine the}} thickness and consistency of kerf. For a given wire temperature, an attempted motion {{in excess of the}} wire's ability to melt the foam can lead to <b>wire</b> <b>drag</b> and poor surface finish of the cut foam. Conversely, dwelling in the foam any longer than strictly required to melt the cut path can lead to excessively thick kerf. A nonuniform feed rate can lead to a kerf of varying thickness.|$|E
50|$|The anti-sweep mine is a {{very small}} mine (40 kg warhead) with as small a {{floating}} device as possible. When the wire of a mine sweep hits the mine, it sinks, letting the sweep <b>wire</b> <b>drag</b> along the anchoring wire of the mine until the sweep hits the mine. That detonates the mine and cuts the sweeping wire. They are very cheap and usually used in combination with other mines in a minefield to make sweeping more difficult. One type is the Mark 23 used by the United States during World War II.|$|E
40|$|Wreck {{superstructure}} {{can extend}} {{into the water}} column and pose a danger to navigation if the least depth is not accurately portrayed to mariners. NOAA has several methods available to acquire a wreck least depth: lead line, <b>wire</b> <b>drag,</b> diver investigation, side scan shadow length, single beam bathymetry, and multibeam bathymetry. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} the bottom detection algorithm can fail to locate a wreck mast that is evident in the water column data. Modern multibeam sonars can record water column data in addition to bottom detections. NOAA’s current Hydrographic Specifications do not require water column collection; the best practice is to collect additional bathymetry data during wreck developments. Several multibeam bathymetry and multibeam water column datasets collected by NOAA vessels are evaluated and the wreck least depth results are compared to previous international field trials. A workflow to extract filtered and sidelobe suppressed water column point clouds is presented using currently available software packages. This paper explores the challenges encountered with water column data collection and processing and finds that analysis of water column data provides an improvement to finding wreck least depths, in some cases...|$|E
50|$|A sweep {{is either}} a contact sweep, a <b>wire</b> <b>dragged</b> through the water by one or two ships to cut the mooring wire of {{floating}} mines, or a distance sweep that mimics a ship to detonate the mines. The sweeps are dragged by minesweepers, either purpose-built military ships or converted trawlers. Each run covers between 100 and 200 m, and the ships must move slowly in a straight line, making them vulnerable to enemy fire. This was exploited by the Turkish army in the Battle of Gallipoli in 1915, when mobile howitzer batteries prevented the British and French from clearing a way through minefields.|$|R

When the sounds stopped after half a minute, O'Byrne brought Curie up to periscope depth to discover that he had only penetrated the outer net. Curies forward momentum carried her into the second net where she became [...] "inextricably entangled". When the submarine, still trapped in the net, was forced to surface for fresh air, Curie came under fire from the Austro-Hungarian destroyer [...] and torpedo boat Tb 63 T which quickly sank her.

Additionally the mine has a magnetic-influence fuze. The mine uses a Misznay Schardin effect warhead to penetrate the belly of armour vehicles; the projectile formed is optimized for after-armour effects. The mine auto-destructs after one of six selectable periods, up to a maximum of four days; the self-destruct mechanism is reported to be 99% reliable http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199697/cmhansrd/vo961105/text/61105w01.htm.

50|$|Of {{particular}} interest {{was the possibility}} of damaging Germany's electricity distribution network by shorting out high-voltage overhead power lines with thin <b>wires</b> <b>dragged</b> by balloons. Again, the results of investigations were favourable: trials showed that even a thin steel wire, much thinner than that used to tether the static barrage balloons, when drawn in sliding contact across two or more phases, could cause an arc as long as 15 ft and that arc would be maintained until the circuit breaker opened. In some cases, the arc's heat could melt the aluminum outer layers and then the reinforcing steel centre strands of the conductors. Even if the cable was not severed, the conductors would be weakened {{so that they would}} be susceptible to breaking due to increased electrical demands or normal weather events such as wind, snow and ice. Investigations revealed that it was common practise in pre-war Germany to use a Petersen coil as protection against earthing; this design was effective against a short between a high voltage cable and earth but relatively vulnerable to a short between different phases. A short between phases could result in damage, not just to a cable, but to transformers and the circuit breakers themselves. The Admiralty ran trials using surplus spherical latex meteorological balloons about 8 ft in diameter when inflated. Calculations based on the trials predicted that there would be between a 10% to 75% chance of a balloon's wire coming into contact with a high-voltage overhead line during a 30 mi transit along the ground.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} Coulomb drag rate for {{electrons}} in two parallel quantum wires. The double-quantum wire structure is modeled for a GaAs material with cylindrical wires having infinite potential barriers. The momentum transfer rate between the <b>wires</b> (Coulomb <b>drag</b> effect) is calculated {{as a function}} of temperature for several wire separation distances. We employ the full wave vector and frequency dependent random-phase approximation (RPA) at finite temperature to describe the effective interwire Coulomb interaction. We find that the drag rate at high temperatures (i. e., T ≥ EF/ 2) is dominated by the collective modes (plasmons) of the system similar to the case in double-well structures. Including the local-field effects in an approximate way we estimate the importance of intrawire correlations to be significant. Copyright © 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The {{power gain}} and thrust for plasma engines {{available}} by unreeling 10 km of insulated Al wire from a spacecraft are investigated.

40|$|Abstract]: Metal meshes have {{a number}} of {{applications}} such as security screens, fencing, screening, filtration, equalization of flow, heat processing etc. They are available in different materials, element shapes, sizes and weavings. The work presented here examines the drag force on the metal meshes as it is particularly important if a large size mesh is used at high wind velocities. The flow of air through cells in a mesh such as perforated (holes drilled in a sheet metal) or woven <b>wire</b> encounters <b>drag</b> force and a pressure drop. This effect of pressure drop associated with the mesh is not desirable in certain applications such as uniform supply of hot air in turbine using the resistance of wire mesh to increase the internal energy of air molecules as an attempt to increase the overall efficiency of turbine. But the added wire mesh faces large drag force at higher wind velocities and since it is at high temperature that makes it vulnerable to tear apart. Various researches have carried work to establish empirical relationships of flow around cylinders when placed in wind tunnel, but hardly any attempt has been made to study air flow through two layers of mesh separated by a finite distance. The work presented here is experimental and intended to investigate the effect of using two layers of mesh on the drag force by using mesh of varying porosity and at different spacing, with a probability to lower the net drag force than that obtained by using single mesh...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the merging of}} the two fields of Coulomb drag and mesoscopic physics. The thesis presents a theory for Coulomb drag between two mesoscopic systems based on linear-response theory. The formalism expresses the drag in terms of either scattering matrices and wave functions or Green functions, and its range of validity covers both ballistic and disordered phase-coherent systems. The consequences are worked out either by analytic means, such as the random matrix theory, or by numerical simulations. The formalism is applied to i) drag between mesoscopic quantum <b>wires</b> and ii) <b>drag</b> between mesoscopic quantum dots. In these systems {{it is found that}} for even weak disorder the mesoscopic sample-to-sample fluctuations of the drag conductance can be of the order of - or even exceed - the mean value.
