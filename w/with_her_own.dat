5|$|Adler's memoirs were {{published}} in the New York socialist Yiddish-language newspaper Die Varheit in 1916–1919, and briefly resumed in 1925 in an unsuccessful revival of that paper; his granddaughter Lulla Rosenfeld's English translation was published only in 1999. The 1916–1919 portion of the memoir gives a detailed picture of his Russian years. The 1925 portion gives a comparably detailed picture of his time in London, although with some evasions around the relative timing of his relationships with his wife Sonya and with Jennya Kaiser and Dinah Shtettin. It contains only a relatively fragmentary description of his New York career. In the English-language book of these memoirs, Rosenfeld attempts to fill the gaps <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> commentary.|$|E
5|$|After Fulin came {{to rule on}} his own in 1651, {{his mother}} the Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang {{arranged}} for him to marry her niece, but the young monarch deposed his new Empress in 1653. The following year Xiaozhuang arranged another imperial marriage with her Khorchin Mongol clan, this time matching her son <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> grand-niece. Though Fulin also disliked his second empress (known posthumously as Empress Xiaohuizhang), he {{was not allowed to}} demote her. She never bore him children. Starting in 1656, the Shunzhi Emperor lavished his affection on Consort Donggo, who, according to Jesuit accounts from the time, had first been the wife of another Manchu noble. She gave birth to a son (the Shunzhi Emperor's fourth) in November 1657. The emperor would have made him his heir apparent, but he died early in 1658 before he was given a name.|$|E

5|$|Penelope's {{story is}} an attempt at {{narrative}} justice to retribute Helen for her erroneously idealised image in the Odyssey as the archetypal female. Penelope acts like a judicial arbiter, a position she held in Ithaca {{as the head of}} state and, during Odysseus' absence, as head of the household. The ancient form of justice and punishment, which was swift and simple {{due to the lack of}} courts, prisons, and currency, is tempered by more modern concepts of balanced distributions of social benefits and burdens. Penelope's chosen form of punishment for Helen is to correct the historical records <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> bias by portraying her as vain and superficial, as someone who measures her worth by the number of men who died fighting for her.|$|E

She becomes good friends with Isabella Thorpe (Carey Mulligan) and she meets Isabella's brother, John (William Beck), when she is reunited <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> brother, James (Hugh O'Conor).|$|E

There was a considerable age gap between the couple, as Matilda was only eight years old while Henry was 24. After the betrothal she was placed into the custody of Bruno, the Archbishop of Trier, who was tasked with educating her in German culture, manners and government. In January 1114 Matilda {{was ready to be}} married to Henry, and their wedding was held at the city of Worms amid extravagant celebrations.
