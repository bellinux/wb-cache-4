40|$|Rock {{grouting}} {{is performed}} {{to decrease the}} hydraulic conductivity around underground structures, such as tunnels and caverns. Cement grouts are often used and pumped into joint and fractures of the rock formation. Piston <b>type</b> <b>pumps</b> are mostly used for high pressure rock grouting. A pulsation effect is inevitable when using this <b>type</b> of <b>pump</b> due to {{the movement of the}} piston. The effect of this pulsation on rock grouting is yet to be known but believed to be benefi-cial for the penetration of the grout. Current flow meters used in the field are not accu-rate enough to determine the fluctuation of the flow rate when it is less than 1 l/min. In addition, currently available flow meters measure the average of the flow over a cer-tain period of time, hence the true fluctuation of the flow rate due to the pulsation of the piston remains unknown. In this paper, a new methodology, the so called ‘Ultrasound Velocity Profiling – Pressure Difference’ (UVP+PD) method has been introduced to show the pulsation effect when using a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump.</b> The feasibility of this method was successfully investigated for the direct in-line determination of the rheological properties of micro cement based grouts under field conditions (Rahman & Håkansson, 2011). Subse-quently, it was also found that this method can be very efficient to measure the fluctu-ation of the flow rate for different <b>types</b> of <b>pumps.</b> From a grouting point of view the UVP+PD method can be used to synchronize the pressure and flow of a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump</b> by measuring the pulsation effect. Conse-quently it {{can be used as a}} tool for the efficiency and quality control of different <b>types</b> of <b>pumps.</b> QC 20121221 </p...|$|R
