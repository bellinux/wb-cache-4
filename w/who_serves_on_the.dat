2500|$|Although Pence is the titular {{head of the}} Commission on Voter Integrity, Kobach is its {{operational}} leader. In that capacity, Kobach, <b>who</b> <b>serves</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> elections {{committee of}} the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), wrote to the top election official in every state requesting they turn over voter data ostensibly to aid a countrywide search for evidence of election irregularities. Besides information such as the names and party affiliations of all registered voters, Kobach sought birth dates, felony conviction records, voting histories {{for the past decade}} and the last four digits of all voters’ Social Security numbers. This precipitated a resounding bipartisan rejection of his inquiries with 22 states quickly rejecting his requests. Ironically, Indiana's SoS, Connie Lawson, and even Kobach himself, indicated that their state laws forbade them from complying.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to Bachmann's charges Chief Deputy Democratic Whip Rep. Jan Schakowsky, <b>who</b> <b>serves</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> House health subcommittee, {{pointed out that}} the report Bachmann refers to is an update of a report that came out in October 2010 and that the costs were spelled out in both the bill and the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of its cost, [...] "Michele Bachmann obviously didn't read the bill, because there was absolutely nothing hidden in that legislation." [...] Schakowsky held that the costs were not kept secret, citing the $40billion for the Children's Health Insurance Program as an example [...] "There was a robust debate about whether or not that should be included, etc. So this idea of somehow, now at the last minute, there was a secret addition to some kind of funding... is absolute nonsense." ...|$|E
2500|$|Economist Stan Liebowitz {{wrote in}} the New York Post that a {{strengthening}} of the CRA in the 1990s encouraged a loosening of lending standards throughout the banking industry. He charged the Federal Reserve with ignoring {{the negative impact of}} the CRA. [...] According to Manhattan Institute scholar Howard Husock, the CEO of a midsize bank reported that 20% of his institution's CRA-related mortgages were delinquent in their first year and probably 7% would end in foreclosure. [...] In a commentary for CNN, Congressman Ron Paul, <b>who</b> <b>serves</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> United States House Committee on Financial Services, charged the CRA with [...] "forcing banks to lend to people who normally would be rejected as bad credit risks." [...] In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, economist Russell Roberts wrote that the CRA subsidized low-income housing by pressuring banks to serve poor borrowers and poor regions of the country.|$|E
2500|$|Both Citigroup and the Mets {{maintain}} that the naming rights deal is secure, despite Citigroup's economic troubles. This deal has been criticized {{in light of the}} late-2000s financial crisis and the $45 billion of taxpayer funds allocated to Citigroup by the U.S. federal government in two separate rescue packages, prompting New York City Council members Vincent Ignizio and James Oddo to suggest that the new ballpark be called [...] "Citi/Taxpayer Field." [...] Radio talk show host Brian Lehrer suggested the name [...] "Debits Field" [...] which combines baseball history with public outrage over the Citi bailout. [...] Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland, <b>who</b> <b>serves</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stated in regards to the Citi Field naming rights deal, [...] "This type of spending is indefensible and unacceptable to Citigroup's new partner and largest investor: the American taxpayer.... I strongly urge Citigroup {{to find a way out}} of this contract and instead spend that $400 million on retaining its employees and restoring confidence in its operations." [...] On January 29, 2009, congressmen Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and Ted Poe of Texas sent a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy F. Geithner urging him to scrap Citigroup's $400 million naming rights deal. [...] "We request that you intervene and demand that Citigroup dissolve the agreement they have with the New York Mets," [...] reads the letter. [...] "Absent this outcome, we feel strongly that you should compel Citigroup to return immediately all federal monies received to date, as well as cancel all loan guarantees." [...] However, Geithner rejected congressional demands to cancel the naming rights deal.|$|E
