5|$|Despite her confession, Wise {{pleaded not}} guilty to the charge of murdering Lily Gienke in front of a grand jury on March 23, 1925. She told the grand jury that she was irresistibly {{attracted}} to attending funerals, and that when there were not enough funerals in the community, she <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> create them by killing. Wise was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder on April 7, 1925.|$|E

5|$|Storm petrels {{face the}} same threats as other seabirds; in {{particular}} they are threatened by introduced species. The Guadalupe storm petrel <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> extinction by feral cats, and introduced predators have also been responsible for declines in other species. Habitat degradation which limits nesting opportunities caused by introduced goats and pigs is also a problem, especially if it increases competition from more aggressive burrowing petrels.|$|E

5|$|In April 1969, {{during the}} summit of the Cultural Revolution, Zhu was {{dismissed}} from his position on the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the activity of the National People's Congress was halted. However, due to the support of Zhou Enlai, he was not harmed or imprisoned. In August 1969, Lin Biao issued a command that dispatched important martial figures to distant areas due to the tension between China and Soviet Union, and Zhu De <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> Guangzhou. In 1973 Zhu was reinstated in the Standing Committee.|$|E
5|$|The Steelers {{fell behind}} the New England Patriots {{less than three}} minutes into the first quarter, after an {{interception}} of Ben Roethlisberger <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> the endzone. The Steelers came back with 2:55 remaining in the initial quarter to convert on a 20-yard Jeff Reed field goal. The Patriots extended their lead to seven points with a 29-yard field goal in the second quarter. Pittsburgh drove 63yards on nine plays, capping their drive with a touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes {{to tie the game}} at ten points at the halfway point.|$|E
50|$|Neohumanism discourages both geosentiment and sociosentiment, {{because both}} {{tend to be}} {{injurious}} to society. However, neohumanism observes that, of the two, sociosentiment is more pernicious.

5|$|A {{medium-sized}} warbler, the Nauru {{reed warbler}} has dark brown upperparts, cream underparts and a long, thin beak. It makes a low, cup-shaped nest into which it lays {{two or three}} white eggs, and it feeds on insects. However, details about its behavior and ecology are little known. It is found throughout Nauru, which has changed substantially in recent decades due to phosphate mining. The Nauru reed warbler is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, and its small range means {{that it could be}} vulnerable to chance occurrences, such as tropical cyclones. Reports of a similar warbler from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere, but <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> local extinction by introduced cats.|$|E
5|$|A trial {{assembly}} of the Gadget without the active components or explosive lenses {{was carried out by}} the bomb assembly team headed by Norris Bradbury at Los Alamos on July 3. It <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> Trinity and back. A set of explosive lenses arrived on July 7, followed by a second set on July 10. Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky, and the best ones were selected for use. The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz, who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material. This test brought bad news: magnetic measurements of the simultaneity of the implosion seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and reported that they were consistent with a perfect explosion.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behaviour. It {{is believed to have}} been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an unlined depression in the ground. It roosted in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame, allowing hunters to pick it up off its roost. The Choiseul pigeon lived in lowland forests, particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. It was only recorded by Albert Stewart Meek, who collected six adults and an egg from the northern part of the island in 1904. Despite many subsequent searches, the bird has not been definitively reported since. It {{is believed to have been}} rare when Meek collected his specimens. The indigenous peoples reported that the species <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> extinction due to the introduction of cats, as the pigeon had never previously confronted a carnivorous mammal on Choiseul. The last unconfirmed report of a Choiseul pigeon was in the early 1940s, and the species is considered extinct.|$|E
30|$|With the {{introducing}} of harvesting, {{the dynamic}} {{behaviors of the}} system become very complicated. Depending on the fraction of the stock that could be harvested, the system may have positive equilibrium, which is globally asymptotically stable, which means that two species could coexist in a stable state; {{or one of the}} species will <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> extinction, or both of the species could <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> extinction.|$|R
30|$|Assume that (2.1) holds, {{then for}} the system without cooperation, it follows from Lemma  2.1 that the first species will <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> extinction. If the {{cooperative}} coefficient d is small enough, then inequality (2.12) holds. It follows from {{the first part of}} Theorem  2.2 that in this case the first species will still <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> extinction despite the cooperation of the second species.|$|R

5|$|Concerned {{that the}} German Army posed {{a threat to}} Petrograd, in March 1918 Sovnarkom {{relocated}} to Moscow, initially as a temporary measure. There, Lenin, Trotsky, and other Bolshevik leaders moved into the Kremlin, where Lenin lived {{with his wife and}} sister Maria in a first floor apartment adjacent to the room in which the Sovnarkom meetings were held. Lenin disliked Moscow, but rarely left the city centre during the rest of his life. It was in the city in August 1918 that he survived a second assassination attempt; he was shot following a public speech and injured badly. A Socialist Revolutionary, Fanny Kaplan, was arrested and executed. The attack was widely covered in the Russian press, generating much sympathy for him and boosting his popularity. As a respite, in September 1918 Lenin <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> the Gorki estate, just outside Moscow, recently acquired for him by the government.|$|E
5|$|Eventually Shaw <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> {{applying}} for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the British Museum Reading Room (the forerunner of the British Library) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing. His {{first attempt at}} drama, begun in 1878, was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme. It was abandoned unfinished, as was his first try at a novel. His first completed novel, Immaturity (1879), was too grim to appeal to publishers and did not appear until the 1930s. He was employed briefly by the newly formed Edison Telephone Company in 1879–80, and as in Dublin achieved rapid promotion. Nonetheless, when the Edison firm merged with the rival Bell Telephone Company, Shaw chose not to seek {{a place in the}} new organisation. Thereafter he pursued a full-time career as an author.|$|E
5|$|His {{loyalty to}} the Ottomans eroded, however, due {{to the impact of}} the new governments's Turkification {{policies}} which he viewed as repressive against his ideals. Because of his dissatisfaction with the Young Turks, Darwaza <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> support Arab independence from the empire. In 1908, he joined the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), but withdrew soon after because of its Turkish nationalist political agenda. He played an active role in establishing a branch for the Party of Harmony and Freedom in Nablus in 1911. The party was founded in Istanbul and joined by Arab members to counter the policies of the CUP. In 1913, he joined a anti-Zionist group based in Nablus that sought to prevent the sale of Arab-owned land to Jews by submitting petitions to the Ottoman sultan, or by buying land for sale to preempt its purchase by Jews. In June 1913, he helped to prepare and became secretary of the First Palestinian Congress (also known as the Arab Congress of 1913) in Paris. In congress, he was also the delegate for the Jamma'in subdistrict of the District of Nablus. Meanwhile, Darwaza was still working in the DTPS.|$|E

5|$|Huntsman's {{process was}} only made {{obsolete}} in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's {{invention of the}} Bessemer converter, but production of crucible steel continued {{until well into the}} 20th century for special uses, as Bessemer's steel was not of the same quality, in the main replacing wrought iron for such applications as rails. Bessemer had tried to induce steelmakers to take up his improved system, but met with general rebuffs, and finally <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> undertake the exploitation of the process himself. To this end he erected steelworks in Sheffield. Gradually the scale of production was enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally became aware that the firm of Henry Bessemer & Co. was underselling them to the extent of £20 a ton. One of Bessemer's converters can still be seen at Sheffield's Kelham Island Museum.|$|E
5|$|In November 2003, Webber {{organised}} and {{competed in}} a 10-day trek across Tasmania {{to raise funds}} for children's cancer research charities. Starting in Marrawah on the state's west coast, the trek involved 1,000km of cycling, kayaking and trekking along the southern coast and finished at Coles Bay in the east. Four teams of four competitors each started the trek, with only two teams (including Webber's) completing the entire journey. Along the way, Australian sporting stars Pat Rafter (tennis), Steve Waugh (cricket), Cathy Freeman (athletics), James Tomkins (rowing), Guy Andrews (iron man), and actor Joel Edgerton completed certain parts of the trek. The challenge concluded with a black tie dinner and auction to raise funds. Webber said he <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> organise the event {{after the death of his}} grandfather to cancer, as well as his experiences with friends whose children had battled the disease.|$|E
5|$|Late {{one night}} in 1997, Boston Herald {{reporter}} Tom Mashberg <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> a warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn by William Youngworth {{to see what was}} purported to be The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. Youngworth was a career criminal and associate to New England art thief Myles Connor Jr. Mashberg had been investigating the theft and was briefly allowed to view the painting with a flashlight. He was given a vial of paint chips for authenticity. These were later confirmed by experts to be fragments of Dutch 17th-century origin—but not from the stolen painting. It was never concretely determined to be real or fake, and the FBI quit speaking to Youngworth after not making any progress. The painting has since disappeared.|$|E

5|$|On Saturday, February 7, Murray's father Fred {{arrived in}} Amherst. He told {{investigators}} he and Maura went car-shopping that afternoon and later went {{to dinner with}} a friend of Murray's. Murray dropped her father off at his motel room and, borrowing his Toyota Corolla, she returned to campus to attend a dorm party. She arrived at 10:30 pm. At 2:30 am on Sunday, February 8, she left the party. At 3:30 am, en route to her father's motel, she struck a guardrail on Route 9 in Hadley causing nearly $10,000 worth of damage to her father's car. The responding officer wrote an accident report but there is no documentation of sobriety field tests being conducted. She <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> her father's motel and stayed in his room the rest of the morning. At 4:49 am, there was a cell phone call placed to Murray's boyfriend from Fred's phone. The participants and content of the phone call are unknown.|$|E
5|$|On islands, birds can {{contribute}} {{as much as}} 60% of a cat's diet. In nearly all cases, however, the cat cannot be identified as the sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds, and in some instances, eradication of cats has caused a 'mesopredator release' effect; where the suppression of top carnivores creates an abundance of smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared prey. Domestic cats are, however, {{known to be a}} contributing factor to the decline of many species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, to extinction. The South Island piopio, Chatham rail, the New Zealand merganser, and the common diving petrel are a few from a long list, with the most extreme case being the flightless Lyall's wren, which <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> extinction only a few years after its discovery.|$|E
5|$|The 27th Infantry Regiment lost 53 men killed, 221 wounded, and 49 missing, a {{total of}} 323 battle {{casualties}} during the battles along the Hwanggan road.

The NK 2nd Division suffered heavily during this time to US artillery and armor, some estimates placing its losses above 3,000 men in the battles along the road. The US 1st Cavalry Division initially took the 27th Infantry's place on the line, but retreated without engaging the NK 2nd Division after movement by the NK 3rd Division threatened to take Kumch'on and block the US division's route of supply. The division <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> the Naktong River by July 31, having taken 916 battle casualties at Hwanggan and Sangju in its first ten days on the line.
