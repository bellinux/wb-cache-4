5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove {{as if someone}} applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling of the knee joint and that the <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> probably already dead before the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldskær <b>Woman</b> <b>was</b> a victim of ritual sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Before Maria's arrival, {{tropical}} storm watches were issued {{for most of}} the Lesser Antilles on September8; the watches were upgraded to {{tropical storm}} warnings at 2230UTC. On the following day, Puerto Rico and many of the U.S. Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands were placed under a tropical storm watch. The watches and warnings for the islands were discontinued around 1500UTC on September10, after the strong thunderstorms diminished from Maria's center. The storm's effects on the island of Puerto Rico were primarily in the form of heavy rainfall. Flood waters near Patillas, Puerto Rico, destroyed several homes and bridges, causing $1.3 million (2011 USD) in damage. In the surrounding city of Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, heavy rainfall flooded and damaged around 150 homes. Many people were forced to relocate after rainfall and mud filled their homes. Near the city of Naguabo, Puerto Rico, the car of a 60-year-old <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> swept away by flood waters on a road.
