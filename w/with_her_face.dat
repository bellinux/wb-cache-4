5|$|A female human {{trafficking}} victim is interviewed <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> hidden. She describes {{how she and}} other {{human trafficking}} victims in Eastern Europe were held in buildings with security cameras, where {{they were forced to}} walk naked down a runway before a group of men who watched under the guise of attending a fashion show. She then describes being auctioned off to the audience members, who she says examined her off the runway as one might examine cattle.|$|E
5|$|Interest in Etty {{declined}} {{after his}} death as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Very few subsequent artists have been influenced by Etty, and one of the few later works on which Candaules can be considered an influence is The Knight Errant, painted by John Everett Millais in 1870, which in its depiction of a rape victim, distraught and <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> turned away from the viewer, was a return to the style developed by Etty in Candaules of forcing the viewer to feel complicity in witnessing the sexual degradation of a woman, and which drew similar criticism.|$|E
5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are {{on their hands and}} knees in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E

5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E

25|$|The Death of the Firstborn, by Mr. Weguelin, shows a {{young man}} {{stretched}} out stark for the funeral-rites, and his mother (perhaps, rather, his wife) crouched on the ground <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> hidden between her knees; a sufficiently well-conceived treatment, fairly executed, but not to be called intense.|$|E
25|$|Some 2-peso coins {{were issued}} in 1999 {{to commemorate the}} centenary {{of the birth of}} world-famous writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges; they had an image of Borges' face on one side, and a {{labyrinth}} and the Hebrew letter aleph on the other. In addition, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of Eva Perón, on September 18, 2002 a new 2-peso coin <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was created. It was said that this coin would replace the old AR$2 banknote if inflation continued to be high. None of the 2-peso coins are currently in wide circulation.|$|E
25|$|In a late-1990s interview, Page stated {{she would}} not allow any current {{pictures}} of her to be shown {{because of concerns about}} her weight. However, in 1997, Page changed her mind and agreed to a rare television interview for the aforementioned E! True Hollywood Story/Page special on the condition that the location of the interview and her face not be revealed (she was shown <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and dress electronically blacked out). Page allowed a publicity picture to be taken of her for the August 2003 edition of Playboy. In 2006, the Los Angeles Times ran an article headlined A Golden Age for a Pinup, covering an autographing session at her current publicity company, CMG Worldwide. Once again, Page declined to be photographed, saying she would rather be remembered as she was.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, Suzanne Rogers was {{diagnosed}} with a rare muscle disorder called Myasthenia Gravis. This disease affected her facial muscles and the medication she needed made her feel ill, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> appearing swollen while also suffering hair loss. Rogers was forced to quit the show after 11 years when the effects of the disease became increasingly worse. Her entire appearance changed, and she did not return to the show for a year. Rogers, wanting to educate viewers about the disease, approached executive producer Betty Corday about her character being diagnosed with the disease. Corday agreed, and a storyline played out with Maggie learning she has myasthenia gravis. The actress went into remission in 1995, and has remained in remission since. In 2010, Maggie began to notice some symptoms of the disease returning.|$|E
25|$|Duchamp's final major {{art work}} {{surprised}} {{the art world}} that believed {{he had given up}} art for chess 25 years earlier. Entitled Étant donnés: 1° la chute d'eau / 2° le gaz d'éclairage ("Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas"), it is a tableau, visible only through a peep hole in a wooden door. A nude woman can be seen lying on her back <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> hidden, legs spread, and one hand holding a gas lamp in the air against a landscape backdrop. Duchamp had worked secretly on the piece from 1946 to 1966 in his Greenwich Village studio while even his closest friends thought he had abandoned art. The torso of the nude figure is based on Duchamp's lover, the Brazilian sculptor Maria Martins, with whom he had an affair from 1946 to 1951.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the month, Wright {{announced}} that the next video would be released [...] "in exactly 1.444 metric hours" [...] on his YouTube channel. At the appointed time, a new video, titled 11B-3-1369, in black and white with occasional effects and inserts, was published, with [...] "Their lies unlock our dissent", underneath in the description. In it, the figure in the plague doctor costume returned, shown outside the sanatorium in the forest at first, and later within. The soundtrack was quieter than that of the first video and included some electronic tinkling noises which were synchronized with the blinker on the figure's hand. Later in the video, the plague-doctor figure is joined by a woman in a white dress <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> covered in bandages.|$|E

Andy then gets back in his wheelchair, turns round, and begins to wheel himself home.|$|R
500|$|The CD single {{contains}} both [...] "Baby Don't Cry" [...] and [...] "Nobody", plus shortened {{versions of}} the tracks. These versions were used for various Japanese television commercials. The CD artwork features a close-up facial shot of Amuro, whilst the DVD single has a close up <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and eyes closed. The DVD single includes the music video to [...] "Baby Don't Cry". Both formats features an extra lyric booklet, printed on plain white paper. Musically, [...] "Baby Don't Cry" [...] is a pop ballad, influenced by R and J-pop music. Japanese music editor Random J compared the composition to the works of American recording artist, Janet Jackson. CD Journal staff member's felt the song's composition was [...] "simplistic", and described the lyrical content as [...] "painful".|$|E
500|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} {{the death of}} Maria Dorantes, an illegal immigrant from Mexico living in the San Joaquin Valley near Fresno, California who was found dead, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> partially eaten away, after yellow rain fell from the sky. Maria was {{the object of the}} love of two brothers, Eladio (Raymond Cruz) and Soledad Buente; Soledad blames his brother for her death. The migrants believe that the so-called [...] "Chupacabra" [...] was responsible for her death, despite the fact that none of the circumstances of the death resemble anything close to reports of the Chupacabra. Mulder, assisted on the case by Mexican-American INS agent Conrad Lozano, is able to track down and interrogate Eladio, who frightens the other migrants. Meanwhile, Scully discovers that Maria was killed by a fungal growth known as Aspergillus.|$|E
500|$|Bole heaped praise on the episode's {{final scene}} in which Janeway [...] "stalks" [...] into the {{corridor}} outside sickbay after performing the procedure which restores Tuvok and Neelix. He extolled, [...] "That last shot I did with Kate , as she's walking into the camera, she told the whole story <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> [...] She gave a great performance. [...] I only asked for a few things; she brought that look and emotion to work with her." [...] In his book The Meaning of Star Trek, author Thomas Richards also credited Mulgrew in this scene. [...] Richards saw Janeway troubled by her difficult decision between two undesirable options and how [...] "she must live with the choice. [...] death has cast a shadow over the ship, {{and for the first}} time in the series the Federation has put to death one of its own." ...|$|E

500|$|The video {{features}} Madonna in {{a stylized}} recording studio singing the song with back up singers. The video {{was compared to}} the music video of Madonna's single [...] "Rain" [...] (1993). Her look in the video, consists of blue-black icy hair, bright blue eyes and a long dark dress with a beaded necklace around her neck. Madonna's face was mainly shot above her head, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> looking up {{just ahead of the}} camera focus. Sometimes she looks to a video screen behind her which plays the scenes from the film, as if to take inspiration for her singing. Other times she is accompanied by her back-up singers, mainly during the chorus, and sometimes she sings alone. In front of the studio, the producers are shown deciding which part of the song should be put in lower bass.|$|E
500|$|After {{having her}} face {{burned in the}} season nine finale, Tess wakes up in the season ten premiere, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> healed, in a secret lab {{surrounded}} by clones of Lex. In the tenth-season episode [...] "Abandoned", it is revealed that Tess was born Lutessa Lena Luthor and is the illegitimate daughter of Lionel Luthor, conceived with Lex's nanny, Pamela Jenkins. She was brought, by Lionel, to an orphanage run by Granny Goodness when she was 5 years old. Shortly after Tess arrived at the orphanage, Lionel returned and removed Tess from Granny Goodness's guardianship. Lionel wiped most of Tess's memories before putting her up for adoption with the Mercer family. In the series finale, Tess is killed by one of Lex Luthor's clones after she administers a neurotoxin that removes all of the clone's memories {{in an effort to}} protect Clark's secret identity.|$|E
500|$|Although {{each of the}} film's key puppets {{required}} a small team of puppeteers to operate it, the most complex puppet of the production was Hoggle. Shari Weiser was inside the costume, while Hoggle's face was radio-controlled by Brian Henson and three other operators. Speaking in the Inside the Labyrinth documentary, Brian Henson explained that Weiser [...] "does all the body movement and her head is inside the head. However, the jaw is not connected to her jaw. Nothing that the face is doing has any connection with what she's doing <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> The other {{four members of the}} crew are all radio crew, myself included." [...] Speaking of the challenges involved with performing Hoggle, Brian Henson said, [...] "five performers trying to get one character out of one puppet was a very tough thing. Basically what it takes is a lot of rehearsing and getting to know each other." ...|$|E
