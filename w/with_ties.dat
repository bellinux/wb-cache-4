5|$|Bouldering {{competitions}} {{occur in}} both {{indoor and outdoor}} settings. The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) employs an indoor format that breaks the competition into three rounds: qualifications, semi-finals, and finals. The rounds feature different sets {{of four or five}} boulder problems, and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to attempt each problem. At the end of each round, competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems, <b>with</b> <b>ties</b> settled {{by the total number of}} attempts taken to solve the problems.|$|E

In 1921 the team's record dipped to 5–3–1, but Pitt made college {{football}} history on October 8, 1921. Harold W.

5|$|Meanwhile, Black Hawk {{learned that}} the Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi tribes were less {{supportive}} than anticipated. As in other tribes, different bands of these tribes often pursued different policies. The Ho-Chunks who lived along the Rock River in Illinois had family ties to the Sauks; they cautiously supported the British Band while trying not to provoke the Americans. Ho-Chunks in Wisconsin were more divided. Some bands, remembering their loss to the Americans in the 1827 Winnebago War, decided to stay clear of the conflict. Other Ho-Chunks <b>with</b> <b>ties</b> to the Dakotas and Menominees, most notably Waukon Decorah and his brothers, were eager {{to fight against the}} British Band.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 International Bowl {{kicked off}} on January3, 2009, at 12:00PM in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

John Saunders, Jesse Palmer, and Doug Flutie, all <b>with</b> <b>ties</b> to Canada, were the announcers for the television broadcast, which aired on ESPN2. The game was watched by over 2millionhouseholds with a rating of 2.12, both the highest in International Bowl history.

5|$|Following Olivia's disappearance, Peter discovers a {{surveillance}} camera in her apartment. He takes its memory device, {{which has been}} overwritten numerous times like a palimpsest, to Walter Bishop's (John Noble) laboratory, using forensic tools to examine previous images on the disc. Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) and Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) take Nina into custody, learning that someone with Nina's bio-metric signature had accessed the Massive Dynamic supply of Cortexiphan {{over the last few}} months; Nina is surprised by this but refuses to talk. As they work, Walter accuses Peter of taking advantage of Olivia's state, even if unintentionally, imprinting his memories of Olivia of the original timeline onto her. They identify a face belonging to Leland Spivey (Monte Markham), a man <b>with</b> <b>ties</b> to Jones and Nina, and Peter suspects that they are dosing Olivia with Cortexiphan for nefarious purposes. Their work is disrupted by the sudden appearance of the Observer September (Michael Cerveris), bleeding from a chest wound.|$|E
5|$|In Norfolk, {{the revolt}} {{was led by}} Geoffrey Litster, a weaver, and Sir Roger Bacon, a local lord <b>with</b> <b>ties</b> to the Suffolk rebels. Litster began sending out {{messengers}} across the county in a call to arms on 14 June, and isolated outbreaks of violence occurred. The rebels assembled on 17 June outside Norwich and killed Sir Robert Salle, {{who was in charge}} of the city defences and had attempted to negotiate a settlement. The people of the town then opened the gates to let the rebels in. They began looting buildings and killed Reginald Eccles, a local official. William de Ufford, the Earl of Suffolk fled his estates and travelled in disguise to London. The other leading members of the local gentry were captured and forced to play out the roles of a royal household, working for Litster. Violence spread out across the county, as gaols were opened, Flemish immigrants killed, court records burned, and property looted and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Last of the Summer Wine {{focused on}} a trio of older men and their {{youthful}} antics. The original trio consisted of Compo Simmonite, Norman Clegg, and Cyril Blamire. Blamire left in 1976, when Michael Bates fell ill shortly before filming of the third series, requiring Clarke to hastily rewrite the series with a new third man. The third member of the trio would be recast four times {{over the next three}} decades: Foggy Dewhurst in 1976, Seymour Utterthwaite in 1986, Foggy again in 1990, and Truly Truelove in 1997. After Compo died in 1999, his son, Tom Simmonite, filled the gap for the rest of that series, and Billy Hardcastle joined the cast as the third lead character in 2001. The trio became a quartet between 2003 and 2006 when Alvin Smedley moved in next door to Nora Batty, but returned to the usual threesome in 2006 when Billy Hardcastle left the show. The role of supporting character Entwistle steadily grew until the beginning of the 30th series, when he and Alvin were recruited by Hobbo Hobdyke, a former milkman <b>with</b> <b>ties</b> to MI5, to form a new trio of volunteers who respond to any emergency.|$|E

5|$|One {{factor in}} William's favour was his {{marriage}} to Matilda of Flanders, the daughter of Count Baldwin V of Flanders. The union was arranged in 1049, but Pope Leo IX forbade the marriage at the Council of Rheims in October 1049. The marriage nevertheless went ahead {{some time in the}} early 1050s, possibly unsanctioned by the pope. According to a late source not generally considered to be reliable, papal sanction was not secured until 1059, but as papal-Norman relations in the 1050s were generally good, and Norman clergy were able to visit Rome in 1050 without incident, it was probably secured earlier. Papal sanction of the marriage appears to have required the founding of two monasteries in Caen– one by William and one by Matilda. The marriage was important in bolstering William's status, as Flanders was one of the more powerful French territories, <b>with</b> <b>ties</b> to the French royal house and to the German emperors. Contemporary writers considered the marriage, which produced four sons and five or six daughters, to be a success.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller's {{charitable}} giving began {{with his first}} job as a clerk at age 16, when he gave six percent of his earnings to charity, as recorded in his personal ledger. By {{the time he was}} twenty, his charity exceeded ten percent of his income. Much of his giving was church-related. His church was later affiliated with the Northern Baptist Convention, which formed from American Baptists in the North <b>with</b> <b>ties</b> to their historic missions to establish schools and colleges for freedmen in the South after the American Civil War. Rockefeller attended Baptist churches every Sunday; when traveling he would often attend services at African-American Baptist congregations, leaving a substantial donation. As Rockefeller's wealth grew, so did his giving, primarily to educational and public health causes, but also for basic science and the arts. He was advised primarily by Frederick Taylor Gates after 1891, and, after 1897, also by his son.|$|E
5|$|After Phocas's fall, Heraclius became {{emperor of}} Byzantium. The Patriarch Nikephoros claims in his Short History that the crown was first offered to Priscus, who refused it. As {{commander}} of the excubitores, a protopatrikios (first among the patrician order) {{and one of the}} few senior and influential officials <b>with</b> <b>ties</b> to past regimes, Priscus represented a potential threat to Heraclius. Nevertheless, facing a critical situation in the East, where the Persians had overrun much territory and were raiding Anatolia, Heraclius appointed Priscus in command of the Anatolian army in the autumn of 611. The Persian general Shahin captured Caesarea in Cappadocia, only to be blockaded and besieged there by Priscus. Heraclius himself decided to visit the army camp at Caesarea during winter, but Priscus refused to meet him, on the pretext of an illness. This snub alienated Heraclius from his general, and when Shahin and his army managed to break out and escape in summer, Priscus was recalled to Constantinople, ostensibly to become godfather to the Byzantine emperor's son, Heraclius Constantine. At the capital, he was removed from his post as comes excubitorum, which went to Heraclius's cousin Nicetas, while command in Anatolia went to the other surviving general of Maurice, Philippicus, brought out of retirement. Priscus was brought before the Byzantine Senate and accused by Heraclius of treason. In the end, he was tonsured as a monk on 5 December 612 and confined in the Monastery of the Chora, where he died in 613.|$|E
