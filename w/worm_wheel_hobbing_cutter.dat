25|$|Gashing is a {{machining}} process used {{to rough out}} coarse pitched gears and sprockets. It is commonly used on <b>worm</b> <b>wheels</b> before <b>hobbing,</b> but also used on internal and external spur gears, bevel gears, helical gears, and gear racks. The process is performed on gashers or universal milling machines, {{especially in the case}} of <b>worm</b> <b>wheels.</b> After gashing the gear or sprocket is finished via hobbing, shaping, or shaving.|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to {{problems}} of designing tools for machining for processing the surface cycloidal rotor of gerotor gear. Such tools are in particular <b>hobbing</b> <b>cutters</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheels.</b> Despite {{the fact that the}} above described tools are known in the world, virtually no information about the method of designing. Mostly it mathematical apparatus that would allow us to build a profile of this tools. Based on the analysis for the rotary tool rake and graphic-analytical synthesis was formulated and solved the problem of the existence of discriminant (tangent curve) of family rotor position, and received its equations, which have advantages over numerical and graphical-analytical methods of construction and are relatively easy for the user. The research results can be used as an engineering methodology in the design and manufacture of <b>hobbing</b> <b>cutters</b> and grinding <b>wheels</b> for machining rotors gerotor gear under the conditions of rounding. ?????? ????????? ????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ??? ????????? ????????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ???????. ?????? ????????????? ? ????????? ???????? ????????? ????? ? ????????? ???????????? ?????. ???????? ?? ??, ??? ????????? ???? ??????????? ???????? ? ????, ??????????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ???????? ?? ??????????????. ??????? ??????? ??? ?????????????? ???????, ??????? ?? ???????? ??????? ??????? ????????????. ? ?????????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ?????-???????????????? ????? ? ??????????????????? ??????? ???? ?????????????? ? ?????? ?????? ? ????????????? ?????????????

40|$|One of {{the most}} wide spread and {{efficient}} spline shafts manufacturing methods is their cutting by the means of generating process by <b>hob</b> <b>cutters.</b> In this case, <b>hob</b> <b>cutter’s</b> theoretical profile, taking in to account its inadaptability to manufacture, traditionally is approximated by the section(s) {{of one or two}} circles. In some cases this approach do not provides necessary accuracy or increase complexity of the manufacturing process. Alternative to the traditional approximation approach is theoretical profile substitution by the circle involute section. Absence of the methods for circle involute parameters evaluation makes this work relevant. There is approach suggested for this kind of substitution, based on equality of theoretical profile’s and substituting curve’s curvature radii in rated points. Methods and algorithms for substituting circle involute parameters and substitution accuracy evaluation are suggested. Given evaluation result shows more than 20 times higher approximation accuracy in comparison with the circle section substitution...|$|R
40|$|Plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is widely}} used in the vehicle {{manufacturing}} field because it is favorable for weight lightening, vibration and noise reduction, as well as corrosion resistance. However, {{it is very difficult}} for general plastics to secure the mechanical properties that are required for vehicle gears. If the plastic resin is reinforced by glass fiber in the fabrication process of plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> it is possible to achieve the mechanical properties of metallic material levels. In this study, the mechanical characteristic analysis of the glass-reinforced plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> according to the contents of glass fiber, is performed by analytic and experimental methods. In the case of the glass fiber-reinforced resin, the orientation and contents of glass fibers can influence the mechanical properties. For the characteristic prediction of plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> computer-aided engineering (CAE) analysis processes such as structural and injection molding analysis were executed with the polyamide resin reinforcement glass fiber (25 wt %, 50 wt %). The injection mold for fabricating the prototype plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> was designed and made to reflect the CAE analysis results. Finally, the durability of prototype plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> fabricated by the injection molding process was evaluated by the experimental method and the characteristics according to the glass fiber contents...|$|R

40|$|Number of {{conventional}} methods {{are available for}} solving different types of optimization problems. But due to their complexity and convergence problems these methods {{are not able to}} give optimal solution. A gear transmission problem {{is one of the most}} complex optimization problems because of relationship between different variables. A Gear design require the designer to compromise many design variables; i. e. continuous, discrete & integer variables in order to determine best performance of gear set. Therefore researchers are now going to use Evolutionary Techniques. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one of such technique. In this paper the attempt has been made to optimize <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> with multiple objectives, which takes gear ratio (i), face width of <b>worm</b> & <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> (b) and pitch circle diameters of worm (dw) & <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> (dg) as design variables.

40|$|Abstract: Owing to {{the complex}} {{geometry}} of helical cutting tools, several manufacturing pro-cesses are required to produce {{the profile of the}} cutter and the cutting angles. If the traditional method of manufacture were used, the cost would be frustratingly expensive. In this paper, a novel straight-sided <b>hob</b> <b>cutter</b> design consisting of two curved cutting edges and three straight cutting edges with different pressure angles is proposed. By applying designed rake profile equations of a <b>hob</b> <b>cutter,</b> the principle of coordinate transformation, the theory of differential geometry, and the theory of gearing, a mathematical model of the helical cutting tool is derived. In addition, the cutting angles, the condition of full undercutting, and the width of the top land of the cutter are also studied. The novelty of the design is such that the multiangles of the helical cutting tool can be manufactured in one hobbing process, thereby simplifying the man-ufacturing process. The results and concepts proposed in the paper will be beneficial as design guidance for tool designers, will enhance the manufacturing processes of helical cutting tools, and will assist tool-related industries in upgrading their technology and competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|Effect of {{tilting angle}} on the {{dynamics}} of tilting table driven by <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> Wenming Wei, Jun Zhang, Dun Lu and Wanhua Zhao The dynamics of tilting table behaves differently during five-axis machining due to the constant changes {{of the position of}} its center of mass which leads to different forces acting on parts of the transmission system. In this research, the lumped parameter method is used to model {{the dynamics of}} tilting table driven by <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> in the tilting direction, where the varying stiffness of the transmission system at different tilting angles is considered. The impact testing experiments of tilting table system with tilting angles from 0 to 90 are also performed to verify the analytical model. The results from sensitivity analysis show that the three stiffnesses have a great effect on the variation of system natural frequency in the tilting direction, including the equivalent tangential meshing stiffness of <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> the torsional stiffness of <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> shaft, and the axial stiffness of worm supporting bearings. Moreover, the variations of system natural frequency with the three stiffnesses at different tilting angles are further investigated...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{worm gear}} drives usually show run-in capable {{material}} pairing. In {{most cases the}} worm is made of case hardened steel and the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> of copper-tin alloy. This choice of material leads to an effective avoidance of the appearance of scuffing. The wear of the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> which is desirable in the running-in phase, limits, along with the known load carrying capacities of other gear types, the life expectancy of the gear set. The {{aim of this study}} is to optimize the copper-tin alloys of the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> with respect to the wear properties. Extensive tests on worm gear drives with different copper-tin alloys allow statements concerning the effects of varying the different material parameters to the wear behaviour. The result is a wear optimized <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> material and an extended load carrying capacity calculation. Furthered load carrying capacity calculation makes a contribution which forms the existing calculation procedure more accurately. The derivation of a statistical evaluation procedure for the test results leads to a wear life expectancy with a specification of an appearance probability. The physical based wear parameter allows the prediction of the wear behaviour of copper-tin alloys using the material properties. Detailed measurements of the power losses in the worm gear drives make possible the calculation of the tooth coefficient of friction of the various material pairing. The introduced order- and purchase regulations guarantee, that in the future, the optimized bronze can be reproduced and supplied. (orig.)
