25|$|Printed {{circuit boards}} {{are used in}} all but the {{simplest}} electronic products. Alternatives to PCBs include <b>wire</b> <b>wrap</b> and point-to-point construction. PCBs require the additional design effort to lay out the circuit, but manufacturing and assembly can be automated. Manufacturing circuits with PCBs is cheaper and faster than with other wiring methods as components are mounted and wired with one single part.|$|E
25|$|Before printed {{circuits}} (and {{for a while}} after their invention), point-to-point construction was used. For prototypes, or small production runs, <b>wire</b> <b>wrap</b> or turret board can be more efficient. Predating the printed circuit invention, and similar in spirit, was John Sargrove's 1936â€“1947 Electronic Circuit Making Equipment (ECME) which sprayed metal onto a Bakelite plastic board. The ECME could produce three radio boards per minute.|$|E
25|$|Creep {{can cause}} gradual {{cut-through}} of wire insulation, especially when stress is concentrated by pressing insulated wire against a sharp edge or corner. Special creep-resistant insulations such as Kynar (polyvinylidene fluoride) {{are used in}} wirewrap applications to resist cut-through due to the sharp corners of <b>wire</b> <b>wrap</b> terminals. Teflon insulation is resistant to elevated temperatures and has other desirable properties, but is notoriously vulnerable to cold-flow cut-through failures caused by creep.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>wrapping</b> {{comes from}} the {{tradition}} of rope splicing. Early <b>wire</b> <b>wrapping</b> was performed manually; a slow and careful process. <b>Wire</b> <b>wrapping</b> was used for splices and for finishing cable ends in suspension bridge wires and other wire rope rigging, usually with a smaller diameter <b>wire</b> <b>wrapped</b> around a larger wire or bundle of wires. Such techniques were purely mechanical, to add strength or prevent fraying.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>wrapping</b> {{techniques}} are not frequently used for mass-produced jewelry because machines can cast (mold) jewelry components faster, more cheaply, and more precisely. At this time, the <b>wire</b> <b>wrapping</b> approach to making jewelry is primarily employed by individual craftspeople.|$|R
25|$|While the Block I version used 4,100 ICs, each {{containing}} a single three-input NOR gate, the later Block II version (used in the crewed flights) used 2,800 ICs, each with dual three-input NOR gates. The ICs, from Fairchild Semiconductor, were implemented using resistor-transistor logic (RTL) in a flat-pack. They were connected via <b>wire</b> <b>wrap,</b> and the wiring was then embedded in cast epoxy plastic. The {{use of a}} single type of IC (the dual NOR3) throughout the AGC avoided problems that plagued another early IC computer design, the Minuteman II guidance computer, which used a mix of diode-transistor logic and diode logic gates.|$|E
2500|$|Cyanoacrylates are a {{class of}} {{fast-acting}} adhesives and glues. Better known under the brand name [...] "Super Glue," [...] cyanoacrylates are used to assemble prototype electronics (see <b>Wire</b> <b>wrap),</b> flying model aircraft, and as retention dressings for nuts and bolts. Their effectiveness in bonding metal and general versatility have also made them popular for use in simple woodworking, industrial binding, and appliance repair. The history of cyanoacrylates is one of accidental discovery when researchers under Dr. Harry Coover conducted experiments on adhesive chemicals in order to devise a clear plastic {{that could be used}} for precision gunsights for soldiers fighting in World War II. Failing in their experimentations, the practical usefulness of cyanoarcrylates did not materialize until much later when in 1951, Coover, who was then working at Eastman Kodak, came to the realization that the sticky adhesives had unique properties in that they required no heat or pressure to permanently bond two items together. In light of his invention of [...] "Super Glue," [...] Coover filed U.S. patent #2,768,109 on June 2, 1954 and it was issued to him on October 23, 1956.|$|E

50|$|Examples of {{wire and}} beaded jewelry made using <b>wire</b> <b>wrapping</b> {{techniques}} {{date back to}} thousands of years BC. The British Museum has samples of jewelry from the Sumerian Dynasty, found in the cemetery of Ur that contain spiraled wire components. This jewelry is dated at approximately 2000 BC. Other samples of jewelry from Ancient Rome show <b>wire</b> <b>wrapped</b> loops (one of the important techniques in making <b>wire</b> <b>wrapped</b> jewelry). This Roman jewelry is dated to approximately 2000 years ago. In the manufacture of this early jewelry the techniques for soldering did not exist. Later, as the technique for soldering developed, the <b>wire</b> <b>wrapping</b> approach continued {{because it was an}} economical and quick way to make jewelry components out of wire.|$|R
40|$|Broken {{prestressing}} <b>wire</b> <b>wraps</b> are {{the main}} cause of failure in prestressed concrete cylinder pipes (PCCP). The effect of the number and location of broken <b>wire</b> <b>wraps</b> on the structural performance of PCCP is investigated using advanced numerical modeling that considers full interaction between the spigot and bell ends of adjacent pipes. The stresses and strains in the various components of PCCP are evaluated with increasing internal pressure. A sensitivity analysis is performed to understand how manipulating the severity of the damage through varying the number of broken <b>wire</b> <b>wraps</b> affects the internal fluid pressure that causes failure. A 244 -cm (96 -in.) embedded cylinder pipe (ECP) is modeled with 5, 35, 70, and 100 broken <b>wire</b> <b>wraps.</b> The results obtained show that the internal fluid pressure required to cause failure can be as much as 14 % lower when the damage is at the joint, and that the internal pressure that causes yielding of the <b>wire</b> <b>wraps</b> decreases approximately 65 % as the severity of the damage increases from 5 to 100 broken wires.

50|$|In {{telecommunications}} <b>wire</b> <b>wrap</b> is {{in common}} high volume use in modern communications networks for cross connects of copper wiring.

Wirewrap panels are rated for high quality data services, including Cat 5 grade wiring. The principal competitor in this application is punch blocks, which are quicker but less secure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>wrapping</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{techniques}} for making handmade jewelry. This technique is done with some jewelry wire and findings similar to wire (like head-pins) to make components. Wire components are then connected to one another using mechanical techniques with no soldering or heating of the wire. Frequently, in this approach, a wire is bent into a loop or other decorative shape and then the <b>wire</b> is <b>wrapped</b> around itself to finish the wire component making that loop or decorative shape permanent. Because of this technique for <b>wrapping</b> <b>wire</b> around itself, this craft is called <b>wire</b> <b>wrapping.</b>|$|R
