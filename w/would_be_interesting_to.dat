The captain decides {{that they should be}} exiled to Ceti AlphaV, a harsh world that Kirk {{believes}} would be a perfect place for Khan to start his kingdom. Khan claims he is up to the challenge of taming the world and accepts Kirk's offer. Instead of a court-martial for Lt.McGivers, Kirk allows her to go into exile with Khan. Spock notes that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see what Khan makes of Ceti AlphaV in 100years.|$|E
5|$|Carmella's {{relationship}} with Connor was originally scripted for Nina Tucker, but {{was transferred to}} Carmella by the producers on Goodrem's departure. Upon Carmella's introduction, her only family member was her mobster father Rocco, who {{had been sent to}} prison. In 2006, Carmella was given a sister, when Natalie Saleeba was cast in the role of Rosetta Cammeniti. Blair opined that Rosie's inclusion brought out different sides to Carmella's character. Many viewers told Blair they felt the casting was good because they look alike. One of the significant changes to Carmella was that she started having fun again—Blair felt this meant they worked well together. Later, Erin McNaught was cast as her cousin Sienna Cammeniti. McNaught commented {{that there had been a}} rivalry between the cousins in their youth, so it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see what unfolded between them.|$|E

25|$|Livia {{played a}} vital role in the {{formation}} of her children Tiberius and Drusus. Attention focuses on her part in the divorce of her first husband, father of Tiberius, in 39/38 BC. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> know her role in this, as well as in Tiberius' divorce of Vipsania Agrippina in 12 BC at Augustus' insistence: whether it was merely neutral or passive, or whether she actively colluded in Caesar's wishes. The first divorce left Tiberius a fosterchild at the house of Octavian; the second left Tiberius with a lasting emotional scar, since he had been forced to abandon the woman he loved for dynastic considerations.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, he met {{his second}} wife, Hadassah Freilich Tucker, while {{he was running for}} Attorney General of Connecticut. Hadassah Tucker's parents were Holocaust survivors. According to Washington Jewish Week, Lieberman called her for a date because he thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> go out with someone named Hadassah. (Hadassah {{is the name of the}} Women's Zionist Organization of America). Since March 2005, Hadassah Lieberman has worked for Hill & Knowlton, a {{lobbying}} firm based in New York City, as a senior counselor in its health and pharmaceuticals practice. She has held senior positions at the Hospital of Saint Raphael in New Haven, the American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (APCO), Pfizer, National Research Council, Hoffmann-La Roche, and Lehman Brothers.|$|E
25|$|For the {{complexity}} classes defined in this way, {{it is desirable}} to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. In particular, although DTIME(n) is contained in DTIME(n2), it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is {{needed in order to}} increase the number of problems that can be solved.|$|E

500|$|Rhys has a {{one-night stand}} with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) not long after his introduction. Rhys meets Kate in the local bar {{and they have a}} [...] "big night out"; the {{following}} morning Kate wakes up in Rhys' apartment. Brewer told a writer for Inside Soap [...] "You don't actually see the lead-up– one minute she meets Rhys in a bar, the next minute we see that they've already slept together!" [...] Kate feels awkward about the situation, but it is made worse when she is unable to remember Rhys' name. When Kate and Rhys meet again, they have different attitudes to their one-night stand. Brewer said Rhys is [...] "a bit of a player", so it is not a big deal to him. He does not have any expectations of Kate, but she is uncomfortable with it and tries to cover her tracks. In November 2011, Brewer said it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> revisit the relationship between Rhys and Kate. Barber also thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see where the characters could go together.

500|$|The {{idea for}} the episode was pitched by Simpsons writer Ron Hauge, who thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see an episode in which Bart would run into a retired Western film star in the {{neighborhood}} and [...] "think he was the coolest guy in the world", although the actor had seen better days. Hauge suggested that Swartzwelder, who is an avid Western fan, would be the appropriate writer for the episode. Swartzwelder also pitched the plot idea about the angry dog who chases Bart in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Sakanaction {{was first}} formed in August 2005 in Sapporo, Hokkaido. It was {{originally}} a two-member unit, consisting of vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi and guitarist Motoharu Iwadera. Yamaguchi first worked together with Iwadera {{in the band}} Dutchman, that formed at their high school in 1998 and performed British rock-inspired music. In 2004, the band broke up, and Yamaguchi took the name for his solo project, where he created techno and club music. Yamaguchi {{had the idea that}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> mix electronic music with Japanese-style [...] "folky melodies", so formed Sakanaction with Iwadera.|$|E
500|$|Although Tony did {{not appear}} in the show until September 2008, his arrival was {{anticipated}} from April of that year, when EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer commented that the series was building a picture of his character, and that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see him on-screen. It was reported on 2 July 2008 that Tony would be arriving in the serial as part of a child sexual abuse storyline involving Whitney. BBC News described the plot as an ongoing [...] "predatory paedophile storyline", noting that {{this was the first time}} this subject matter had been tackled by a UK soap opera.|$|E

500|$|He {{earned a}} degree in Computer Science & Engineering in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, which due to his {{background}} in computers he found [...] "quite easy", but describes himself as spending much of his time there teaching himself digital art and animation, and later did a minor in digital art and design at Donghua University. Still interested in video games, he was involved in making three video games as part of a student group while in school. Upon graduating, he had trouble finding a job in the Chinese video game industry that combined his interests of [...] "engineering, art, and design", and additionally felt that [...] "very few games [...] actually achieved those qualities that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> an adult". He also considered working in digital animation for films.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode title}} is a {{reference}} to the standard of the Roman legion, a symbol that represents the legion's unity. While the storyline detailing its theft was based on fiction, Heller believed that it showed how Caesar could turn [...] "misfortune into opportunity. He was always one step ahead of his enemies." [...] Certain characters were changed from their traditional images; for instance, while Brutus has been portrayed as the noblest Roman, Heller and historical consultant Jonathan Stamp thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> have him forced into his later role through his ancestry. Alluding to the fact that Brutus' great great great grandfather [...] "drove the last king out of Rome", Stamp said that [...] "his family history was pushing him in one direction, his emotions in another." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{casting the}} two leading {{actors in the}} film, Bertino sought Liv Tyler {{for the role of}} Kristen. Tyler, who had not worked for several years after the birth of her son, {{accepted}} the part after being impressed by the script: [...] "I especially liked Bryan's way of saying a lot, but not saying everything. Often in movies, it's all spelled out for you, and the dialogue is very explanatory. But Bryan doesn't write like that; he writes how normal people communicate—with questions lingering. I knew it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> act that." [...] Canadian actor Scott Speedman was cast as James. Speedman was also impressed by the script, stating that [...] "the audience actually gets time to breathe with the characters before things get scary as hell. That got me interested from the first pages".|$|E

500|$|The writing staff {{wanted to}} do an episode where the Simpsons family {{traveled}} to Australia. They had previously poked fun at several American institutions and thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> poke fun at a whole nation. They designed Australia and the Australian people very inaccurately and many things were completely made up for fun. The episode [...] "Bart vs. Australia" [...] received a mixed reception in Australia, with some Australian fans saying the episode was a mockery of their country. Shortly after it had aired, the Simpsons staff received over 100 letters from Australians who were insulted by the episode. Reiss claimed that this episode is Australia's least favorite, and that [...] "whenever we have the Simpsons visit another country, that country gets furious, including Australia". He also claimed that they were [...] "condemned in the Australian Parliament after the episode had aired".|$|E
500|$|Shore {{traced the}} concept {{for the title}} {{character}} to {{his experience as a}} patient at a teaching hospital. Shore recalled: [...] "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [...] and I thought that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see a character who actually did that before they left the room." [...] A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be disabled in some way. The original idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox rejected this. Jacobs later expressed her gratitude for the network's insistence that the character be reimagined—putting him on his feet added a crucial physical dimension. The writers ultimately chose to give House a damaged leg arising from an incorrect diagnosis, which requires him to use a cane and causes him pain that leads to a narcotic dependency.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Ian McKellen {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} not be reprising his role as Magneto in the Origins movie citing his age, and Shuler Donner stated that the movie might never be made, stating it was [...] "at the back of the queue" [...] in the studio's priorities. Both Donner and Bryan Singer have stated that Magneto would not be produced as the plot of X-Men: First Class [...] "superseded" [...] the story of the planned film. Singer denied using Sheldon Turner's script for Magneto as inspiration to write his draft of First Class, but the Writer's Guild of America arbitration still credited Turner for the film's story, while Moss and Schwartz's collaborations ended up uncredited. Singer set the film in a period where Xavier and Magneto were in their twenties, and seeing that it was during the 1960s, added the Cuban Missile Crisis as a backdrop, considering it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> [...] "discuss this contemporary concept in a historical context". Shuler Donner suggested the Hellfire Club as the villains.|$|E
