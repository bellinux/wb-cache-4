5000|$|Carr {{also felt}} that while {{targeted}} programs must address the issues of education, economics, health and wellbeing for vulnerable populations, the enabling environment that drove their marginalization—what Carr saw as [...] "a constant assault on the humanity of gay and bisexual people from elected officials, homophobic dance hall artists, and religious leaders who believe that gay rights are against God’s will"—must also be changed to facilitate their advancement. He therefore worked with his dedicated team of activists to dismantle the homophobic attitudes and promote {{the establishment of a}} safer, more inclusive environment as a key component of their programs, particularly as it related to the national legal and policy frameworks that supported this marginalization. His work as a human rights activist not only embraced this need for legislative and policy changes to remove discrimination and stigma but also the establishment of specific programs managed by marginalized groups to empower them and address their health and social needs. Including health and social needs directly tied to a legacy of violence: 'There were no treatments available in the Caribbean initially..., so AIDS really was a death sentence. You had people with Kaposi's sarcoma, people with violent diarrhea, who were just wasting away and then dying in really horrible and traumatic ways.'   The terror induced by these deaths, combined with an already intense local culture of homophobia produced a violent backlash.  'To call what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here</b> [...] "stigma and discrimination" [...] was really an understatement. In the ghettos they were putting tires around people who had AIDS and lighting the tires on fire. They were killing gay people because they thought AIDS was contagious.  It was a very extreme environment, and really horrible things were happening.'Carr brought human rights activists together to formulate strategic plans to establish a Caribbean regional organization of vulnerable groups to strengthen their role as advocates, to empower them to address their priority health problems and to change the political, legal, economic and social environment that reinforces their persistent marginalization through stigma and discrimination, reinforcing, [...] "'the change has to come from within; it really has to be Caribbean people taking a stand against this kind of violence and abuse, and against…misinformed, emotionally based, irresponsible attempts at policy making.'" [...] They held meetings in the sanctity of Carr’s home and other safe spaces to create the Caribbean Vulnerable Communities Coalition (CVC) working with key allies to establish the legal, administrative structure and functions as well as funding mechanisms so that the Coalition became a sustainable reality. [...] In 2004, Carr and his colleagues began a social change campaign to break the silence on violence against {{men who have sex with}} men in Jamaica, stimulate public dialogue and change the institutional attitudes and behaviours. The programme approach used by Carr and his colleagues has included interpersonal communication, institutional communication, mass media and other traditional information, education and communication tools. Carr has used media interventions, a dedicated website page with resources, radio and television public service announcements, key spokespersons and research.  Carr’s regional and global reputation and his ability to relate to CARICOM, International Funding Agencies and United Nations agencies such as UNAIDS, UNFPA, UNIFEM and UNDP gave the Coalition critical funding for its strategic objectives; writing, My focus is HIV/AIDS which most dramatically infects and affects the poor in the Caribbean… I straddle the poles of helping those on the ground stay in their homes, find the hope that is medically proven to prolong and improve the quality of their lives, even as I battle with the donor agencies whose policies are set in the metropoles and who all too often find their hands tied by right-wing politics that dominate the West. As I listen to the subaltern speak in my office on a daily basis and tell me of their imminent eviction, of their abandonment by family, their struggle to afford unaffordable blood tests and treatment regimes, the reality of subaltern studies is woven into the warp and woof of my daily life.Because of his advocacy at international conferences and at meetings of the UNAIDS Reference groups on HIV and Human Rights, other working groups, and advisory committees he was able to raise concerns about the urgency of addressing the needs of vulnerable populations across all nations as part of a global strategy. His presentations at international meetings included his famous “Bullshit Address” presentation in Vienna in July 2010 during closing remarks at the Plenary Session MSMG Forum Pre- Conference Meeting to the International AIDS Conference in Vienna Austria (You Tube: The Global forum on MSM & HIV: Part 5: Closing Plenary; Robert Carr; Vienna July 2010). Carr became a global champion of the rights of vulnerable populations and worked with international agencies to promote human rights and access to critical services.|$|E

40|$|Footage of an {{apprentice}} priestess, Tukui, possessed by {{a spirit of}} the ancestors. I was invited to follow Tukui and company on {{their way through the}} village. From the FLEx Notebook: While strolling the town I bumped into Forson Kallai and a woman. I greeted them and asked (as is customary) "Where are you going?" Forson gestured me to follow them. The woman was walking fast. Then I saw that she had smears of white flour {{at the back of her}} neck and on her arms (a sign of traditional ritual). Something <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here.</b> We ended up at the house of the only remaining priestess in town, known as "Adum's wife". There I was offered a seat while Forson, the woman, and the priestess carried out some rituals inside. Lively conversations, prayers to the ancestors and crying of someone whom I presumed to be the woman. After a while Forson appeared outside the room and asked me to come in. I asked whether it was okay to record and he said it was. So I entered, and I switched on my video camera. It became clear that the woman was in trance. She spoke in a stuttering way, often repeating words, and never forming very complicated sentences. Apart from me there were four people present: Forson Kallai; the possessed woman (PW, OK 20120203 and the people recorded in "Neighbours" identify her as Tukui, one of the "pagans" mentioned in 2008 by Prosper Anani.); the priestess, also known as Adum's wife; and Okunuku Adzo, another woman wearing cowrie strings like a priestess. At some point the meeting seemed to be over but that was just the beginning. Some singing of songs and dancing ensued outside on the compound (all videotaped), and then off we went, with the PW striding and the three of us following (leaving Adum's wife behind). First we went to the compound where Eunice (and mother and presumably also this older sister) lives. There was an exchange between Eunice and the PW that has to be transcribed. Then we went on to another compound, where the PW did some very interesting things with two kids. It looked to me like an explicit socialization event: balancing the kid, stretching the limbs, taking both hands together in one hand and letting the baby hang, then taking one leg and doing the same, then switching to the other leg. A slightly older boy who was sitting improperly (legs crossed) was sanctioned. Also on videotape. Then on to another compound, where we met an old man whom the PW called Kodzo. He pointed out that he was actually called Kwami, but the PW kept calling him Kodzo and he quickly (very quickly) gave in. Interestingly, I believe Adzo later tried to explain to him that Kodzo was an older name for him. Both Eunice's sister and Forson Kallai seemed to have a special relation to the PW. Forson announced their coming to every compound with the traditional summons [loboo]. Other notable things: some people are afraid, others arenÂ´t. The former typically get shouted at, the latter enter into an interesting, if quirky, dialog. There is order to this performance. There is sequence, turn-taking, and massive contingency. The PW is not out of control and neither are the bystanders...|$|E
