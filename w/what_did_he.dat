One militant wrote, {{referring}} to al-Balawi's pseudonym: [...] "Our James Bond, who is he? / He is Abu Dujana! / His motto: Let me die or live free! / Our James Bond, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> seek? / Not power or money, / But justice for the weak." ...|$|E
500|$|Health workers {{played an}} {{important}} role in documenting the injuries, which were at the time downplayed or denied by the government of Bahrain. Rheumatologist Fatima Haji, for example, appeared on Al Jazeera television news in a [...] "hysterical" [...] state, describing Isa Abdul Hasan, a man in his 60s who died in her hospital of a head wound he had received from police: [...] "I just started shouting: 'What the hell did this guy do, he was an old man. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> do to deserve this?'"

2500|$|<b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> {{actually}} die of? Mozart's {{medical history}} {{is like an}} inverted pyramid: [...] a small corpus of primary documentation supports {{a large body of}} secondary literature. There is a small quantity of direct eye-witness testimony concerning the last illness and death, and a larger quantity of reporting of what eye witnesses are alleged to have said. [...] Altogether it would not cover ten pages; some of it is vague, and some downright unreliable. All too often later writers have used this data uncritically to support pet theories. They have invented new symptoms, nowhere recorded in the primary sources.|$|E
2500|$|Senator Obama's {{speech on}} Tuesday was a {{brilliant}} effort to deflect attention away from what remains the core issue: what did Obama hear, when did he hear it, and <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> do about it? The answers, {{as best we can}} tell at this stage, is that Obama heard some very harsh things said from the pulpit of Trinity United Church of Christ; that Obama heard them said {{a long time ago and}} probably repeatedly; and that he did little or nothing about it. This from a man who tells us at almost every stop along the campaign trail that he has the [...] "judgment to lead." ...|$|E
