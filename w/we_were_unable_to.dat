500|$|During United's first league {{game of the}} 2008–09 {{season at}} home to Newcastle United, Carrick was {{substituted}} after just 25 minutes {{as a result of}} an injured ankle in the 1–1 draw. The following day, it was confirmed he would be out for up to three weeks, which ruled him out of the UEFA Super Cup match against Zenit St. Petersburg on 29 August. His return to action came on 13 September in a 2–1 away loss to Liverpool, he was taken off at half-time during after sustaining another injury. Three days later, it was revealed he would be out for up to six weeks after breaking a bone in his foot during a challenge with Yossi Benayoun. On 1 November, Carrick scored his first goal of the season in a 4–3 home win over Hull City. His second goal followed two weeks later in a 5–0 home win over Stoke City. His first goal of 2009 came on 22 April as he scored late on in a 2–0 home win over Portsmouth. On 13 May, he assisted Carlos Tevez and then scored a late winner in a 2–1 win away to Wigan. The goal was Carrick's first for United away from home and meant that they only needed one point from their final two games to gain a third successive Premier League title. Carrick ensured a third title in three years with United as they drew with Arsenal 0–0 at home on 18 May to claim an 18th overall English title. On 27 May, Carrick played the full match in the 2009 Champions League Final in a 2–0 defeat by Barcelona. This defeat was described by Carrick as worst night of his career as he said [...] "the game just seemed to pass us by and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> do anything about it. I suppose when you look at the big picture, it was still another Champions League final".|$|E
500|$|The Saint John Mill Rats {{moved to}} the newly created National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) for the 2011–12 season. Anderson debuted in the league debut by {{recording}} 14 points, 5 assists, and 3 steals in a 96–112 loss to the Summerside Storm on November 4, 2011. In a rematch with the same team less than one week later, he posted 25 points, although his team was still defeated by one point. Anderson scored a season-high 35 points in a 106–90 win over the Storm on November 17, hitting three of four three-pointers. He recorded 20 {{points in the second}} half alone. After leading his team in points in three of four games, Anderson earned Player of the Week honors on November 20. The point guard posted his first double-double of the season with 10 points and 10 assist in a 5-point victory over the Halifax Rainmen on December 2, despite making no treys. He was effective again on December 29, scoring 31 points vs. the London Lightning and adding 11 assists. However, on January 3, 2012, Anderson injured his hand in a defeat to the Moncton Miracles and was expected to be sidelined for three to four weeks. General manager Ian McCarthy said, [...] "This really stung because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> finish the game strong against Moncton with Anthony out, and now we have a road game 48 hours later against a tough Quebec team." [...] The Mill Rats responded by signing two players, including Darren Duncan. Anderson returned to the court in a rematch with the Miracles on February 1, notching 15 points and 7 assists. In the remainder of the regular season, he recorded 2 double-doubles and had three games in which he scored 20 or more points. In Game 1 of the NBL Canada Playoffs vs the London Lightning, Anderson recorded 26 points and 12 assists, going 6-of-7 from beyond the arc and 4-of-4 on free throws. He put up another 19 points in the second game. However, Saint John was swept 0–2 in the best-of-3 series and London {{went on to win the}} 2012 NBL Canada Finals.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate on whether we can have reason <b>to</b> do what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> do. I take as my starting point two papers recently published in Philosophical Studies, by Bart Streumer and Ulrike Heuer, which defend the two dominant opposing positions on this issue. Briefly, whereas Streumer argues that we cannot have reason <b>to</b> do what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> do, Heuer argues {{that we can have}} reason <b>to</b> do what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> do when <b>we</b> can get closer to success but cannot have reason to try <b>to</b> do what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> do when <b>we</b> cannot get closer to success. In this paper, I reject both positions as they are presented, on the grounds that neither can accommodate an important category of reasons, which are the reasons to realise and to try to realise dimensions of value that lie at the boundary of what is realisable, specifically, genuinely valuable ideals. I defend a third view that we can have reason to do and to try <b>to</b> do what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> do even when we cannot, in Heuer's sense, get closer to success. Moreover, I argue that we can have reason to realise and to try to realise genuinely valuable ideals for their own sake and not simply for the sake of achieving mundane, realisable ends...|$|R

2500|$|By February 1942 Japanese {{forces had}} gained footholds in territories {{adjoining}} northern Australia {{which made it}} seem probable that the advance southwards would continue, culminating in the invasion of Australia. This threat of invasion in 1942 is summarised in a statement made by Prime Minister Curtin in 1944, {{in which he said}} now that Singapore was lost and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> concentrate a superior fleet, the strength of our defences was inadequate to defend Australia ... against an enemy with command of the sea and air.

2500|$|The rebel defeat {{has been}} {{attributed}} by {{one side to}} a misjudgement of Déby's strength, which brought to an attack with too few troops and heavy weapons, and by the other side due to divisions among the rebel commanders. While stating that the troops were well coordinated during the battle, some of the participants mentioned the three-headed leadership {{as one of the}} reasons for the defeat. The rivality among the groups had surfaced easily during the groups, as recognized by Nouri: [...] "In Ndjamena we wanted to send out a radio message, but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> agree on which leader was going to read it out", adding that [...] "after the fall of the regime our objectives are different." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{offensive}} {{was undertaken}} {{in the hope of}} triggering a general uprising, but urban Vietnamese did not respond as the Việt Cộng anticipated. About 75,000 communist soldiers were killed or wounded, according to Trần Văn Trà, commander of the [...] "B-2" [...] district, which consisted of southern South Vietnam. [...] "We did not base ourselves on scientific calculation or a careful weighing of all factors, but...on an illusion based on our subjective desires", Trà concluded. Earle G. Wheeler, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated that Tet resulted in 40,000 communist dead (compared to about 10,600 U.S. and South Vietnamese dead). [...] "It is a major irony of the Vietnam War that our propaganda transformed this debacle into a brilliant victory. The truth was that Tet cost us half our forces. Our losses were so immense that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> replace them with new recruits", said PRG Justice Minister Trương Như Tảng. Tet had a profound psychological impact because South Vietnamese cities were otherwise safe areas during the war. U.S. President Lyndon Johnson and Westmoreland argued that panicky news coverage gave the public the unfair perception that America had been defeated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Vergne was happy with his maiden victory, saying it felt [...] "extremely satisfying" [...] as he endured a difficult season and it would improve his team's confidence in the future, [...] "There were mistakes as a team but nevertheless, to get second places, double podiums and then a win today is an amazing feeling." [...] He stated the win would put Techeetah's personnel in a positive state of mind {{and that they would}} return for the following the season as a stronger force in the series. Rosenqvist revealed that Bird was his main rival over the race weekend and that his focus was to secure third place in the Drivers' Championship. Nevertheless, he was delighted to finish in the top three driver's standings in his maiden Formula E season, [...] "I think it speaks volumes about the kind of effort we have made as a team. Big, warm thanks to Mahindra Racing for putting their trust in me and for giving me the tools to achieve this.” Third-place finisher López spoke of his pleasure finishing in the position following his first race retirement, [...] "I could tell straightaway what a difference the team had made to the car since my last race and it was frustrating our qualifying group meant <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> show this. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the race and of course the whole season, as well as working with the DS Virgin Racing team.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Unable to come {{to terms}} with the Rangers, Shanahan sat out the first half of the 2008–09 season. Then, on January 10, 2009, it was {{announced}} that Shanahan agreed to join the New Jersey Devils for his second stint with the team. Four days later, on January 14, the terms of the contract were finalized and Shanahan signed a one-year, $800,000 prorated contract. The time between Shanahan's departure from and return to the Devils was 17 years, 294 days, the longest gap in tenure with one team in NHL history. Playing in his first game back with the Devils since 1990–91, he scored the first goal of the game against the Nashville Predators on a 5-on-3 power play by toe dragging the puck around the opposition player and then shooting it on the pad side on January 19 in a 3–1 win. On August 5, 2009, Shanahan agreed to a one-year deal with the Devils returning for a 22nd season, to play during the 2009–10 season. This would have been Shanahan's sixth season as a Devil. However, on October 1, 2009, the Devils and Shanahan parted ways, with Shanahan saying, [...] "When I signed this past summer, Lou Lamoriello, Jacques Lemaire and I agreed that if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> find a suitable fit in which I would be able to compete and contribute at the level I expect from myself, then I would simply step aside." [...] Shanahan had played just four pre-season games of the 2009–10 season. He scored the Devils' last pre-season goal that year, on one of his last NHL shifts.|$|E

2500|$|The Spanish {{forces and}} their allies {{advanced}} into the city. Despite inflicting heavy casualties, the Aztecs could not halt the Spanish advance. While the fighting in the city raged, the Aztecs cut out and ate the hearts of 70 Spanish prisoners-of-war at the altar to Huitzilopochtli. By August, many of the native inhabitants had fled Tlatelolco. Cortés sent emissaries {{to negotiate with the}} Tlatelolcas to join his side, but the Tlatelolcas remained loyal to the Aztecs. Throughout the siege, the Tlaxcalans waged a merciless campaign against the Aztecs who had long oppressed them as for hundreds of years the Tlaxcalans had been forced to hand over an annual quota of young men and women to be sacrificed and eaten at the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan, and now the Tlaxcalans saw their chance for revenge. The American historian Charles Robinson wrote: [...] "Centuries of hate and the basic viciousness of Mesoamerican warfare combined in violence that appalled Cortés himself". In letter to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, [...] Cortés wrote: [...] "We had more trouble in preventing our allies from killing with such cruelty than we had in fighting the enemy. For no race, however savage, has ever practiced such fierce and unnatural cruelty as the natives of these parts. Our allies also took many spoils that day, which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> prevent, as they numbered more than 150,000 and we Spaniards only some nine hundred. Neither our precautions nor our warnings could stop their looting, though we did all we could...I had posted Spaniards in every street, so that when the people began to come out [...] they might prevent our allies from killing those wretched people, whose numbers was uncountable. I also told the captains of our allies that on no account should any of those people be slain; but there were so many that we could not prevent more than fifteen thousand being killed and sacrificed [...] that day".|$|E
