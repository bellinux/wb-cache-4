5|$|After the 1922 elections, Cotillo {{became the}} {{chairman}} of the influential State Senate Judiciary Committee, a sign of his rising authority. The post helped him to get ready for a next step. In 1924, he was the first Italian-born to become Justice of the New York Supreme Court, First District, where he <b>would</b> <b>he</b> remain until his death. He was elected with the endorsement of the Tammany Hall political machine, many social welfare organizations and organized labor, the Citizen's Union and several bar organizations.|$|E

She shuddered with nervous {{apprehension}} and desire as she went through the church-door. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> be there, surely <b>he</b> <b>would</b> see how beautiful her dress was, surely <b>he</b> <b>would</b> see how she had made herself beautiful for him. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> understand, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to see how she was made for him, the first, how she was, for him, the highest.

5|$|At a September 10, 2008, press conference, Paul {{announced}} his general support of four third-party candidates: Cynthia McKinney (Green Party); Bob Barr (Libertarian Party); Chuck Baldwin (Constitution Party); and Ralph Nader (independent). He said {{that each of}} them had pledged to adhere to a policy of balancing budgets, bringing the troops home, defending privacy and personal liberties, and investigating the Federal Reserve. Paul also said that under no circumstances <b>would</b> <b>he</b> be endorsing {{either of the two}} main parties' candidates (McCain– Republican Party, or Obama– Democratic Party) because there were no real differences between them, and because neither of them, if elected, would seek to make the fundamental changes in governance that were necessary. He urged instead that, rather than contribute to the “charade” that the two-party election system had become, the voters support the third-party candidates as a protest vote, to force change in the election process. Later that same day, Paul gave a televised interview with Nader saying much the same again.|$|E
5|$|Elvis Presley as Vince Everett, a {{prisoner}} who, after being released, becomes a star for his singing talent. Producer Pandro S. Berman's wife {{convinced him to}} make a film with Presley starring in the leading role. Berman contacted Presley's manager, Colonel Thomas Parker, and asked if he could send Presley or Parker the script to read it. Parker was uninterested and denied the request. Berman asked Parker under which conditions <b>would</b> <b>he</b> take the project, to which Parker replied that he was only interested in the music score of the movie and owning the rights for record sales and publishing royalties. Presley's payment was settled at 250,000 and 50% of the royalties from the distribution of the movie.|$|E
5|$|When {{he assumed}} his Senate seat in 1855, Crittenden was sixty-nine years old, the eldest {{member of that}} body. The Whig Party had {{practically}} dissolved by this time, and he joined many of his fellow Kentuckians in associating with the Know Nothing Party. Although he {{did not agree with}} all of the party's principles, he would not associate with the Democrats, the party he had spent much of his career denouncing, nor <b>would</b> <b>he</b> associate with the new Republican Party because of their stance against slavery. Despite his misgivings about some of the party platform, he campaigned on behalf of Millard Fillmore, the party's candidate in the 1856 presidential election.|$|E

25|$|Gris {{claimed to}} {{manipulate}} flat abstract planar surfaces first, {{and only in}} subsequent stages of his painting process <b>would</b> <b>he</b> 'qualify' them so that the subject-matter became readable.

Gris referred to this technique as 'synthetic', in contradistinction from the process of 'analysis' intrinsic to his earlier works.|$|E

25|$|Gilruth {{refused to}} address the crowd other than making a {{statement}} that he was answerable to the Minister and would not and did not recognise the citizens of Darwin as having any authority over him. The crowd outside became tense and impatient. The crowd demanded that Gilruth appear before them to vindicate himself. Surprisingly, Gilruth complied but he was defiant, inviting the crowd to gaze upon him and stating if recalled by the Minister he would leave, but under no other circumstances <b>would</b> <b>he</b> leave his post.|$|E
25|$|Thus Gregory VII, as a {{politician}} wanting to achieve some result, was driven in practice to adopt a different standpoint. He acknowledged {{the existence of the}} state as a dispensation of Providence, described the coexistence of church and state as a divine ordinance, and emphasized the necessity of union between the sacerdotium and the imperium. But at no period <b>would</b> <b>he</b> have dreamed of putting the two powers on an equal footing; the superiority of church to state was to him a fact which admitted of no discussion and which he had never doubted.|$|E

60|$|The {{rest of the}} day Dickory {{spent with}} Mr. Mander and his wife, who were {{intelligent}} and pleasant people. They talked of their travels, their misfortunes and their blessings, and Dickory yearned to pour out his soul to them, but he could not do so. His woes did not belong to himself alone; they were not for the ears of strangers. He made up his mind what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do. Until the morrow <b>he</b> <b>would</b> stay as a visitor with these most hospitable people, then <b>he</b> <b>would</b> ask for work. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> collect firewood, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> hunt, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> fish, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do anything. And here <b>he</b> <b>would</b> support himself until there came some merchant ship bound southward which would carry him away. If the Mander family were anyway embarrassed or annoyed by his presence here, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> make a camp at a little distance and live there by himself.

25|$|Amery {{differed}} from Churchill in hoping throughout the 1930s to foster {{an alliance with}} fascist Italy to counter the rising strength of Nazi Germany. A united front of Britain, France, and Italy <b>would,</b> <b>he</b> felt, have prevented a German occupation of Austria, especially with Czechoslovakia's support. He thus was for appeasing Italy by tacitly conceding its claims to Ethiopia. A start {{was made in the}} so-called Stresa Front of 1935, but he felt that Britain's decision to impose economic sanctions on Italy, for invading Ethiopia in 1936, drove Italy into the arms of Germany.|$|E

If he was voted out, {{there would be a}} new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats—along with dissenting Republicans—would vote in Dick Gephardt as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly, as {{the only member of the}} leadership who had been appointed to his position—by Gingrich—instead of elected.|$|E

Nehru, however, demanded that the jailed political leader, Sheikh Abdullah, be released from prison and involved in the state government. Only then <b>would</b> <b>he</b> allow the state to accede. The Maharaja released Sheikh Abdullah on 29 September. Before any further reforms were implemented, the Pakistani tribal invasion brought the matters to a head.|$|E

If he had killed her, he asked, why <b>would</b> <b>he</b> have cooperated with the police investigation as much as he had, to the point of allowing officers to search his home without obtaining a search warrant?

25|$|According to Baker, {{the plea}} deal could allow Wilson to be {{eligible}} for First Offender Treatment, which would mean that he would not have a criminal record nor <b>would</b> <b>he</b> be subject to registering on the sex offender registry once his sentence had been completed. It could also result in Wilson receiving a reduced sentence, possibly leading to his release based upon time already served. Wilson's lawyer, B.J.

25|$|Knuckles' early adventures {{typically}} involved protecting Angel Island or {{the various}} Echidna groups-only rarely <b>would</b> <b>he</b> join the Freedom Fighters against threats like Dr. Robotnik. However, Robotnik's encroachments on {{different areas of}} the planet-including Angel Island itself-eventually persuaded Knuckles to relocate to the surface to join the battle against the evil doctor and other threats. One of his enemies-a villainous Echidna named Dr. Finitevus-later made Knuckles into a new Enerjak after revealing that Robotnik had driven the Echidna race to the brink of extinction. Knuckles would become wracked with guilt over his actions, especially since the remnants of the Dark Legion chose to ally themselves with Dr. Robotnik.|$|E
