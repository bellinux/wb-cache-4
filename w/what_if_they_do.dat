40|$|Abstract. Service {{providers}} {{argue that}} if net neutrality is not enforced, they will have sufficient incentives to build special high-quality channels that will take the Internet {{to the next level}} of its evolution. But <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> get their wish, net neutrality is consigned to the dustbin, and they do build their new services, but nobody uses them? If the networks that are built {{are the ones that are}} publicly discussed, that is a likely prospect. What service providers publicly promise to do, if they are given complete control of their networks, is to build special facilities for streaming movies. But there are two fatal defects to that promise. One is that movies are unlikely to offer all that much revenue. The other is that delivering movies in real-time streaming mode is the wrong solution, expensive and unnecessary. If service providers are to derive significant revenues and profits by exploiting freedom from net neutrality limitations, they will need to engage in much more intrusive control of traffic than just provision of special channels for streaming movies. ...|$|E

40|$|Why not the {{standard}} 1 model? In {{the standard}} model risk aversion coincides with the aversion to substituting consumption over time. However, from an a priori perspective, attitude with respect to risk and attitude {{with respect to a}} displacement of consumption over time are distinct features of preferences. <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not happen to coincide? • Characterizing risk aversion in a multi-commodity world: In a multi-commodity world standard risk aversion depends on the commodity under observation. This fact seems legitimate when interpreting risk aversion as a form of taste (or ‘taste curvature’) parameter. However, reconsider the semantic interpretation of ‘risk aversion ’ (before you started studying economics [...] .). Shouldn’t there be a characterization of whether somebody likes risk or dislikes risk that is independent of the commodity? • Do you want to see what the general model that is additive on certain consumption paths and satisfies von Neumann & Morgenstern’s (1944) axioms really looks like? • Have you been to the seminar talk? Do you want to understand it? (; Lecture 1 introduces a simple two period ‘certain × uncertain ’ model. It is the simplest model that allows to introduce the concept of intertemporal risk aversion and to discuss most of the above issues. First, we revisit the von Neumann & Morgenstern (1944) setting from a slightly different perspective. Then, we introduce time and develop a representation that satisfies additive separability on certain consumption paths and time consistency. To simplify the model, we also assume stationarity and a zero rate of pure time preference. Some of the assumptions in this toy model are non-axiomatic {{in the sense that they}} assume functional forms rather than directly characterize preferences. 1 I refer to {{the standard model}} as the intertemporally additive expected utlility model, i. e. a model with an evaluation function of the form Ep t u(xt,t) ...|$|E

40|$|Roughly {{half the}} adults in the world, about 2. 5 billion people, have no bank account nor even access to a ―semi-formal ‖ {{financial}} service like microcredit (1). But <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did?</b> Muhammad Yunus, the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner and founder of Bangladesh’s Grameen Bank, argues that this lack of financial access means that the poor, especially poor women, can’t obtain the tiny loans (known as microcredit) {{that they need to}} build their businesses and get on a path out of poverty (2). The idea has taken hold: in 2009 Grameen Bank served 8 million customers (the average loan balance was just $ 127). (3) World-wide, microcredit advocates claim over 190 million customers (4). But proof of concept is not proof of impact, and the surprisingly weak results from recent impact studies suggest we need to rethink microcredit. In the June 10, 2011 issue of Science, Karlan and Zinman report on a randomized evaluation of microcredit in the Philippines (5). The study joins a handful of other recent studies that convincingly address the concern that success stories may overstate impact because of selection bias (6, 7, 8). The studies carefully account for the fact that borrowers may be atypical members of their communities. Borrowers may be more entrepreneurial, for example, or better connected to markets, or more focused by nature. Th...|$|R

One argument used by these anti-renters is, for instance, that the patroons, in their leases, reserved the mill-seats. Now, <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did?</b> Some one must own the mill-seats; and why not the Patroon as well as another? To give the argument any weight, not as law, not as morals, but as mere expediency, it must be shown that the patroons would not let these mill-seats at as low rents as any one else; and my opinion is that they would let them at rents of not half the amount that would be asked, were they the property of so many individuals, scattered {{up and down the}} country. But, admitting that so large an estate of this particular sort has some inconveniences in that particular spot, can there be two opinions among men of integrity about the mode of getting rid of it? Everything has its price, and, in a business sense, everything is entitled to its price. No people acknowledge this more than the Americans, or practise on it so extensively. Let the Rensselaers be tempted by such offers as will induce them to sell, but do not let them be invaded by that most infernal of all acts of oppression, special legislation, in order to bully or frighten them from the enjoyment of what is rightfully their own. If the State think such a description of property injurious in its heart, let the State imitate England in her conduct towards the slave-holders--buy them out; not tax them out, and wrong them out, and annoy them out.

Anxiety is formulated using probabilistic models that describe how people interact with devices in combinations.

40|$|Plato is {{commonly}} considered a metaphysical dualist conceiving {{of a world}} of Forms separate {{from the world of}} particulars in which we live. This paper explores the motivation for postulating that second world as opposed to making do with the one we have. The main objective is to demonstrate that and how everything, Forms and all, can instead fit into the same world. The approach is exploratory, as there can be no proof in the standard sense. The debate between explaining Plato’s ontology with a single world and requiring a two-world model {{to make sense of the}} same thing is typically about scouring the Platonic corpus for evidence and turning to Aristotle for help where we need it. The aim here is to dig deeper than what either of them, or anyone else, has said or implied about the number or worlds, searching instead for any insight that might be gained from the way Forms are supposed to exist versus what we ourselves might understand by existence. Although the paper is, at its most basic level, about the existence of the Forms, the intention is not to prove that they exist, nor to evaluate the proofs and objections already on record, but to consider how they might exist and <b>what</b> follows <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> Dialogue toward consensus on why we think the Forms exist, and why we think <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not, could perhaps provide a smoother “second sailing” in waters where we have been unable to agree whether <b>they</b> <b>do</b> and where <b>they</b> would <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did...</b>|$|R
