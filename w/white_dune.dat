40|$|The {{management}} experiences {{presented here}} have been realised since 1994 owing to the ‘Conseil Général’ of the North district on the upper beaches of the Flemish dunes owned by the ‘Conservatoire du Littoral’ situated on the Bray-Dunes and Zuydcoote municipalities (France). This experience aims at {{the restoration of the}} habitats on the sea frontline of the border dune. The matter is the space that starts from the annual halo-nitrophilic strip on the upper beach, goes on with the embryo dune and finishes with the quick <b>white</b> <b>dune</b> dominated by the European beachgrass (marram). The requirements of beach cleanness, especially regarding seaside tourism, have led to the destruction of these patrimonial important habitats by the regular and complete mechanical raking of the strand. The first step consisted in limiting this mechanical raking to the rights of sea-side resorts. At the same time, the upper strip of the beach along dunes is managed softly by a selective manual picking up of the biggest trashes. This change of cleaning process rapidly produced the emergence of noticeable habitats that didn’t exist before. It concerns water marks mingled with sand and embryonic dunes with sand couch grass. To a reduced extent, these methods of management lead to a reinforcement of the <b>white</b> <b>dune</b> with marram and sand ryegrass and the <b>white</b> <b>dune</b> which is warmer with marram and sea spurge. Some of these habitats are listed as part of the Guideline ‘Habitat’ and are listed as vulnerable or endangered after the red book of the littoral terrestrial phytocoenoses according to the definitions proposed by the International Union for Nature Preservation. Moreover, the obstacles kept on the upper strip of the beach afford the start of a process of sand accumulation and build the embryonic dune. According to the sedimentary context, this type of operation assists the fertilisation of the upper beach and reduces the retreat phenomenon of the coastline. The cost of operations is much reduced, money is even saved with the reduction of the number of interventions. It was only difficult to convince our partners about modifying their cleaning habits. This successful experience over a 1. 5 km distance of beach, facing preserved dune massifs, shows the large potentialities of spontaneous restoration of these natural environments. The extreme simplicity of this method and its very small cost, except employment, allow us to envisage and adapt it all along the European coastline...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} importance of seed, habitat and microhabitat limitation has rarely been investigated for invasive non-native species, although this is critical for their effective management and for predicting future range expansion. Rosa rugosa is an abundant non-native shrub in coastal habitats of NW Europe; it is common along the Baltic coast but more scarce in exposed dunes of the North Sea. To investigate whether invasion of exposed dunes is limited by seed, habitat and microhabitat limitation, seedling emergence and establishment were examined in a factorial sowing, transplant and disturbance experiment. Twenty plots were randomly placed in each of five dune habitats (<b>white</b> <b>dune,</b> Empetrum dune, grey dune, outer dune heath, inner dune heath), and studied over 2 years. Seedling emergence in control subplots was zero in all habitats, whereas 96 % and 98 % of the undisturbed and disturbed seeded subplots produced seedlings. Disturbance had {{a positive effect on}} emergence and subsequent survival in <b>white</b> <b>dune,</b> outer and inner dune heath. Seedling survival and growth, and growth of transplanted seedlings, were markedly lower in grey dune. These findings indicate that establishment of R. rugosa is seed-limited in coastal dune habitats, and that the species is able to establish in both active and fixed dunes once seeds have arrived. Although differential seedling emergence and growth indicate that habitats differ in their degree of invasion susceptibility by R. rugosa, the positive influence of small-scale disturbance suggests microhabitat limitation in some dune habitats as well. Dune management should aim to reduce seed production and dispersal of R. rugosa in near-natural sites, and anthropogenic changes of habitat dynamics should be prevented...|$|E

A total of 267 plots was investigated and presence of mosses and rooted vascular plants recorded.

40|$|Measurements {{were carried}} out {{on the island of}} Ameland (The Netherlands) to {{determine}} whether notches cut into foredunes stimulated the supply of fresh calcareous beach and dune sand into the white and grey dune habitats behind the dunes, increasing these habitats' biological quality. Sediment characteristics and dynamics (deposition flux and grain size properties) as well as aspects of the vegetation (occurrence, composition and cover density) were studied along six transects, three behind an intact foredune and three behind a foredune with a notch cut into it. Compared to an intact foredune, the notched foredune exhibited higher deposition and accumulation behind the dune. The extra supply of sand was small, however, and for the notches studied, limited to the zone within approximately 50 – 60 m of the foredune's crest. Farther away from the dune, the effect of the notches became negligible. The presence of a notch did affect the grain size composition of sediment deposited behind the foredune. For intact foredunes, the grain size composition behind the dune was similar to that on the dune itself. When a notch had been cut, the sediment was finer behind the foredune, gradually coarsening away from the dune. Sand spray (deposition of sand eroded from the dune and transported in modified saltation during heavy winds) explains these granulometric results. The effect of the notches on the vegetation in the grey dune habitat behind the foredune was small and, for the notches studied, limited to the first approximately 35 m of the grey dune area, between 30 and 65 m from the foredune's crest. The notches had a greater effect on the <b>white</b> <b>dune</b> habitat but – in the opinion of the authors – this remained disproportionately small relative to the effort required for notch excavation and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Lord Howe Island is {{a remote}} {{subtropical}} {{island in the}} Tasman Sea, situated 700 k m eastnortheast of Sydney. It is composed of Miocene basalt and outcrops of aeolianite, a bioclastic limestone deposited as dune units with subordinate beach, palaeosols and reefal units. This thesis investigates the chronostratigraphy of the aeolianite, identifying a far longer Quaternary record of dune emplacement on the island than {{has been reported in}} previous studies. This study also reveals that the major periods of dune emplacement on the island are linked to glacio-eustatically controlled sea-level highstands. Past studies of the island have concluded that the dunes which comprise the aeolianite formed during periods of low sea level {{around the time of the}} Last Glacial Maximum, when the broad shelf surrounding the island was exposed. The aeolianite comprises two lithostratigraphic formations, the Searles Point Formation the Neds Beach Formation. This classification revises the previous proposed lithostratigraphy of the aeolianite which recognised only a single formation. The diagenetically-mature lower unit, the Searles Point Formation, consists of well-cemented dune units comprising red algal, molluscan, micritic and recrystallised grains with minor proportions of foraminiferal and volcanic grains. Major units within the formation are capped by well-developed, clay-rich palaeosols. The upper formation, the Neds Beach Formation, comprises mostly very pale-brown, lightly- to moderately-cemented dune and beach units which exhibit only minor diagenetic alteration. Most units of this formation exhibit a mix of skeletal grains similar to that observed in the Searles Point Formation. The Neds Beach Formation includes several outcrops of beach deposits that record open coastal environments. The beach units are considerably more extensive than has previously been recognised. This study shows that the major aeolianite ridge on the island is predominantly composed of dune units of the Neds Beach Formation. Both the bedding structures within and the shore-aligned orientation of the ridge suggest much of the deposit was emplaced as a source-bordering transverse dune. The Neds Beach Formation includes two members, the Middle Beach and Cobbys Corner Members. The Middle Beach Member is characterised by <b>white</b> <b>dune</b> units with a major proportion of miliolid foraminiferal grains and rare volcanic grains. This is distinct from the Cobbys Corner Member which comprises dune units with a major proportion of volcanic grains and brown micritic cement. The two members represent distinctly different shoreline environments on the east and west coasts that appear to have existed during the Last Interglacial. Geochronological determinations using the uranium-series (U/Th), radiocarbon (AMS 14 C), thermoluminescence (TL) and amino acid racemisation (AAR, mollusc and 2 ̆ 2 wholerock 2 ̆ 2) techniques provide reliable chronologies for the lithostratigraphic units and help correlate disjunct outcrops. Speleothems from the Searles Point Formation range in age from approximately 3 ̆e 350 ka to 95 ka and dune and palaeosol units range from approximately 274 ka to 201 ka. Speleothems, corals, aeolianite and fossil land snails from the Neds Beach Formation range in age from - 125 ka to 3 ̆e 40 ka. Allostratigraphic mapping of the aeolianite indicates up to nine major phases of dune building in contrast to previous studies which recognised two phases. During each phase the emplacement of dunes was followed by a relatively long period of pedogenesis. These cycles of sedimentation have occurred since the Middle Pleistocene or possibly earlier. The Middle Beach Alloformation outcrops at all the main sites except North Bay and represents the final phase of Pleistocene dune sedimentation on the island, probably occurring at the end of oxygen isotope stage 5. As on the islands of Bermuda and the Bahamas, most dune units on Lord Howe Island appear to have been emplaced during periods of high sea level in the Middle and Late Pleistocene. Dune emplacement occurs predominantly after the sea has flooded the platforms surrounding the islands during interglacials. Thus, carbonate sedimentation is linked to global eustatic changes in sea-level. In contrast to Bermuda and the Bahamas, during the last glacial cycle on Lord H o w e Island, aeolianite appears to have been more a product of sea-level highstands during oxygen isotope substages 5 c and 5 a rather than substage 5 e, when sea level was approximately 20 m below present. During these periods, the island was surrounded by a shallow sea, 10 - 30 m deep, that formed a highly productive Heterozoan subtropical to temperate carbonate province. The stratigraphic and geochronological findings presented in this thesis show Lord Howe Island possesses a long record of Quaternary coastal environments. This mid-ocean record provides important new palaeoenvironmental information for the southwest Pacific...|$|E

40|$|International audienceLes dunes de Merlimont-Berck, d’un seul tenant sur plus 1000 ha, sont l’illustration la plus achevée des dunes « picardes ». La 1 ère partiede l’article décrit leur origine et leur évolution jusqu’à la deuxième guerre mondiale, grâce aux cartes anciennes et aux {{archives}} photographiques. Les dunes externes étaient très mobiles et peu végétalisées et l’avant-dune absente ou discontinue. La 2 e partie de l’articlereconstitue la mobilité du trait de côte et la naissance et l’évolution de l’avant-dune après la 2 e guerre mondiale, à partir de la « bunker-archéologie» des ouvrages du Mur de l’Atlantique et de l’analyse des photos aériennes de l’IGN. En 1947, les dunes externes avaient peuchangé depuis 1935 : grandes dunes mouvantes s’allongeant vers l’ENE et directement alimentées depuis la plage. L’avant-dune n’estnette qu’à partir des années 1960. Les photos aériennes soulignent l’ampleur des interventions humaines sur tout le domaine dunaire au sudde Merlimont (quadrillage de brise-vent et plantation d’oyat). Le trait de côte a reculé assez nettement à partir des années 1970 jusqu’auxannées 1990 avant de ré-avancer. La morphologie des dunes externes (avant-dune bien formée et système couloirs/ pourrières), si caractéristiquedu paysage actuel, ne date que du début des années 1980. Le suivi topographique complété par celui des bunkers allemandsde 1993 à nos jours montre la mobilité extrême du trait de côte sur le court terme. L’alternance de recul et d’avancée fait apparaître uneremarquable résilience de ce système côtier macrotidal, grâce au rôle de stockage de l’avant-dune, à une dynamique éolienne très activeet à l’abondance de sable dans les petits-fonds. A contrario, toute absence ou destruction de l’avant-dune est une menace pour lebudget sédimentaire de la plage, comme c’est le cas le long de la digue de Merlimont. The Merlimont-Berck dune-field {{which extends}} {{over more than}} 1000 ha is {{the best example of}} "Picardy dunes". Seven main units areobserved from the sea eastwards: the intertidal zone, the upper beach, an outer dune system, an interdune sandy plain, the inner dunesand a low flat wetland limited eastwards by a marine palaeo-cliff. First the paper analyses the origin and development of the dunes beforethe 2 nd World War thanks to old maps and photos. In the first 30 years of the 20 th century the outer dunes were mainly bare-surfaced andconstantly moving inland. In most places the foredune was absent. In the second part the paper analyses the evolution of the outer dunesafter the second World War. In 1947, just after the war and the mine clearance operations, the outer dunes have not changed significantlyin comparison with 1935. South of Merlimont-Plage, huge bare-surfaced sand tongues stretch northeastwards from the beach and the foreduneis absent except close to Berck. The methods to follow up the changing dune morphology and shoreline use aerial photos (IGN archives),bunker-archeology and field monitoring. A stereoscopic analysis of the photos was often necessary to clearly identify the shoreline,incipient dunes and other dune landforms. Moreover a good geomorphological knowledge of the field is required to interpret accuratelythe photos. The "Bunker archeology" refers to the utilization of the German bunkers and other works of the "Atlantic Wall" to reconstitute theirarchitecture, military purpose and exact original position. It is based on a careful analysis of their remnants in the field, completed by thestudy of military and civil archives. It may give very interesting and precise data on the shoreline change and foredune development since 1944. In this paper a bunker complex located south of Merlimont-Plage, in front of the National Biologic Reserve, has been chosen to showthe great interest of these benchmarks. The results concern two main points: the shoreline change {{and the development of a}} foredune inthe 20 years following the war. The successive IGN aerial photographs allow to follow up the bunker complex in relationship with the changingmorphology. In October 1947, all the bunkers are still in their original position and badly seen on the photo. The access road is partlycovered with sand but still recognizable. The foredune is low and very discontinuous north of the bunkers and completely absent to thesouth. A parabolic dune is forming in the north (on the left side of the photo). There are wide areas of bare sand directly connected with thebeach. The sand deposit was certainly massive since no bomb-holes are seen in this area, which was strongly bombed by the British in 1943 and 1944. In April 1955, the whole outer dune system has been remodeled, more or less flattened and squared off with windbreaks orientedNNW-SSE. Wide areas are bare-surfaced. The bunkers are better seen than in 1947. Two gun tanks lie on the upper beach. The foredune istotally absent. In August 1961, the main casemate has moved down but it is still leaning against the dune slope. A narrow sand bench hasformed in front of the previous shoreline. On the top of the photo (to the south) there is a dense grid of windbreaks associated with marramplanting. Along the beach the foredune is not well formed yet (it is present on the 1963 photo). Inland numerous small sand mounds arebeing colonized by vegetation (marram?). In 1968, the bunkers position has not changed significantly. The bare-surfaced sand bench alongthe upper beach is well developed. An incipient foredune is forming but it is discontinuous with numerous transverse troughs. Inland the effectof human intervention is even more spectacular than in 1961 with wide areas which are equipped with windbreaks and planted withmarram. In May 1974, the coastal strip has changed: the sand bench has disappeared and all the bunkers lies on the beach. This is relatedto several storm events which happened just before. To the north a small incipient foredune has formed in front of a higher dune coveredwith marram. In August 1983, the main casemate lies a few meters in front of the dune. It is noticeable that the bunker position is exactly thesame than today, 30 years later, the sand bench has disappeared in that area (but present further north) where a cliff cuts the dune face. The shoreline has distinctly retreated since 1968. The appearance of the outer dunes has changed also: the <b>white</b> <b>dune</b> has extended andthe grid of marram planting is well seen. A system of SSE-NNW troughs and bare sand tongues ("P" on the photo) has formed. A large blowoutis changing into a parabolic dune ("C" on the photo). Other blowouts have formed inland: the natural wind dynamics is working to createmore natural landforms. But a new bike trail through the dunes proves that the battle for nature conservation is not completely won. In 2000,the situation has just slightly changed. The system of troughs/sand tongues is very well developed. The foredune has been cut into a sandycliff. Once again this erosion feature must be connected with successive storms in the 1990 ’s. The present shoreline (in 2014) has advancedsince 2000. Finally the shoreline retreat between 1944 and 2014 is about 35 to 40 m, i. e. 0. 50 to 0. 57 m per year on average. But this rate doesnot reflect the long term evolution: the retreat took place mainly between 1974 and 2000, then the shoreline has advanced, so that thepresent situation is the same than in 1983. So it would be incorrect to use an average rate measured in a short period to anticipate the futurelong term evolution. Especially in a macrotidal environnement the effects of storms depend not only of their occurrence frequency but alsoof their simultaneity with spring tide. The analysis of aerial photos clearly shows that the origin of the foredune south of Merlimont has bee...|$|E
