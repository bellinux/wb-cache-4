This style was very slow, As Deere realized that this {{was not going to be}} a viable business model, he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale; this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand, but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away.

In her Preface to Frank-Jürgen Richter and Pamela Mar's book Asia's New Crisis, she decries that the unique Asian <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>business</b> has given rise to much crony capitalism and opacity in Asia, including the Philippines. In January 2001, during the EDSA Revolution of 2001 which ousted Estrada, Aquino enthusiastically supported the ascendancy of another woman, then Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, to power.|$|E

25|$|As {{production}} {{became more}} specialized, trade guilds were divided and subdivided, eliciting the squabbles over jurisdiction {{that produced the}} paperwork by which economic historians trace their development: The metalworking guilds of Nuremberg were divided among dozens of independent trades in the boom economy of the 13th century, and there were 101 trades in Paris by 1260. In Ghent, as in Florence, the woolen textile industry developed as a congeries of specialized guilds.

25|$|The {{early history}} of the LMS was {{dominated}} by infighting between its two largest constituents and previously rivals, the Midland and the North Western, each of which believed their company's way was the right – and only – <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>business.</b> This rivalry was so severe, that stories of connecting trains at Birmingham New Street from the previous LNWR and MR parts of the system, being deliberately made to miss each other persisted even {{as late as the}} early 1950s, long after their demise. Generally, the Midland prevailed, with the adoption of many Midland practices such as the livery of Crimson Lake for passenger locomotives and rolling stock. Notable was the continuation of the Midland Railway's small-engine policy (see Locomotives of the Midland Railway).|$|E
25|$|He alternated {{between the}} Liberal (PNL) and Conservative (PC) parties in a vain {{search for the}} right {{conditions}} within which to achieve his democratic ideals. Along with other radicals of the period, his alternation was not due primarily to opportunism, but because the king recognized only the two main parties as legitimately able to form a government, and smaller parties were denied an effective role in public life. Although he frequently clashed with their leadership and despised their <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>business,</b> he hoped that by working from within, {{he would be able}} to secure at least some of his objectives. It is in this context that the militant of the 1880s moved to the Conservatives in the 1890s while preserving his core convictions. Additionally, he was unable to join the Liberals at that point because he believed they were too compromised by their long years in power, and had himself helped to overthrow them.|$|E
