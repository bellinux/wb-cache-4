5|$|The philosopher Peter Singer {{considers}} that usually when we describe an action as conscientious {{in the critical}} sense <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in order to deny either that the relevant agent was motivated by selfish desires, like greed or ambition, or that he acted on whim or impulse.|$|E
25|$|The {{quantization}} of {{the volume}} proceeds {{the same way as}} with the area. As we take the derivative, and each time <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> we bring down the tangent vector , when the volume operator acts on non-intersecting Wilson loops the result vanishes. Quantum states with non-zero volume must therefore involve intersections. Given that the anti-symmetric summation is taken over in the formula for the volume we would need at least intersections with three non-coplanar lines. Actually it turns out that one needs at least four-valent vertices for the volume operator to be non-vanishing.|$|E
500|$|Mackintosh had two daughters, {{the second}} born {{while he was}} in Australia {{awaiting}} the Aurora's departure. On the return Barrier journey in February 1916, expecting to die, he wrote a [...] farewell message, with echoes of Captain Scott. The message concludes: [...] "If it is God's will that we should have given up our lives then <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in the British manner as our tradition holds us in honour bound to do. Goodbye, friends. I feel sure that my dear wife and children will not be neglected." [...] In 1923, Gladys Mackintosh married Joseph Stenhouse, Auroras first officer and later captain.|$|E

500|$|While Ozzy Osbourne {{was working}} on new solo album {{material}} in 2006, Rhino Records released , a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. The Dio Years was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the Billboard 200, while the single [...] "The Devil Cried" [...] reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the Mob Rules era line-up for a world tour. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. When asked about {{the name of the}} group, Iommi stated [...] "it really is Black Sabbath, whatever <b>we</b> <b>do...</b> <b>so</b> everyone knows what they're getting [...] so people won't expect to hear 'Iron Man' and all those songs. We've done them for so many years, it's nice to do just all the stuff we did with Ronnie again." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 3 October 2014, Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the Australian Cabinet {{approved}} for RAAF Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter bombers to begin airstrikes against Islamic State militants. Abbott said [...] "It {{is in our}} national interest that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> {{it is in the}} interests of civilisation that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> It is in everyone's best interests that the murderous rage of the ISIL death cult be checked and rolled back and that's what we're determined to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....When we {{call upon}} the workers to support the Communist Party ticket in the {{elections}} we do not do so {{on the basis of}} agreement with the Party tactics or the Party's present election platform; <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> because of our agreement with the fundamentals and aims of the Communist Party and the Communist International. We {{call upon the}} workers to support the Communist Party ticket as an expression of their agreement with the fundamental aims of Communism but to remember that the dangerous tactics of the official leaders of the Communist Party, which are doing such harm to the cause of Communism, are not the traditional tactics of the world Communist movement." ...|$|E

2500|$|Just as the First World War {{dramatically}} {{changed the}} work {{of many of the}} poets who saw service in the trenches, Lawrence's own work saw a dramatic change, during his years in Cornwall. During this time, he wrote free verse influenced by Walt Whitman. He set forth his manifesto for much of his later verse in the introduction to New Poems. [...] "We can get rid of the stereotyped movements and the old hackneyed associations of sound or sense. We can break down those artificial conduits and canals through which <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> love to force our utterance. We can break the stiff neck of habit [...] But we cannot positively prescribe any motion, any rhythm." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 11 December 2012, HSBC {{agreed to}} pay a record $1.92 billion fine in this money {{laundering}} case. [...] "Bank officials repeatedly ignored internal warnings that HSBC's monitoring systems were inadequate, the Justice Department said. In 2008, for example, the CEO of HSBC Mexico was told that Mexican law enforcement had a recording of a Mexican drug lord saying that HSBC Mexico {{was the place to}} launder money." [...] The DOJ, however, decided not to pursue criminal penalties, a decision which the New York Times labelled a [...] "dark day for the rule of law." [...] HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver said: [...] "We accept responsibility for our past mistakes. We have said we are profoundly sorry for them, and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> again." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Sun {{described}} the album as [...] "a mixture of ballads and the relentlessly upbeat, catchy hits {{we have come}} to expect." [...] Kimberley Walsh has said that the album is [...] "a lot older sounding, which wasn't intentional, it was just kind of how it went." [...] The girl group were very involved in the album's direction. [...] "The '60s thing is quite prominent," [...] Walsh told the BBC. [...] "But it's out of the ordinary. Not really what you'd expect." [...] Nicola Roberts said that the album also features a lot of 1980s-inspired electropop. Sarah Harding said that Girls Aloud [...] "wanted to stay upbeat but try something a bit different and advanced. I don't think anything we've ever done has ever sounded the same. But we have that same vibe whatever we do because of our vocals." [...] Nadine Coyle said the [...] "aim from the beginning was to come up with songs that didn't sound like anything else out there." [...] Walsh continued, [...] "We want to impress the fans with what <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>so</b> we've tried to up our game with this album and step outside the comfort zone." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Basis steps {{demonstrate}} that the simplest provable sentences from [...] are also implied by , for any [...] (The proof is simple, since the semantic fact that a set implies any of its members, is also trivial.) The Inductive step will systematically cover all the further sentences that might be provable—by considering each case where we might reach a logical conclusion using an inference rule—and shows that if a new sentence is provable, it is also logically implied. (For example, {{we might have a}} rule telling us that from [...] "" [...] we can derive [...] " [...] or [...] ". In III.a We assume that if [...] is provable it is implied. We also know that if [...] is provable then [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] is provable. We have to show that then [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] too is implied. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> by appeal to the semantic definition and the assumption we just made. [...] is provable from , we assume. So it is also implied by [...] So any semantic valuation making all of [...] true makes [...] true. But any valuation making [...] true makes [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] true, by the defined semantics for [...] "or". So any valuation which makes all of [...] true makes [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] true. So [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] is implied.) Generally, the Inductive step will consist of a lengthy but simple case-by-case analysis of all the rules of inference, showing that each [...] "preserves" [...] semantic implication.|$|E
