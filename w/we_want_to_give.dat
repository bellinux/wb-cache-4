500|$|After this album, {{the group}} planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to {{facilitate}} their solo careers. Beyoncé {{has noted that}} their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyoncé has said that [...] "the group felt it still had something to offer musically" [...] with the album before adding: [...] "We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as {{just the fact that}} three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.". Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> our fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to – not because it's a good business move." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't as bad as they were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew look a little silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: if somebody showed up at your door and said, [...] "Hey, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> you this weapon you used to murder a bunch of guys we knew years ago," [...] wouldn't you be a little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the Stargazer using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E

2500|$|Abkhazia said {{it would}} not take part in the [...] "Geneva Talks on Security and Stability in the Caucacus" [...] in June 2010 because of {{concerns}} over the objectivity of the co-chairmen who were representatives of the UN, the EU, and OSCE. A spokesman said [...] "Our proposals are being ignored, discussions on the non-renewal of war are being procrastinated, instead secondary questions are being discussed. Thereupon we feel the co-chairmen have no real proposals, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them time till September to prepare a document, concerning security, and acceptable for all sides. The Geneva discussions are necessary, and it is normal that each party voices its position, but the mediators must be neutral and non-biased.

2500|$|In November 2009, a {{representative}} of Usher told MTV News that the album will not be released on December 21, 2009 as scheduled: [...] "The release of Usher's next album, Raymond v. Raymond, has been delayed because {{we believe that the}} album is so strong that <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it the opportunity to have the proper setup before coming out". The album's release was pushed back again due to Usher experiencing issues in obtaining management, following him parting ways with his then manager, Jonetta Patton, also his mother, in late November 2009. Patton had severed management ties with Usher due to his relationship with former Def Jam executive Grace Miguel, and she felt [...] "if she didn't end things when she did, it would permanently affect their personal relationship." [...] Raymond v. Raymond was ultimately released on March 30, 2010 in the United States, and released on April 26, 2010 in the United Kingdom.|$|E

2500|$|This did not please Mahathir, who had clashed {{on several}} {{previous}} occasions with the judiciary. In one instance, a government order revoking the work permits of two foreign journalists {{critical of the}} government had been over-ruled by the Supreme Court. Mahathir began making heated attacks on the judiciary, telling Time, [...] "The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we think that your mind is wrong, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> our interpretation.' If we disagree, the Courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' If we [...] go along, {{we are going to}} lose our power of legislation." [...] Mahathir also lashed out at [...] "black sheep ... who want to be ... fiercely independent," [...] accusing them of playing to public opinion. Immediately after this latter statement, the government reassigned several High Court judges to different divisions, including Justice Harun Hashim who was then hearing the UMNO case. However, as the latter case was already in progress, Harun's transfer would not take effect until the case closed.|$|E
2500|$|Mahathir, who {{had never}} been fond of the judiciary, began making heated {{statements}} about it at this time. Mahathir declared, [...] "The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we think that your mind is wrong, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> our interpretation.' If we disagree, the courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' ... We know exactly what we want to do, but once we do it, it is interpreted in a different way." [...] Mahathir also lambasted [...] "black sheep ... who want to be ... fiercely independent" [...] and play to public opinion. Soon after, nine judges sitting on the High Court were reassigned to different divisions; Justice Harun Hashim, who presided over the UMNO case, was transferred from appellate and special powers cases to commercial crimes. However, because the UMNO case was already in progress, his transfer would not take effect until the case closed. Harun later ruled that under the evidence presented, it was clear several UMNO delegates had come from unregistered branches of the party. In line with the law, he declared he was forced to declare UMNO an illegal society, and thereby dismissed the case of the plaintiffs. Mahathir soon formed a new party, UMNO Baru (New UMNO), to replace UMNO. Within a year, the suffix [...] "Baru" [...] was dropped, making it just plain [...] "UMNO".|$|E

60|$|On re-reading my protest, which I {{honestly}} {{think much}} needed, against our heathen idolatry of mere ablution, I {{see that it}} may possibly be misread. I hasten to say that I think washing a {{most important thing to}} be taught both to rich and poor. I do not attack the positive but the relative position of soap. Let it be insisted on even as much as now; but let other things be insisted on much more. I am even ready to admit that cleanliness is next to godliness; but the moderns will not even admit godliness to be next to cleanliness. In their talk about Thomas Becket and such saints and heroes they make soap more important than soul; they reject godliness whenever it is not cleanliness. If we resent this about remote saints and heroes, we should resent it more about the many saints and heroes of the slums, whose unclean hands cleanse the world. Dirt is evil chiefly as evidence of sloth; {{but the fact remains that}} the classes that wash most are those that work least. Concerning these, the practical course is simple; soap should be urged on them and advertised as what it is--a luxury. With regard to the poor also the practical course is not hard to harmonize with our thesis. If <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> poor people soap we must set out deliberately to give them luxuries. If we will not make them rich enough to be clean, then emphatically we must do what we did with the saints. We must reverence them for being dirty.|$|E
