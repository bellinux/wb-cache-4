5|$|Following this, {{the player}} is offered {{a choice of}} eight minigames to test their {{knowledge}} of the words given in the lesson. These minigames are Multiple Choice, Hit-A-Word, Word Find, Flash Cards, Fill in the Blank, Memory, Bridge Builder, and Spelltastic. In Multiple Choice, the player must select the correct French or Spanish translation of an English word from four choices in a limited time frame. Hit-A-Word is a Whac-A-Mole game in which the player must hit the most amount of moles with the correct translation of an English word within the allotted time. Word Find is a word search in which the player must find the French or Spanish translations of a set of English words or phrases. In Flash Cards, the player is given a French or Spanish <b>word</b> <b>and</b> must choose the card with the proper English translation. In Memory, the player must select from a set of face-down cards a French or Spanish <b>word</b> <b>and</b> its English translation. Bridge Builder tests sentence structure; the player has to construct a proper sentence from a set of given words. In Spelltastic, the player listens to a French or Spanish <b>word</b> <b>and</b> spells it using a keyboard within the allotted time. For Fill-in-the-Blank, the player selects the proper conjugation of a French or Spanish verb within a sentence.|$|E

30|$|Considering the {{above-mentioned}} issue, this study {{focuses on the}} temporal behaviors of the Twitter service known as “retweeting,” in which users disseminate information by resending a previous tweet, and develops a method for extracting feature <b>words</b> <b>and</b> phrases that can predict retweeting behavior using {{the content of the}} users’ tweeting history. To tackle the problem of absence of the words in a prepared dictionary, we use the values of pattern evaluation indices that assume <b>words</b> <b>and</b> phrases as patterns. The use of values of the pattern evaluation indices separates the surface form of the <b>words</b> <b>and</b> phrases from their statistical nature. In addition, we should also solve the problem of preparing the categories of the <b>words</b> <b>and</b> phrases for characterizing users’ tweeting behaviors. As for grouping <b>words</b> <b>and</b> phrases, we can use the temporal values of the pattern evaluation indices. By clustering the temporal values as the temporal patterns, the <b>words</b> <b>and</b> the phrases are categorized based on their statistical nature. On a set of temporal clusters, the centroids of the clusters represent the temporal patterns of anonymized <b>words</b> <b>and</b> phrases that are represented by the averaged temporal values and their ranges on each timestamp of the established pattern evaluation index.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{number of}} {{previous}} studies reported dissociations between the processing of number <b>words</b> <b>and</b> other <b>words</b> <b>and</b> reasoned that there are fundamentally different mental representations and/or processing strategies related to these types of words. Messina et al. reported the performance of Italian aphasic patients with <b>words</b> <b>and</b> number <b>words</b> in different tasks [1]. In line with previous studies, they found that lexical errors formed the dominant error type in number words, whereas phonological errors were the most frequent error type in other words. Messina et al. [1] concluded that speech production processes differ categorically between number <b>words</b> <b>and</b> other <b>words,</b> leading to qualitatively different error patterns in language breakdown. The present study examined error types in number <b>words</b> <b>and</b> other <b>words</b> {{in a sample of}} 15 German patients with aphasia using the same tasks as Messina et al. [1]. Performance in reading <b>and</b> repeating number <b>words</b> <b>and</b> other <b>words</b> was analysed. In general, we replicated the dissociation of error types between number <b>words</b> <b>and</b> other <b>words</b> reported by Messina et al. [1] and others. However, in contrast to previous assumptions this dissociation was not categorical but rather gradual. We suggest that psycholinguistic stimulus properties (such as number of repetitions per morpheme) and type of task influenced error types in a gradual fashion...|$|R
