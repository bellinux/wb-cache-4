5000|$|The outdoor <b>wood</b> <b>boiler</b> is {{a variant}} on the indoor wood, oil or gas boiler. An outdoor <b>wood</b> <b>boiler</b> or outdoor wood stove is a unit about 4-6 {{feet wide and}} around 10 feet long. It {{is made up of}} three main parts, the firebox, which can be either round or square, the water jacket, and the exhaust heat {{reclaiming}} system. The fire box ranges from 2 to 5 feet long and can be as tall as 4 feet. It is fit lengthwise inside the outer shell and is surrounded by the water jacket. The water Jacket is a second shell around the fire box which is filled with water, which is circulated through insulated underground lines to the house, where the heat can be transferred from the water to the existing heating system. After the wood is burned, the smoke is passed through the water jacket to reclaim much of the heat in the exhaust.|$|E

5000|$|Much of Maine Energy Systems {{work to make}} wood pellet heating more {{prevalent}} in the Northeast has been with regulatory agencies. At the time MESys was founded very few regulations existed which directly referred to <b>Wood</b> Pellet <b>boilers</b> in Maine and the surrounding regions. As a result, rules and regulations created to regulate the installation and use of cordwood and coal stoker boilers were frequently applied to pellet boilers. Co-Owner Dr. Harry [...] "Dutch" [...] Dresser Jr. {{has been instrumental in}} helping to achieve parity in heating regulations between wood pellet heating appliances and conventional liquid and gaseous fuel appliances in some jurisdictions. Regulations which directly address wood pellet heat have existed for decades in various countries in Europe; the majority of new construction in Upper Austria is heated with <b>wood</b> pellet <b>boilers.</b> As <b>wood</b> pellet <b>boilers</b> gain use in the United States it is necessary that regulations be devised which directly address appropriate <b>wood</b> pellet <b>boiler</b> use. Currently the lack of wood pellet fuel based appliance regulations requires regulatory agencies to hold <b>wood</b> pellet <b>boilers</b> to standards established for a different solid fuel source, such as cordwood, even though the manually fed operation of a cordwood boiler bears no resemblance to the operation of an automatic <b>wood</b> pellet <b>boiler.</b> Regulatory changes that have been made to directly address <b>wood</b> pellet <b>boilers</b> through Maine Energy Systems involvement include the following: ...|$|R

50|$|Gassifier wood boilers use {{secondary}} combustion air to burn additional wood gases. The most sophisticated systems use computer controls to direct air {{at different stages}} of the burn process at variable volume. Outdoor wood boilers are a topic of environmental controversy. An improperly used or built outdoor <b>wood</b> <b>boiler</b> can produce wood smoke with excessive unburned particulate matter, but when properly burned, studies show that burning wood {{is still one of the}} most environmentally friendly heating options. In 2007, EPA began a voluntary program to encourage manufacturers to reduce particulate levels. In 2015, the U.S. EPA updated its clean air standards for residential wood heaters, this is a mandatory standard for sales in the United States. The revised regulations apply only to new products and will not affect existing wood heaters. At this point, the only boilers that pass these emission controls are gasification models.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to perform a techno-economic analysis on a typical wood pellet and <b>wood</b> residue <b>boiler</b> for generation of heat to an average-sized greenhouse in British Columbia. The variables analyzed included greenhouse size and structure, boiler efficiency, fuel types, and source of carbon dioxide (CO 2) for crop fertilization. The net present value (NPV) show that installing a wood pellet or a <b>wood</b> residue <b>boiler</b> to provide 40 % of the annual heat demand is more economical than using a natural gas boiler to provide all the heat at a discount rate of 10 %. For an assumed lifespan of 25 years, a <b>wood</b> pellet <b>boiler</b> system could generate NPV of C$ 259, 311 without electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and C$ 74, 695 with ESP, respectively. While, installing a <b>wood</b> residue <b>boiler</b> with or without an ESP could provide NPV of C$ 919, 922 or C$ 1, 104, 538, respectively. Using a <b>wood</b> biomass <b>boiler</b> could also eliminate over 3000 Â tonne CO 2 equivalents of greenhouse gases annually. Wood biomass combustion generates more particulate matters than natural gas combustion. However, an advanced emission control system could significantly reduce particulate matters emission from wood biomass combustion which would bring the particulate emission to a relatively similar level as for natural gas.

50|$|Standard outdoor <b>wood</b> <b>boilers</b> {{heat the}} firebox {{and the smoke}} goes out the exhaust straight.

While functional, these models take more work and are far less efficient than some newer more efficient models.|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} machine {{depends on a}} large number of {{variables}} other than straight production output. Different markets require different processing. For example, people who heat with large outside <b>wood</b> <b>boilers</b> prefer large, slow-burning pieces of hardwood, while a good campfire is made of small pieces of fast-burning softwood. Restaurants with wood-fired ovens prefer small pieces as well, but of hardwood or specialty species.|$|R
40|$|This article {{relates the}} results of a {{research}} project aiming at characterising the impact of load variations on <b>wood</b> <b>boiler</b> efficiency and emissions. It is based on a case study consisting in a wood fired district heating system in Geneva canton (Switzerland). The heat is supplied by two <b>wood</b> <b>boiler</b> (2 MW and 0. 65 MW). The boilers efficiency and emissions were measured on the entire load range. The results given by the traditional indirect method (based on Siegert formula) were corroborated by direct measurements of the efficiency. Surprisingly, the efficiency found not to be influenced by the load: a constant value was observed for both boilers over the entire load range, even during the stand-by periods (83 % for the 2 MW boiler, 90 % for the 0. 65 MW boiler). On the other hand, CO emissions are strongly deteriorated at low load because of the necessary increase in the excess air. NOx emissions remained low over the entire load range. The operation of the overall district heating system was also analysed during all year 2011. High distribution losses (> 20 %) due to the low linear density of the district heating system (0. 9 MWh/m/yr) and a high oversizing factor of the <b>wood</b> <b>boiler</b> (> 1. 5) were highlighted...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the impacts of technical and market changes on the economic feasibility of using wood biomass to produce heat for an average-sized greenhouse in British Columbia. A previous techno-economic analysis determined that the installation of a wood pellet or a <b>wood</b> residue <b>boiler</b> to generate 40 % of the greenhouse heat demand is more economical than using a natural gas boiler alone to generate all the heat [1]. As the techno-economic analysis contained forecasted parameters, a thorough sensitivity analysis is needed for sound decision making. This paper extends the previous techno-economic study by assessing the effect of fuel price, wood biomass energy contribution, and greenhouse size changes on the net present value (NPV) when using a wood pellet or <b>wood</b> residue <b>boiler</b> with or without an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). The results indicate that the attractiveness of using wood biomass will increase if the price of fossil fuels increases more than 3 % per year or carbon taxes and regulations are applied. Increasing the biomass energy contribution by 20 % (to provide 60 % of the total heat demand) would still be economical. The installation of a <b>wood</b> pellet <b>boiler</b> or a <b>wood</b> residue <b>boiler</b> is economical for average (7. 5 Â ha) or large (15 Â ha) greenhouses.

2500|$|Wood heat {{continues}} {{to be used in}} areas where firewood is abundant. [...] For serious attempts at heating, rather than mere ambience (open fireplaces), stoves, fireplace inserts, and furnaces are most commonly used today. [...] In rural, forested parts of the U.S., freestanding boilers are increasingly common. [...] They are installed outdoors, some distance from the house, and connected to a heat exchanger in the house using underground piping. [...] The mess of wood, bark, smoke, and ashes is kept outside and the risk of fire is reduced. [...] The boilers are large enough to hold a fire all night, and can burn larger pieces of wood, so that less cutting and splitting is required. [...] There is no need to retrofit a chimney in the house. [...] However, outdoor <b>wood</b> <b>boilers</b> emit more <b>wood</b> smoke and associated pollutants than other wood-burning appliances. [...] This is due to design characteristics such as the water-filled jacket surrounding the firebox, which acts to cool the fire and leads to incomplete combustion. [...] Outdoor <b>wood</b> <b>boilers</b> also typically have short stack heights in comparison to other wood-burning appliances, contributing to ambient levels of particulates at ground level. [...] An alternative that is increasing in popularity are <b>wood</b> gasification <b>boilers,</b> which burn <b>wood</b> at very high efficiencies (85-91%) and can be placed indoors or in an outbuilding.

40|$|Emissions {{of organic}} {{compounds}} from wood burning {{in a modern}} ecolabelled residential boiler (30 kW) were studied. Smoke was collected in the chimney outlet at different times during the burning cycle for subsequent analysis by gas chromatography. The studied ecolabelled <b>wood</b> <b>boiler</b> had high combustion efficiency, and the flaming phase emissions were very low. The greenhouse gas methane (CH 4) was determined in low concentrations of about a few mg m&# 8722; 3 and was the major volatile hydrocarbon emitted. The CH 4 emission factor was calculated to 0. 04 g kg&# 8722; 1 dry fuel. Benzene, in the range 0. 1 - 1 mg m&# 8722; 3, was the predominant aromatic compound emitted. Other major aromatic compounds were methylbenzene, dimethylbenzenes and ethenylbenzene. The concentrations of the studied polycyclic aromatic compounds were generally low, except for naphthalene, which was the third most prominent aromatic compound. However, the total emissions of these health and environmentally hazardous compounds were low. The already low emissions {{of most of the}} organic compounds decreased further {{towards the end of the}} burning cycle, although the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) increased. This indicates that large CO emissions are not necessarily linked to large emissions of organic compounds. Relative to benzene, the concentrations of many of the aromatic compounds studied were higher in the glowing combustion phase, than in the flaming combustion phase. The total environmental and health impact of the studied emissions from the ecolabelled boiler is considered to be low. This <b>wood</b> <b>boiler</b> can be recommended as an environmentally sound residential heating alternative...|$|E

40|$|The {{utilization}} of wood biomass to generate district heat {{and power in}} communities that have access to this energy source is increasing. In this paper the effect of wood fuel properties, combustion condition, and flue gas cleaning system on variation in the amount and formation of particles in the flue gas of typical district heating <b>wood</b> <b>boilers</b> are discussed based on the literature survey. Direct measurements of particulate matter (PM) emissions from <b>wood</b> <b>boilers</b> with district heating applications are reviewed and presented. Finally, recommendations are given regarding the selection of wood fuel, combustion system condition, and flue gas cleaning system in district heating systems {{in order to meet}} stringent air quality standards. It is concluded that {{utilization of}} high quality wood fuel, such as wood pellets produced from natural, uncontaminated stem wood, would generate the least PM emissions compared to other wood fuel types.
