5|$|This Is <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Truth</b> Feels Like is {{the third}} studio album {{recorded}} by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani.

Initially, the album {{was scheduled to be}} released in December 2014 with Stefani working with a handful of high-profile producers, and Benny Blanco serving as executive producer. However, after the underperformance of her 2014 singles and the writer's block Stefani suffered, she did not feel comfortable curating an album and scrapped the whole record in favor of starting again.
