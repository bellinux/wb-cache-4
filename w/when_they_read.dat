5|$|Staffrooms {{are funny}} places, full of articulate, mad people. They have a {{tremendous}} sense of black humour, but there's a layer of dust over them. They are immature because they're in a children's environment all the time. They have a strange perspective; because they spend all day with kids, they are more aware of kids' culture than adults'. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>read</b> about a former pupil who has become head of ICI, they always say, 'But that boy's an idiot. He's crap at geography.' The boy is condemned forever because in the 1960s he didn't know all the capitals of the Third World.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa suggest Homer have a go at voice acting <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>read</b> {{that there}} will be open auditions. Homer auditions to read for Poochie's voice, and gets the part. He and June Bellamy, his fellow voice actor, make several {{publicity}} stops to promote Poochie, where Homer confronts the show's hardcore fans. Homer invites all of his friends and relatives to the screening of the first Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show. However, the cartoon is full of clichés and asinine antics, and by emphasizing Poochie, contains none of the show's trademark violence. Everyone except Homer finds the episode unimpressive. Meyers is forced to admit that Poochie's debut was a dud, and he decides {{to get rid of the}} character. Homer learns that Poochie will be killed off, and resolves to keep Poochie alive. At his next recording session, rather than reading from the script, he implores the audience, through lines that he wrote, to give Poochie a fair chance. The writing team appears moved by Homer's statement. However, on airing, his statement is dubbed over by Myers and Poochie is killed off in a poorly edited fashion. The in-studio audience cheers wildly as Krusty promises that Poochie is gone for good. Homer feels betrayed but attributes the affair to the nature of show business.|$|E

That year the chamber of commerce decided to commemorate the riot, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>read</b> the account and saw photos gathered by Ed Wheeler, host of a radio history program, they refused to publish it. He took it to both major newspapers, which refused to handle it. His article was finally published in Impact Magazine, a new publication aimed at a black audience, but most of white Tulsa never knew about it.|$|E
25|$|Womack and {{her husband}} are best friends with Scott Maslen and his wife Estelle Rubio. They have known each other since they were teenagers. Maslen is godfather to Womack's two {{children}} and she is godmother to Maslen's son, Zak. They often go on holiday together with their children, which Womack revealed during an appearance on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in January 2008. In late 2007 Maslen joined the cast of EastEnders as Jack Branning, who has a relationship with Womack's character, Ronnie. This was something that both Maslen and Womack were initially uncomfortable with <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>read</b> the scripts, with Maslen commenting in various interviews that having to kiss Womack was like having to kiss his sister.|$|E

500|$|According to Aliens casting director, Newt was {{the most}} {{challenging}} role to cast; five hundred schoolchildren auditioned, often smiling <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>read</b> their lines. Carrie Henn was discovered by a casting agent when she was living with her father, who was stationed at RAF Lakenheath near Lakenheath in Suffolk. The agent notified the producers, and Henn was cast after her audition at Pinewood Studios. Although Henn received a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, she did not pursue an acting career and became a teacher in Atwater, California. The creative decision for Newt to die in Alien 3 was opposed by James Cameron, who {{referred to it as}} a [...] "Temple of Doom slap in the face".|$|E
500|$|Cwrt (...) , now a large farm, was the {{administrative}} centre of Bardsey Abbey's mainland estates, and {{was known as}} the [...] "Court of Bardsey". The steepest cliffs in the Llŷn Peninsula are at Y Parwyd, the scene of a local ghost story. In 1794 a newly married couple moved into a cottage nearby. Within a few years they were disturbed by a phantom, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>read</b> a verse from the Bible, the phantom would retreat towards Y Parwyd and hover over the cliff edge before disappearing; the couple finally moved to Bodferin. In 1801 a ship pilot was put ashore on the rocks below the cliffs. Although very drunk, he managed to climb the cliff face and, reaching the top, fell asleep in a sheep pen. In the early morning, he awoke and, still drunk, headed for home; he walked in the wrong direction, however, and disappeared over the cliff edge into the sea.|$|E
500|$|Russell T Davies {{referred}} to a scene in [...] "Last of the Time Lords" [...] as promoting a theory that Jack may one day become recurring character [...] "the Face of Boe" [...] (a large, mysterious disembodied head in a glass case) {{as a consequence of}} his immortality and slow aging. The Face first appeared in 2005 episode [...] "The End of the World", appearing fully three times and maintaining a presence through {{to the end of the}} 2007 series. Barrowman described himself and David Tennant as being [...] "so excited" [...] to the extent where they [...] "jumped up screaming" [...] <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>read</b> Jack's line regarding the Face of Boe, remarking [...] "It was probably the most excitable moment we had during the shooting of that series." [...] The Face of Boe had originally been a throwaway line in a script for [...] "The End of the World"; because creating the character seemed expensive, the Face of Boe was nearly discarded and replaced. However, special effects designer Neil Gorton loved the idea and pushed to make sure the character lived. Davies loved Gorton's design and to his surprise, the character was written into future episodes and became pivotal in the third series. In a spin-off novel, The Stealer of Dreams (2005), Captain Jack makes a reference to the Face of Boe as a famous figure. Davies conceived the idea that the two characters might be connected midway through the production of the 2007 series.|$|E
5000|$|The term sonnet {{sequence}} {{might be}} rephrased as series or cycle of sonnets.

2500|$|Phonics is a {{teaching}} method that stresses character-sound correspondences, specific rules {{and their use}} in reading and spelling. [...] This helps beginning readers understand how characters are linked to sounds (phonemes), patterns of letter-sound correspondences and spelling in English, and how to apply this knowledge <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>read</b> to sound out words. Phonics teachers present the spellings for different sounds in a specific order, introducing the simplest (or most useful) patterns early on; these patterns are then practiced. A disadvantage to phonics is that in some languages like English, complex letter-sound correspondences can cause confusion for beginning readers.|$|E

2500|$|Affective piety is most {{commonly}} {{described as a}} style of highly emotional devotion to the humanity of Jesus, particularly in his infancy and his death, and to the joys and sorrows of the Virgin Mary.

These images could be either conjured up in people's minds <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>read</b> or heard poetry and other pieces of religious literature, or they could gaze on manuscript illuminations and other pieces of art as they prayed and meditated on the scenes depicted.
