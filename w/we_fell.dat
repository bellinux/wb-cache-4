25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1807 I was on board of the ship Canton, {{belonging}} to my uncle, the late Hugh Thompson, of Baltimore, when <b>we</b> <b>fell</b> in, at sea, near the termination of a very heavy equinoctial gale, with an English brig in a sinking condition, and took off the crew. The brig was loaded with codfish, and was bound to Pole, in England, from Newfoundland. I boarded her, in command of a boat from the Canton, which was sent {{to take off the}} English crew, the brig's own boats having been all swept away, and her crew in a state of intoxication. I found onboard of her two Newfoundland pups, male and female, which I saved, and subsequently, on our landing the English crew at Norfolk, our own destination being Baltimore, I purchased these two pups of the English captain for a guinea apiece. Being bound again to sea, I gave the dog pup, which was called Sailor, to Mr. John Mercer, of West River; and the slut pup, which was called Canton, to Doctor James Stewart, of Sparrow's Point. The history which the English captain gave me of these pups was, that the owner of his brig was extensively engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and had directed his correspondent to select and send him a pair of pups of the most approved Newfoundland breed, but of different families, and that the pair I purchased of him were selected under this order. The dog was of a dingy red colour; and the slut black. They were not large; their hair was short, but very thick-coated; they had dew claws. Both attained great reputation as water-dogs. They were most sagacious in every thing, particularly so in all duties connected with duck-shooting. Governor Lloyd exchanged a Merino ram for the dog, {{at the time of the}} Merino fever, when such rams were selling for many hundred dollars, and took him over to his estate on the eastern shore of Maryland, where his progeny were well known for many years after; and may still be known there, and on the western shore, as the Sailor breed. The slut remained at Sparrows Point till her death, and her progeny were and are still well known, through Patapsco Neck, on the Gunpowder, and up the bay, amongst the duck-shooters, as unsurpassed for their purposes. I have heard both Doctor Stewart and Mr. Mercer relate most extraordinary instances of the sagacity and performance of both dog and slut, and would refer you to their friends for such particulars as I am unable, at this distance of time, to recollect with sufficient accuracy to repeat.|$|E

60|$|But we {{had this}} night, of all the nights of our travels, a most {{advantageous}} camp; for we lay between two woods, with a little rivulet running just before our front; {{so that we could}} not be surrounded or attacked any way, but in our front or rear: we took care also to make our front as strong as we could, by placing our packs, with our camels and horses, all in a line {{on the side of the}} river, and <b>we</b> <b>felled</b> some trees in our rear.|$|R

We identified the potential trees from previous forest inventory list. All large commercial non-deformed trees, with tree diameter (D) greater than 80 cm, from various species were first selected {{and the potential}} felling directions were estimated. To minimize the logging damage, <b>we</b> selected and <b>felled</b> small trees within the area that potentially will be impacted by the felling of large trees. We also selected trees from the potential logging and skidding roads. However, we excluded deformed trees and included {{a wide range of}} tree genera or family as much as possible.|$|R
500|$|Expecting {{to show a}} new {{and more}} mature side visually, TLC were in Los Angeles {{discussing}} about the project when a Matthew Rolston-directed music video for Salt-N-Pepa came on. [...] "We were looking at it and said, 'Whoever did this video has to do the 'Creep' video. <b>We</b> <b>fell</b> in love with the way it was shot," [...] Thomas said. Often times, she remembered the video that they were seeing was [...] "Whatta Man", however, during their interview with MTV in 1995, the show cited [...] "None of Your Business", a video which was also done by Rolston and had more visual similarities to the final [...] "Creep" [...] video. Lopes also recalled the moment: [...] "We were very, very adamant about redoing the 'Creep' video because we were coming back out [...] And we were like, 'Look at that video Salt-N-Pepa got. Man, we're going to kick nobody's butts putting these videos out. [...] is budi, [...] is whack, we've got to do it over.'" [...] Their management team then suggested going back to the editing room to find better shots and have the video redone, but group declined and said: [...] "There is no better shot." [...] Initially, TLC reached out to Rolston and set up the third version's shooting in LA.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{performances}} and selection in the episode {{were met with}} mixed response from critics. The original track [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] received general acclaim from critics. Berk praised the performance, and gave it four stars. He opined, [...] "All four stars are for the lyrics [...] in which the lovable dorks sing about being the lovable dorks <b>we</b> <b>fell</b> in love with [...] ". In her review for the episode, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised the song, and called it a [...] "true anthem" [...] that [...] "ends triumphantly". Raymond Flandez of The Wall Street Journal gave a positive review of the song: [...] "The song {{grew out of a}} collaborative brainstorming session that went beyond rhyming dictionaries or first attempts at ditties such as 'Trouty Mouth', 'Big Ass Heart', and 'Hell to the No'." [...] Jarrett Wieselman of the New York Post commended the show for the use of original songs, and wrote [...] "Glee entered uncharted territory last night [...] no, not Kurt's first kiss. I'm talking about New Directions dabbling in, and debuting, their very first original songs. It was as risky for the show as it was for the group since opting to perform wholly new creations would either give them a leg up on the competition or put them six feet under." [...] Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle praised the song, and deemed it [...] "fun and summery".|$|E
2500|$|Ceppos {{noted that}} Webb {{did not agree}} with these conclusions. He concluded: [...] "How did these {{shortcomings}} occur? ...

2500|$|Impressed by {{accounts}} of the shipwreck, the 25-year-old artist Théodore Géricault decided to create a painting based on the incident and contacted the writers in 1818.

She disappeared, and {{in the words of one}} of the surviving crew members, [...] "From the delirium of joy, <b>we</b> <b>fell</b> into profound despondency and grief". The ship, Argus, reappeared two hours later and rescued those who remained.|$|E

Also appearing on Bubblegum is Lanegan's ex-wife, Wendy Rae Fowler now in <b>We</b> <b>Fell</b> to Earth [...] The favorably reviewed album is his most commercially successful to date, reaching number 39 on Billboard's Top Independent Albums chart.

2500|$|Bronson Alcott {{announced}} his plans in November 1842 to find [...] "a farm {{of a hundred}} acres in excellent condition with good buildings, a good orchard and grounds". Charles Lane purchased a [...] farm in Harvard, Massachusetts, in May 1843 for what would become Fruitlands, a community based on Utopian ideals inspired in part by transcendentalism. The farm would run based on a communal effort, using no animals for labor; its participants would eat no meat and use no wool or leather. Emerson said he felt [...] "sad at heart" [...] for not engaging in the experiment himself. Even so, {{he did not feel}} Fruitlands would be a success. [...] "Their whole doctrine is spiritual", he wrote, [...] "but they always end with saying, Give us much land and money". Even Alcott admitted he was not prepared for the difficulty in operating Fruitlands. [...] "None of us were prepared to actualize practically the ideal life of which we dreamed. So <b>we</b> <b>fell</b> apart", he wrote. After its failure, Emerson helped buy a farm for Alcott's family in Concord which Alcott named [...] "Hillside".|$|E
2500|$|UCSD Economics {{professor}} Julian Betts states: “What {{all this}} means for spending is that starting around 1978-1979 {{we saw a}} sharp reduction in spending on schools. <b>We</b> <b>fell</b> compared to other states dramatically, and we still haven’t really caught up to other states.” [...] From 1977, in California {{there has been a}} steady growth of class sizes compared to the national average, “which have been decreasing since 1970.” [...] The shortage in funds translated to decreased spending per student in the years following passage of Proposition 13. During the 1970s, school spending per student was almost equal to the national average. Using discount rate, “measured in 1997-1998 dollars, California spent about $100 more per capita on its public schools in 1969-1970 than did the rest of the country." [...] Since 1981-1982, California consistently has spent less per student {{than the rest of the}} U.S. as demonstrated by data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and by the Public Policy Institute of California [...] This has resulted in increased pupil-to-teacher ratios in K-12 public schools in California. Professor Betts observes that “pupil-teacher ratios start to skyrocket in the years immediately after 1978, and a huge gap opens up between pupil-teacher ratios here and in the rest of the country, and we still haven’t recovered from that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way <b>we</b> <b>fell</b> in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back. We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E
