Grounded in stakeholder and contract theory, this correlation study {{examined the relationship between}} Fortune reputation scores and return on asset, return on equity, and earnings per share, while controlling for total assets. Archival data were collected from 25 corporate websites of U. S. banks included in Fortune Most Admired Companies listing from 2011 to 2013. For 2011 there was a moderate positive partial correlation between Fortune reputation index (FRI) and return on equity (ROE) while controlling for total assets, r =. 47, p 3 ̆c. 05, <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of FRI associated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of ROE.

Correspondingly, there was a moderate positive partial correlation between FRI and EPS, r =. 56, p 3 ̆c 0. 5 <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of FRI associated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of ROE in 2012.

30|$|To attain data, Japanese {{university}} students (N =  633) completed questionnaires related to psychological inflexibility, depressive symptoms, and sleep difficulty. Psychological inflexibility was significantly correlated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of both depressive symptoms (r =  0.61) and sleep difficulty (r =  0.39).

5|$|Like {{other animals}} {{at the highest}} trophic levels, the killer whale is {{particularly}} at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbor seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} {{countries}} in the world, with a high population growth rate of 2.5%per year and nearly 70% of the population living in poverty.

These socioeconomic issues have complicated conservation efforts, even though the island of Madagascar has been recognized by IUCN/SSC as a critical primate region for over 20years.

An inquest held in October concluded that various safety precautions had not been followed, and had the mine been sufficiently watered it would have reduced the coal dust held in the air. The colliery had further problems in October 1910 when a heavy roof fall in the Mafeking return released trapped firedamp, which caused the mine to be temporarily evacuated.|$|E

5|$|Modern Scotland is {{half the}} size of England and Wales in area, but with its many inlets, islands and inland lochs, it has roughly the same amount of {{coastline}} at 4,000 miles. Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level. Its east Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall, today about 700cm per year in the east and more than 1,000cm in the west. This encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog, the acidity of which, combined <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of wind and salt spray, made most of the islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult and {{may have contributed to the}} fragmented nature of political power. The early Middle Ages was a period of climate deterioration, with a drop in temperature and an increase in rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. This was reversed in the period c. 1150 to 1300, with warm dry summers and less severe winters allowing cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and making land more productive. In the late Middle Ages, average temperatures began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands.|$|E

At Time 2 (Day 4), participants completed the same measure of attributions (reflective attributions). At Time 3 (Day 7, 8, or 9), participants completed a measure of self-efficacy relating to an up-coming performance.
