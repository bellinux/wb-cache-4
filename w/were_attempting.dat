5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the war two days earlier, the US forces <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> to evacuate US civilians and diplomats from the city of Seoul, where a battle was ongoing between North and South Korean forces. Transport aircraft and ships, escorted by US fighter planes, <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> to bring civilians out of the country as fast as possible. During these missions on June 27, US forces were attacked by North Korean aircraft in two separate incidents in the Seoul area. Despite being outnumbered, the better-built American aircraft outmaneuvered the North Koreans, quickly shooting down half of the attacking force.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} {{with the people}} of the Arab world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to rumors that the Baghdad Pact countries <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> to topple Syria's leftist government. Nasser sent a contingent force to Syria as a symbolic display of solidarity, further elevating his prestige in the Arab world, and particularly among Syrians.|$|E
5|$|Goebel's {{campaign}} staff included Senator Jo Blackburn, {{former governor}} James B. McCreary, and political boss Percy Haly. Goebel opened his campaign on August 12 in Mayfield, {{a city in}} the heavily Democratic Jackson Purchase region of the state.

5|$|On April 9, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia {{continued}} to flee westward. Infantry led by Generals John Brown Gordon and James Longstreet, and cavalry led by Fitzhugh Lee formed a battle line near the Appomattox Court House.

If the scheduling of operands still fails, result moves are unscheduled again and a reschedule <b>is</b> <b>attempted,</b> with only late bypassing enabled. Once again, if the schedule of operands still fails, scheduled moves are unscheduled and a reschedule <b>is</b> <b>attempted,</b> without any bypassing enabled. Only if all previous attempts fail, the starting cycle of the scheduling is decreased and a reschedule <b>is</b> <b>attempted.</b>|$|R
5|$|There {{was little}} {{fighting}} for the next month of the campaign, but Washington moved his army to White Plains in October after hearing that the British <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> to trap him on Manhattan. After being defeated at the Battle of White Plains and later at Fort Washington, Washington and his army retreated across New Jersey, pursued by the British, into Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|White {{would later}} {{confirm that the}} killings were premeditated.

5|$|As the American troops <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> {{to destroy}} Shōji's force, Vandegrift ordered Carlson's raiders to march {{overland}} from Aola Bay toward Koli Point {{to cut off}} any of Shōji's forces that escaped the encirclement attempt. On 5 November, two transport ships headed for Espiritu Santo to pick up three companies from Carlson's battalion while Carlson prepared his two companies already on Guadalcanal to march overland towards Koli Point. Carlson arranged for rear echelon personnel at Aola to resupply his patrol with rations every four days at a prearranged point on the coast. A patrol with native carriers would meet the boat and manpack the supplies inland to Carlson's patrol base.|$|E

5|$|But within minutes, the Do 17 {{formation}} {{had been}} reduced to 15 aircraft and most of them were damaged. Six had been shot down and four <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> to make a run for home. The remainder dropped their bombs and were met by a covering force of Bf 109s and landed back in France without further combat. LG 2 meanwhile had been and gone. They saw one rail station and released their bombs and returned home. They saw only one British fighter, No. 46 Squadron’s Pilot Officer Gunning who reported the make up of the formation. Park had decided to ignore their raid.|$|E
5|$|German minesweepers and escorting light cruisers <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> {{to clear}} British-laid minefields in the Heligoland Bight in late 1917. The Admiralty planned a large {{operation}} for 17 November {{to destroy the}} ships, and allocated two light cruiser squadrons and the 1st Cruiser Squadron covered by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and, more distantly, the 1st Battle Squadron of battleships. New Zealand {{was attached to the}} 1st BCS for this operation, which became known as the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight. New Zealand did not fire her guns during the battle. As in previous engagements, Captain Green wore the piupiu and tiki for luck.|$|E

With no takers, he renewed the offer in 1924, when aviation technology had advanced enough {{at that point that}} many people tried for the prize. Most <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> to fly from New York to Paris, but a number of French aviators planned an attempt to fly in the opposite direction, from Paris to New York.|$|E

5|$|In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway {{to protect}} {{shipments}} of iron ore from Sweden, which the Allies <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> {{to cut off}} by unilaterally mining neutral Norwegian waters. Denmark capitulated after a few hours, and despite Allied support, during which the important harbour of Narvik temporarily was recaptured from the Germans, Norway was conquered within two months. British discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to {{the replacement of the}} British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, with Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940.|$|E
5|$|McCoy led the Longhorns, {{who were}} ranked number {{four in the}} {{pre-season}} Associated Press Poll and Coaches Poll, to a 21–13 victory over unranked Arkansas State in the season opener. McCoy threw two touchdown passes and two interceptions. He also made two quick-kick punts when the Longhorns lined up as if they <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> to convert on fourth down. He averaged thirty yards per kick and both kicks were downed inside the opponent's twenty yard-line. In the second game, McCoy led the Longhorns to a 34–13 victory over #19-ranked TCU.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1964, the British {{aircraft}} carrier HMS Victorious {{and her two}} destroyer escorts sailed through the Sunda Strait, an international waterway claimed by Indonesia, en route to Australia.

50|$|IA-BF - The Impairment Aware Best Fit (IA-BF) {{algorithm}} {{was proposed}} in. This algorithm is a distributed approach that is dependent upon {{a large amount of}} communication to use global information to always pick the shortest available path and wavelength. This is accomplished through the use of serial multi-probing. The shortest available path and wavelength <b>are</b> <b>attempted</b> first, and upon failure, the second shortest available path and wavelength <b>are</b> <b>attempted.</b> This process continues until a successful path and wavelength have been found or all wavelengths have <b>been</b> <b>attempted.</b>|$|R
50|$|Integrated Windows Authentication {{itself is}} not a {{standard}} or an authentication protocol. When IWA is selected as an option of a program (e.g. within the Directory Security tab of the IIS site properties dialog) this implies that underlying security mechanisms {{should be used in}} a preferential order. If the Kerberos provider is functional and a Kerberos ticket can be obtained for the target, and any associated settings permit Kerberos authentication to occur (e.g. Intranet sites settings in Internet Explorer), the Kerberos 5 protocol will <b>be</b> <b>attempted.</b> Otherwise NTLMSSP authentication <b>is</b> <b>attempted.</b> Similarly, if Kerberos authentication <b>is</b> <b>attempted,</b> yet it fails, then NTLMSSP <b>is</b> <b>attempted.</b> IWA uses SPNEGO to allow initiators and acceptors to negotiate either Kerberos or NTLMSSP. Third party utilities have extended the Integrated Windows Authentication paradigm to UNIX, Linux and Mac systems.|$|R

5|$|Only a {{week after}} being {{appointed}} by Harrison, Crittenden was dispatched to New York to mediate tensions with Great Britain over {{the sinking of the}} steamboat Caroline by a group of Canadian militia, who <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> to suppress a rebellion in Canada.
