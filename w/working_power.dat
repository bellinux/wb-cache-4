5|$|Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) is Joel's brother. At {{the initial}} outbreak, he picked Joel and Sarah {{up in his}} car {{to take them to}} safety. When the car is hit by a truck, he defends Joel as he carries Sarah, whose leg is badly hurt. After Sarah's death, Joel and Tommy {{initially}} survive together, but differing outlooks and Joel's hardened ways led to their estrangement, and Tommy left to join the Fireflies. After becoming disillusioned, he subsequently left them as well, and built a settlement around a <b>working</b> <b>power</b> plant in Wyoming with his wife, Maria. Many years later, Joel arrives at Tommy's settlement, and the brothers are reunited. Tommy initially refuses to take Ellie off Joel's hands, but upon seeing their close bond and realizing that Joel doesn't trust himself to protect Ellie, he agrees to take her to Marlene himself. However, Ellie confronts Joel about Sarah and, after having a change of heart, Joel and Ellie continue their journey after Tommy promises them sanctuary should they need it.|$|E
25|$|Doubly fed {{electric}} motors have two independent multiphase winding sets, which contribute active (i.e., <b>working)</b> <b>power</b> {{to the energy}} conversion process, {{with at least one}} of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation. Two independent multiphase winding sets (i.e., dual armature) are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication. Doubly-fed {{electric motors}} are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation. This is twice the constant torque speed range as singly-fed electric machines, which have only one active winding set.|$|E

60|$|So they knelt {{together}} {{among the}} black rocks, and prayed {{as some of}} them had never prayed before. It was very well to discuss prayer and treat it lightly and philosophically upon the deck of the Korosko. It was easy to feel strong and self-confident in the comfortable deck-chair, with the slippered Arab handing round the coffee and liqueurs. But they had been swept out of that placid stream of existence, and dashed against the horrible, jagged facts of life. Battered and shaken, they must have something to cling to. A blind, inexorable destiny was too horrible a belief. A chastening power, acting intelligently and for a purpose,--a living, <b>working</b> <b>power,</b> tearing them out of their grooves, breaking down their small sectarian ways, forcing them into the better path,--that was what they had learned to realise during these days of horror. Great hands had closed suddenly upon them and had moulded them into new shapes, and fitted them for new uses. Could such a power be deflected by any human supplication? It was that or nothing,--the last court of appeal, left open to injured humanity. And so they all prayed, as lover loves, or a poet writes, from the very inside of their souls, and they rose with that singular, illogical feeling of inward peace and satisfaction which prayer only can give.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{there came}} to be a god of life and a god of death, one who sends {{fertility}} and one who causes famine. All sorts of inanimate objects were defined as possessing some fancied attribute either for good or evil, and the one Almighty God became hidden and lost in the crowd of minor deities. In some nations the fancies of man went one way, in another another. The lower the intelligence of the people the lower their gods. In some countries serpents are sacred, doubtless because originally they were considered to typify at once the subtleness and the destructive power of a god. In others trees are worshiped. There are peoples who make the sun their god. Others the moon. Our forefathers in Egypt being a wiser people than the savages around them, worshiped the attributes of gods under many different names. First, eight great deities were chosen to typify the chief characteristics of the Mighty One. Chnoumis, or Neuf, typified {{the idea of the}} spirit of God--that spirit which pervades all creation. Ameura, the intellect of God. Osiris, the goodness of God. Ptah typified at once the <b>working</b> <b>power</b> and the truthfulness of God. Khem represents the productive power--the god who presides over the multiplication of all species: man, beast, fish, and vegetable--and so {{with the rest of the}} great gods and of the minor divinities, which are reckoned by the score.|$|E
6000|$|The facts {{presented}} by Mr. Brassey(178) very fully illustrate this [...] principle. Although French workmen in their ship-yards receive [...] less wages {{for the same}} kind of work than the English workmen in [...] English yards, yet it costs less per ton to build ships in England [...] than in France. The same correspondence between high wages and [...] efficient work was found to be true of railway construction in [...] different parts of the world. With different character, varying [...] amounts of industrial energy, varying intelligence, and endurance, [...] different people {{do not have the same}} efficiency of labor. It is [...] ascertained that inefficiency is, as a rule, accompanied by low [...] wages. Even though wages paid for ordinary labor in constructing [...] railways were in India only from nine to twelve cents a day, and [...] in England from seventy-five to eighty-seven cents a day, yet it [...] cost as much to build a mile of railway in India as in England. [...] The English laborer gave a full equivalent for his higher wages. [...] Moreover, while an English weaver tends from two to three times as [...] many looms as his Russian competitor, the workman in the United [...] States, it is said, will tend even more than the Englishman. In [...] American sailing-vessels, also, a less number of sailors, [...] relatively to the tonnage, is required than in English [...] sailing-ships. Mr. Brassey, besides, came to the conclusion that [...] the <b>working</b> <b>power,</b> or efficiency, of ordinary English laborers was [...] to the French as five to three.|$|E

6000|$|The rest of {{the cabinet}} {{consisted}} of men of less eminence, who subordinated themselves more easily. In January, 1862, Lincoln {{found it necessary to}} bow Cameron out of the war office, and to put in his place Edwin M. Stanton, a man of intensely practical mind, vehement impulses, fierce positiveness, ruthless energy, immense <b>working</b> <b>power,</b> lofty patriotism, and severest devotion to duty. He accepted the war office not as a partisan, for he had never been a Republican, but only to do all he could in [...] "helping to save the country." [...] The manner in which Lincoln succeeded in taming this lion to his will, by frankly recognizing his great qualities, by giving him the most generous confidence, by aiding him in his work to the full of his power, by kindly concession or affectionate persuasiveness in cases of differing opinions, or, when it was necessary, by firm assertions of superior authority, bears the highest testimony to his skill in the management of men. Stanton, who had entered the service with rather a mean opinion of Lincoln's character and capacity, became one of his warmest, most devoted, and most admiring friends, and with none of his secretaries was Lincoln's intercourse more intimate. To take advice with candid readiness, and to weigh it without any pride of his own opinion, was one of Lincoln's preeminent virtues; but he had not long presided over his cabinet council when his was felt by all its members to be the ruling mind.|$|E

Thus, then, {{the real}} <b>working</b> <b>power</b> or {{worth of the}} {{currency}} is founded on the entire sum of the relative estimates formed by the population of its possessions; a change in this estimate in any direction (and therefore every change in the national character), instantly alters the value of money, in its second great function of commanding labour. But we must always carefully and sternly distinguish between this worth of currency, dependent on the conceived or appreciated value of what it represents, and the worth of it, dependent {{on the existence of}} what it represents. A currency is true, or false, in proportion to the security with which it gives claim to the possession of land, house, horse, or picture; but a currency is strong or weak,[32] worth much, or worth little, in proportion to the degree of estimate in which the nation holds the house, horse, or picture which is claimed. Thus the power of the English currency has been, till of late, largely based on the national estimate of horses and of wine: so that a man might always give any price to furnish choicely his stable, or his cellar; and receive public approval therefor: but if he gave the same sum to furnish his library, he was called mad or a biblio-maniac. And although he might lose his fortune by his horses, and his health or life by his cellar, and rarely lost either by his books, he was yet never called a Hippo-maniac nor an Oino-maniac; but only Biblio-maniac, because the current worth of money was understood to be legitimately founded on cattle and wine, but not on literature. The prices lately given at sales for pictures and MSS. indicate some tendency to change in the national character in this respect, so that the worth of the currency may even come in time to rest, in an acknowledged manner, somewhat on the state and keeping of the Bedford missal, {{as well as on the}} health of Caractacus or Blink Bonny; and old pictures be considered property, no less than old port. They might have been so before now, but that it is more difficult to choose the one than the other.|$|E
