His deputy — Rear-Admiral Albert Hastings Markham — {{was in the}} lead ship of the second division of five ships, the 10600 LT Camperdown. Markham's normal divisional flagship — [...] — was being refitted. Unusually for Tryon, he had discussed his plans for anchoring the fleet {{with some of his}} officers. The fleet were to turn inwards in succession by 180°, thus closing to 400 yd and reversing their direction of travel. After travelling a few miles in this formation, the whole fleet would slow and simultaneously turn 90° to port and drop their anchors for the night. The officers had observed that 1200 yd was much too close and suggested that the columns should start at least 1600 yd apart; even this would leave insufficient margin for safety. The normal turning circles of the ships involved would have meant that a gap between the two columns of 2000 yd would be needed to leave a space between the columns of 400 yd on completion of the manoeuvre. Tryon had confirmed that eight cables 1300 m should be needed for the manoeuvre the officers expected, but had later signalled for the columns to close to six cables 1000 m. Two of his officers gingerly queried whether the order was what he intended, and he brusquely confirmed that it <b>was.He</b> ordered speed to be increased to 8.8 kn and at about 15:00 ordered a signal to be flown from Victoria to have the ships in each column turn in succession by 180° inwards towards the other column so that the fleet would reverse its course. However, the normal [...] "tactical" [...] turning circle of the ships had a diameter of around 800 yd each (and a minimum of 600 yd, although standing orders required [...] "tactical rudder" [...] to be used in fleet manoeuvres), so if they were less than 1600 yd apart then a collision was likely.|$|E

Since much of this divergence appeared traceable to the essentially qualitative and relative nature of {{the methods used for}} the estimation of agglutinin titer, it was decided to attempt the assembly of more precise data on agglutination than had hitherto been available. As a first step an absolute, quantitative method was developed for the micro estimation of certain agglutinins (1), in which these are measured as the amount of antibody nitrogen actually combined with a given volume of bacterial suspension and in which an accuracy of 0. 01 to 0. 02 rag. of nitrogen is easily attainable. With this method and with the absolute, quantitative methods previously developed for the estimation of precipitins (2 - 4), it was possible to demonstrate the identity of agglutinin and precipitin in absorbed antisera containing only antibody to the type specific polysaccharide of Type I pneumococcus (5).

Japan’s rigorous seismic reinforcement of infrastructure has greatly reduced the effort required to restore essential facilities.

FINDINGS The Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) caused tremendous damage to {{infrastructure and}} public utilities in the eastern region of Japan. According to the Cabinet Office, damages to public utilities and social infrastructure were estimated to be about ¥ 1. 3 trillion ($ 16 billion) and ¥ 2. 2 trillion ($ 27 billion), respectively (KN 6 - 3). Since damage to the road network was limited, and rehabilitation work was efficient, (figure 1) the main highways and roads to the affected areas were repaired within one week. Bullet train service was resumed within 49 days of the event. These developments, in turn, facilitated full-scale relief activities in the devastated areas.

40|$|Many {{industrial}} structures associated with railway infrastructures {{rely on a}} large number of bolted joint connections to ensure safe and reliable operation of the track and trackside furniture. Significant sums of money are spent annually to repair the damage caused by bolt failures and to maintain the integrity of bolted structures. In the U. K., Network Rail (the organization responsible for rail network maintenance and safety) conducts corrective and preventive maintenance manually on 26, 000 sets of points (each having approximately 30 bolted joints per set), in order to ensure operational success and safety for the travelling public. Such manual maintenance is costly, disruptive, unreliable and prone to human error. The aim of this work is to provide a means of automatically measuring the clamping force of each individual bolted joint, by means of an instrumented washer. This paper describes the development of a sensor means {{to be used in the}} washer, which satisfies the following criteria. 1. Sense changes in the clamping force of the joint and report this fact. 2. Provide compatibility with the large dynamic range of clamping force. 3. Satisfy the limitations in terms of physical size. 4. Provide the means to electronically interface with the washer. 5. Provide a means of powering the washer in situ. 6. Provide a solution at an acceptable cost. Specifically the paper focuses on requirements 1, 2 and 3 and presents the results that support further development of the proposed design and the realization of a pre-prototype system. In the paper, various options for the force sensing element (strain gage, capacitor, piezo-resistive) have been compared, using design optimization techniques. As a result of the evaluation, piezo-resistive sensors in concert with a proprietary force attenuation method, have been found to offer the best performance and cost trade-off The performance of the novel clamping force sensor has been evaluated experimentally and the results show that a smart washer can be developed to monitor the condition of bolted joints as found on railway track and points.
