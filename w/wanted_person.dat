25|$|With regular police {{raids on}} people {{known to be}} {{supportive}} of the Angry Brigade and with Mendleson a <b>wanted</b> <b>person</b> (although for cheque fraud only), the police were interested in finding any addresses where she might be found. Mendleson was keeping in regular touch with her family in Stockport and a police informer there passed the Amhurst Road address to police on 18 August 1971. An observation was set up and when Jim Greenfield was seen leaving the flat, a search warrant was obtained. At 4:15 PM on 20 August the police entered the flat and arrested Mendleson, Creek, Barker and Greenfield. Mendleson again gave her name as 'Nancy Pye'. The police reported that their searches of 359 Amhurst Road discovered not only duplicating equipment on which Angry Brigade publications had been produced, but a stick of gelignite, two submachine guns, a Browning pistol and 81 rounds of ammunition. Mendleson was remanded in custody at Holloway Prison and was eventually charged with possession of the armaments and conspiracy to cause explosions. Mendleson's fingerprints were found on a copy of Rolling Stone magazine used to wrap a bomb planted at the Italian consulate in Manchester, and she was also charged with attempting to cause this explosion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. On October 10, 2001, US President {{identified}} the most <b>wanted</b> <b>persons</b> {{sought by the}} United States of America. Agencies such as F BI, CIA and Homeland Security spread images of the most <b>wanted</b> <b>persons</b> across the United States. Even though US citizens saw their images on television, the Internet and posters, computers had, and still have for that matter, no ability at all to identify these persons. To date F BI, CIA and Homeland Security depend entirely on human beings, not computers, to identify persons at borders and international airports. In other words, facial recognition remains an incompetent technology. Accordingly, authors first succinctly show the weaknesses of the current facial recognition methodologies, namely Eigenface Technology, Local Feature Analysis (from the classical 7 point to the 32 - 50 blocks approach), the Scale-Space Approach...|$|R
