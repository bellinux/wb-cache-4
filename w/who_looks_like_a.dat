500|$|Ill from {{drink and}} {{suffering}} from smoker's cough, in February 1888 Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles. He {{seems to have}} moved with thoughts of founding an art colony. The Danish artist Christian Mourier-Petersen became his companion for two months, and at first Arles appeared exotic. In a letter, he {{described it as a}} foreign country: [...] "The Zouaves, the brothels, the adorable little Arlésienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1967, {{she left}} Glassboro State College (now Rowan University) {{and moved to}} Manhattan. She met {{photographer}} Robert Mapplethorpe there while working at a book store with a friend, poet Janet Hamill. She and Mapplethorpe had an intense romantic relationship, which was tumultuous as the pair struggled with times of poverty, and Mapplethorpe with his own sexuality. Smith considers Mapplethorpe {{to be one of}} the most important people in her life, and in her book Just Kids refers to him as [...] "the artist of my life." [...] Mapplethorpe's photographs of her became the covers for the Patti Smith Group albums, and they remained friends until Mapplethorpe's death in 1989. In 1969 she went to Paris with her sister and started busking and doing performance art. When Smith returned to Manhattan, she lived in the Hotel Chelsea with Mapplethorpe; they frequented Max's Kansas City and CBGB. Smith provided the spoken word soundtrack for Sandy Daley's art film Robert Having His Nipple Pierced, starring Mapplethorpe. The same year Smith appeared with Wayne County in Jackie Curtis's play Femme Fatale. Afterward, she also starred in Tony Ingrassia's play Island. As a member of the St. Mark's Poetry Project, she spent the early 1970s painting, writing, and performing. In 1971 she performed – for one night only – in Cowboy Mouth, a play that she co-wrote with Sam Shepard. (The published play's notes call for [...] "a man <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> coyote and a woman <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> crow".) [...] She wrote several poems, [...] "for sam shepard" [...] and [...] "Sam Shepard: 9 Random Years (7 + 2)" [...] about her relationship with Shepard.|$|E
500|$|During the SETI program, Earth's {{scientists}} {{send out}} transmissions (shown {{to be the}} Arecibo message) with information about Earth and its inhabitants, DNA structure, etc., in hopes of finding life beyond Earth. They then receive transmissions from an alien source on how to create endless fuel effortlessly. Therefore, the scientists assume {{that this is a}} friendly alien species. From a second alien transmission, the scientists receive information about an alien DNA along with instructions on how to splice it with human DNA. A government team led by Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) goes forward with the genetic experiment attempting to induce a female, under the (later proved to be mistaken) assumption that a female would have [...] "more docile and controllable" [...] traits. One of the hundred experimental ova produces a girl named Sil, <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> normal human but develops into a 12-year-old in 3 months.|$|E

500|$|Despite being a prequel, {{the second}} game {{introduces}} upgraded versions of the original characters called Toy Freddy, Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica, and Mangle, along with old, ripped, and worn out versions of the original animatronics. Mangle {{is meant to be}} a [...] "toy" [...] version of Foxy, but was ripped apart so much by children that the staff got tired of reassembling it and left it as a [...] "take apart, put back together" [...] attraction, according to Phone Guy. He also mentions that the employees nicknamed it [...] "the Mangle". [...] Two new characters are also introduced: BB (known as Balloon Boy), who has no jumpscare and can only disable the players' lights, and The Puppet (also known as The Marionette), who must be quelled by constantly winding up a music box.The only true animatronic in the third game is Springtrap, <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> decayed golden version of Bonnie. Additionally, Freddy, Chica, Foxy, Balloon Boy, Mangle, and The Puppet return as hallucinations (or [...] "phantoms"), and although their jumpscares don't kill the player, they can disable certain features that are essential for the player to complete the night easily.|$|E
2500|$|During {{her first}} year in Pittsburgh, Cather also wrote a number of short stories, {{including}} [...] "Tommy, the Unsentimental," [...] about a Nebraskan girl with a boy's name, <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> boy and saves her father's bank business. Janis P. Stout calls this story one of several Cather works that [...] "demonstrate the speciousness of rigid gender roles and give favorable treatment to characters who undermine conventions." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2012, Egypt's Al Nahar channel fooled actors into {{thinking}} {{they were on}} an Israeli television show and filmed their reactions to being told it was an Israeli television show. In response, some of the actors launched into antisemitic rants or dialogue, and many became violent. Actress Mayer El Beblawi said that [...] "Allah did not curse the worm and moth {{as much as he}} cursed the Jews" [...] while actor Mahmoud Abdel Ghaffar launched into a violent rage and said, [...] "You brought me someone <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Jew...

2500|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews, with The Hindu's Malathi Rangarajan {{giving the}} film an average review concluding that [...] "the dialogue sparkles in many a place, the direction is neat and song sequences have been inserted intelligently — {{but even with}} such a youthful team what the film lacks is pep and verve." [...] Another critic noted that the film [...] "has predictable, cliched situations, stereotyped characters, and lack-lustre treatment. Half-way through the film, you realise which way the script is being steered." [...] Rediff.com noted that [...] " [...] the film lacks the freshness and grandeur of other films", while Sify called it [...] "a highly melodramatic and over-the-top movie with no logic". The critic however noted [...] "If there is something nice about Priyamana Thozhi, it is Sridevi as Julie <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dream, with her controlled and understated performance and steals the show." [...] The actress was also nominated for the Filmfare Best Tamil Supporting Actress Award in 2004 for her performance as Julie.|$|E

60|$|It has {{frequently}} {{been said that}} those who are much with cows, and have an affection for them, appear to catch something of their expression--to look like cows; just as persons of sympathetic or responsive nature, and great mobility of face, grow to be like those they live and are in sympathy with.
