5|$|After {{taking over}} the {{administration}} of the country in 1945, the Communist Party changed the administrative model to that of the Soviet Union (regions and raions) in 1950, but changed it back in 1968. Nevertheless, the county borders set then <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> different from those present during the interbellum, as only 39 counties were formed from the 56 remaining after the war.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{left his}} brother-in-law's home {{a year later}} and went {{to live and work}} on a sheep farm. The family he lived with were devout Seventh Day Adventists. During this time, he became {{convinced}} that their view of the Bible and its teachings <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> different than what he had been raised to understand, but he accepted their religion entirely.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Tulkinghorn <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> well. Sir Leicester <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> well. My Lady <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> well. All highly satisfactory. The lawyer, {{with his}} hands behind him, walks at Sir Leicester's side along the terrace. My Lady walks upon the other side.|$|R
50|$|He <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> outspoken {{and could}} <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> blunt and {{sometimes}} inconsiderate with people he disagreed with. He {{was known to}} have <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> opinionated, sharp of tongue, and occasionally obnoxious, though he tried to portray himself as a strict religious figure.|$|R
50|$|Lucius Junius Brutus <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> {{prominent}} in English literature, and he <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> popular among British and American Whigs.|$|R
5|$|In 1914, {{the crew}} {{numbered}} 803 officers and enlisted men. The Swiftsures <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> manoeuvrable {{as a result}} of their balanced rudder and a hull form optimized to make the rudder more effective. They were the last British battleships to enter service with bow crests and were also were the last to enter service equipped with ventilation cowls.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} of the Guanche mummies of Tenerife found that they <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> tall. On average, the males stood 1.70 m and the females were 1.57 m in height. They were also generally of robust constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} achieved some {{surprise and}} tactical success, but was ultimately a failure. A great many Allied aircraft were destroyed {{on the ground}} but replaced within a week. Allied aircrew casualties <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> small, since the majority of Allied losses were grounded aircraft. The Germans, however, lost many pilots {{that they could not}} readily replace.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} {{values for}} the set <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> good. The production staff had reproduced an effective-looking replica of {{the bridge of the}} U.S.S Enterprise. As the scene began, the viewscreen of the ship depicted the U.S.S Enterprise being pursued by a type of automobile commonly manufactured in the United States and from the time period when Star Trek was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified on the tail of Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat, but the tails of diplodocids <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.|$|E
5|$|American {{intelligence}} analysts <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> baffled by {{this series of}} enemy actions. For them {{there appeared to be}} no logic behind the sustained NVA/NLF offensives, other than to inflict casualties on the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time—they fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, a {{primitive}} form of milling the silk threads was already in use. In 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, Étienne Boileau's Livre des métiers (Tradesman's Handbook) enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines. The instruments used were further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280. From {{the start of}} the 14th century, many documents allude to the use of devices that <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> complex.|$|E
5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of the {{environment}} of European warfare, which generally took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 12th century, Southampton Castle was valued more for its role in coastal defence and as a coastal base for {{operations}} on the continent than for its value in ensuring internal security. Following the threat of French invasion in the 1170s, Henry II invested modest additional resources in the castle, and in 1187 the wooden keep was converted into a stone shell-keep. John increased spending on the castle during his reign. Royal visits to Southampton <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> common, and additional royal accommodation, called the King's House, was built outside the castle.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{these attacks}} and {{those from the}} extreme left, the ECSC found {{substantial}} public support, {{and so it was}} established. It gained strong majority votes in all eleven chambers of the parliaments of the Six, as well as approval among associations and European public opinion. In 1950, many had thought another war was inevitable. The steel and coal interests, however, <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> vocal in their opposition. The Council of Europe, created by a proposal of Schuman's first government in May 1948, helped articulate European public opinion and gave the Community idea positive support.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, George {{published}} a revised arrangement that placed B.attenuata in the subgenus Banksia {{because of its}} flower spike, section Banksia because its styles are straight rather than hooked, and the series Cyrtostylis, a large and rather heterogenous series of twelve species. He conceded its large emarginate cotyledons (having a notch in their apex) <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> different from other members, {{and that it had}} similarities in flower architecture to another anomalous member B.elegans. He felt B.attenuata to have affinities to B.lindleyana and B.media.|$|E
5|$|In Heian-era Japan, {{husbands and}} wives kept {{separate}} households; children were raised with their mothers, although the patrilineal system was still followed. Murasaki was unconventional because she lived in her father's household, most likely on Teramachi Street in Kyoto, with her younger brother Nobunori. Their mother died, perhaps in childbirth, when the children <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> young. Murasaki had at least three half-siblings raised with their mothers; she {{was very close to}} one sister who died in her twenties.|$|E

5|$|In {{its first}} week of release, it sold 1.71 million Blu-ray units and {{generated}} $48.50 million, topping the weekly Blu-ray chart. However these results <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> skewed due to the one-month delay of its DVD-only release. It sold 3.20 million Blu-ray units ($83.46 million) after 11 weeks. It has also sold 1.12 million DVD units ($19.32 million). Upon its television premiere on December 29, 2013 in the UK on BBC One, it was watched {{by a total of}} 5.4 million viewers, making it the third-most watched program that night, according to overnight figures.|$|E
5|$|On 5 November 2013, Anonymous protesters {{gathered}} {{around the world for}} the Million Mask March. Demonstrations were held in 400 cities around the world to coincide with Guy Fawkes Night. This hasn't been the only march and there <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> a few others over the years such as the 2015 march which formed into a riot and went out of control in London, UK.|$|E
5|$|Reviews {{were widely}} varied for the episode: some {{felt it was}} the best of the third season to date, and others <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> critical, though the overall mix was {{somewhat}} more positive than negative. A number of reviewers noted that tribute episodes have tended to be light on plot, though several felt that this episode had surmounted the usual storyline problems that had plagued past tributes.|$|E
6000|$|But Lucy only cast {{a frightened}} glance around, and rising {{up with the}} accents of perfect sincerity, said, 'No, papa; I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> ready; I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> happy. I <b>was</b> only silly.' ...|$|R
