40|$|Background: Performance of {{migrating}} birds can {{be affected}} {{by a number of}} intrinsic and extrinsic factors like morphology, meteorological conditions and migration strategies. We compared travel speeds of four raptor species during their crossing of the Sahara desert. Focusing the analyses on this region allows us to compare different species under equivalent conditions in order to disentangle which factors affect migratory performance. Methodology/Principal Finding: We tracked raptors using GPS satellite transmitters from Sweden, Spain and Italy, and evaluated their migratory performance at both an hourly and a daily scale. Hourly data (flight speed and altitude for intervals of two hours) were analyzed in relation to time of day, species and season, and daily data (distance between roosting sites) in relation to species, season, day length and tailwind support. Conclusions/Significance: Despite a clear variation in morphology, interspecific differences were generally very small, and did only arise in spring, with long-distance migrants (. 5000 km: osprey and <b>Western</b> <b>marsh-harrier)</b> being faster than species that migrate shorter distances (Egyptian vulture and short-toed eagle). Our results suggest that the most important factor explaining hourly variation in flight speed is time of day, while at a daily scale, tailwind support is the most important factor explaining variation in daily distance, raising new questions about the consequences of possible future changes i...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractRaptors may {{contract}} highly pathogenic {{avian influenza}} virus H 5 N 1 by hunting or scavenging infected prey. However, natural H 5 N 1 infection in raptors is rarely reported. Therefore, we tested raptors found dead during an H 5 N 1 outbreak in wild waterbirds in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, in 2006 for H 5 N 1 -associated disease. We tested 624 raptors of nine species—common buzzard (385), Eurasian sparrowhawk (111), common kestrel (38), undetermined species of buzzard (36), {{white-tailed sea eagle}} (19), undetermined species of raptor (12), northern goshawk (10), peregrine falcon (6), red kite (3), rough-legged buzzard (3), and <b>western</b> <b>marsh-harrier</b> (1) —for H 5 N 1 infection in tracheal or combined tracheal/cloacal swabs of all birds, and on major tissues of all white-tailed sea eagles. H 5 N 1 infection was detected in two species: common buzzard (12 positive, 3. 1 %) and peregrine falcon (2 positive, 33. 3 %). In all necropsied birds (both peregrine falcons and the six freshest common buzzards), H 5 N 1 was found most consistently and at the highest concentration in the brain, and the main H 5 N 1 -associated lesion was marked non-suppurative encephalitis. Other H 5 N 1 -associated lesions occurred in air sac, lung, oviduct, heart, pancreas, coelomic ganglion, and adrenal gland. Our {{results show that the}} main cause of death in H 5 N 1 -positive raptors was encephalitis. Our results imply that H 5 N 1 outbreaks in wild waterbirds are more likely to lead to exposure to and mortality from H 5 N 1 in raptors that hunt or scavenge medium-sized birds, such as common buzzards and peregrine falcons, than in raptors that hunt small birds and do not scavenge, such as Eurasian sparrowhawks and common kestrels...|$|E
40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is a {{zoonotic}} intracellular protozoan parasite {{of worldwide}} distribution that infects {{many species of}} warm-blooded animals, including birds. To date, there is scant information about the seropositivity of T. gondii and the risk factors associated with T. gondii infection in wild bird populations. In the present study, T. gondii infection was evaluated on sera obtained from 1079 wild birds belonging to 56 species (including Falconiformes (n = 610), Strigiformes (n = 260), Ciconiiformes (n = 156), Gruiformes (n = 21), and other orders (n = 32), from different areas of Spain. Antibodies to T. gondii (modified agglutination test, MAT titer $ 1 : 25) were found in 282 (26. 1 %, IC 95 %: 23. 5 – 28. 7) of the 1079 birds. This study constitute the first extensive survey in wild birds species in Spain and reports {{for the first time}} T. gondii antibodies in the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), short-toed snake-eagle (Circaetus gallicus), Bonelli’s eagle (Aquila fasciata), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Montagu’s harrier (Circus pygargus), <b>Western</b> <b>marsh-harrier</b> (Circus aeruginosus), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), long-eared owl (Asio otus), common scops owl (Otus scops), Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), white stork (Ciconia ciconia), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus); in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) ‘‘vulnerable’’ Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti), lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) and great bustard (Otis tarda); and in the IUCN ‘‘near threatened’’ red kite (Milvus milvus). The highest seropositivity by species was observed in the Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo) (68. 1 %, 98 of 144). The main risk factors associated with T. gondii seropositivity in wild birds were age and diet, with the highest exposure in older animals and in carnivorous wild birds. The results showed that T. gondii infection is widespread and can be at a high level in many wild birds in Spain, most likely related to their feeding behaviour...|$|E
