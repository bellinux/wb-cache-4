5|$|The {{rejection}} likely {{had several}} causes. The {{people of the}} Grants <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the disputes with New York, and they <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> Allen's posturing and egotistic behavior, which the success at Ticonderoga had enhanced. Finally, {{the failure of the}} attempt on St. John's was widely seen as reckless and ill-advised, attributes they did not appreciate in a regimental leader. Warner was viewed as a more stable and quieter choice, and was someone that also commanded respect. The history of Warner's later actions in the revolution (notably at Hubbardton and Bennington) may be seen as a confirmation of the choice made by the Dorset meeting. In the end, Allen took the rejection in stride, and managed to convince Schuyler and Warner to permit him to accompany the regiment as a civilian scout.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-month}} hiatus, on the November 30 episode of Raw, Carlito {{returned}} to confront John Cena, after Cena challenged Sheamus {{to come out}} to the ring, telling him everyone on the roster <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> him and that Sheamus was their representative of what the roster believed and then tried to spit apple in Cena's face, which led to him getting hit with Cena's finisher, the Attitude Adjustment. The following week, Carlito was defeated by Cena.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, he was demoted to {{the minor}} leagues to develop {{secondary}} pitches. From 2010 until 2012, his role on the big-league squad frequently fluctuated, but overall, was an underrated member of the pitching staff, according to several writers. Nevertheless, he drew the ire of Phillies fans, who <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> his inconsistency {{during the course of}} his career. After a successful 2012 campaign, however, he firmly implanted himself in the Phillies' starting rotation before the 2013 season. Again in 2013, though, he was inconsistent, and entering 2014, some suggested he should be traded to another team.|$|E

5|$|One year later, the feudal {{families}} of the Sasanian Empire, who <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> war against the Byzantines and Khosrow's oppressive policies, freed Khosrow's son Kavadh, who had been imprisoned by his own father. The feudal families included: Shahrbaraz himself, who represented the Mihran family; the House of Ispahbudhan represented by spahbed Farrukh Hormizd and his two sons Rostam Farrokhzad and Farrukhzad; the Armenian faction represented by Varaztirots II Bagratuni; and finally the Kanarang. In February, Kavadh, along with Aspad Gushnasp, captured Ctesiphon and imprisoned Khosrow II. Kavadh II then proclaimed himself as king of the Sasanian Empire on 25 February, and {{with the aid of}} Piruz Khosrow, executed all his brothers and half-brothers, including Khosrow II's favorite son Mardanshah. Three days later, he ordered Mihr Hormozd to execute his father. With the agreement of the nobles of the Sasanian empire, Kavadh then made peace with the Byzantine emperor Heraclius; under the terms of this peace, the Byzantines regained all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a war indemnity, along with the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.|$|E

25|$|Guevara, {{who viewed}} {{the capture of}} the armored train as a priority, {{successfully}} mobilized the tractors {{of the school of}} Agronomy at the university to raise the rails of the railway. The train was therefore derailed as it transported troops away from the Capiro hill. The officers within tumbled out asking for a truce. At this, ordinary soldiers, whose morale was very low, began to fraternize with the rebels, saying that they <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> fighting against their own people. Shortly afterwards the armored train was {{in the hands of the}} rebels and its 350 men and officers were transported as prisoners.|$|E

This rebellion got stronger day by day and even in 1753 the Crown Prince of Surakarta joined the rebels.

25|$|It {{was evident}} that the people at large, with their respect for the law and their anxiety for their own homes, <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the war. Only those men, such as Cromwell, who have set their hearts on {{fighting}} out the quarrel of conscience, kept steadfastly to their purpose. Cromwell himself had already decided that the King himself must be deprived of his authority, and his supporters were equally convinced. But they were relatively few. Even the Eastern Association trained bands had joined in the disaffection in Waller's army. The unfortunate general's suggestion of a professional army, with all its dangers, indicated {{the only means of}} enforcing a peace, such as Cromwell and his friends desired.|$|E

On October 5, 2000 the first massive surrender of 669 LC-MILF mujahideen led by the renegade vice mayor of Marugong, Lanao del Sur Malupandi Cosandi Sarip and seven other battalion commanders, surrendered to President Estrada at the 4th ID headquarters in Camp Edilberto Evangelista, Bgy.

25|$|The {{semi-nomadic}} eco-centred Inuit were fishers {{and hunters}} harvesting lakes, seas, ice platforms and tundra. While {{there are some}} allegations that Inuit were hostile to early French and English explorers, fishers and whalers, more recent {{research suggests that the}} early relations with whaling stations along the Labrador coast and later James Bay were based on a mutual interest in trade. In the final years of the 18th century, the Moravian Church began missionary activities in Labrador, supported by the British who <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the raids on their whaling stations. The Moravian missionaries could easily provide the Inuit with the iron and basic materials they had been stealing from whaling outposts, materials whose real cost to Europeans was almost nothing, but whose value to the Inuit was enormous and from then on contacts in Labrador were far more peaceful.|$|E

25|$|On 8 September, the Italian {{garrison}} on {{the island}} of Kastelorizo surrendered to a British detachment, which was reinforced during the following days by ships of the Allied navies. The next day, a British delegation, headed by Lord Jellicoe, was dropped by parachute on Rhodes, to persuade the Italian commander, Admiral Inigo Campioni, to join the Allies. The swift action of the German forces forestalled the Allies. Without waiting for the Italians to decide, Kleemann attacked the 40,000-strong Italian garrison on 9 September and forced it to surrender by 11 September. The loss of Rhodes dealt a critical blow to Allied hopes. The government of the Kingdom of Italy surrendered and many Italian soldiers in the Aegean <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the war and had become opposed to Mussolini. Italian Fascist loyalists remained allied to Germany in the Greek campaign. German forces in Greece convinced 10,000 Italians in the Aegean to continue to support their war effort.|$|E
25|$|Politicians in London {{had always}} {{expected}} American colonists {{to contribute to}} the cost of their own defense. So long as a French threat existed, there was little trouble convincing colonial legislatures to provide assistance. Such help was normally provided through the raising of colonial militias, which were funded by taxes raised by colonial legislatures. Also, the legislatures were sometimes willing to help maintain regular British units defending the colonies. So long as this sort of help was forthcoming, there was little reason for the British Parliament to impose its own taxes on the colonists. But after the peace of 1763, colonial militias were quickly stood down. Militia officers <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the disdain shown to them by regular British officers, and were frustrated by the near-impossibility of obtaining regular British commissions; they were unwilling to remain in service once the war was over. In any case, they had no military role, as the Indian threat was minimal and there was no foreign threat. Colonial legislators saw no need for the British troops.|$|E
