5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E
25|$|When {{our father}} Adam {{came into the}} garden of Eden, he came into it with a {{celestial}} body, and brought Eve, one of his wives, with him. He helped to make and organize this world. He is MICHAEL, the Archangel, the ANCIENT OF DAYS! about whom holy men have written and spokenHe is our FATHER and our GOD, and the only God with <b>whom</b> <b>WE</b> <b>have</b> to do. Every man upon the earth, professing Christians or non-professing, must hear it, and will know it sooner or later.|$|E
25|$|It {{must also}} be {{mentioned}} that {{quite a few of}} these men were not just enthusiastic amateurs but had been ‘professionals’ in their field before the war; there were quite a few sportsmen who had represented their country for instance, even at Olympic level. Then there were those like Raoul Bailleux, a theatre director in Brussels before the war, who during his time in the Colony wrote, produced and directed a number of ‘entertainments’ for the delectation of the Colony. Not to mention Camille Fabry, <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> already met, a well-known poet and writer with a number of books to his name before the war.|$|E
60|$|Of course I {{did know}} very well, but here, in an acute form, arose the ancient question: Were we to perish {{for the sake}} of certain {{individuals}} in <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> no great interest and <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> could not save by remaining with them? If we stayed where we were our end seemed fairly certain, whereas if we ran for it, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a good chance of escape. But this involved the desertion of several injured bearers and a woman and child <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> picked up starving, all of whom would certainly be massacred, save perhaps the woman and child.|$|R
5000|$|In Sura 18, ayat (verses) 65-82 Al Kahf, Moses {{meets the}} Servant of God, {{referred}} in the Quran as [...] "one of our slaves <b>whom</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> granted mercy from Us and <b>whom</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> taught knowledge from Ourselves". Muslim scholars identify him as Nabi Khadra, {{although he is}} not explicitly named in the Quran {{and there is no}} reference to him being immortal or being especially associated with esoteric knowledge or fertility. These associations come in later scholarship on al-Khiḍr.|$|R

500|$|On his death, Glyn Daniel {{described}} Lethbridge as [...] "a colourful, stimulating, {{provocative and}} often controversial figure in British archaeology", who represented [...] "one {{of the last}} of that invaluable band of dilettante scholars and devoted amateurs of <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had so many in Britain". Although stating that Lethbridge only emerged as a [...] "semi-professional" [...] for a [...] "short time", he praised much of Lethbridge's writing for its [...] "freshness and an eager restless sense of enquiry". An anonymously authored obituary in The Antiquaries Journal referred to [...] "the strength and honesty of Lethbridge's character as a man, and the singleness of purpose that united all his work, as experimental testing of what he found by observation", seeing these as the unifying characteristics behind his divergent research interests. According to the historian Ronald Hutton, as a result of both his unorthodox ideas and his [...] "contempt for professionalism in all fields", Lethbridge's [...] "status as a scholar never really rose above that of an unusually lively local antiquary". His books continue to be largely ignored by academics into the 21st century.|$|E
500|$|Problems arose during Tilley's {{administration}} {{because of}} conflicting Samoan and American laws. In one case, a native had caught and eaten a skipjack, a sacred fish which {{could only be}} eaten {{with the permission of}} a local chief under Samoan law. Traditional punishment decreed that the offender's house should be burned down and his crops uprooted, and he should be exiled from the territory. The native challenged his punishment under the American legal system, however, resulting in the arrest of the chief responsible for ordering the destruction of his property. The chief was sentenced to a year of house arrest in a criminal proceeding, on which Tilley sat as judge, and he was ordered to pay compensation for the destroyed property. There were similar issues with Samoan customs not blending well with the newly introduced American political divisions in the territory. For example, the territory's three district governors had equal authority but they were of differing Samoan social status. This disparity made decision-making more difficult and caused social tensions. Despite these problems, Tilley was well-considered by the locals. On December 18, 1900, the local chiefs sent a letter of congratulations on the re-election of President McKinley in which they said of Tilley, [...] "you gave us a leader, a Governor, a High Chief, <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> learned to love and respect".|$|E
500|$|Themistocles {{died with}} his {{reputation}} in tatters, a traitor to the Athenian people; the [...] "saviour of Greece" [...] {{had turned into}} the enemy of liberty. However, his reputation in Athens was rehabilitated by Pericles in the 450sBC, {{and by the time}} Herodotus wrote his history, Themistocles was once again seen as a hero. Thucydides evidently held Themistocles in some esteem, and is uncharacteristically flattering in his praise for him (see above). Diodorus also extensively praises Themistocles, going as far as to offer a rationale for the length at which he discusses him: [...] "Now {{on the subject of the}} high merits of Themistocles, even if we have dwelt over-long on the subject in this digression, we believed it not seemly that we should leave his great ability unrecorded." [...] Indeed, Diodorus goes so far as to say that [...] "But if any man, putting envy aside, will estimate closely not only the man's natural gifts but also his achievements, he will find that on both counts Themistocles holds first place among all of <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> record. Therefore one may well be amazed that the Athenians were willing to rid themselves of a man of such genius." [...] Since Diodorus's history includes such luminaries as Alexander the Great and Hannibal, this is high praise indeed. Plutarch offers a more nuanced view of Themistocles, with more of a critique of Themistocles's character. He does not detract from Themistocles's achievements, but also highlights his failings.|$|E

2500|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} the Law {{correctly}} says in [...] "You shall open your hand wide to your brother, to your poor."

60|$|Next, Sir, let {{me bring}} before you the pious care that was taken of our allies under that treaty which {{is the subject of}} the Company's applauses.

2500|$|When the Kathmandu Durbar {{solicited}} Nepalese chiefs' {{opinions about}} a possible war with the British, Amar Singh Thapa {{was not alone in}} his opposition, declaring that – [...] "They will not rest satisfied without establishing their own power and authority, and will unite with the hill rajas, <b>whom</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> dispossessed.
