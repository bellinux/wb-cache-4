They are packed up in one or two large Sahharahs, and then commences the labour of returning home gratis. Besides the Ikram, most of the Madani, when upon these begging trips, are received as guests by great men at Constantinople.

"All's Well" [...] is very {{pleasant}} when sung decently in tune, and inspires noble and poetic ideas of duty, courage, and danger: {{but when you}} hear it shouted all the night through, accompanied by a clapping of muskets {{in a time of}} profound peace, the sentinel's cry becomes no more romantic to the hearer than it is to the sandy Connaught-man or the bare-legged Highlander <b>who</b> <b>delivers</b> <b>it.</b> It is best to read about wars comfortably in Harry Lorrequer or Scott's novels, in which knights shout their war-cries, and jovial Irish bayoneteers hurrah, without depriving you of any blessed rest. Men of a different way of thinking, however, can suit themselves perfectly at Gibraltar; where there is marching and counter- marching, challenging and relieving guard all the night through. And not here in Commercial Square alone, but all over the huge Rock in the darkness--all through the mysterious zig-zags, and round the dark cannon-ball pyramids, and along the vast rock-galleries, and up to the topmost flagstaff, where the sentry can look out over two seas, poor fellows are marching and clapping muskets, and crying [...] "All's Well," [...] dressed in cap and feather, in place of honest nightcaps best befitting the decent hours of sleep.|$|E

5000|$|When {{he wakes}} up from the accident, it is {{revealed}} that Carrie, Jamie's former nanny, {{was the one who}} ran him over, as revenge for interfering with her taking Jamie as her son. He finds himself in a [...] "hospital room" [...] but when he tries to escape (Carrie is torturing him) he discovers that he is not in a hospital room, but in her house, in a room which Carrie designed to confuse him by disguising it as a hospital room by putting medical equipment and painting the room, as well as adding hospital-style curtains. Carrie devises a plan to get Jamie by telling Haley that Dan is dying, so that she'll bring Jamie to see him. Carrie goes after Jamie, then Haley too. Dan shoots Carrie once she attempts to kill Haley and Deb. Carrie wakes up later that night, and reminds Dan that he promised he'd kill her if she came near his family again, prompting him to keep his word and shoot her again, this time killing her. As a result, Nathan and Haley let Dan see Jamie, but Nathan quickly reminds his father that he still hates him for killing his uncle. Unfortunately, Dan still finds himself without a heart transplant and has to wait longer. In the mean time, he tries to be a father to Nathan by advising him on his basketball and has a talk with Lucas about the day of the school shooting to help with the Ravens movie. His relationship with Jamie also grows and he finally has a blowout with Deb about Keith. When his heart transplant does come, the man <b>who</b> <b>delivers</b> <b>it</b> trips over a dog's leash and the dog eats it. Dan ultimately loses all hope and attempts to drown himself at a beach. He then goes to tells Jamie goodbye. Jamie becomes upset and asks him who killed Keith; and Dan admits that he did it. Dan leaves Tree Hill, but not before saying some last words to Lucas and Nathan. At {{the end of the season}} we see Dan as a broken man. He hates his life and wants to die. To make amends he goes to visit Coach Durham to whom he confesses that when he looks back on his life it all went wrong when he refused to play at the state championship. He tells Coach Durham that he should be dead but he isn't and that he realizes [...] "this is my hell". He has to see his family experience the happiest moments of their lives but he can't feel them. To this Coach Durham replies [...] "you created that, Danny". Dan then turns a gun on himself but can't bring himself to pull the trigger. He then forces the gun into Coach Durhams hand and begs him to shoot him later, after Dan cries in his arms, adds [...] "there is still time for redemption, son". Nathan shows up and tells Dan that he has made it to the NBA. Later Peyton lets Dan hold his other grandchild Sawyer Scott. At the end of the episode he tells the audience that when he looks in the mirror he sees that he was supposed to be someone else, but fell short of that person.|$|E

40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{interpretation and}} the correct usage of connectives in English are often different in written and spoken language. In particular, {{in the case}} of spontaneous spoken English, the use of linking, adverbs, and prepositional particles which function as connectives are combined with, or are actually completely substituted by “intonational contours”. These contours cannot be substituted with other forms; so much so that not even the well-studied scorings systems used for written texts render merit to the importance of the particular dynamic of intonation chosen. The goal {{of this paper is to}} illustrate the determining role played by intonation in oral texts regarding “connectives of opposition, or contrast”. It is fundamental to the construction of the text, as it is tied to the constant and direct contact between <b>who</b> <b>delivers</b> <b>it</b> and its receivers, the textual sequence and its context. Intonation also works at a syntactical level, by clarifying the sense of an enunciation. It is an instrument for the emphasizing separation and opposition, above all when an upward-downward pattern of dynamics is followed. Furthermore, it plays an important “emotional and attitudinal” role; and therefore enriches the significance of the text...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{argues that}} {{although}} infrastructure delivery results in numerous economic benefits, {{it can be}} a curse depending on <b>who</b> <b>delivers</b> <b>it.</b> This paper seeks to examine the impact of the influx of non-domestic construction companies and the possible effect of their activities on domestic construction enterprises, and the overall effect on the construction industry’s development agenda of Ghana. By design the paper is descriptive. The paper uses literature review as a method to identify, summarize and synthesize literature on infrastructure delivery and its impact on economic growth of nations, particularly Africa. The paper finds that major infrastructure projects are executed mostly by non-domestic construction firms largely due their greater experiences and resources which give them competitive advantage over their domestic counterparts. This situation is detrimental to the growth, survival and profitability of local construction consultants, contractors and individual practitioners and the construction industry development agenda of Ghana. The need exist for capacity building and / or improvement of domestic construction enterprises through networking {{to meet the challenges of}} globalization which are inevitable. The paper open new directions of infrastructural delivery research that focuses on the impact of the activities of non-domestic construction enterprises on the Ghanaian construction industry generally, the Ghanaian construction industry development agenda and the nations’ construction related social and economic development...|$|E
40|$|This {{definition}} of professional nursing was {{developed at the}} Institute of Nursing Science, University of Basel, {{in collaboration with the}} group of experts from the project "Future of Swiss Medicine" of the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences. Starting points were existing definitions and a list of desirable contents. Using Grounded Theory approaches, potential contents were analysed and a first draft was written. Through several feedback rounds, this draft was refined to the definition that is presented here. Professional nursing is defined in two core sentences. As regards content, it relates to promoting and maintaining health, preventing health problems, and assisting people in treating illnesses and in dealing with consequences of illnesses and their therapies. The goal is to achieve the best possible results of treatments and care as well as the best possible quality of life in all phases of life until death for the people cared for. Eight additional paragraphs describe to whom professional nursing is directed, the tasks it includes, its essential basics, <b>who</b> <b>delivers</b> <b>it,</b> how it is put into practice, and its context. The definition has a scientific background and incorporates international perspectives and developments. An addendum outlines further thoughts regarding interprofessional collaboration in health care, focal points of nursing education, and future directions of professional nursing. It calls for an optimal collaboration among the different professional groups to reach the best possible outcomes for people with (potential) health problems. Trends in society and health care, especially the growing numbers of old and chronically ill people, will increase the need for professional care. It is necessary to develop new systems and models of care that meet population needs and have a lasting effect. Nursing education must take these future changes into consideration. status: publishe...|$|E
