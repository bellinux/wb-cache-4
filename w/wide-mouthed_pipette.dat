30|$|The {{plankton}} {{were identified}} by referring the standard manuals and textbooks (Altaff, 2004; Battish, 1992; Edmondson, 1959; Murugan, Murugavel, & Kodarkar, 1998; Sharma & Michael, 1987) using a compound microscope and inverted biological microscope (INVERSO 3000 (TC- 100) CETI) attached with a camera (Model IS 300). A 1  ml of zooplankton sample was taken with a <b>wide-mouthed</b> <b>pipette</b> and poured into the counting cell of the Sedgewick Rafter and allowed to settle for some time, followed by count was made. The counting process was made in triplicate for each sample of the plankton. Total number of plankton present in 1  l of water sample was calculated using the following formula (Santhanam, Velayutham, & Jegatheesan, 1989): N[*]=[*]n[*]×[*]v/V, where N[*]=[*]total number of plankton per liter of water filtered; n[*]=[*]average number of plankton in 1  ml of plankton sample; v[*]=[*]volume of plankton concentrated (ml); and v[*]=[*]volume of total water filtered (litre).|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} {{to determine the effects of}} various substances on the development of the sea urchin embryo due to the lack of appropriate quantitative microassays. Here, a microplate assay has been developed for quantitatively evaluating the effects of substances, such as hyalin, on living sea urchin embryos. Hyalin (330 kDa) is a major constituent of the sea urchin hyaline layer, an extracellular matrix that develops 20 min postinsemination. Function of the hyaline layer and its major constituent, is the adhesion of cells during morphogenesis. Using <b>wide-mouthed</b> <b>pipette</b> tips, 25 microl of 24 -h Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryos were transferred to each well of a 96 -well polystyrene flat-bottom microplate yielding about 12 embryos per well. Specific concentrations of purified hyalin diluted in low calcium seawater were added to the wells containing the embryos, which were then incubated for 24 h at 15 degree C. The hyalin-treated and control samples were observed live and after fixation with 10 % formaldehyde using a Zeiss Axiolab photomicroscope. The small number of embryos in each well allowed quantification of the developmental effects of the added media. Specific archenteron morphologies-attached, unattached, no invagination and exogastrula-were scored and a dose-dependent response curve was generated. Hyalin at high concentrations blocked invagination. At low concentrations, it inhibited archenteron elongation/attachment to the blastocoel roof. While many studies have implicated hyalin in a variety of interactions during morphogenesis, we are not aware of any past studies that have quantitatively examined the effects of exogenous hyalin on specific gastrulation events in whole embryos...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{monitor the}} current {{duration}} of the application rates in vector programme {{and the level of}} Aedes albopictus larvae susceptibility from three selected areas in northeast district of Penang on two selected larvicides, temephos and Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti) which are commonly used by Penang Health Department for vector control. Methods: The mosquito larvae were tested against two types of larvicides: (1) temephos (Abate®) with diagnostic dosage (0. 012  mg/L) and operational dosage (1  mg/L) and (2) Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (VectoBac® WG) with operational dosage ranging from 6000 international toxic units per L to 24000 international toxic unit per L. A total of 20 late third and early forth instar larvae were selected and transferred into paper cup sized 300  mL using <b>wide-mouthed</b> <b>pipette.</b> The larvae were distributed into each 300  mL paper cup containing 50  mL of aged tap water. The experiment was replicated five times for each concentration tested. Each test was repeated three times. The mortality was recorded after 24  h of exposure and recorded lethal time was based on 2  h for temephos and 6  h for Bti. The control consisted of ethanol for temephos and only seasoned water for Bti. Results: The result showed that Aedes albopictus from Flat Hamna, Kampung Sungai Gelugor and Kampung Tanjung Tokong were still susceptible to Bti and temephos. However, higher lethal time and resistance ratio were detected in strain from Flat Hamna which was a known dengue hot spot area in northeast of Penang. Conclusions: The application of temephos and Bti in vector control activity in these selected localities is still relevant in the control of Aedes larvae populations...|$|E
40|$|The {{best way}} to collect {{free-floating}} planktonic foraminifera for laboratory study and experimentation is to capture them in glass jars held by scuba divers at 3 to 5 m depth in open-ocean conditions. This blue water diving method is preferred over collection with a plankton net because it minimizes trauma and enhances the survival of taxa that are easily damaged or killed when they {{come into contact with}} the mesh of a plankton net. Planktonic foraminifera can be discriminated from other groups of marine plankton (e. g., radiolaria, acantharia) by focusing from 50 to 80 cm distance, whereas species-level identification is best accomplished at a range of 20 to 50 cm. One fine-mesh collection bag containing wide-mouthed collection jars (~ 130 ml) that are each filled with seawater is hung onto a 25 m length vertical down-line that is passed through a float and tethered to the dive boat. An empty collection bag is also attached to the line to receive jars with captured specimens. Divers are tethered to the down-line through a safety-diver monitored trapeze to ensure continuous contact with the diving platform. Foraminifera are collected by gently rotating the jar around a specimen as the lid is slowly lowered onto the jar top. After the lid is firmly replaced the jar is put into the receiving sack. Using this method, as many as 60 to 80 specimens/hr can be collected depending on planktonic foraminifera abundance. Upon return to the laboratory the collected specimens are transferred to culture vessels using a <b>wide-mouthed</b> <b>pipette.</b> At this point, the researcher is ready to initiate a desired experiment...|$|E
40|$|Fluctuation in {{plankton}} {{abundance and}} diversity of the Imo River in Etche, a Niger Delta region of Nigeria was investigated. Plankton samples were collected with 55 micro meter mesh size plankton net at 7 sampling locations once monthly between March 2007 and February 2009. Samples were preserved with 4 % formalin solution in labeled plastic containers in the field. In the laboratory, 1 ml of the plankton subsample was withdrawn with a <b>wide-mouthed</b> <b>pipette</b> from field samples and placed on a Sedge-wick rafter-counting chamber for species identification and counts with standard keys through direct microscopy. The studentized t-test of significance was used to partition numerical abundances of plankton biotypes seasonally. Phytoplankton comprised 43 genera and a mean density of 1859 cells/ml. The dominant phytoplankton was the Bacillariophyceae (53. 25 %), followed in order by Cyanophyceae (21. 25 %), Chlorophyceae (10. 33 %), Chrysophyceae (4. 84 %), Pyrrophyceae (4. 57 %), Xanthophyceae (3. 39 %) and Euglenophyceae (2. 42 %). Zooplankton {{was made up of}} 7 taxa and a mean density of 433 organisms/ml. The order of dominance was the Cladocera (25. 87 %), Copepoda (20. 55 %), Protozoans (19. 17 %), Rotifera (18. 71 %), fish eggs and larvae (9. 24 %), Crab larvae (4. 62 %), and Beetle larvae (0. 69 %). Phytoplankton species showed oscillating as well as stable seasonal patterns of occurrence. Higher Margalef’s diversities were recorded in the dry (3. 655; 57 % and 1. 273; 61 %) than wet season (2. 732; 43 % and 0. 810; 39 %) for phytoplankton and zooplankton biotypes, respectively. Phyto- and zoo-plankton taxa each showed significant numerical differences between the 2007 / 2008 and 2008 / 2009 sampling periods [F (14. 39) >F crit(4. 30) and F (29. 08) >F crit(4. 23), respectively] at P< 0. 05. The observed seasonal peaking in abundance could be attributed to periods of concentrations of nutrients and stability in growth factors of plankton biotypes. </p...|$|E
