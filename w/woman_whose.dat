40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} {{of domestic violence}} remains unacceptably high with numerous consequences ranging from psychological to maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity outcomes in pregnant women. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify factors that increased the likelihood of an event of domestic violence as reported by ever married Ghanaian women. Methods Data from the 2008 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) was analysed using a multivariate logistic model and risk factors were obtained using the forward selection procedure. Results Of the 1524 ever married women in this study, 33. 6  % had ever experienced domestic violence. The risk of ever experiencing domestic violence was 35  % for women who reside in urban areas. Risk of domestic violence was 41  % higher for <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> husbands ever experienced their father beating their mother. <b>Women</b> <b>whose</b> mother ever beat their father were three times more likely to experience domestic violence as compared to <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> mother did not beat their father. The risk of ever experiencing domestic violence was 48  % less likely for <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> husbands had higher than secondary education as compared to <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> husbands never had any formal education. <b>Women</b> <b>whose</b> husbands drink alcohol were 2. 5 times more likely to experience domestic violence as compared to <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> husbands do not drink alcohol. Conclusion Place of residence, alcohol use by husband and family history of violence do increase a woman’s risk of ever experiencing domestic violence. Higher than secondary education acted as a protective buffer against domestic violence. Domestic violence against women is still persistent and greater efforts should be channelled into curtailing it by using a multi-stakeholder approach and enforcing stricter punishments to perpetrators...|$|R

The child allowance increased {{for some of the}} Druze and Bedouin populations and almost for all the Muslim population. This paper examines the change in the birthrate of <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> child allowances increased (i. e., <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> husbands did not serve in the army) as against that of similar <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> child allowances did not increase. We found that the {{increase in}} child allowances increased the completed fertility rate of Druze women but did not affect the fertility of Bedouin and Muslims...|$|R

5|$|The film Il giorno di San Sebastiano (Saint Sebastian's Day) (1993), {{directed}} by Pasquale Scimeca, {{is based on}} the Caltavuturo massacre on January 20, 1893, when during the celebration of Saint Sebastian, a firing squad killed 15 peasants who claimed their right to state-owned land. It won a Golden Globe and was presented at the Venice film festival. The play, a monologue depicting a peasant <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> husband was killed in the events at Caltavuturo, was written by Rosario Garibaldi Bosco and first performed on February 2, 1893, in Palermo {{to raise money for the}} victims.|$|E
5|$|As a judge, Parker was {{notable for}} {{independently}} researching each {{case that he}} heard.

Rochester Folding Box Co, Parker found against a <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> face had been used in advertisements without her permission, ruling that this use did not violate her common law privacy rights. The decision was unpopular in the press and led to the passage of a privacy law by the New York State Legislature the following year. In the same year, Parker upheld the death sentence given to convicted murderer Martha Place, who became the first woman to be executed by electric chair.|$|E

5|$|At {{some time}} during the 590s, Rædwald married a <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> name is unknown, though it is known from Bede that she was pagan. By her he fathered at least two sons, Rægenhere and Eorpwald. He also had an older son, Sigeberht, whose name is unlike other Wuffingas names but which {{is typical of the}} East Saxon dynasty. It has been {{suggested}} that Rædwald's queen had previously been married to a member of the Essex royal family and that Sigeberht was Rædwald's stepson, as was stated by William of Malmesbury in the 12th century. Sigeberht earned the enmity of his step-father, who drove him into exile in Gaul, possibly to protect the Wuffingas bloodline.|$|E

As an act of gratitude, Vittalacharya sold the remake rights to Nagi Reddy. Mane Thumbida Hennu revolves around the life of a rich <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> brother marries off her daughter to a criminal when she chooses a mentally challenged person as her step-daughter's life partner. Nagi Reddy chose to remake the film in Telugu and discussed it with D. V. Narasa Raju; {{it was the first time}} Vijaya Vauhini Studios decided to remake a film. After the script was ready, Nagi Reddy approached C. Pullaiah to direct the remake after considering Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy.

5|$|Cagney {{was even}} more violent towards women in the gangster film Picture Snatcher (1933): in one scene, he knocks out an amorous <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> {{feelings}} he does not reciprocate and violently throws her into the backseat of his car. In April 1931, the same month as the release of The Public Enemy, Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct {{a study on the}} effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and even overly favorable in depicting the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed, and from 1930 through 1932, removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.|$|E
