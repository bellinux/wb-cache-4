500|$|Kneale {{had brought}} Quatermass's story {{to a close}} in the 1979 serial Quatermass, and for many years {{saw no reason to}} revisit the character. However, in 1995 he was {{approached}} by BBC radio producer Paul Quinn with an idea for creating a drama-documentary about the character as part of a season of BBC radio programming looking back at the 1950s. Quinn told Dreamwatch magazine, [...] "For many people who remember the seminal experience of hiding behind the sofa when the Quatermass serials came on the television, Quatermass was the 1950s. His adventures [...] have gone down in popular cultural history." [...] Kneale was intrigued by the idea, and agreed to write new dramatic material of Quatermass relating his memories which Quinn could then combine with archive clips from the existing episodes of the various Quatermass television serials. Kneale saw the older Quatermass of this new serial as [...] "the same very concerned scientist <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>now,</b> <b>in</b> retrospect, horribly worried about what he may have done to the world through his encounters with various lifeforms that were better not contacted". It was Kneale's first radio work since he had written the play You Must Listen for the BBC in 1952, and his first work for the BBC in any medium since the mid-1970s.|$|E

500|$|Ripley {{attempts}} to find help, but is confronted by Axel, a survivor who explains that Sevastopol {{is out of control}} due to a deadly [...] "monster" [...] lurking aboard, leading to fear and paranoia amongst the station's population. Ripley convinces him to help her in exchange for a ride off the station aboard the Torrens, but Axel is eventually killed by the monster in question, an alien creature. While exploring the station, Ripley finds the Nostromos flight recorder but discovers, to her dismay, that it contains no data. After contacting Samuels and recovering medical supplies to treat an injured Taylor, Ripley reunites with the station's marshal, Waits, and his deputy, Ricardo. Waits explains that the alien was brought on board the station by Anesidora captain Henry Marlow, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> Waits' custody. Ripley learns from Marlow that the Anesidora crew discovered the flight recorder near the planetoid LV-426, where they also found a derelict ship previously found by the Nostromo crew and the nest of alien eggs contained within. While exploring the ship, Marlow's wife was attacked by a facehugger. Marlow then brought her aboard Sevastopol for emergency medical treatment, but an alien ultimately hatched from her. Waits convinces Ripley to contain the alien by luring it into a remote section of the station and sealing it inside. Ripley is successful, but Waits truly plotted to use Ripley as bait, and ejects the module from the station with her still inside. As the module careens into space towards KG348, Ripley space-jumps back to Sevastopol using an EVA suit.|$|E
