5|$|The Leopold Report, officially {{known as}} <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Management</b> in the National Parks, is a 1963 paper {{composed}} {{of a series of}} ecosystem management recommendations that were presented by the Special Advisory Board on <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Management</b> to United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall. Named for its chairman and principal author, zoologist and conservationist A. Starker Leopold, the report proved influential for future preservation mandates.|$|E

5|$|After {{several years}} of public {{controversy}} regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in Yellowstone National Park, Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future <b>wildlife</b> <b>management</b> of the national parks. The committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended different management of Yellowstone's elk population. In addressing the goals, policies, and methods of managing wildlife in the parks, the report suggested {{that in addition to}} protection, wildlife populations should be managed and regulated to prevent habitat degradation. Touching upon predator control, fire ecology, and other issues, the report suggested that the National Park Service (NPS) hire scientists to manage the parks using current scientific research.|$|E

5|$|MD 12 heads {{north from}} the Virginia border on Snow Hill Road, {{which is a}} two-lane {{undivided}} road. The road continues south into Virginia as SR 679 (Fleming Road). From the border, the route passes through a mix of woodland and farmland with a few residences in southern Worcester County before reaching Stockton. Here, MD 12 passes by homes and crosses MD 366 (George Island Landing Road). Upon leaving Stockton, the roads heads back into rural areas and passes near the E.A. Vaughn <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Management</b> Area before reaching the residential community of Girdletree. Past Girdletree, the road continues {{to the east of}} a tract of the Pocomoke State Forest as it approaches Snow Hill, the county seat of Worcester County.

5|$|Rafting is also {{popular in}} some of the Canadian {{stretches}} of the river, especially those near the headwaters that have the steepest gradient and the most challenging rapids. Several Canadian outfitters provide trips on the river near Kootenay National Park ranging from a few hours to several days. Canoeing in the numerous sloughs, side-channels and distributaries of the Kootenay that thread through the wetlands of the Kootenay Flats has the additional benefit of watching birds and wildlife in the Creston Valley <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Management</b> Unit and other surrounding marshes. Larger craft such as houseboats are able to travel on Kootenay and Koocanusa Lakes. Rafting and kayaking is also an activity on the swift-flowing Slocan River, the lowermost major tributary of the Kootenay, and in parts of other major Kootenay tributaries as well.|$|E
5|$|Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area has trails for {{hiking and}} horseback riding. A short, half mile (800m) trail leads to Silver Springs near the park's east entrance. A longer, four mile (6.4km) trail follows {{the course of}} the Fox River through the park's wooded areas. The equestrian trail is located in the <b>wildlife</b> <b>management</b> area of the park and {{stretches}} seven miles (11km). A one-mile (1.6km) path travels through the prairie restoration area as well. During the winter, much of the park's trail system is open to cross-country skiing, and a four-mile (6km) trail is open to snowmobiling, weather permitting. When ice thickness permits, the lakes are opened to ice skating and ice fishing. Sledding is another popular activity; Toboggan Hill is located inside the park's east entrance.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with NY26 in Cincinnatus, {{a town in}} eastern Cortland County. It heads east across the Otselic River and through the hamlet of Lower Cincinnatus before curving to the northeast and crossing into Chenango County very soon afterward. Across the county line, it continues northeast through a lightly developed valley surrounding Brakel Creek to the Pharsalia State <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Management</b> Area, where it connects with CR42, a highway that was once part of NY23. From here, the route heads southeastward along another valley, this one surrounding Canasawacta Creek, {{to the city of}} Norwich, the county seat of Chenango County. It heads east–west across the city on Pleasant and Rexford streets, passing through mostly residential areas and intersecting with NY12 at Broad Street.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a kind}} of {{continuum}} {{with three}} semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: hybridization without introgression, hybridization with widespread introgression (backcrossing with one of the parent species), and hybrid swarms (highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with the parent species). Depending on where a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within <b>wildlife</b> <b>management</b> and habitat management. Global climate change is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization.|$|E

MD291 crosses Mills Branch as it approaches its indirect interchange with US301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway). The state highway connects with the southbound and northbound directions of the U.S. Highway via Edge Road (unsigned MD701A) and Howard Johnson Road (MD701), respectively, both of which meet MD291 at roundabouts. At this interchange, a park and ride lot {{is located on the}} west side of MD701. MD291 continues east into the town of Millington, through which the highway passes as Cypress Street. In the center of town, the highway intersects MD313 (Sassafras Street) and the Centreville Branch of the Northern Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad. MD291 crosses Cypress Branch to exit Millington along Cypress Road, which the route follows between the Chester River and the Millington <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Management</b> Area to the Delaware state line.

5|$|MD363 {{begins at}} a dead end in the {{community}} of Wenona {{at the southern end of}} Deal Island. The state highway heads north, sharply curving before crossing Middle Creek. The road runs through another series of sharp curves through marshland before straightening out and passing St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church and the old post office building, two examples of buildings on the island preserved as part of the Deal Island Historic District. The route passes a boat ramp accessed from Ralph Abbott Road before a high-level bridge carries it over Upper Thorofare, a strait between Laws Cove and Tangier Sound. On the north side of the bridge, MD363 intersects MD363A, the northern approach to the previous bridge to Deal Island, before passing through the community of Chance, the site of Rock Creek Methodist Episcopal Church. After passing Haines Point Road, which leads to a large public boat ramp, the state highway continues northeast across the two branches of Rock Creek and through more marshland before entering Dames Quarter. MD363 traverses Dames Quarter Creek and passes through Deal Island <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Management</b> Area.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, {{improvements}} in natural resource management techniques emerged, along with increased concerns about otter population declines in North America. Consequently, many <b>wildlife</b> <b>management</b> agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, {{including the use}} of reintroduction projects. Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. All Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and 29 U.S. states have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of northern river otters are similar for Canada and the United States, with most pelts being used in the garment industry. In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached approximately 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million. Otters are inadvertently harvested by traps set for beavers, and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously. While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas. Otter harvests correlate positively with the beaver harvests and with the average beaver pelt price from the preceding year. Fur of the river otter is thick and lustrous and is the most durable of Native American furs. River otter pelts are used as the standard for rating the quality of other pelts.|$|E
