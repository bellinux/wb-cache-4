The series follows the original Thor, who now refers to himself as Odinson, {{as he tries to}} find his purpose after relinquishing his name and title to Foster. Aaron stated that the series finds Odinson in a dark place explaining, [...] "He failed for a reason we still don't quite understand. He dropped the hammer and hasn't been able to pick it up since. So then <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pretty dark place. A darker, more desperate, more driven version." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with USA Today, Azalea talked about {{the concept of the}} music video, mentioning Spears's signature dance scenes, [...] "I think Britney's identity is really embedded in being a dancer, and that's something she really wanted to do as well. So there's a lot of dancing in the video, but I wouldn’t say it's necessarily centered around that." [...] When asked about the '80s-inspired visuals seen on the candids from the video shoot, she explained that it would have a narrative and stated that Britney wanted to do a video where she got to dress up and play a character. Azalea revealed she looked to actress Geena Davis when modeling her style, describing her as [...] "the ultimate '80s pin-up hot, cool type of girl" [...] that Britney also liked. Spears added, [...] "I had called my manager and had some ideas about doing a Valley girl-type video. It was really kind of funny, because I had just watched Clueless on TV, and was like, 'It would be so fun to do something like that.' Then I saw Iggy's video, and I thought, 'Oh my God, to work with her would be heaven sent.'" [...] They brainstormed the concept for the video, deciding on a send-up of 1988 sci-fi comedy Earth Girls Are Easy, which starred Davis. Spears said, [...] "I do a makeover for her and <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> club. The best part about it was just us coming together with the clothes and doing the '80s haircuts. We were all about being characters, so it was kind of funny for us. We weren't taking ourselves so seriously".|$|E

[...] "Cannot <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> music-hall, the Alhambra, for example? We could take a box and sit back." ...|$|E
60|$|After dining <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{roof-garden}} vaudeville {{that was}} being much praised. There we found a good bill, an artificially cooled atmosphere, cold drinks, prompt service, and a gay, well-dressed audience. North was bored.|$|R

If, therefore, when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> place, we {{see nothing}} else than is there, {{we are to}} paint nothing else, and to remain pure {{topographical}} or historical landscape painters. If, going to the place, we see something quite different from what is there, then we are to paint that--nay, we must paint that, whether we will or not; it being, for us, the only reality we can get at. But let us beware of pretending to see this unreality if we do not.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dishonesty is not {{the general}} fault of the critics, Lady Carbury,--at least not as far as I have {{observed}} the business. It is incapacity. In what little I {{have done in the}} matter, that is the sin which I have striven to conquer. When we want shoes <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> professed shoemaker; but for criticism we have certainly not gone to professed critics.

6000|$|... "Why, then, {{should not}} <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> land {{where there is}} much that is far better than we find here, and live as the Fire-spouters live? Did the Great Maker of all things intend that we should remain content with these {{treeless}} islands among the ice, when there are lands not very far away where we may find much of all kinds of things that are far better? If it is wise to change our hunting and fishing grounds close at hand, surely it may be wise to change to those that are far away--especially when we know that they are better, and likely to make us more comfortable and happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Fulk's answer, was--"Better so! If <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strange place, {{and tried}} to conceal it, it would always be oozing out, and be {{supposed}} disgraceful. If my sisters can bear it, I had rather confront it straightforwardly--" ...|$|R

6000|$|It was 10 o'clock A.M. {{when we got}} in Chicago, {{too late}} for the steamer; so <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{excellent}} public house, the [...] "American Temperance," [...] and I spent the time that day and till next morning, looking around Chicago.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{why do you}} object?" [...] she asked, {{looking at}} me steadily, and beating with her little hand the {{arm-rest}} by her side. [...] "If your behavior is not impertinence, pray what is it? We meet at the Opera. You look. It {{is not enough for}} you that you look once, but you look twice, three times. You come out on to the pavement to hear the address which my uncle gives the chauffeur. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> restaurant for supper, where only the few are admitted. You are content to be brought by a waiter, but you are there! You travel to England by the same train,--you walk up and down past my compartment. You presume to address me upon the boat. You give a fee to the guard that he should put us in your carriage. Yet you object to the term 'impertinence'!" ...|$|E

I shall not be obliged to cook for you, for now you do not eat; I shall not have to make your bed, for tin does not tire or require sleep; when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dance, you will not get weary before the music stops and {{say you want to}} go home. All day long, while you are chopping wood in the forest, I shall be able to amuse myself in my own way--a privilege few wives enjoy. There is no temper in your new head, so you will not get angry with me. Finally, I shall take pride in being the wife of the only live Tin Woodman in all the world!' Which shows that Nimmie Amee was as wise as she was brave and beautiful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, now, that's {{just what}} I mean,' said Hilda ecstatically, with a neat shot off the cushion against {{the red and}} into the middle pocket; 'that's such a delightfully {{original}} {{way of looking at}} things, you see. We all of us here talk always about the partridges, and the red deer, and the turnips, and the Church, and dear Lady This, and that odious Lady That, and the growing insolence of the farmers, and the shocking insubordination of the lower classes, and the difficulty of getting really good servants, and the dreadful way those horrid Irish are shooting their kind-hearted indulgent landlords; or else we talk--the women especially--about how awfully bored we are. Lawn-tennis, you know, and dinners, and what a bad match Ethel Thingumbob has made. But you talk another kind of slang; I dare say it doesn't mean much; you know you're not working at anything very much more serious than we are; still it's a novelty. When <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> coursing meeting, we're all on the hounds; but you're on the hare, and that's so delightfully original. I haven't the least doubt that if we were to talk about the Irish, you'd say you thought they ought to shoot their landlords. I remember you shocked mamma by saying something like it at the Dolburys'. Now, of course, it doesn't matter to me a bit which is right; you say the poor tenants are starving, and papa says the poor landlords can't get in their rents, and actually have to give up their hounds, poor fellows; and I don't know which of you is the most to be believed; only, what papa says is just the same thing that everybody says, and what you say has a certain charming freshness and variety about it. It's so funny to be told that one ought really to take the tenants into consideration. Exactly like your brother Ronald's notions about servants!' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{paid for}} what we had drunk, and {{we made our way}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cheap restaurant, crowded and gay, where we dined with pleasure.

"It was {{so crowded}} {{that there was}} even no way of {{entering}} it. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> canteen <b>to</b> have something to eat, when there was suddenly a big blast.

60|$|He is to {{consider}} that the grand characteristic of a tradesman, and by which his credit is rated, is this of paying his bills well or ill. If any man goes to the neighbours or dealers of a tradesman to inquire of his credit, or his fame in business, which is often done upon almost every extraordinary occasion, the first question is, 'How does he pay his bills?' As when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> master or mistress to inquire {{the character of a}} maid-servant, one of the first questions generally is of her probity, 'Is she honest?' so here, if you would be able to judge of the man, your first question is, 'What for a paymaster is he? How does he pay his bills?'--strongly intimating, and, indeed, very reasonably, that if he has any credit, or any regard to his credit, he will be sure to pay his bills well; and if he does not pay his bills well, he cannot be sound at bottom, because he would never suffer a slur there, if it were possible for him to avoid it. On the other hand, if a tradesman pays his bills punctually, let whatever other slur be upon his reputation, his credit will hold good. I knew a man in the city, who upon all occasions of business issued promissory notes, or notes under his hand, at such or such time, and it was for an immense sum of money that he gave out such notes; so that they became frequent in trade, and at length people began to carry them about to discount, which lessened the gentleman so much, though he was really a man of substance, that his bills went at last at twenty per cent, discount or more; and yet this man maintained his credit by this, that though he would always take as much time as he could get in these notes, yet when they came due they were always punctually paid to a day; no man came twice for his money.|$|E
