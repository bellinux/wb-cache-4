5|$|According to Walter Breen, Snowden {{most likely}} chose the {{combination}} of the Indian Head and the laurel wreath as it was the lowest relief of any of the options, and could be expected to strike well. On November 4, 1858, Snowden wrote to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb about the Indian Head design, and two days later wrote to Longacre, informing him that it was approved. Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production, which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> on January 1, 1859.|$|E
5|$|After being {{signed by}} Mercury Records, the New York Dolls {{released}} their self-titled debut album in 1973 to poor sales. Although it was praised by critics, {{the band was}} not satisfied with producer Todd Rundgren's sound for the album and had disagreements with him before choosing not to retain him. Songwriting and production partners Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were originally enlisted to produce their next album, while the band's guitarist Johnny Thunders wanted to produce it himself. However, Leiber and Stoller withdrew shortly before recording <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin.</b> The group held a single session with Mercury A executive Paul Nelson at Media Sound Recording Studios, where they recorded 14 songs, {{most of which were}} covers.|$|E

5|$|Buddhist {{scholars}} living {{during the}} time of the Liao dynasty predicted that the mofa (末法), an age in which the three treasures of Buddhism would be destroyed, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> in the year 1052. Previous dynasties, including the Sui and Tang, were also concerned with the mofa, although their predictions for when the mofa would start were different from the one selected by the Liao. As early as the Sui dynasty, efforts were made to preserve Buddhist teachings by carving them into stone or burying them. These efforts continued into the Liao dynasty, with Emperor Xingzong funding several projects in the years immediately preceding 1052.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the portion}} of the highway between the eastern {{terminus}} and the Muskogee Turnpike, known as the Broken Arrow south loop, was scheduled to begin in May 1999 and be completed in January 2001. The section from the Muskogee Turnpike north to the Will Rogers Turnpike <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> construction in September 1999 and be completed in January 2002. Unlike the section of the turnpike built in the early 1990s, this section was expected to displace few residents; the city of Broken Arrow had purchased much of the right-of-way ahead of time to preserve the corridor for the expected turnpike.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} draft {{that got the}} film green-lit, Straczynski's script was tossed aside. Production <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> {{at the start of}} 2009, but was delayed while the script was {{completely}} re-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan to set the film in the present, leaving behind much of the book's premise to make it more of an action film. In a 2012 interview, Brooks stated the film now had nothing in common with the novel other than the title. Filming commenced mid-2011, and the film was released in June 2013.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} early church {{settlement}} at Llanbadarn Fawr was comparatively successful and well-endowed, {{it is unlikely that}} significant building work was done. The clas church would continue to reflect a strong Celtic form for many years. But even though St Augustine, first Archbishop of Canterbury, failed to extend his authority to the Christians in Wales and Dumnonia {{at the beginning of the}} seventh century, the influence of the western church <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> to be gradually felt. However, even then, the tendency in west Wales was to build larger and larger single cell churches, rather than adopt the newly fashionable basilican design.|$|E
5|$|For {{his first}} foreign project, Kurosawa chose a story {{based on a}} Life {{magazine}} article. The Embassy Pictures action thriller, to be filmed in English and called simply Runaway Train, would have been his first in color. But the language barrier proved a major problem, and the English version of the screenplay was not even finished by the time filming <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> in autumn 1966. The shoot, which required snow, was moved to autumn 1967, then canceled in 1968. Almost twenty years later, another foreigner working in Hollywood, Andrei Konchalovsky, would finally make Runaway Train, though from a script totally different from Kurosawa's.|$|E
5|$|NY9L was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to its current alignment. The bridge carrying NY9L over Halfway Creek in Queensbury was originally built in 1923. On August27, 2007, the New York State Department of Transportation announced that the bridge would be replaced at a cost of $1.3 million. Initially, work on the project <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> in September of that year; however, the start of construction was delayed until April21, 2008.

5|$|Operation Perch was a British {{offensive}} of the Second World War {{which took}} place from 7 to 14 June 1944, {{during the early stages}} of the Battle of Normandy. The operation was intended to encircle and seize the German occupied city of Caen, which was a D-Day objective for the British 3rd Infantry Division in the early phases of Operation Overlord. Operation Perch <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> immediately after the British beach landings with an advance to the south-east of Caen by XXX Corps. Three days after the invasion the city was still in German hands and the operation was amended. The operation was expanded to include I Corps for a pincer attack on Caen.|$|E
5|$|SR209 was {{designated}} in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Plans for an interchange between I-5, I-8, SR 209, and SR 109 date from 1965, although several concerns {{had to be}} taken into account, including the preservation of historical Old Town and keeping traffic through the area moving during construction. The goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> construction in 1966, and complete the interchange in 1969. There were concerns about a $3 billion shortfall in funding during May 1966, which caused the San Diego Chamber of Commerce Highway Committee to recommend the completion of SR 109 as a project.|$|E
5|$|The {{expressway}} portion east of I-805 to South Worthington Street was {{upgraded to}} a freeway {{in the late}} 1990s, and an HOV lane opened in each direction, east of I-805 only. The first part from I-805 to near Woodman Street was finished in November1993. The second part <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> the construction phase in 1994; this was complete by 1998. The state legislature allowed for the relinquishment of SR54 from the El Cajon city limit to I-8 to the City of El Cajon in 1999, and the transfer took place that year.|$|E
