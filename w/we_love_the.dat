500|$|Advance Wars: Days of Ruin {{features}} a style unlike previous {{entries in the}} series. When asked why it was changed, the developers stated {{that they wanted to}} surprise people. One of the people who localized Days of Ruin into English, Tim O'Leary, commented that the design change also came from reading comments from people that state to the effect: [...] "We like the game, <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> game, but it's the same thing." [...] In designing the new style, setting, and plot, the developers discovered that Japanese people have a different view on war than American people do, citing the previous titles' lighthearted take on war. As a result, they designed the game to be [...] "grittier" [...] and [...] "more somber". Another influence on the new setting was that Advance Wars was more successful in North America than it was in Japan.|$|E

[...] "Storm" [...] was originally written by Wade at the age of sixteen, when he was going through difficult times. When asked about the song in an interview, Wade said, [...] "That was fun to record because of its starkness. <b>We</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> idea of the title, surrounded by negative space, like the a cappella beginning. Because when you’re lost in confusion, no matter how much is going on around you, you’re still alone." ...|$|E

Shiva would meet the chief of the Vasudevas and the Vayuputras in the hidden cities of Ujjain and Pariha. [...] "Some loose ends will be left deliberately open for the readers to interpret. As for losing someone <b>we</b> <b>love?</b> <b>The</b> Shiva trilogy chronicles a battle against evil. And evil does not go quietly into the night; instead, it puts up a strong fight against Good. So yes, people will die in Vayuputras," [...] he concluded.|$|E
