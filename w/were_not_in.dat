5|$|A {{group in}} Cambridge, which {{met at the}} White Horse tavern from the mid-1520s and became known as Little Germany, soon became influential. Its members {{included}} Robert Barnes, Hugh Latimer, John Frith and Thomas Bilney—all eventually burned as heretics. Cranmer's change of mind, borne partly by his membership of the team negotiating for the annulment, finally came through his stay with Andreas Osiander in Nuremberg in 1532. (Cranmer also secretly married Osiander's niece). Even then the position was {{complicated by the fact}} that Lutherans <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> favour of the annulment. Cranmer (and Henry) felt obliged to seek assistance from Strasbourg and Basel, which brought him into contact with the more radical ideas associated with Zwingli.|$|E

The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Panama alerted officials in Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala about the possible impacts from Beta.

5|$|Another {{question}} of contention was the Progress Party's policy on Norwegian {{membership in the}} European Union. Reportedly, Carl I. Hagen wanted to postpone a decision on European Union policy from the national convention to a national board meeting in June. Others <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> favor of this. In an interview, Hagen stated that political parties should not agitate officially for one opinion or the other. He stated an indifference towards EU membership, and that if accessing the Union, Norway could always use a veto against EU policies when needed. Central board member Terje Sæbø submitted a competing resolution which opposed Norwegian membership.|$|E
5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men not wearing military uniform with white feathers (symbolising cowardice). This campaign often went awry, {{as many of the}} men presented with the feathers <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the Rhodesia Herald and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2008, {{a bridge}} {{replacement}} and expansion project got underway on Illinois 22 at the interchange with Interstate 94. This {{was necessary for}} the tollway which travels underneath to be widened to eight lanes. The old bridge, which was five lanes wide, was rebuilt with one that is eight lanes and includes full length dual left turn lanes in both directions. Other benefits are the improved entrances and exits {{to and from the}} interstate, modernized traffic signals, and the use of concrete pavement. The bulk of the work was completed by December 2009, however both sets of dual left turn lanes <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> operation until the following spring.|$|E

5|$|Illingworth was {{selected}} to make his first-class début for Victoria against Tasmania at Kardinia Park in Geelong in February 1962. His selection had generated controversy since he had twice been no-balled for throwing by two different umpires in Melbourne district cricket in the two seasons prior to his selection. One of the occasions in district cricket, he had been no-balled three times in one over. At the time, Tasmania <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the Sheffield Shield competition, {{so it was a}} one-off match.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Ruter {{decided to}} scrap {{all of the}} T2000 wagons, after only 16 years in operation, and ten of the wagons were sold for NOK100,000 a piece to the {{recycling}} company Hellik Teigen at Hokksund. The two remaining wagons will be preserved and displayed at the Oslo Tramway Museum. Ruter stated that it would cost about NOK50 million {{to keep them in}} operation. Nevertheless, Ruter was in 2011 forced by the owner Oslo Vognselskap to keep renting the wagons for 22 million NOK each year, even though they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> operation. Oslo Vognselskap stated the reason behind this was the contract which lasted for 30 years.|$|E
5|$|In August 1792, {{a second}} {{convention}} {{was held in}} Pittsburgh to discuss resistance to the whiskey tax. This meeting was more radical than the first convention; moderates such as Brackenridge and Findley <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> attendance. Future Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin was one moderate who did attend, to his later regret. A militant group known as the Mingo Creek Association dominated the convention and issued radical demands. As {{some of them had}} done in the American Revolution, they raised liberty poles, formed committees of correspondence, and took control of the local militia. They created an extralegal court and discouraged lawsuits for debt collection and foreclosures.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, the Home Office {{published}} a report evaluating {{the effectiveness of}} the Gateway Protection Programme. The research it was based upon focused on refugees' integration into British society in the 18 months following their resettlement. The research found that refugees showed signs of integration, including the formation of social bonds through community groups and places of worship. The report noted that low employment rates and slow progress with acquiring English language skills were particular concerns. Younger refugees and children had made the most progress. No specific language lessons are provided under the Gateway Protection Programme. Instead, Gateway refugees who require help with their English language skills are provided with access to mainstream English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses, which are run by a range of state, voluntary and community-based organisations. However, the International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC) Europe reports that in Sheffield, it can be difficult for resettled refugees to gain access to ESOL classes because demand has generally exceeded supply – a situation also noted by an evaluation of the scheme's operation in Motherwell undertaken in 2013. The Motherwell evaluation found that most of the male refugees were in employment, but that many of them <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> jobs that allowed them to use their skills. The majority of women <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> work, reflecting a lack of job opportunities but also a lack of childcare provision.|$|E

5|$|Information {{obtained}} {{later from}} North Korean prisoners revealed the divisions the Far East Command {{thought to be}} still west of the Naktong had already crossed to the east side and <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the bombed area. No evidence {{was found that the}} bombing killed a single North Korean soldier. However, the bombing appeared to have destroyed a significant number of North Korean artillery batteries, as artillery fire on UN positions waned substantially following the mission. The UN ground and air commanders opposed future massive carpet bombing attacks against enemy tactical troops unless there was precise information on an enemy concentration and the situation was critical. Instead, they recommended fighter-bombers and dive bombers would better support ground forces.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{also changed}} the {{extradition}} policy, allowing extradition for people prosecuted abroad and not facing charges in Argentina. He also supported the requests by {{human rights organizations}} to turn the former detention centers into memorials for the disappeared. Argentina became a signatory of the UN Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity in 2003. A creative interpretation of the convention by the courts allowed them to circumvent the statutory limitations to crimes committed decades in the past, and also the ex post facto applicability of laws that <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> force {{at the time of}} the crimes.|$|E
5|$|Looking to do {{a family}} film, Johnny Depp visited the Walt Disney Studios in 2001 {{when he heard}} of plans to adapt the Pirates of the Caribbean ride into a film.

Depp was cast on June 10, 2002. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer felt Depp would give the film an edge that could draw teenage and adult audiences despite Disney's reputation for soft children's fare.|$|E
