5|$|During his suspension, Ramirez {{was allowed}} to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the Dodgers' {{facilities}} and he trained with Dodger coach Manny Mota. To get back into shape he was allowed a short rehab stint in the minor leagues. Ramirez played two games with the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes, where his appearance led to record crowds for the Isotopes. He played several games with the Single-A Inland Empire 66ers, homering in his first at-bat with the 66ers. Ramirez returned from his suspension and reclaimed his starting role with the Dodgers on July 3 against the San Diego Padres. On July 7, Ramirez was ejected by homeplate umpire John Hirschbeck after throwing his elbow guard in the air after being called out on strikes. Instead of causing conflict, Ramirez walked into the dugout where he remained {{the rest of the}} game.|$|E

Davis worked as a Marketing/PR person for a non-profit organization until November 2011; then she decided to quit her job, so she could concentrate all her efforts into developing her career through YouTube.|$|E

25|$|After the 1997 season, Moss {{decided to}} go pro. He {{did not have a}} good offseason. Moss's past issues were laid out for all to see, and {{questions}} of his character began to rise. Moss was expected to be the most watched contestant of the NFL Combine, but he did not show up. Rumors swirled that the reason for his absence was to avoid the drug test. Moss opted to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the Marshall pro day, where scouts from nearly every NFL team came to watch him work out. Moss turned in a legendary performance, running the 40 yard dash in just 4.25 seconds, despite running into the wind. He also posted a 39-inch vertical leap while catching nearly every pass thrown. Scouts for the Dallas Cowboys, who had the 8th overall pick and were greatly interested in Moss, told owner Jerry Jones that Moss was the greatest individual prospect they had ever seen.|$|E
500|$|Kafka {{was invited}} to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the first NFL veteran combine on March 22, 2015. The veteran combine was created {{as a way for}} {{unemployed}} players to potentially work their way back into the league by going through drills in front of NFL scouts and coaches. Daniel Jeremiah of NFL Network said that he has [...] "never seen [...] throw it as well as he did on the field" [...] and that he expected Kafka to sign with a team following his workout. The Minnesota Vikings signed Kafka to a one-year contract worth $660,000 on April 1, 2015. He was expected to compete with rookie undrafted signee Taylor Heinicke for the third quarterback job behind starter Teddy Bridgewater and backup Shaun Hill.|$|E
500|$|Bryan Singer {{first read}} Apt Pupil {{when he was}} 19 years old, and {{when he became a}} director, he wanted to adapt the novella into a film. In 1995, Singer asked his friend and screenwriter Brandon Boyce to write a spec script {{adapting}} the novella. [...] Boyce recalled the writing process, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} stageplay, actually... two people, pretty much in a house talking. [...] My script was completely on spec, so, if it didn't <b>work</b> <b>out,</b> <b>at</b> least I'd have a writing sample." [...] When the original option to the novella expired in 1995, Stephen King sued to get the rights back. Singer and Boyce then provided to King a first draft of their script and a copy of Singer's film The Usual Suspects (1995), which had yet to be publicly released. Impressed with Singer, King optioned the rights to the director for $1, arranging to be compensated when the film was released. Singer said of King's ultimate response to the film, despite some changes made to the source material, [...] "Stephen loved it. He seemed to think I captured the mood of the piece." [...] The director appreciated being able to make a Stephen King horror film but with less supernatural terror and more character-driven terror. Singer spoke of his goal: [...] "There have been a lot of fun horror movies like Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. But I miss movies like The Shining, The Exorcist, and The Innocents by Jack Clayton, so this is a movie sort of in the spirit of the real horror movie." ...|$|E

60|$|If English {{literature}} {{were really}} taught in schools, and the eldest boys had received training {{that brought them}} in their last school- year to {{a knowledge of the}} changes of intellectual fashion that set their outward mark upon successive periods, there is no prose writing of Dryden that could be used by a teacher more instructively than these Discourses on Satire and on Epic Poetry. They illustrate abundantly both Dryden and his time, and give continuous occasion for discussion of first principles, whether in disagreement or agreement with the text. Dryden was on his own ground as a critic of satire; and the ideal of an epic that the times, and perhaps also the different bent of his own genius, would not allow him to <b>work</b> <b>out,</b> <b>at</b> least finds such expression as might be expected from a man who had high aspirations, and whose place, in times unfavourable to his highest aims, was still among the master-poets of the world.|$|E
60|$|That means {{four hundred}} or more subsidized authors for Great Britain, which would work out, perhaps, as {{eighteen}} or twenty every year, and a proportionate number for America and the Colonial States of the British Empire. Suppose, further, that from this general body of authors we draw every year {{four or five}} of the seniors to form a sort of Academy, a higher stage of honour and income; this would probably give something under a hundred on this higher stage. Taking the income of the two stages as £1000 and £2000 respectively, this would <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> about £500,000 a year for Great Britain--a quite trivial addition to what is already spent on educational work. A scheme that would provide for widows and children whose education was unfinished, and for the official printing and sale of correct texts of the books written, would still fall within the dimensions of a million pounds. I am assuming this will be done quite in addition to the natural growth of Universities and Colleges, to the evolution of great text-books and criticism, and to the organization and publication of special research in science and letters. This is to be an endowment specifically for unspecialized literature, for untechnical philosophy that is, and the creative imagination.|$|E
60|$|Distribution, however, is {{only the}} {{beginning}} of the problem. There is the more difficult issue of getting books and papers printed and published. And here we come to an intricate puzzle in reconciling the indisputable need for untrammelled individual expression on the one hand with public ownership on the other, and also with the difficult riddle how authors may be supported under Socialist conditions. It is not within the design of this book to do more than indicate a possible solution. These are problems the Socialist has still to <b>work</b> <b>out.</b> <b>At</b> present authors with business shrewdness and the ability to be interesting get an income from the sale of their books, and it seems possible that they might continue to be paid in that way under Socialism. It is difficult outside the field of specialist work (which under any social system has to be endowed in relation to colleges and universities) to find any other just way of discriminating between the author who ought to get a living from writing, and the author who has no reasonable claim to do so. But under Socialism, in addition to the private publisher or altogether replacing him, {{there will have to be}} some sort of public publisher.|$|E
