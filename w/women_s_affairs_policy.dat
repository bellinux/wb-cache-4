40|$|THE OVERALL SITUATION OF FEMALE STREET CHILDREN (11 18 YEARS) ENGAGED IN COMMERCIAL SEX WORK IN DIRE DAWA - ETHIOPIA (SURVEY IN CASE STUDY WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO CHILD PROSTITUTION) By MELKAM LENGEREH MEKURIA 2004 A THESIS SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MASTER OF PHILOSOPHY IN SPECIAL NEEDS EDUCATION UNIVERSITY OF OSLO FACULTY OF EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OF SPECIAL NEEDS EDUCATION ABSTRACT Prostitution {{in general}} and child {{prostitution}} in particular as a major social problem is a common phenomenon for many countries in the world. Different causes can propel children towards street life and street activities. One of the street activities available for female street children is prostitution. As one of the underdeveloped and poor countries, economic problem in Ethiopia is the major cause for child prostitution. The strong relationship between poverty and prostitution is stated as, {{as long as there}} is poverty, prostitution will exist. As long as the root is wet, the tree survives (Gedu, 1995, p. 12). Though poverty is the major reason for child prostitution, it can not be the only cause. For this reason, the study was attempted to look into the overall situation of female street children (11 18) engaged in prostitution in Dire Dawa town Ethiopia. In conducting this descriptive research, the two main objectives were; identifying if street child prostitutes have their own special educational needs or not and to expose their overall situation to the rest of the society. Their overall situation in this study is all about their general background, their current situations and the possible consequences of child prostitution. In studying the overall situation of street child prostitutes, triangulation of methods as well as designs were implemented. In this regard, the combination of two designs (survey and case study) was used. The different methods implemented in the study are interview, questionnaire, focus group discussion and informal observation. Instruments such as interview guide, questionnaires, focus group discussion guide and log book were used for data collection. The number of informants participated in the study were 62 street child prostitutes, 2 key persons from the society and an expert from <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>affair</b> office. The findings of the study revealed that poverty is the major cause for street child prostitution. However, it is not the only cause of street child prostitution as other causes were identified in the study. It is also shown in the study that children engaged in street prostitution have their own special educational needs as they all are not enrolled to school currently. Moreover, the different consequences of child prostitution were addressed in the study. Finally, based on the findings of the study, it is concluded that, street child prostitution in Dire Dawa is survival prostitution. At the end, recommendations which are directed towards the society, the family, government and NGOs are made so that the problem of child prostitution can at least be curtailed if not eliminated...|$|R

They include access to education and finance, and grasping the use of new information and communication technologies. Many women have already opened up the traditional mindsets which have denied even the principle of gender equality and have thus condemned women to a secondary position in society. Others are following suit, and more will join them. There s nothing new in women entrepreneurs, but there s more to genderisation than income-generation Illustration: J. Florentin Across the ACP countries, women {{are coming out of}} their enforced invisibility. Through a tide of conference resolutions, commissions and fora over the decades, an awareness has grown of their economic and social role. Gender is now mentioned in all the speeches about development, and the notion of gender, which embraces a strategy to integrate women in development, is sowing its seeds just about everywhere. The Year of the Woman in 1975 triggered off a movement which the international <b>women</b> <b>s</b> conference in Beijing in 1995 transformed into an unstoppable force. Women are, literally, on the march. True, they are not all marching to the same drum, and although many are lagging behind, more and more women are coming out of isolation and holding hands behind slogans, in the belief that power comes through unity. Or so, at least, it would appear. There are still flagrant differences between urban and rural women, between wives and widows, between secretaries in the office and the self-effacing just housewives in the village, and between women in Africa and their sisters in the Caribbean or the Pacific. These disparities are pinned down by the weight of traditions, often with the complicity of women, and of history, religion and culture. Even the terminology used to discuss women in the context of development or power says a lot about the different mentalities and the degree of dynamism at play in gender issues. In the English-speaking world, the favoured term seems to be Women in development whereas French-speaking stakeholders talk more of Femmes et développement (women and development). Some talk of empowerment, others of access to power. It is more than a question of the subtleties of language: are women really in power or do they just skirt around it, stuck in governmental bodies which are usually seen as mere coordination mechanisms? There has been, it must be said, a blossoming of ministries for <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> <b>Affairs,</b> and for the Family, or Social action or National solidarity in some ACP countries. They are headed by women, of course, but surely women, and rural women above all, should be present, or at least represented, in all ministries and all areas of economic and political decision-making. Clearly, progress has to be made. Training is the key to empowerment Illustration: J. Florentin Spreading the word Whether they are farmers, traders or food processors, we know that ACP women are rightly seen as one of the essential levers of development; and yet they are, paradoxically, faced with major barriers such as access to credit and land. Take the case of Honduras and Costa Rica, where 28 % of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> applications for land rights have been granted, compared with 61 % for men. In Jamaica only 5 % of loans made by the agricultural bank go to women, although in fairness private credit operations such as the Self-Start Fund and Solidarity are more responsive to <b>women</b> <b>s</b> requests. In Suriname, women do {{not have the right to}} receive loans directly, and transactions have to pass through their husband or a relation. In Africa, women are still often regarded as an item to be inherited: like the land they toil, they are passed down from the hands of a deceased husband to the hands of a brother-in-law. Not content with waiting for fundamental reforms, some women are already following another, parallel route alongside that of public bodies. These women have graduated from secondary school or higher education. They often come from well-placed families. They know their way around the world of NGOs and donor agencies, and have become journalists, company directors and heads of local radio stations. Their efforts are slowly spreading into the villages, where women are coming to appreciate the meaning of 'united we stand, divided we fall'.
