25|$|Twitty {{said that}} she vowed to share her story shortly {{following}} her daughter's disappearance, {{in the hope that}} other families would not suffer what she had to go through. After searchers had spent five months in an unsuccessful quest to find Natalee, her attorney John Q. Kelly took over the case and she spent the next two years traveling to various high schools and colleges to present messages about personal safety. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> about reaching more travelers with her story, Twitty said that her efforts evolved into writing a book.|$|E
25|$|Wuornos told several {{inconsistent}} {{stories about}} the killings. She claimed initially that all seven men had raped her while she {{was working as a}} prostitute but later recanted the claim of self-defense, citing robbery and a desire to leave no witnesses as the reason for murder. During an interview with filmmaker Nick Broomfield, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the cameras were off, she told him that it was, in fact, self-defense, but she could not stand being on death row—where she had been for ten years at that point—and wanted to die.|$|E
60|$|Polly {{had always}} loved kind Mr. Shaw, but now she {{respected}} him heartily, and felt {{that she had not}} done him justice <b>when</b> <b>she</b> sometimes <b>thought</b> that he only cared for making money.|$|R
2500|$|Rowling {{explained}} that Harry's image {{came to her}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first <b>thought</b> up Harry Potter, seeing him as a [...] "scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy". She also mentioned that she thinks Harry's glasses are the clue to his vulnerability.|$|R
60|$|Oh! how {{she missed}} the silent and {{thoughtful}} friend who in those days of pride and of joy had angered her so, because he seemed to stand for conscience and for prudence, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> only <b>thought</b> of happiness and of love.|$|R
25|$|Ström {{headed off}} towards Åby to inform {{them of the}} {{accident}} and met Mr. Andersson, a track walker. From a nearby house, Andersson called Åby and notified them of the accident. Track walker Eriksson arrived from his house east of the accident site. His wife had lowered the boom barrier at the railway crossing and was standing {{and waiting for the}} train <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it sounded as if the train had stopped, so Eriksson quickly went {{to the site of the}} derailment. Once he saw that the telegraph poles were aslant, he knew that something serious had occurred. Upon seeing that the train had derailed, he hurried to Getå Halt to notify Krokek Station what had occurred.|$|E
25|$|Working with Mona and Sara, {{the girls}} finally {{infiltrate}} A's lair, where they discover a live feed of Alison coming {{face to face}} with Charles, who is revealed to be CeCe Drake. CeCe then begins to explain her story and motives, revealing that she was born as Charles, but was not accepted by her father for believing she was a girl. She was sent to Radley, where she eventually transitioned into Charlotte. She also explains what led to Mrs. Cavanaugh's death at the hands of Bethany Young, her complicated relationship with Bethany and her subsequent death, the events regarding the night Alison disappeared, the deal she made with Mona, the events at the burning lodge, Wilden's death, the events in New York, and their mother's death. She explained that she did everything just to be closer to her family, and she became 'A' <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that the Liars were happy about Alison's 'death', so she wanted to make them suffer for it but couldn't stop the game because she grew obsessed with it. Cece also reveals that Sara is both the other Red Coat and The Black Widow, working under CeCe's orders, leaving Emily distraught. CeCe heads for the roof to commit suicide (after her bomb attempt fails and Emily subdues Sara), but Alison and the girls convince her to stop, saying they now understand why she became 'A'. CeCe then surrenders and declares the game over. On Labor Day weekend, the girls say goodbye as they are leaving for college except for Alison who stays in Rosewood.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} island, Kate is famous {{as one of}} the Oceanic Six. [...] She is tried for her {{numerous}} crimes committed before the crash and pleads not guilty. [...] Because Kate is opposed to bringing her son into the trial, Jack is called in as a character witness. [...] He lies in his testimony, saying that Flight 815 crashed in the water, eight survived the crash, but two have since died and Kate was primarily responsible for the Oceanic Six's survival. [...] Kate speaks with her mother Diane Janssen (Beth Broderick) {{for the first time in}} four years. [...] Diane is no longer angry at Kate because her perspective changed <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that Kate had died in the plane crash. [...] When Diane, the prosecution's star witness, no longer wants to testify against her daughter, the District Attorney makes a plea deal: Kate gets ten years probation, but must stay in the state of California. [...] Jack meets Kate in the parking garage. He admits that he still loves her (in contrast to his false testimony under oath on her behalf) and asks to go out for coffee with her. [...] Kate responds that they cannot go out until he is willing to visit her baby. [...] It is then revealed that Kate is raising Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) son Aaron (William Blanchette) as her own.|$|E

25|$|Some {{newly married}} brides suffer {{domestic}} {{violence in the}} form of harassment, physical abuse or death <b>when</b> <b>she</b> is <b>thought</b> to have not brought enough dowry with marriage.

500|$|Although {{she worked}} well into her seventh month, Cardinale's {{pregnancy}} was kept a tight secret. Tormented by thoughts of suicide, {{she fell into}} a state of depression. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> she could no longer hide her condition, she asked Cristaldi to terminate her contract. Understanding her predicament, he sent her to London for the birth, far away from the press. He simply explained that she had gone to England to learn English for a film. Cristaldi told Cardinale not to reveal her condition as she would be betraying the public and it would put an end to her career. So as to maintain the secret, he drew up a detailed American-style contract covering every little detail of her life, depriving her of any possibility of acting on her own behalf. Cardinale explained: [...] "I was no longer master of my own body or thoughts. Even talking with a friend about anything that could make me look different from my public image was risky, {{as if it had been}} publicized, I would have been in trouble. Everything was in the hands of Vides". For seven years, Cardinale kept her secret, not only from the public, but also from her own son, Patrick, who grew up in the family with her parents and sister more or less as a brother until the day Enzo Biagi, a journalist, discovered the truth. After Cardinale decided to tell him everything, he published her story in [...] Oggi and L'Europeo.|$|E
2500|$|A {{turning point}} for Mashinini came <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> about how {{clothing}} produced in her factory was being used. [...] "When I realized that I had personally helped to make these uniforms used for the slaughter of my people ... I felt horrified", she wrote in her autobiography. She resolved that union organising would always touch on larger political issues.|$|E
2500|$|In a third set of {{psychological}} assessments, more detailed {{than the previous}} two, three of four psychiatrists concluded that she was [...] "malingering" [...] (faking her symptoms of mental illness) and that she behaved normally <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the assessors were not looking. One suggested that this was to prevent criminal prosecution and to improve her chances of being returned to Pakistan. In April 2009, Manhattan federal judge Richard Berman held that she [...] "may have some mental health issues" [...] but was competent to stand trial.|$|E
50|$|Ironside's {{students}} included Bill Gibb, Ossie Clark, Zandra Rhodes, Moya Bowler, Janice Wainwright, Sally Tuffin and Marion Foale. She {{introduced a}} menswear course and was laughed at <b>when</b> <b>she</b> said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> Mick Jagger stylish. Antony Price, a student on the menswear course, {{went on to}} create the suited look favoured by Bryan Ferry and others. When the College was given the power to award degrees, however, her School of Fashion was excluded. After Ironside lost her post in 1968, according to her daughter in her book Janey and Me, there followed a downward spiral of alcohol abuse and depression.|$|R
60|$|The {{old woman}} {{returned}} to her kitchen, and falling upon her knees remained for some time {{in a state of}} grateful, pious ecstasy. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> arose <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of those other women, and, snatching a shawl from its peg behind the door, ran up the deserted street with her tidings.|$|R
2500|$|Amnesty's {{international}} secretariat Policy Director, Anne Fitzgerald, <b>when</b> {{asked if}} <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> Begg {{was a human}} rights advocate, said: “It’s something you’d have {{to speak to him}} about. I don’t have the information to answer that.” ...|$|R
2500|$|A {{story is}} {{recorded}} of Ní Mháille chiding her son Tíoboíd {{in the course}} of an attack on Kinturk Castle, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> he was shirking the battle: [...] "An ag iarraidh dul i bhfolach ar mo thóin atá tú, an áit a dtáinig tú as?" [...] ("Are you trying to hide in my arse, the place that you came out of?"). She is also recorded as saying with regard to her followers [...] "go mb'fhearr léi lán loinge de chlann Chonraoi agus de chlann Mhic an Fhailí ná lán loinge d'ór" [...] (that she would rather have a shipload of Conroys and MacAnallys than a shipload of gold).|$|E
2500|$|Her {{schooling}} was erratic: {{she attended}} seven different schools, for a cumulative total of just four years, ending {{when she was}} fifteen. [...] Her mother was not affectionate with her children. To keep them from getting hurt as she had been, she forbade her children to make strong friendships or read fiction. In her autobiography, The Living of Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Gilman wrote that her mother showed affection only <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> her young daughter was asleep. Although she lived a childhood of isolated, impoverished loneliness, she unknowingly prepared herself for the life that lay ahead by frequently visiting the public library and studying ancient civilizations on her own. Additionally, her father's love for literature influenced her, and years later he contacted her {{with a list of}} books he felt would be worthwhile for her to read.|$|E
2500|$|General Manager of {{his family}} {{bathroom}} fixture business Hao Sheng [...] Cold and hot tempered, all of his employees are terrified of him.

He cares deeply {{of his family}} and is very protective of them. He has been in love with Yang Yi-ru since meeting her in college and searching for her ever since. For anyone that crosses him he makes sure there is payback, even if it's the girl he loves. After his misunderstanding is cleared with Yi-ru, he tries hard to change his cold-hearted attitude to win her love. He eventually convinces Yi-ru that his love for her is sincere and they get married for real <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> she had almost lost him during an accident.|$|E
5000|$|Jack {{tried to}} prevent Sydney from {{discovering}} {{the truth about}} her mother. He was forced to reveal the truth to Sydney <b>when</b> <b>she</b> mistakenly <b>thought</b> {{that he had been}} a KGB mole.

5000|$|On October 18, 2012, Miley Cyrus {{spoke about}} the song with Ryan Seacrest. <b>When</b> asked if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the song was about her, she responded, “I don’t know who else is getting married…so I feel like that’s pretty blatant, it’s whatever.” ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{had been}} down so little all that winter, twice {{for a couple}} of days' shooting, once for a week-end, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> him looking thinner and rather worn.

Upon their return to Walford, Leon attempts to make amends with Zsa Zsa {{but she says she}} preferred it <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> he was dead.|$|E
60|$|She turned upon me {{abruptly}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> her step-mother {{was beyond}} ear-shot.|$|E
60|$|So on that {{understanding}} she came. A month later {{my mother asked}} her <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the marriage would actually take place.|$|E
60|$|At {{the moment}} she was chagrined by the remark, though she {{accepted}} it in silence; but later, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> the matter over, she took from it infinite pleasure. This was indeed to share man's ideas and to think with the workings of man's mind. It encouraged her to further and larger ideas, and to a greater toleration than she had hitherto dreamed of.|$|R
60|$|Then the {{daughter}} said to Elsa, 'Fear nothing, my mother {{will be your}} friend. I saw {{by the way she}} looked that she would grant your request <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> over it,' and, telling Elsa to wait, she entered the house to seek her mother. Elsa meanwhile was tossed about between hope and fear, and felt as if the girl would never come.|$|R
60|$|He hesitated. He {{felt that}} she was {{creeping}} back again into his life <b>when</b> he <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was gone out of it for ever. She watched him with sickening anxiety.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly the {{old lady}} raised her hands and clasped them. It was a usual gesture <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of {{something}} she ought to do.|$|E
60|$|She clenched, {{her hands}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of Margaret. It was monstrous {{that she should}} have caused such havoc in that good, strong man.|$|E
60|$|They {{were again}} silent; but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that his emotion had subsided, she again {{recalled}} their consideration {{to the object}} of their interview.|$|E
6000|$|... "But my {{good mother}} was wiser than I, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> much <b>she</b> remembered the {{butterflies}} upon the beautiful scarf, and how my husband, Don Arturo, had delighted to behold them glistening {{in the sunlight}} when I first wore the shawl to my bridal; how, afterwards, he insisted that his children should first be shown to his household wrapped in the splendid gift of his grandmother. Wisely she remembered these things, and when, weeks after, I asked her {{the name of my}} child, I wept for joy <b>when</b> <b>she</b> said, 'She is Mariposilla.'" ...|$|R
2500|$|Rowling {{herself was}} {{supportive}} of Watson {{after her first}} screen test. <b>When</b> asked if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> actors suited the characters, Rowling said, [...] "Yes, I did.

60|$|Sarah had {{something}} better now {{to take her}} mind back to Sardis and the people and things on dry land. The engagement and probably early marriage of Mr. Clewe and Mrs. Raleigh had made a great impression upon her, and there were days <b>when</b> <b>she</b> never <b>thought</b> of the pole, so busy was she in making plans based upon the future connection {{of the life of}} herself and Sammy and that of Mr. and Mrs. Clewe.|$|R
