5|$|Stone bridge {{construction}} {{started with the}} excavation of foundations for the abutments. Then a temporary structure known as a center or centering would be built of wood or iron. This structure supported the stone arch during construction. Once the stone arch was built, the spandrel walls and <b>wing</b> <b>walls</b> could be added. Then the road bed was built, with fill (loose stones or dirt) added to support it as needed. Wall and arch stones were generally set in place dry to ensure a good fit, then set in mortar. Once the bridge was complete and the mortar had properly hardened, the center was gradually lowered and then removed. In March 1996, after standing for between 156 and 121 years, the arch of Bridge No. 3 finally collapsed.|$|E
25|$|On {{the stone}} wall, (in {{the same way}} as Milecastles,) {{additional}} structures known as <b>Wing</b> <b>Walls</b> were incorporated on the east and west side, allowing bonding to the curtain wall. This is interpreted as evidence that turrets (and milecastles) were constructed before the curtain wall. Where turrets were built with the intention of bonding to a broad gauge curtain wall, they were given broad <b>wing</b> <b>walls.</b> However, there are many cases where the curtain wall actually constructed was of narrow gauge, giving a point of reduction where the curtain wall and turret <b>wing</b> <b>walls</b> join. To facilitate bonding with the curtain wall, <b>wing</b> <b>walls</b> were constructed longer at the base, and stepping inwards as they were built upwards. Turrets thought to have been constructed later in the plan were built with much shorter <b>wing</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E

Most stone arch bridges have solid parapets without decoration; this bridge's parapet crenellation was an ornamental feature.

500|$|Canterbury Castle was {{a private}} , three-story house located in Arlington Heights near Washington Park, {{offering}} views of downtown Portland. Constructed from basalt stone quarried from Rocky Butte, the house featured characteristics of a castle such as a moat, a drawbridge and a copper-topped turret. The wooden drawbridge covered a moat seven feet wide by more than three feet deep. A single-car garage, built into the hillside, was constructed {{during the same time}} as the house. The concrete foundation supported a rectangular ground plan. Canterbury featured [...] "buttressing <b>wing</b> <b>walls,</b> cylindrical corner bays and a crenellated parapet of uncut stone". Round, arched and straight-topped frameless windows were often fitted with steel sashes. Doorways were also frameless, narrow and round or parabolic in shape. Doors had wrought iron hinges, handles and lock plates. The leaded glass slit window at the stair tower's top level featured a spiderweb pattern, a signature element of castle designer Jeter O. Frye's work. Windmill palms surrounding the property added to its exotic appearance.|$|E

The river passes under the Avoncliff and Dundas Aqueducts and at Freshford is joined by the Somerset River Frome.

40|$|In buildings, 60 % of {{the energy}} {{consumption}} is associated to Heating, Ventilation and Air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. One solution to reduce this share is the application of natural ventilation systems. Windcatcher and <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> are two well-known techniques for natural ventilation which {{have been used in}} different regions. Nevertheless, in areas with low wind speed such as the tropical climate of Malaysia there is hesitation for application of natural ventilation systems. The integration of windcatcher with <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> can potentially enhance the ventilation performance. However, this configuration was not looked into by pervious investigations thus, this study aims to address this research gap by first evaluating the effect of <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> with various angles on the ventilation performance and second compare the performance of this new design with a conventional windcatcher. This research used two main investigative steps: experimental scaled wind tunnel testing and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. Four reduced-scale models of two-sided windcatcher were tested in a low speed wind tunnel. Three models were integrated with <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> in 30 °, 45 ° and 60 ° incident angles and another windcatcher was a conventional two-sided windcatcher, which is typical in regions with predominant wind direction. The CFD validation against experiment showed good agreement. The best operation was observed in the windcatcher with 30 ° <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> angle which could supply 910 l/s fresh air into the room in 2. 5 m/s wind speed. Hence, the new design had 50 % more ventilation performance comparing with conventional two-sided windcatcher in the same external wind speed.

Sometimes cantilevered walls are buttressed on the front, or include a counterfort on the back, to improve their strength resisting high loads.
