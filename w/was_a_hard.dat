5|$|Holmes <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> working midfielder who possessed {{skill and}} could make neat passes, {{although}} he had been criticised for lacking in physical strength and tackling. He preferred to play as a central midfielder, although was able {{to play on the}} left side of midfield and was equally comfortable playing with either foot.|$|E

5|$|After the {{graduation}} of running backs Ball and Lattimore, Scott competed with Morgan Green for the starting position. At {{the conclusion of}} spring practice, it appeared they would share the duties, as they had complementary running styles: Scott had breakaway speed, while Green <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> runner for short-yardage gains. However, Green suffered a quadriceps injury that caused him to fall to the third-string position behind true freshman Davin Meggett.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>hard</b> limit <b>is</b> {{something}} that must not <b>be</b> done. Violating <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> limit <b>is</b> often considered <b>a</b> just cause for ending a scene {{or even a}} relationship. Examples include “scat <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> limit for me” or “I have a back injury, so striking on the back <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> limit”.|$|R

5|$|These successes {{established}} Steinitz {{as one of}} the world's top players, and he {{was able}} to arrange a match in 1866 in London against Adolf Anderssen, who was regarded as the world's strongest active player because he had won the 1851 and 1862 London International Tournaments and his one superior, Paul Morphy, had retired from competitive chess. Steinitz won with eight wins and six losses (there were no draws), but it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> fight; after 12 games the scores were level at 6–6, then Steinitz won the last two games.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the decline of Bristol's Iceland trade for 'stockfish' (freeze dried cod) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> blow to the local economy, encouraging Bristol merchants to turn west, launching unsuccessful voyages of exploration in the Atlantic by 1480 in search of the phantom island of Hy-Brazil. More recent research, however, has shown that the Iceland trade was never more than a minor part of Bristol's overseas trade and that the English fisheries off Iceland actually increased during the late 15th and 16th centuries. In 1487, when king Henry VII visited the city, the inhabitants complained about their economic decline. Such complaints, however, were not uncommon among corporations that wished to avoid paying taxes, or which hoped to secure concessions from the Crown. In reality, Bristol's customs accounts show that the port's trade was growing strongly during the last two decades of the fifteenth century. In great part this was due of the increase of trade with Spain.|$|E
5|$|The King's {{capitulation}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> {{blow for}} Kościuszko, {{who had not}} lost a single battle in the campaign. By mid-September 1792 he was resigned to leaving the country, and in early October he departed from Warsaw. First he went east, to the Czartoryski family manor at Sieniawa, which gathered various malcontents. In mid-November he spent two weeks in Lwów (in Ukrainian, Lviv; in German, Lemberg), where he was welcomed by the populace; since the war's end, his presence had drawn crowds eager to see the famed commander. Izabela Czartoryska discussed having him marry her daughter Zofia. The Russians planned to arrest him if he returned to territory under their control; the Austrians, who held Lwów, offered him a commission in the Austrian Army, which he turned down. Subsequently they planned to deport him, but he left Lwów before they could do so. At {{the turn of the}} month, he stopped in Zamość at the Zamoyskis' estate, met Stanisław Staszic, then went on to Puławy.|$|E

5|$|The loss of Kronan <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> {{blow for}} Sweden during the Scanian War. Besides being {{the largest and}} most heavily armed ship in the Swedish Navy, she had been an {{important}} status symbol for the monarchy of the young Charles XI. Along with Kronan, the navy lost a sizeable proportion of its best manpower, acting supreme commander Lorentz Creutz, numerous high-ranking fleet officers, and the chief of the navy medical staff. A commission was set up to investigate whether any individuals could be held responsible for the Swedish fiasco at the Battle of Öland and other major defeats during the war. Although no one was officially held accountable, Creutz has been blamed by many historians for the sinking of Kronan because of his naval and command inexperience. Recent research has provided a more nuanced picture, and points to Sweden's general lack of a well-developed naval organization and officer corps at the time.|$|E
25|$|Smith <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> hitting {{right-handed}} batsman {{and made}} 45 known appearances in first-class matches {{up to the}} 1820 season. His career spanned the Napoleonic Wars which had a detrimental effect on the game and so reduced his opportunities for playing.|$|E

25|$|Tiffany's career {{suffered}} as musical tastes {{changed in the}} early 1990s, swinging away from dance-pop and towards harder-edged rock and rap. This was shown in her third album, the urban-influenced New Inside. It was her first album away from Tobin, {{and some of her}} fans felt the new soulful, sultrier Tiffany <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> sell. New Inside received mixed reviews from critics, but was successful in Japan.|$|E
25|$|The first Asian probe {{that was}} part of a lunar landing program was the Indian Moon Impact Probe (MIP) {{released}} from Chandrayaan-1 in 2008. MIP <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> lander and was designed to move the ground under for research purposes. MIP was designed to be destroyed at impact. Its instruments performed lunar observations to within 25 minutes before impact. The landing test will be applied to future soft landings such as Chandrayaan-2, planned for 2016.|$|E

25|$|The loss {{of two of}} the Olympic-class ships <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> blow to White Star Line, {{which was}} losing investment. The Treaty of Versailles settled part of this problem as Germany had to cede some of its ocean liners as war reparation, two of which were given to the company. The first, the Bismarck, renamed Majestic, {{replaced}} the Britannic. The second, the Columbus, renamed the Homeric, compensated for other ships lost in the conflict.|$|E
25|$|As Fiji {{was not a}} Test nation {{during his}} time, his {{official}} games were limited to two tours of New Zealand. Bula <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> hitter of the ball, and {{was said to have}} scored a century in an hour against Canterbury on his second tour in 1953–54. He also hit 22 sixes in a club match at Suva in 1958 in which he scored 246, the highest total in domestic Fijian cricket.|$|E
25|$|The First World War <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> {{time for}} the liners. Some of them, like the Mauretania, Aquitania, and Britannic were {{transformed}} into hospital ships during the conflict. Others became troop transports, while some, such as the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, participated in the war as warships. Troop transportation was very popular due to the liners' large size. Liners converted into troop ships were painted in dazzle camouflage {{to reduce the risk}} of being torpedoed by enemy submarines.|$|E

25|$|The {{successor}} to Albert Sing had large shoes to fill; average performance {{was no longer}} acceptable to the discriminating Bernese supporters. Heinz Bigler and Hans Grütter took over the training until Hans Merkle ultimately succeeded Sing. Merkle had the misfortune to be measured against the championships of his predecessor. Although Geni Meier, Ernst Wechselberger and other players from the championship years continued to play, it mattered little. Merkle <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> coach of the German school, however, {{and was able to}} keep YB in {{the top half of the}} table, with finishes of second, fifth, and seventh. The mixture of old and young players did not provide the results the Bernese sought, however.|$|E
25|$|Central to {{the myth}} {{and the reality}} of the West is the American cowboy. His real life <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> one and {{revolved}} around two annual roundups, spring and fall, the subsequent drives to market, and the time off in the cattle towns spending his hard earned money on food, clothing, gambling, and prostitution. During winter, many cowboys hired themselves out to ranches near the cattle towns, where they repaired and maintained equipment and buildings. For young cowboys and buckaroos, working cattle was not just a job but also a lifestyle, one that was lived in the freedom of the outdoors and, most of the time, on horseback. On a long drive, there was usually one cowboy for each 250 head of cattle. Alcohol was everywhere in the West (outside Mormondom), but on the trail the cowboys were forbidden to drink it. Often, hired cowboys were trained and knowledgeable in their trade such as herding, ranching and protecting cattle. To protect their herd from wild animals, hostile Indians and rustlers, cowboys carried with them their iconic weaponry such as the Bowie knife, lasso, bullwhip, pistols, rifles and shotguns.|$|E
25|$|Shortly thereafter, {{they were}} {{transferred}} to Shpalernaya prison, where they would remain {{for most of their}} incarceration. Here each had his own private cell, if only seven feet long and three feet wide. Their only furniture <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> iron bed. The Grand Dukes were permitted to exercise a half-hour to 45 minutes twice a day, although the personal contact allowed in Vologda was denied them here at first. Their wardens, all of whom were soldiers, treated them well; they even helped the grand dukes smuggle out letters. After several days they were all allowed to gather in the courtyard and were permitted some provisions from the outside such as fresh linens and cigarettes. Their day began at 7 am when they were awakened by the steps in the hall of their jailers and the clank of their keys in the door. Lunch was served at noon, which consisted of dirty hot water with a few fish bones on it and black bread. The lights were turned on in the cells at 7 pm, although as the winter approached, the prisoners had to sit in darkness until that time. The meetings of the grand dukes during exercise gave them opportunity to exchange a few words.|$|E
