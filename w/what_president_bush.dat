40|$|This article {{appeared}} in Strategic Insights (February 2003), v. 2 no. 2 At {{a time when}} the talk of war against Iraq is so casually bandied about in the United States, Elliot A. Cohen's book, Supreme Command, is timely and essential reading for supporters and opponents of that war. Cohen studies four great statesmen [...] Abraham Lincoln, Georges Clemenceau, Winston Churchill, and David Ben Gurion. One of his major conclusions is that they succeeded in their role because they immersed themselves in the conduct of war; they mastered their military briefs as thoroughly as they did their civilian ones; and they demanded and expected from their military subordinates a candor as bruising as it was necessary. While the study of those leaders is significant for the current and future generations of leaders, it is equally important to examine how President George W. Bush conducts himself in the seemingly definite war against Iraq. He has the benefit of Cohen's sage observations, since he is reported to have read Supreme Command. Applying the preceding to the Iraqi situation Bush currently faces, the need for having a clear strategic concept [...] I prefer the phrase strategic purpose [...] is vital. We do not know <b>what</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> has learned from Cohen's book, and what lessons he has drawn from it for his upcoming involvement in a military campaign against Iraq.

40|$|Does {{it matter}} if massive arsenals of {{chemical}} and biological weapons and missiles are not found in Iraq? asks Geoffrey Barker in this extract from his new book, Sexing It Up: Iraq, Intelligence and Australia DESPITE belatedly acknowledged errors and exaggerations in US, British and Australian claims about Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction, the Iraqi dictator’s brutal record made him an unquestionably desirable target for elimination. He had used chemical weapons again Iran in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980 s (when the US turned a blind eye and supported Iraq); he had used chemical weapons against Kurds in Northern Iraq. After he was expelled from Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf war he was ordered by the UN to disarm, but for twelve years he failed to cooperate. At the same time Saddam maintained a regime of terror, turned Iraq into an international pariah and wrecked the country’s economy. In 1998 he ousted UN weapons inspectors from Iraq and the international community moved to contain him with economic sanctions and no-fly zones policed by US and British pilots. Under mounting international pressure, with US and British forces massing on his borders, Saddam Hussein agreed in September 2002 to the unconditional return of UN weapons inspectors. Two months later, the UN passed resolution 1441 declaring Saddam in material breach of previous resolutions and giving him ‘a final opportunity’ to comply with UN demands or face war. As Hans Blix prepared to lead teams of inspectors back to Iraq, Iraq declared itself ‘devoid of weapons of mass destruction’ and submitted a 12, 000 -page report on its weapons programs which was widely seen as a tactic to confuse the UN rather than cooperate with it. Iraq also said it had come close to possessing nuclear technology, but that it had no nuclear weapons. Blix’s teams, called ‘spies’ by Saddam in January 2003, found some sixteen empty missile warheads. In mixed reports to the UN between January and March 2003, Blix moved from expressing concern about whether Iraq accepted the need to disarm to suggesting that Iraq had finally decided to cooperate. Blix said he wanted more time. At the same time the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, reported that {{there was no evidence of}} Iraq having nuclear abilities. But the patience of US and British leaders was exhausted; they saw Saddam Hussein continuing a pattern of delay. After a summit meeting with Blair and the Spanish leader (but not John Howard) in the Azores, President Bush said the coalition of the willing would not seek UN approval for the use of force. His announcement followed French President Jacques Chirac’s promise to veto any UN ultimatum. France, Germany and Russia said the inspections were working and should be given more time. Chirac said the inspections were working. But on 17 March President Bush, in a globally televised address, gave Saddam Hussein and his sons 48 hours to leave Iraq or face military action. He said the UN had not lived up to its responsibilities. The first bombs fell on Iraq, on what the US said was ‘a target of opportunity,’ two days later. Against this background it is hardly surprising that the coalition cited Saddam Hussein’s refusal to obey UN disarmament demands as the primary reason for the pre-emptive attack. Bush, Blair and Howard could argue that they were upholding the authority of the UN when the UN would not do so itself. Bush asked: ‘Will the United Nations serve the purpose of its founding or will it be irrelevant?’ Blair said: ‘At stake in Iraq [...] . is the authority of the UN. ’ Howard said: ‘If the Security Council produces a grey rather than a black or white outcome, choices on final actions and commitments will need to be made by many nations including Australia. ’ The refusal of the coalition partners to give Blix more time to test the sincerity of Saddam’s eleventh-hour moves towards cooperation, and their dodgy claims about Iraq’s efforts to obtain nuclear weapons, suggest that Iraq’s alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction constituted the real and present threat they needed to justify the planned pre-emptive action. They had to show, as each of them said, that containment had failed or was failing. They did not want their claims about Iraq’s weapons falsified by any last-minute breakthrough negotiated by Hans Blix, however unlikely that seemed. And, of course, shaky domestic political support tended to be reinforced by revealing the alarming intelligence that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction that could be deployed in 45 minutes. But Saddam’s alleged arsenals, and his defiance of UN demands that he disarm, were at best subsidiary and at worst phoney reasons for the decision to go to war. In fact the US and Britain and Australia had other reasons, not always entirely compatible. For President Bush, and US administration hard-liners, regime change was always the primary goal - even, as we have seen, before they came to office. Bush wanted Saddam out. He was unfinished business left by Bush senior. That implied the inevitability of war: Saddam was not the sort of ruler who was likely to accept Bush’s invitation that he take himself into exile. After the swift overthrow of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the US administration was determined to maintain the momentum of its war against its terrorist enemies. The regime change so easily achieved in Afghanistan had reinforced the unilateralist impulses of the Bush administration as well as its determination to combat, alone if necessary, countries it deemed part of <b>what</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> famously called an ‘axis of evil’. Saddam was part of the axis, and the push to oust him with or without UN backing was a demonstration of US assertiveness. It was for this reason that the US attempted, not too convincingly, to argue that there were links between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda and that Saddam Hussein might supply al Qaeda with WMD. Bush and Howard also stressed that North Korea, also part of the ‘axis of evil,’ would not moderate its WMD programs and proliferation if Iraq’s defiance of the international community was not stopped immediately. But other deep and powerful impulses were driving the US. First, the US wanted to install a friendly democratic regime in an oil-rich Middle Eastern country. It vehemently denied that its actions were calculated to gain control of Iraqi oil, but senior administration figures spoke openly about a democratic Iraq as a model for peace and stability in the Middle East. President Bush hinted strongly at this objective in his 17 March ultimatum to Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi people, he said, ‘are deserving and capable of human liberty, and when the dictator has departed, they can set an example to all the Middle East of a vital and peaceful and self-governing nation. ’ The US was using its pre-eminent military position to establish a regime congenial to its ideological outlook. Hugh White, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, summed it up well: the US wanted to ‘turn Iraq into an American strategic asset, and a starting point for the democratisation of the Arab and Islamic worlds. ’ An idealistic strand of US foreign policy thinking was also invoked to justify regime change on the ground that it would restore the basic human rights of Iraqis who had suffered terrible brutality under Saddam. This was the so-called humanitarian intervention justification. Moreover, having massed mighty air, sea and land forces around Iraq, and brought them to fighting pitch, the US felt it had to either put them to action before the height of the coming summer or risk seeing their combat readiness and morale decline. The troops could not just sit on the ships and in the sand doing nothing. In short, a complex mix of revenge, self-interest, logistical necessity and idealism drove the US to war against Saddam Hussein. Blair and Howard, by contrast, both said they were prepared to accept the survival of Saddam’s regime provided he disarmed. They knew the UN would not agree to a war to satisfy the US desire for regime change when there was no convincing evidence of an impending and urgent threat from Iraq. ‘I couldn’t justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime,’ John Howard said on 13 March. But Blair and Howard were ultimately driven to war by their desire to demonstrate solidarity with the United States. Blair did not say so, but it was plainly in the UK’s interests to stay onside with the US. He was particularly critical of French, German and Russian demands that the weapons inspectors be given more time. For Howard the US alliance was central to his thinking about the Iraq crisis: ‘Australia’s alliance with the United States has been and will remain an important element in the government’s decision-making process on Iraq. ’ If the US was whistling up a posse to hunt down Saddam Hussein, Australia would answer the call. But Howard was more guarded than Blair. As Paul Kelly has noted, Howard did not argue that Saddam was a threat to Australia, or that Iraq threatened the world, or that its was significantly linked to al Qaeda. Howard was also more circumspect about Iraq’s nuclear capacities, although he repeated the African uranium story. Howard’s postwar outburst about his pride in Australia’s liberation of an oppressed people was an after-the-fact sentiment that he suppressed before the war. But it suggested that somehow Howard might have secretly or sub-consciously shared Bush’s declared desire to bring democracy to Iraq, to make it a pliant pro-Western strategic asset through regime change. Howard was clearly determined to join the US in any battle against Iraq. His early ‘predeployment’ of Australian forces (ostensibly to enable them to acclimatise) underscored this determination and made a mockery of his public denials that Australia had decided to fight. But he was also seeking maximum alliance leverage for minimum military involvement. Australia’s 2000 land, sea and air forces contributed importantly to the coalition, but it was a minuscule contribution compared with the US and British deployments, and it was an extremely short-term commitment. Most of the troops were home within weeks of the end of major combat operations, although about 800 stayed to guard the Australian Embassy and to perform other post-war tasks. Howard made clear that Australia would participate in combat operations but not in any long-term peacekeeping operation. It was a cautious and calculated commitment. Given the size of the Australian Defence Force and its ongoing regional commitments, including in East Timor, it was also probably about as much military capability as was comfortably available at the time. Nevertheless Howard established a principle. Australia would not consider itself bound to the UN system if the US called on Canberra to join it in aggressive action without UN backing. This principle was acknowledged openly on 26 June 2003 when Alexander Downer declared multilateralism ‘a synonym for an ineffective and unfocused policy’ and added that ‘sovereignty in our view is not absolute. Acting for the benefit of humanity is more important. ’ Downer repeated these remarks in an address to the UN General Assembly in September. The actual Australian commitments might have been limited and short-term, but Australia’s participation in the war was about moving away from what Downer called ‘internationalism of the lowest common denominator. ’ By pitching the argument in terms of Saddam Hussein’s twelve years of defiance of some seventeen UN resolutions demanding his disarmament, Australia was emphasising what it saw as the failings of ineffective and unfocused internationalism. It was cementing its place as a member of the pre-emptive posse available to its hyper-power ally. As in East Timor and Afghanistan, the Australian deployment was blessed. There were virtually no casualties and Howard basked in the national spotlight as he welcomed the troops home to a proud and grateful nation. For Howard it was the best kind of war: war without sacrifice. THE hard question, of course, is this: Does any of the foregoing discussion matter? Is there any point in nitpicking over the accuracy of intelligence assessments and the way they were transformed by political rhetoric-makers? Does {{it matter if}} massive arsenals of {{chemical and biological weapons}} and missiles are not found in Iraq? Does it matter if Iraq really was far from having a nuclear capability? Are the undeclared or half-hidden motives for the US, British and Australian decisions to fight in Iraq really important? The bottom line, surely, is that a dreadful dictator has been overthrown and the Iraqi people have been freed from his tyranny, however painfully and slowly and expensively, and that, despite ongoing violence, Iraq is being reconstructed. This simple utilitarian assessment has attractions for bureaucrats and politicians alike. It gets them off the hook of questions and inquiries that raise doubts about their competence and honesty and undermine public support. That is why the mantra of US, British and Australian leaders since the war has been: ‘Be patient. Time will prove that we were right - or close enough to right. ’ It would be reassuring if ready-to-fly arsenals of weapons of mass destruction were discovered, even though the war was demonstrably fought for other political and geo-strategic reasons. The weapons would at least show that Saddam had posed something of an international threat. If weapons are not found in any large concentrations, if reports from international survey teams show that Iraq had more plans and projects for WMD than actual stocks of material and weaponised projectiles, important questions arise about the credibility, competence and truthfulness of the intelligence agencies and of the spin doctors who crafted speeches for political leaders. The nature of their relationship is also a grave concern if American, British, Australian and other troops went to war on the basis of sexed-up or phoney threats. Wars are too serious, too important and too costly to be fought on the basis of falsehoods and wasted on great-power geopolitical fantasies and middle-power alliance management. It is, of course, always difficult for intelligence agencies to get things right. Their failures can be huge: they did not, for example, predict the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union; they did not predict the terrorist attacks on the US. Intelligence assessments are cautious and qualified because the information received by analysts is complex and often ambiguous and incomplete. But if Australia’s agencies based their Iraq assessments, as Howard said, mostly on information from the US and Britain, then it is legitimate to ask how much value Australia is getting for the millions of dollars it spends annually on its intelligence agencies. Disquiet about this issue has been reflected in a submission to the parliamentary inquiry by the Australian Defence Association, now headed by Neil James, a feisty former defence intelligence officer who served as a weapons inspector in Iraq. The ADA criticised what it called ‘the unfortunate habit within the Australian bureaucracy of posting far too many personnel with policy development backgrounds into analytical and management positions within our intelligence agencies. ’ It went on: ‘Often a tour with ONA or DIO in particular is seen as merely a ticket punching exercise by ambitious careerists before they move into policy-making areas offering better promotion. ’ Perhaps the most significant words in the submission were these: ‘The large numbers of intelligence agency staff with policy-making backgrounds or ambitions has too often resulted, however unconsciously, in intelligence assessments being biased towards desired policy outcomes rather than being objective in their own right. This is a fatal flaw in the intelligence process [...] . reactive, frequently banal and “say nothing” assessments lack the predictive discipline and essence vital for effective use by the customers of intelligence. ’ This is a damning assessment by a former intelligence officer who has close ties to the intelligence community and represents an organisation that is nationally respected for its active and expert engagement in the defence policy debate. The ADA’s observation is not far from Andrew Wilkie’s claim that intelligence reporting involves so many layers of politically astute managers that final reports are often so bland as to be virtually useless or subtly skewed towards the government’s preferred line. Without access to intelligence reports it is difficult to judge these claims. But if the intelligence agencies are populated with ambitious careerists and politically astute managers, it would not be surprising if they tended to ensure that politically important assessments were congenial to the political leadership. Promotions do not go to the contrary or the dissident. Political leaders want robust advice that will support their policy preferences. Political leaders, reasonably, want to make the best public case they can for their policy decisions, and they can legitimately ask intelligence agencies for advice on how far intelligence assessments can be simplified and hardened for public consumption. Effective presentation is a necessary prerequisite to gaining acceptance for any policy decision. But political leaders also have their personal credibility, and the credibility of their administrations, on the line when they address their nations on matters as important as going to war. Retailing dodgy or wrong information undermines public trust and corrodes the good standing of politicians and governments. It is not enough for political leaders like John Howard to say, when claims they have made are shown to have been false, that they were only repeating advice and did not intentionally mislead. ‘[A]s to whether I would set out deliberately to deceive them [the Australian people], no I hope I never do that,’ John Howard said. But political leaders have a duty to ensure the accuracy of the words they repeat. Any meaningful regime of accountability requires that politicians take responsibility for what they say. To preface a sensitive disclosure with phrases like ‘I am advised that [...] . ’ or ‘Our intelligence agencies report that [...] . ’ does not limit the accountability or responsibility of politicians for the accuracy of what they are saying. Yet resort to these sorts of evasions is one of the more disquieting features of the way politicians sought to sell and later justify their decisions to fight in Iraq. The result, inevitably, is an increase in public cynicism as the truth emerges, and a decline in public trust in political leaders. That is dangerous for the politician and bad for the democratic system The evidence from public polls seems clear that the political standing of President Bush and Prime Ministers Blair and Howard was higher before the war than in its protracted aftermath. Although no electoral consequences have yet been seen, Bush seems increasingly vulnerable to criticism as he heads into a presidential election year. Blair has been gravely damaged by the Hutton inquiry. Howard, perhaps because he was more cautious, and because the Australian involvement was smaller and shorter, seems to have suffered the least political damage. But the lessons and long-term strategic and political lessons and consequences still have to emerge from the war in Iraq.
