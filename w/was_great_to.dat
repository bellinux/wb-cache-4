[...] He described the scene in which he was strapped to an operating table with Mulder as [...] "totally uncomfortable".

500|$|The episode saw {{the return}} of several {{characters}} from previous seasons {{and the introduction of}} new characters that had either been mentioned or had some connection to established characters. Joseph Mawle, who was previously cast to play Benjen Stark and was featured in three episodes in the show's first season before disappearing (as he does in the A Song of Ice and Fire series that the show is based on). In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Bryan Cogman spoke of the re-introduction of Benjen and Mawle to the show saying [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> have Joe Mawle back with us – {{it must have been a}} trip for him to step back into the character after so long – but he's also decidedly not the Benjen of season 1.

[...] However, she thought that the scene did not use its full potential in emphasizing Hurley's empathy and Ben's reaction. However, Kristin Dos Santos of E!, who gave the episode a mostly positive review, was critical of the scene; she thought that the scene wasted time and was [...] "cruel and unusual punishment" [...] to air before the cliffhanger ending.

[...] In the fourth season episode [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", Tom is seen kissing his New York lover Arturo (Francesco Simone). After the broadcast of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", Lindelof and Cuse confirmed that the line from the third season premiere is an allusion to Tom's sexuality, but felt that it needed to be explicitly confirmed in the show, although Lindelof noted that the confirmation scene in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] "was not subtle, to say the least".

500|$|On 18 May 2011, it was {{announced}} Barber had joined the cast of Neighbours as Rhys Lawson. His casting announcement came as the show lost regular cast member Scott McGregor (Mark Brennan). Barber was appearing in a small guest role in fellow Australian soap opera Home and Away when {{he was given the}} role of Rhys. He began filming his first scenes for Neighbours opposite Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy) and Jackie Woodburne (Susan Kennedy) the week before his casting announcement. Of appearing in Neighbours, the actor told Matt Neal of The Warrnambool Standard [...] "I catch myself and have a moment where I realise that I'm working with actors I watched on TV growing up.

Hunter Davies, who was at Jim's house at the time doing an interview for his Beatles' biography, remembered Jim listening to an acetate disc of [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four". Davies wrote that Paul recorded the song specifically for his father, as Jim was then 64 years old and had married Angela two years previously. Paul wrote [...] "Let It Be", because of a dream he had in 1968. He said that he had dreamt of his mother, and the [...] "Mother Mary" [...] lyric was about her.

500|$|Director Adam Smith, new to Doctor Who, felt {{pressure}} {{in making the}} episode be a worthy sequel to [...] "Blink", which he called a [...] "brilliant, brilliant, brilliant episode", but also said that it <b>was</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> work with the Weeping Angels. He decided to have {{the interaction between the}} Doctor and River Song resemble that of an old married couple, bickering like [...] "mum and dad arguing over directions in the car". Actress Alex Kingston stated that it was [...] "great fun" [...] on set and she enjoyed working with Matt Smith, although her relationship with Smith was different from his predecessor and her former co-star, David Tennant. In the script it was not written in that River would land on the Doctor when she flew into the TARDIS; it was an idea that Matt Smith came up with in rehearsal that proved difficult to film. In the episode, there is a moment in the viewing room where the Doctor hangs on a strap attached to the ceiling and it breaks. This was originally an accident during one of the takes, but director Adam Smith liked it and filmed it again, with Matt Smith doing it on purpose.|$|E
500|$|Attention also {{focused on}} Jaguar's {{improved}} pace during the event. Prior to the race, {{the team had}} been criticised by the media {{for their ability to}} perform well in the series with some publications criticising their move of signing Evans and Carroll to drive their cars. Evans said his improved performance encouraged everyone working for the team and it gave Jaguar more confidence: [...] "If you look at the bigger picture, I’ve got to be satisfied with today. Qualifying <b>was</b> <b>great,</b> <b>to</b> be honest, I topped the group. If you ask me or the whole team if this would have happened after Marrakesh, we would have taken it with both hands." [...] Carroll hoped he would have a strong performance in the event and be faster than he could be but it was an issue that could be improved on. Jaguar team principal James Barclay stated the improvement was [...] "a little bit of a positive surprise" [...] but was unsure if Carroll's problem {{at the start of the}} race was caused by driver error or an electrical issue but admitted his team had to improve their understanding of full course yellow in future races.|$|E
500|$|In the original, non-broadcast pilot, Willow {{was portrayed}} by Riff Regan. However, network {{executives}} requested that Regan be replaced. Willow's character demanded {{that she be}} shy and unsure of herself, and the casting department encountered some difficulty finding actresses who could portray this effectively and still be likable. After seven auditions, Alyson Hannigan was eventually chosen for the role. She was chosen {{for being able to}} spin the character's lines with a self-effacing optimism; she stated, [...] "I didn't want to do Willow as someone who's feeling sorry for herself. Especially in the first season, she couldn't talk to guys, and nobody liked her. I was like, 'I don't want to play somebody who's down on herself." [...] Whedon conceived the character as introverted, saying [...] "I wanted Willow {{to have that kind of}} insanely colorful interior life that truly shy people have. And Alyson has that. She definitely has a loopiness I found creeping into the way Willow talked, which <b>was</b> <b>great.</b> <b>To</b> an extent, all the actors conform to the way I write the character, but it really stands out in Willow's case." ...|$|E

500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided to come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> win there before and I also had one of my best performances for Liverpool.

500|$|With the film's success, it was {{immediately}} decided to finish Superman II.

Donner commented in January 1979, [...] "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as {{he has nothing to}} say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then they need to go out and find another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me." [...] Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a cameo appearance for Superman III, and not a main supporting role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds." [...] Two more films, Superman III (1983) and [...] (1987), were produced. Superman Returns was released in 2006.

Despite this, {{she said that she}} was [...] "very much excited" [...] to compete at the Games: “I hope I will win, inshah’Allah [...] That is what I am expected to do, so that I can change the narrative of Somalia.” Farah competed in the first heat of the women's 400 metre discipline on 3 August, finishing seventh and last of all runners, with a time of one minute and 20.48 seconds.
