METHOD:We designed an experiment to directly correlate the performance of basketball players in a free-throw task and an elbow- and <b>wrist-joint</b> position sense task. RESULTS:We found a moderately high correlation between the free-throw success rate and <b>wrist-joint</b> position sense and a moderate correlation between the free-throw success rate and elbow-joint position sense. In both cases, the most successful shooters also had the best proprioceptive results. CONCLUSIONS:The results indicate that free-throw success is, at least partly, determined by players' ability to sense the position of the distal joints of their throwing upper limb. From a motor-control point of view, this suggests that basketball players may organize the compensatory behavior between the joints of their free-throwing arm on the basis of proprioception.

40|$|Present data on carpal {{kinematics}} and carpal ligament behaviour {{are limited}} to flexion and deviation movements of the hand. These motions do not represent all the <b>wrist-joint</b> motions which are important for the activities of daily living. The goal of this project was to obtain insight into carpal kinematics and carpal ligament behaviour during motions of the hand covering {{the full range of}} motion of the wrist joint. The carpals and the ligaments of 4 <b>wrist-joint</b> specimens were provided with radiopaque markers. These joints were subjected to Rontgenstereophotogrammetric experimentation in a large number of hand positions to determine carpal positions and ligament lengths. The movements or the carpal bones were described by means of finite helical axes. It was found that the movements of the carpals in the distal row closely resemble those of the hand. Conversely, the motions of the carpals of the proximal row appeared not to be directly proportional to the hand motions and exhibited clear out-of-plane movements. Furthermore, it could be shown that movements of the hand into the ulnodorsal quadrant of the full range of hand motion corresponds to larger helical rotations and translations for most of the carpals than when the hand was moved into any other quadrant. The maximal ligament length changes determined did not exceed the length changes reported for pure flexion and pure deviation movements of the han...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Quantification {{of joint}} {{mobility}} by ROM (range of movement), meaning the ‎maximal range of joint angle, {{is used to}} evaluate the degenerative joint disorders and the efficacy ‎of treatment. Age, gender, individual habits, daily activities and tissue degeneration influence the ‎joint ROM. The wrist joint, with many supporting tissues to perform a motion, is a complex ‎structure. Many studies mentioned ROM may be different in various racial groups because of ‎their body built, underlying diseases. ‎Objective: This study aims to establish a database of wrist joint ROM and factors influencing it ‎among Myanmar population. ‎Method: 120 Myanmar volunteers with no past history of musculoskeletal or neural lesions, but ‎with normal functional wrist joints of both sides, were included. 30 subjects (15 males and 15 ‎females) each from 5 - 17 year, 18 - 40 year, 41 - 60 year, 61 year and above age groups participated. ‎Various ranges of wrist joint motions were measured by hand goniometry in pronation position ‎only as most of the daily activities were usually performed in pronation. ‎Result: The average of ROM of <b>wrist-joint</b> flexion was 68. 3 degrees, extension was 68. 2 ‎degrees, radial deviation was 19. 6 degrees and ulnar deviation was 26. 1 degrees. Significant ‎difference between male and female was found in ulnar deviation of right side. 5 - 17 year age ‎group had wider range of motion than other age groups while over 60 people has lowest. ‎Conclusion: The findings highlighted the decline in <b>wrist-joint</b> motion capability with age. If ‎facilities are available, ROM of wrist joint during both pronation and supination should be ‎measured by using electrogoniometer. ...|$|E

40|$|Using a roentgen-stereophotogrammetric {{measurement}} system, {{the three-dimensional}} kinematic characteristics of each carpal bone in two human wrist joints were obtained as the hands were moved in vitro through dorsopalmar flexion and through radioulnar deviation, {{both in the}} supinated and pronated positions of the hand. The results were {{described in terms of}} Euler rotation angles and showed that in flexion, the distal carpal bones may be considered as one fixed group while the proximal carpals may not. For the deviation motion, quite different rotational excursions for the carpal bones were observed, therefore, none of the two rows may be assumed acting as rigid groups. In both of the hand motions performed, all carpal bones moved synchronously and uniformly. These results demonstrate that accurate measurements of three-dimensional carpal-bone motions are feasible by using an adequately refined roentgen-stereophotogrammetric system. The detailed and precise kinematic information obtained can serve as a database for future developments of functional <b>wrist-joint</b> models, and will provide more insight into carpal-bone behavior, useful in clinical diagnosis and surgical reconstruction procedures...|$|E
40|$|In biomechanical joint-motion analyses, the {{continuous}} motion {{to be studied}} is often approximated by a sequence of finite displacements, and the Finite Helical Axis FHA) or 2 ̆ 2 screw axis 2 ̆ 2 for each displacement is estimated from position measurements {{on a number of}} anatomical or artificial landmarks.

This implies, that under certain conditions, {{the continuous}} pathways of joint motions cannot be adequately described. The purpose of the present experimental study is to investigate the applicability of smoothing (or filtering) techniques, in those cases where FHA parameters are ill-determined. Two different quintic-spline smoothing methods were used to analyze the motion data obtained with Roentgenstereophotogrammetry in two experiments.

40|$|Most {{techniques}} of fusion {{of the wrist}} joint, whether performed through a dorsal approach 1, 2, 6 or a medial one tend to involve almost the entire wrist complex extending from the distal end of the radius across the carpus. While such diffuse procedures are indicated {{in the presence of}} generalized disease of the wrist, the n-iced does arise for a more localized method which conserves part of the joint. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to describe a fusion confined to the radioscaphoid compon-ient of the join-it (Figs. 1 an-id 2). The <b>wrist-joint</b> complex consists of the radiocarpal, mid-carpal, intercarpal, carpometacarpal, an-id intermetacarpal joints. Flexion an-id extension take place at the radiocarpal, mid-carpal, an-id carpometacarpal joints. The total average range of flexion an-id extension is about 140 degrees and of this range about 40 degrees takes place at the mid-carpal and carpomctacarpal joints. In-itercarpal and in-itermctacarpal movement is important in grip. The inferior radio-ulnar join-it is essential for pronation and supination. A localized radioscaphoid fusion, consequently, has the following advantages: (a) a small but useful residual range of flexion and exten-ison, (b) side to side move-ment, (c) preservation of the grip, and (d) unimpaired movements of pronation and supination. Indications Progressive pain, unrelieved by conservative measures, instability, an-id de-formity of the wrist, associated with impaired hand functioni, were the indications for operation-i...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPainful wrist {{osteoarthritis}} {{can result}} in major functional impairment. Most cases are related to posttraumatic sequel, metabolic arthropathies, or inflammatory joint disease, although wrist osteoarthritis occurs as an idiopathic condition in {{a small minority of}} cases. Surgery is indicated only when conservative treatment fails. The main objective is to ensure pain relief while restoring strength. Motion-preserving procedures are usually preferred, although residual wrist mobility is not crucial to good function. The vast array of available surgical techniques includes excisional arthroplasty, limited and total fusion, total wrist denervation, partial and total arthroplasty, and rib-cartilage graft implantation. Surgical decisions rest on the cause and extent of the degenerative wrist lesions, degree of residual mobility, and patient's wishes and functional demand. Proximal row carpectomy and four-corner fusion with scaphoid bone excision are the most widely used surgical procedures for stage II wrist osteoarthritis secondary to scapho-lunate advanced collapse (SLAC) or scaphoid non-union advanced collapse (SNAC) wrist. Proximal row carpectomy is not indicated in patients with stage III disease. Total wrist denervation is a satisfactory treatment option in patients of any age who have good range of motion and low functional demands; furthermore, the low morbidity associated with this procedure makes it a good option for elderly patients regardless of their range of motion. Total wrist fusion can be used not only as a revision procedure, but also as the primary surgical treatment in heavy manual labourers with wrist stiffness or generalised <b>wrist-joint</b> involvement. The role for pyrocarbon implants, rib-cartilage graft implantation, and total wrist arthroplasty remains to be determined, given the short follow-ups in available studies...|$|E
40|$|Injection {{studies on}} 35 upper limbs with {{neoprene}} latex {{were carried out}} and the limbs carefully dissected to observe the vascular contribution of the posterior interosseous branches of the dorsal forearm, the transverse anastomosis between anterior and posterior interosseous vessels and the calibre of the vessel. The findings indicated that a fascia-cutaneous flap based on septo-cutaneous branches of the posterior interosseous artery can be raised as a reversed forearm for resurfacing after skin loss in the hand. The versatility of the radial forearm flap has been well-documented (Montandon et al., 1984) and (Braun et al., 1985). It is easy to harvest, safe, reliable {{and can be used}} either as a pedicled or free flap. Its greatest drawback is the sacrifice of one major artery supplying the hand. Timmons (1986) has reported the complications at the donor site following the use of radial forearm flaps. The aim of our study was to explore the anatomical basis of using the dorsal skin flap of the forearm based on the posterior interosseous artery and its branches. Anatomy On the posterior aspect of the forearm, the posterior interosseous artery runs in the septum between extensor carpi ulnaris and extensor digitorum communis and minimi. The artery provides branches to the muscles and also to {{the lower part of the}} ulna (McCormack et a 1., 1953; Backhouse, 1981). The septo-cutaneous branches rise vertically and reach the overlying skin (Manchot, 1983). The posterior interosseous artery ends on the dorsal aspect of the carpus where it participates in the dorsal carpal arch (Fig. 1). Above the level of the <b>wrist-joint,</b> it receives a transverse anastomosis from the dorsal branch of the anterior interosseous artery. This branch crosses the interosseous membrane at the upper border of the quadratus pronatus (Zancolli and Angrigiani, 1988). A fascia-cutaneous flap, distally based on the septo-cutaneous arteries of the posterior interosseous artery and reverse-flow irrigated by the dorsal branch of the anterior interosseous artery via the transverse anastomotic artery, can be raised as a reverse dorsal forearm flap, after division of the posterior interosseous arteries proximally...|$|E
