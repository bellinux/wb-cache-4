5|$|English cookery has {{developed}} over many centuries {{since at least}} the time of The Forme of Cury, written in the Middle Ages around 1390 in the reign of King Richard II. The book offers imaginative and sophisticated recipes, with spicy sweet and sour sauces thickened with bread or quantities of almonds boiled, peeled, dried and ground, and often served in pastry. Foods such as gingerbread are described. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> emphasises Clarissa Dickson Wright in her A History of English Food, a matter of large lumps of roast meat at every meal as imagined in Hollywood films.|$|E
5|$|When World War I began, Macmillan {{looked for}} peace {{activism}} {{on the part}} of NUWSS. Instead, she found a majority of British women were in favour of helping the men win the war. Her pacifism <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> passive—soon after hostilities broke out, she travelled to Flushing, Netherlands on a mission of mercy. By late October 1914 she was providing food for refugees from the fall of Antwerp. Macmillan signed the Open Christmas Letter, a peace-seeking exchange between women of warring nations, in late 1914.|$|E
5|$|A {{consensus}} formed {{within the}} European diplomatic community in Constantinople that {{the persecution of}} the accused Jews had to be stopped. This opinion was held not only by Lord Ponsonby, but also by von Stürmer, whose correspondence revealed that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> convinced of the innocence of the Jews; by the French ambassador Edouard Pontois, whose government stood by the French consuls who supported blood libels in Rhodes and Damascus; and by the Prussian ambassador Hans von Königsmark. Consequently, the way was open for Lord Ponsonby, {{by far the most}} powerful diplomat in Constantinople, to intervene unopposed on behalf the Jews of Rhodes.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{parliamentary}} election after the war, in 1945, Meisdalshagen was re-elected {{for a second}} term in Parliament. It was not clear that he would be nominated for the ballot, as this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> usual for those Labour Party members who in the summer of 1940 had agreed to the King's abdication. However, Meisdalshagen's service in Milorg probably tipped the scales in his favour. He {{was a member of the}} Standing Committee on Finance and Customs and secretary of the Preparatory Credentials Committee, and also became a member of the Standing Committee on Justice in December 1946. Meisdalshagen was also board chairman of the Norwegian State Housing Bank from 1946 to 1953.|$|E

40|$|I {{contend that}} there are two dogmas that are still popular among {{philosophers}} of action: that agents can only desire what they think is good and that they can only intentionally pursue what they think is good. I also argue that both dogmas are false. Broadly, I argue that our best theories of action can explain the possibility of intentionally pursuing what one thinks <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> good, that we need to allow for the possibility of intentionally pursuing what one think <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> good, and that if we can intentionally pursue what we think <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> good then we can desire it on similar grounds...|$|R

25|$|Voyager 2 {{found that}} one of the most {{striking}} effects of the sideways orientation of Uranus is the effect on the tail of the planetary magnetic field. This is itself tilted about 60° from the Uranian axis of rotation. The planet's magneto tail was shown to be twisted by the rotation of Uranus into a long corkscrew shape following the planet. The presence of a significant magnetic field for Uranus <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> known until Voyager 2s arrival.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, Bardswell {{played only}} {{in a couple of}} {{first-class}} matches for MCC against the Universities, but {{at the start of the}} 1899 season he reappeared for Lancashire, playing as captain in the first six games of the season, but standing aside when Archie MacLaren resumed his cricket career in June. That was the end of Bardswell's first-class cricket career apart from one appearance for Lancashire in an end-of-season match in 1902, in which he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> successful.|$|E

She also explained why her character, Lee Haines, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> like her. During that year, she appeared on the cover of Top Billing.|$|E

25|$|The grand-ducal {{government}} of the Seekreis was dissolved, and Hecker gradually gained reinforcements. But friendly advisers also joined him, pointing out the risks of his undertaking. Hecker, however, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> ready to listen to them. On the contrary, he added to violence an absurd defiance, and offered an amnesty to the German princes on condition of their retiring within fourteen days into private life. The troops of Baden and Hesse marched against him, {{under the command of}} General Friedrich von Gagern, and on April 20 they met near Kandern, where, although Gagern was killed, Hecker was completely defeated.|$|E
25|$|In The Art of Courtly Love, Andreas Capellanus, Andrew the chaplain, {{refers to}} the court of Poitiers. He claims that Eleanor, her {{daughter}} Marie, Ermengarde, Viscountess of Narbonne, and Isabelle of Flanders would sit and listen to the quarrels of lovers and act as a jury to the questions of the court that revolved around acts of romantic love. He records some twenty-one cases, the most famous of them being a problem posed to the women about whether true love can exist in marriage. According to Capellanus, the women decided that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> likely.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, however, composers such as Arnold Schoenberg, Béla Bartók, and Igor Stravinsky sought {{alternatives}} or {{extensions of}} tonal harmony, and found other {{uses for the}} semitone. Often the semitone was exploited harmonically as a caustic dissonance, having no resolution. Some composers would even use large collections of harmonic semitones (tone clusters) {{as a source of}} cacophony in their music (e.g. the early piano works of Henry Cowell). By now, enharmonic equivalence was a commonplace property of equal temperament, and instrumental use of the semitone <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> problematic for the performer. The composer was free to write semitones wherever he wished.|$|E

25|$|A bombe run {{involved}} a cryptanalyst first obtaining a crib — {{a section of}} plaintext that was thought to correspond to the ciphertext. Finding cribs <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> straightforward; it required considerable familiarity with German military jargon and the communication habits of the operators. However, the codebreakers were aided {{by the fact that}} the Enigma would never encrypt a letter to itself. This helped in testing a possible crib against the ciphertext, as it could rule out a number of cribs and positions, where the same letter occurred in the same position in both the plaintext and the ciphertext. This was termed a crash at Bletchley Park.|$|E
25|$|The 1925 {{design was}} by Milwaukee Road Chief Mechanical Engineer C. H. Bilty, with detail design by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, who {{actually}} built them. They represented {{the best of}} American locomotive practice at the time, and were given all the latest devices and fittings. A Coffin feedwater heater was fitted, which was the Milwaukee's favorite type; this was installed flush in the extended smokebox, and thus <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> obvious. Possibly because of this, the boiler lagging was continued over the smokebox, which was not common; most North American locomotives had bare smokeboxes which were graphited, rather than painted. The associated steam-driven centrifugal water pump was located under the cab at the left rear. The class F6-a was fitted with the tender-mounted Wilson Water Conditioner instead of the Coffin feedwater heater.|$|E
25|$|On 8 April 2011, the Netherlands {{agreed to}} buy a second test aircraft, and signed a deal to {{purchase}} {{it at the end}} of the month. Later that month, Dutch defence minister Hans Hillen suggested that their purchase level would be lower than 85, as the plan was to replace F-16s on a one for one basis and Dutch F-16 numbers had already dropped to 68. Lockheed was confident that the Netherlands will purchase the full order of 85 F-35 fighters. However, the Dutch Minister of Defence announced in March 2013 that the test programme would be stopped until further notice and that the purchase of the F-35 <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> certain. The two F-35s on order will be placed in storage until a decision is made.|$|E
