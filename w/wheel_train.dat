25|$|David J. Macpherson (b. 1854, Ontario, Canada), a civil {{engineer}} from Cornell University and a newcomer to Pasadena (1885), proposed a steam driven cog <b>wheel</b> <b>train</b> to reach the crest via Mount Wilson. It wasn't until he {{was introduced to the}} millionaire Thaddeus S. C. Lowe (arrived in Pasadena 1890) that a fully funded plan could be put into action. The two men visited Colorado to view the mountain railway to Pike's Peak. Lowe was impressed with the trolley car systems in the city and thought that should be the way to go. This would make the Mount Lowe Railway the only electric traction rail line ever to be put into scenic mountain railway service.|$|E

50|$|In {{the motor}} barrel, the {{functions}} of the arbor and barrel were reversed from the going barrel. The mainspring was wound by the barrel, and turned the arbor to drive the <b>wheel</b> <b>train.</b> Thus if the mainspring broke, the destructive recoil of the barrel would be applied not to the <b>wheel</b> <b>train</b> but to the winding mechanism, which was robust enough to take it.|$|E
5000|$|Watch {{movements}} are very standardized, and the <b>wheel</b> <b>trains</b> of most watches {{have the same}} parts. The <b>wheel</b> <b>trains</b> of clocks {{are a little more}} varied, with different numbers of wheels {{depending on the type of}} clock and how many hours the clock runs between windings (the [...] "going"). [...] However, the <b>wheel</b> <b>trains</b> of clocks and watches share the same terminology, and are similar enough that they can be described together. The large gears in timepieces are generally called wheels, the smaller gears they mesh with (large to small, large to small) are called pinions, and the shafts that the wheels and pinions are mounted on are called arbors. [...] The wheels are mounted between the plates of the movement, with the pivots rotating in holes in the plates. The pivot holes have semicircular depressions around them, called oil cups, to hold the oil in contact with the shaft by capillary action. There are several <b>wheel</b> <b>trains</b> in a typical clock or watch.|$|R

5000|$|The {{escapement}} is {{a mechanical}} linkage that converts the force from the clock's <b>wheel</b> <b>train</b> into impulses {{that keep the}} pendulum swinging back and forth. It is the part that makes the [...] "ticking" [...] sound in a working pendulum clock. Most escapements consist of a wheel with pointed teeth called the escape wheel which is turned by the clock's <b>wheel</b> <b>train,</b> and surfaces the teeth push against, called pallets. During most of the pendulum's swing the wheel is prevented from turning because a tooth is resting {{against one of the}} pallets; this is called the [...] "locked" [...] state. Each swing of the pendulum a pallet releases a tooth of the escape wheel. The wheel rotates forward a fixed amount until a tooth catches on the other pallet. These releases allow the clock's <b>wheel</b> <b>train</b> to advance a fixed amount with each swing, moving the hands forward at a constant rate, controlled by the pendulum.|$|E
50|$|The {{backward}} {{motion of the}} escape wheel during part of the cycle, called recoil, {{is one of the}} disadvantages of the anchor escapement. It results in a temporary reversal of the entire <b>wheel</b> <b>train</b> back to the driving weight with each tick of the clock, causing extra wear in the <b>wheel</b> <b>train,</b> excessive wear to the gear teeth, and inaccuracy. It can also cause the points of the escape wheel teeth to dig into the pallet surface. The teeth are slanted backward, opposite the direction of rotation, and the surface of the pallets is slightly convex, to prevent this.|$|E

5000|$|Although the {{escapement}} is necessary, {{its force}} disturbs the natural {{motion of the}} pendulum, and in precision pendulum clocks this was often the limiting factor on {{the accuracy of the}} clock. Different escapements have been used in pendulum clocks over the years to try to solve this problem. In the 18th and 19th century escapement design was at the forefront of timekeeping advances. The anchor escapement (see animation) was the standard escapement used until the 1800s when an improved version, the deadbeat escapement took over in precision clocks. It is used in almost all pendulum clocks today. The remontoire, a small spring mechanism rewound at intervals which serves to isolate the escapement from the varying force of the <b>wheel</b> <b>train,</b> was used in a few precision clocks. In tower clocks the <b>wheel</b> <b>train</b> must turn the large hands on the clock face {{on the outside of the}} building, and the weight of these hands, varying with snow and ice buildup, put a varying load on the <b>wheel</b> <b>train.</b> Gravity escapements were used in tower clocks.|$|E
50|$|Tower clocks {{are one of}} the few {{types of}} {{pendulum}} clock which the anchor escapement did not dominate. The varying force applied to the <b>wheel</b> <b>train</b> by the large exterior hands, exposed to wind, snow, and ice loads, was better handled by gravity escapements.|$|E
50|$|Remontoires {{are used}} because the {{timekeeping}} mechanism in clocks and watches, the pendulum or balance wheel, is never isochronous; that is its rate {{is affected by}} changes in the drive force applied to it. In spring driven timepieces, the drive force declines as the mainspring runs down. In weight driven clocks the drive force, provided by a weight suspended by a cord, is more constant, but imperfections in the gear train and variations in lubrication also cause small variations. In turret clocks, the large hands, which {{are attached to the}} clock's <b>wheel</b> <b>train,</b> are exposed to the weather {{on the outside of the}} tower, so winds and accumulations of ice and snow apply disturbing forces to the hands, which are passed on to the <b>wheel</b> <b>train.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Training</b> <b>wheels</b> {{that prevent}} the bike from leaning also prevent countersteering, so that, {{as with a}} tricycle, {{children}} learn to turn the handlebars the wrong way, which must be unlearned later. Sheldon Brown wrote that <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> can become an obstacle to learning if they are adjusted incorrectly, because they prevent the bike from leaning if they are too low, and can inhibit braking if too much weight is taken off the rear <b>wheel</b> by <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> that are too low. Adjusting <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> correctly, and raising them higher as the child's skill increases, avoids these problems. [...] Alternatives to using <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> include removing the pedals from a child's bike, or balance bicycles.|$|R
5000|$|The gear on the fusee {{drives the}} movement's <b>wheel</b> <b>train,</b> usually the center wheel. There is a ratchet between the fusee and its gear (not visible, inside the fusee) which {{prevents}} the fusee from turning the clock's <b>wheel</b> <b>train</b> backwards {{while it is}} being wound up. In quality watches and many later fusee movements {{there is also a}} maintaining power spring, to provide temporary force to keep the movement going while it is being wound. This type is called a going fusee. It is usually a planetary gear mechanism (epicyclic gearing) in the base of the fusee [...] "cone") which then provides turning power in the opposite direction to the 'winding up' direction therefore keeping the watch or clock running during winding.|$|E
5000|$|A {{gear train}} (<b>wheel</b> <b>train)</b> that steps up {{the speed of}} the power so that the {{pendulum}} can use it. The gear ratios of the gear train also divide the rotation rate down to give wheels that rotate once every hour and once every 12 hours, to turn the hands of the clock.|$|E
5000|$|In horology, a <b>wheel</b> <b>train</b> (or just train) is {{the gear}} train of a {{mechanical}} watch or clock. [...] Although {{the term is}} used for other types of gear trains, {{the long history of}} mechanical timepieces has created a traditional terminology for their gear trains which is not used in other applications of gears.|$|E

50|$|Tram {{tires are}} {{generally}} narrower than train tires. Trams use bigger crossing angles and tighter curve radii {{are more likely}} than for train tracks. To cope with this difficulty the wheels of trams temporarily transfer the weight of the tram onto the flange to reduce wear on both the frog point and the horizontal surface of the tram <b>wheels.</b> <b>Train</b> <b>wheels</b> are not designed to bear such weight on their flanges.|$|R
50|$|The {{modern day}} {{chronograph}} works by pushing a start button, normally {{located at the}} two o'clock position, to begin recording time, and by pushing the same button to stop the recording. When the button is pushed to start the recording, {{a series of three}} (in more complicated and more precise chronographs there are more <b>wheels)</b> <b>train</b> <b>wheels</b> start turning. The smallest has a revolution time of one second, the next sixty seconds, and the final one has a revolution time of sixty minutes. The three <b>train</b> <b>wheels</b> interact with one another and record how long it has been since the start button has been activated.|$|R
50|$|In {{mechanical}} clocks {{this is done}} mechanically by a gear train, {{known as}} the <b>wheel</b> <b>train.</b> The gear train also has a second function; to transmit mechanical power from the power source to run the oscillator. There is a friction coupling called the 'cannon pinion' between the gears driving the hands {{and the rest of}} the clock, allowing the hands to be turned to set the time.|$|E
50|$|True 'skeletonization' also {{includes}} the trimming away of any non-essential metal on the bridge, plate, <b>wheel</b> <b>train</b> or any other mechanical part of the watch, leaving only a minimalist 'bare' skeleton of the movement required for functionality. Often, the remaining thinned movement is decorated with engraving. This can be {{with or without a}} dial face that allows the user to see through to the movement.|$|E
50|$|Although {{a highly}} ingenious {{escapement}} design, the Daniels coaxial nevertheless still needs lubrication to the lever pallet pivots. In addition, {{because of its}} geometry the impulse wheel can only have {{a limited number of}} teeth, thus it is necessary to have an extra wheel and pinion in the <b>wheel</b> <b>train</b> the pivots of which also need lubricating.Therefore, the advantages of this escapement over the lever are of an uncertain value.|$|E
5000|$|Manufacturers {{of balance}} {{bicycles}} say {{that children can}} learn to bicycle faster because they learn to balance and countersteer first and then to pedal later, and that <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> slow learning because kids become too dependent on them, acquiring bad habits. Pediatricians [...] {{say that there is}} no evidence that children learn to bike faster without <b>training</b> <b>wheels.</b> <b>Training</b> <b>wheels</b> that prevent the bike from leaning also prevent countersteering, so that, as with a tricycle, kids learn to turn the handlebars the wrong way, which must be unlearned later. Sheldon Brown wrote that <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> can become an obstacle to learning if they are adjusted incorrectly, because they prevent the bike from leaning if they are too low, and can inhibit braking if too much weight is taken off the rear <b>wheel</b> by <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> that are too low. Adjusting <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> correctly, and raising them higher as the child's skill increases, avoids these problems. Balance bikes with no brakes at all except the rider's feet might stop poorly as well, though very young children might not use brakes effectively anyway. Brown recommended simply removing the pedals from a normal kid's bicycle, avoiding the extra expense of a balance bike, and parents have had success with this approach.|$|R

50|$|In 1864 Aaron Dennison and A. O. Bigelow {{set up the}} Tremont Watch Company in Boston.

50|$|Escapement: A {{mechanism}} {{that allows the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>train</b> to advance, or escape a fixed amount with each swing of the balance wheel or pendulum. It consists of a gear called an escape wheel which is released one tooth at a time by a lever that rocks back and forth. Each time the escape wheel moves forward it also gives the pendulum or balance wheel a push to keep it moving.|$|E
50|$|Around 1900, when broken watchsprings {{were more}} of a problem, some pocketwatches used a {{variation}} of the going barrel called the motor barrel or safety barrel. Mainsprings usually broke at their attachment to the arbor, where bending stresses are greatest. When the mainspring broke, the outer part recoiled and the momentum spun the barrel in the reverse direction. This applied great force to the delicate <b>wheel</b> <b>train</b> and escapement, often breaking pivots and jewels.|$|E
