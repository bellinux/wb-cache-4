40|$|BACKGROUND: Epidemiological {{evidence}} on meat intake {{and breast cancer}} is inconsistent, with little research on potentially carcinogenic meat-related exposures. <b>We</b> investigated <b>meat</b> subtypes, cooking practices, meat mutagens, iron, and subsequent breast cancer risk. METHODS: Among 52 158 women (aged 55 – 74 years) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, who completed a food frequency questionnaire, 1205 invasive breast cancer cases were identified. <b>We</b> estimated <b>meat</b> mutagen and haem iron intake with databases accounting for cooking practices. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) within quintiles of intake. RESULTS: Comparing the fifth to the first quintile, red meat (HR 1. 23; 95 % CI 1. 00 – 1. 51, P trend 0. 22), the heterocyclic amine (HCA), 2 -amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), (HR 1. 26; 95 % CI 1. 03 – 1. 55; P trend 0. 12), and dietary iron (HR 1. 25; 95 % CI 1. 02 – 1. 52; P trend 0. 03) were positively associated with breast cancer. We observed elevated, though not statistically significant, risks with processed meat, the HCA 2 -amino- 3, 4, 8 -trimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx), mutagenic activity, iron from meat, and haem iron from meat. CONCLUSION: In this prospective study, red meat, MeIQx, and dietary iron elevated the risk of invasive breast cancer, but there was n...|$|R

60|$|So {{the days}} went by pleasantly enough with lots to eat, since {{whenever}} <b>we</b> wanted <b>meat</b> I {{had only to}} go a few yards to shoot a fat buck at a spot whither they trekked to drink in the evening, till at last came the time of full moon.

40|$|Many {{approaches}} {{have been taken}} regarding this topic, {{some of them are}} anthropological or scientific that pursue the understanding of why <b>we</b> eat <b>meat,</b> but from the philosophical lens this question is solved in the field of applied ethics, which is the area that debate about the moral status of animals (nonhuman animals) and where different theorizations that tried to explain the relationship between animals and humans and the examination of the morality of meat consumption take place.
