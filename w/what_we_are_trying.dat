Local journalist and broadcaster Keith Skipper told the Eastern Daily Press: [...] "If {{they are going}} to set these dramas in a specific location with locals and extras surely they should get the accent right otherwise it is self defeating." [...] An ITV spokesman told the paper: [...] "We hired a professional dialect coach to help the actors achieve their Norfolk accent. The Norfolk accent is different in one area of Norfolk to another. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to achieve is something that resembles a Norfolk accent that cannot be pinned down."

[...] Both Caltech and MIT have a set of pranking ethics, stating that pranks should be reversible and not cause permanent damage, and emphasize creativity and originality. [...] In recent years, pranking has been officially encouraged by Tom Mannion, Caltech's Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs and Campus Life. [...] "The grand old days of pranking have gone away at Caltech, and that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to bring back," [...] reported The Boston Globe, which noted that [...] "security has orders not to intervene in a prank unless officers get Mannion's approval beforehand." [...] However, hacks at MIT are generally more secretive and often do not involve identifying the hackers.|$|E

2500|$|During the South Carolina Democratic Debate in Myrtle Beach, Edwards {{sought to}} {{distinguish}} himself from Senators Obama and Clinton, and criticized {{them for their}} attacks and [...] "big city" [...] politics. As soon {{as he began to}} question how the attacks helped, he was widely cheered by the audience for in what many people thought was what distinguished Edwards from negative campaigning. Saying [...] "This kind of squabbling, how many children are going to get healthcare? How many {{people are going to get}} an education from this?

5000|$|Walt Simonson, {{who wrote}} the Thor {{installments}} of [...] "Mutant Massacre" [...] and penciled the X-Factor installments, said: [...] Partly, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> {{to do in the}} crossover was not create a string of beads where you had to go from one bead to the next bead to the next bead in order to follow the entire storyline. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to do, rather, was to take several separate skeins and intertwine them {{in such a way that}} in the end they formed a coherent whole, but then unwound and went in their own directions. And you can follow any one skein through the Massacre: you can read X-Men, you can read X-Factor, or you can read Thor, New Mutants, Power Pack, or Daredevil without really having to go over and read all the other books. But, of course, then you don't get the whole picture.|$|R

6000|$|... "My dear child, {{you are so}} young--so strangely young. I am a {{thousand}} years old; I have lived through generations--through centuries. I know what I know by experience; you know it by imagination. That is consistent with your being the fresh, bright creature that you are. I am constantly forgetting the difference between us--that you are a mere child as yet, though a child destined for great things. I forgot it the other night, but I have remembered it since. You must pass through a certain phase, {{and it would be}} very wrong in me to pretend to suppress it. That is all clear to me now; I see it was my jealousy that spoke--my restless, hungry jealousy. I have far too much of that; I oughtn't to give any one the right to say that it's a woman's quality. I don't want your signature; I only want your confidence--only what springs from that. I hope with all my soul that you won't marry; but if you don't it must not be because you have promised me. You know what I think--that there is something noble done when one makes a sacrifice for a great good. Priests--when they were real priests--never married, and what you and I dream of doing demands of us a kind of priesthood. It seems to me very poor, when friendship and faith and charity and the most interesting occupation in the world--when such a combination as this doesn't seem, by itself, enough to live for. No man that I have ever seen cares a straw in his heart for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to accomplish. They hate it; they scorn it; they will try to stamp it out whenever they can. Oh yes, I know there are men who pretend to care for it; but they are not really men, and I wouldn't be sure even of them! Any man that one would look at--with him, as a matter of course, it is war upon us to the knife. I don't mean to say there are not some male beings who are willing to patronise us a little; to pat us on the back and recommend a few moderate concessions; {{to say that there are}} two or three little points in which society has not been quite just to us. But any man who pretends to accept our programme in toto, as you and I understand it, of his own free will, before he is forced to--such a person simply schemes to betray us. There are gentlemen in plenty who would be glad to stop your mouth by kissing you! If you become dangerous some day to their selfishness, to their vested interests, to their immorality--as I pray heaven every day, my dear friend, that you may!--it will be a grand thing for one of them if he can persuade you that he loves you. Then you will see what he will do with you, and how far his love will take him! It would be a sad day for you and for me and for all of us if you were to believe something of that kind. You see I am very calm now; I have thought it all out." ...|$|E

Also, the way they recorded...it was completely out of the ordinary...we'd been through the culture where you'd lay down the drums first, then you lay down the bass, then you lay down the guitars, and then you do the vocals...and we get to the Blasting Room and once the drums were done it was like, all bets are off, Chuck bassist would go in for a couple hours, then I would go in, then Luke guitarist would go in, and we'd just be chipping away at these songs ... it was definitely a new approach for us anyway, we'd never done anything like that before...so I think that those guys really brought out the best in us, they challenged us, but they also, I think, had a really innate sense of knowing <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to get done.|$|R
