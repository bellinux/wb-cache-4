Next, the design <b>wind</b> <b>loads</b> of scaffolds for building construction, those of buildings in the construction stage, and those of so-called “temporary” structures such as site offices are discussed. In Japan, the design <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> for scaffolds is defined as 1 -year-recurrence <b>wind</b> <b>load,</b> because its average setting period at one construction site is around 6 months, but this paper clearly proves the inappropriateness of this design <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> estimation concept.

Finally, even for the design <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> for main structural frames, it is clearly demonstrated that the design load level {{may not be able to}} be determined based on the lifetime of an individual building. Therefore, although the LCC concept is applied in design load estimation, it is strongly recommended that the optimal design load level should be decided considering total LCC for the city or nation as a whole, and treat design as involving a group of buildings, rather than attempting to optimize the LCC of individual buildings.
