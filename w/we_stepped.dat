60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> {{back into}} the world I was glad that the fog stood between myself and the heaven above.|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> {{out into}} the street, where the dusk was now thickening, I turned to Castelroux to inquire how Saint-Eustache came into Chatellerault's company.|$|E
6000|$|... "A word {{of advice}} in season, Don Antonio," [...] {{he said as}} <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> forth together. [...] "Do not go so often to visit the Princess." ...|$|E
60|$|Abbot. Oh, Sir, there <b>we</b> <b>step</b> in, {{with the}} consolations and {{instructions}} of the faith.|$|R
50|$|We're the ushers, {{who show}} to your seat / then nonchalantly, <b>we</b> <b>step</b> upon your feet.|$|R

60|$|The door of Briony Lodge was open, and {{an elderly}} woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> from the brougham.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>stepped</b> {{between the}} {{principal}} actors in this scene, which only {{the passion of}} Altascar made tragical, but Tryan, with a humility but ill concealing his triumph, interrupted,-- ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was waiting}} on the {{platform}} when <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> out, and we {{could see in the}} light of the station lamps that he was very pale, and quivering with agitation.|$|E
60|$|Here then, <b>we</b> <b>step</b> aside {{a moment}} from {{following}} {{the fortunes of}} Somerset, and proceed to relate the strange and romantic episode of THE BROWN BOX.|$|R
6000|$|... "Supposing <b>we</b> <b>step</b> {{in there}} for a few minutes, while you and Mr. Passmore meet Mr. Haskers," [...] he cried. [...] "We'll come out when you say so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] said Vuyning, with a smile. [...] "But, suppose <b>we</b> <b>step</b> {{aside to}} a quieter place. There is a divan--a café over here that will do. Schrumm {{will give us}} a private corner." ...|$|R
60|$|Our {{boat was}} waiting for us at Kingston just below bridge, and to it we wended our way, and round it we stored our luggage, and into it <b>we</b> <b>stepped.</b>|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> out {{on to the}} lawn, one of the under-gardeners--a mere lad--passed us {{on his way to}} the house, with {{a letter}} in his hand. Miss Halcombe stopped him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was. <b>We</b> <b>stepped</b> {{behind the}} rocks {{to find out}} what sort of men you were. And I guess you are just our kind," [...] added Merwell, with a sickly grin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Belding, I {{certainly}} {{would prefer a}} conference with you right now," [...] interposed the elder Chase, cutting short Belding's strange speech. [...] "There are other matters--important matters to discuss. They've got to be settled. May <b>we</b> <b>step</b> in, sir?" ...|$|R

6000|$|When <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> {{from the}} train the {{stationmaster}} asked us if we were the three Miss Youngs. Alberta pleaded guilty, and he said, [...] "Well, here's a letter for you then." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{saying she}} swung the secret panel that {{separated}} {{us from the}} apartment in which I had found her, and <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> through once more into {{the presence of the}} other prisoners.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>stepped</b> down {{on to the}} platform. Louis, {{for some}} reason, seemed {{slightly}} nervous. He {{glanced up at the}} clock and watched the few late arrivals with an interest which was almost intense.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is coming}} to sup, then," [...] said the doctor, staring in the {{direction}} indicated. [...] "What say you, Paul, suppose <b>we</b> <b>step</b> up?" [...] Just then a curtain near by lifted, and from a private building a few yards distant the queen entered, unattended.|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely some prodigious merry-making {{is going}} on," [...] exclaimed he [...] "I have laughed very little since I left home, sir, {{and should be}} sorry to lose an opportunity. Shall <b>we</b> <b>step</b> round the corner by that darkish house and take our share of the fun?" ...|$|R
5000|$|As <b>we</b> <b>step</b> {{from the}} phrase {{to the world}} of human beings, [...] "social construction" [...] {{analyses}} can become more complex.

60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> {{into the}} {{carriage}} {{one of the}} stable-lads held {{the door open for}} us. A sudden idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for he leaned forward and touched the lad upon the sleeve.|$|E
60|$|We went out, {{down the}} garden path. Lettie held her skirts {{carefully}} {{gathered from the}} ground. A nightingale began to sing in the twilight; <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> along in silence {{as far as the}} rhododendron bushes, now in rosy bud.|$|E
60|$|We {{left the}} city by a late {{afternoon}} train, and already twilight had ceased to linger. As <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> blindly into the early winter darkness {{at the end of}} our short journey, the voice of Sidney Sanderson sounded pleasant and assuring.|$|E
40|$|Human {{language}} comprehension is so effortless that {{it often}} appears instantaneous. Someone speaks, {{and we understand}} them without any awareness of how. It is only when <b>we</b> <b>step</b> back and examine the structure of language that it becomes clear just how complex this ability is. To understand speech, we must: transform the acousti...|$|R

5000|$|The Cardinal {{was heavily}} opposed to Nazi Germany, and once said, [...] "With Germany <b>we</b> <b>step</b> many degrees {{downward}} and reach {{the lowest possible}} depths.

6000|$|... "This is {{the last}} year of this trade; they're getting {{machines}} to do away with us," [...] said the sweated one mournfully, as <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> over the woman with the breasts grossly naked and waded anew through the cheap young life.|$|E
60|$|The {{small change}} was made, <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> on board, and the ropes were cast off. Jones, Holmes, and I {{sat in the}} stern. There was one man at the rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors forward.|$|E
60|$|The lift {{came to a}} {{standstill}} at the third floor and <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> out on to the corridor. The Count's servant followed me to my room, deposited the box on {{a chair at the}} foot of the bed and wished me good-night.|$|E
