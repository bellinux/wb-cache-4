25|$|This, Kleist's last play, {{met with}} {{resistance}} {{not only from}} his contemporaries. The fear of death scene was long held to be unperformable and was always omitted. Equally criticised were the prince's sleep-walking and the trick played by the Elector. This was because although these <b>were</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were acceptable in comedy, they offended the rules governing the portrayed behaviour of the aristocratic figures of tragedy. This was a convention that really only disappeared shortly before the First World War, when it did become possible to portray an aristocrat as a figure of comedy, for example Baron Ochs in Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Der Rosenkavalier.|$|E

[...] White claimed [...] "there <b>were</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> needed to be addressed and now is a good time." [...] After missing three road games to Indiana and Pennsylvania, White returned to the Vipers for their final six games, which were all home games, but he did not anticipate participating in the [...] "hectic" [...] playoff schedule.|$|E
500|$|After {{the episode}} was {{finished}} filming, the footage {{entered into a}} long period of editing. Series creator Chris Carter noted that the episode [...] "wasn't cutting together well and that there <b>were</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> just didn't work." [...] Once the resultant footage was reworked into an acceptable episode, it was four minutes under time. In order to compensate for this, additional inserts of the Rube Goldberg Machine were filmed as well as a scene featuring Mulder and Scully discussing the episode's back-story. The latter, which was filmed several months after the rest of the episode, required Anderson to wear a wig because her hair style had substantially changed.|$|E

500|$|During these years, Carte was {{not just}} the manager of the theatre. He was a full {{participant}} in the producing partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, involved in casting and finding designers; in charge of publicity; directing and hiring designers for the non-Gilbert works, including the many companion pieces (sometimes with the help of assistants); and casting, directing and rehearsing the touring companies, among other duties. According to Henry Lytton, [...] "Mr. Carte was a great stage manager. He could take in the details of a scene with one sweep of his eagle eye and say unerringly just what was wrong." [...] The quality of Carte's productions created a national and international taste for them, and he sent touring companies throughout the British provinces, to America (generally managed by Helen), Europe and elsewhere. Queen Victoria honoured the company by calling for a Royal Command Performance of The Gondoliers at Windsor Castle in 1891. Following the libretto closely, she noticed additions to the text made by some of the actors and asked Carte to explain why this was done. Carte replied that they [...] "are what we call 'gags'". The queen answered that she had always understood that [...] "gags <b>were</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were put by authority into people's mouths." [...] Carte rejoined, [...] "These gags, Your Majesty, are things people put into their own mouths without authority." [...] George Bernard Shaw, writing in The World in October 1893, stated: ...|$|E

That was a protest idea and inspiration. I was trying to inspire Black people to move up higher. Don't be satisfied with the mediocre...Before the freedom fights started, before the Martin Luther King days, I had to lead a lot of protest meetings. In order to get my message over, there <b>were</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were almost dangerous to say, but you could sing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show's theme song, [...] "Tossed Salads and Scrambled Eggs", is sung by Grammer and {{is played}} over the closing credits of each episode. Composer Bruce Miller, {{who had also}} {{composed}} for Wings, was asked to avoid explicitly mentioning any subjects related to the show such as radio or psychiatry. After Miller finished the music, lyricist Darryl Phinnesse suggested the title as they <b>were</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were, like Frasier Crane's patients, [...] "mixed up". The lyrics indirectly refer to Crane's radio show; [...] "I hear the blues a-callin", for example, refers to troubled listeners who call the show. Grammer recorded several variations of the final spoken line of the theme which were rotated among for each episode. Other than season finales, a short, silent scene, often revisiting a small subplot aside from the central story of the episode, [...] appears with the credits and song, which the actors performed without written dialogue based on the scriptwriter's suggestion.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2001, Cuccurullo {{was asked}} to leave the band so that the {{original}} members of Duran Duran could reunite. At first the split was amicable, hinging on a financial settlement which granted him compensation from the band's forthcoming reunion album (to which he was not expected to contribute). Two years later relations soured considerably during the reunited band's American tour {{when he was asked}} by management not to attend the Los Angeles show after the band had invited him (no reason was given), and he began confirming some of the rumors that had spread about the 2001 split. Cuccurullo claimed that he was fired from Duran Duran by letter because Rhodes and Le Bon feared his reaction, though he told Duran Duran biographer Steve Malins: [...] "I would never get aggressive in a situation like that. There <b>were</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> had to be sorted out in a professional manner, so, that's what I did.". Cucurrullo remained on good terms with Rhodes however, and in 2013 they released an album containing material from their side project TV Mania.|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2003 interview, Maida {{explained}} that lyrically, his {{words on the}} album would follow the music and would be very much {{a product of the}} times. [...] "I think it's {{going to be a little}} more raw, a little bit more in your face, not a lot of relationship stuff," [...] he says, noting that fans would get a preview of a couple of the tracks, [...] "Wipe That Smile Off Your Face" [...] and [...] "Walking In Circles", on the current tour. [...] "My head, with what's going on in the world and being able to reflect on all the (stuff) that I've done in the last few years in terms of going to Iraq, working very closely with War Child, I'm in that mode. I'm not angry, but kind of frustrated." [...] After observing the plight in Sudan and Darfur, Maida returned with a different outlook on his lyrics and became more outspoken. “There were some [...] that were way too over the top and preachy,” he admits, “and I had to pull a lot of stuff back. This isn’t a solo record for me, this is Our Lady Peace, so I have three people that I contend with in terms of how far I can go with saying things.” Bassist Coutts added [...] "A lot of things he was talking about lyrically <b>were</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we discussed as a band in spending all that time together. I also think that becoming a father also let him deal with issues that he hadn't dealt with before. Although there are some of the darkest lyrics ever on this record, I think there are also some very positive ones as well." [...] The content of the album's lyrics have led it to be classified as a politically charged album, which the band hasn't denied.|$|E
