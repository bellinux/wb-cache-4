40|$|Web {{applications}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular for mobile <b>wireless</b> <b>PDAs.</b> However, web browsing on these systems can be quite slow. An alternative approach is handheld thin-client computing, in which the web browser and associated application logic run on a server, which then sends simple screen updates to the PDA for display. To assess the viability of this thin-client approach, we compare the web browsing performance of thin clients against fat clients that run the web browser locally on a PDA. Our results show that thin clients can provide better web browsing performance compared to fat clients, {{both in terms of}} speed and ability to correctly display web content. Surprisingly, thin clients are faster even when having to send more data over the network. We characterize and analyze different design choices in various thin-client systems and explain why these approaches can yield superior web browsing performance on mobile <b>wireless</b> <b>PDAs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{examines}} the widely cited claim that the network electricity use associated with a wireless personal digital assistant �PDA � {{is equal to the}} electricity consumed by a refrigerator. It compiles estimates of the data flows of wireless PDAs and related networks and allocates network and phone system electricity use based on these estimates. It also conducts sensitivity analyses to verify the robustness of these calculations. This analysis demonstrates that the network electricity use associated with a <b>wireless</b> <b>PDA</b> cannot equal that of a typical refrigerator, even under the most extreme assumptions. Our best-estimate case shows network electricity use for wireless PDAs of 0. 5 kW•h/year, and therefore claims that wireless PDAs use as much electricity as a refrigerator are too high by more than a factor of 1, 000. Even in our upper-limit assessment, the electricity used by a new U. S. refrigerator is about 100 times greater than the network electricity use associated with a <b>wireless</b> <b>PDA...</b>|$|E

40|$|WebSplitter {{symbolizes the}} union of {{pervasive}} multi-device computing and collaborative multi-user computing. WebSplitter provides a unified XML framework that enables multi-device and multi-user Web browsing. WebSplitter splits a requested Web page and delivers the appropriate partial view of each page to each user, or more accurately to each user's set of devices. Multiple users can participate in the same browsing session, as in traditional conferencing groupware. Depending on the access privileges of the user to the different components of content on each page, WebSplitter generates a personalized partial view. WebSplitter further splits the partial view among the devices available to each user, e. g. laptop, <b>wireless</b> <b>PDA,</b> projection display, stereo speakers, orchestrating a composite presentation across the devices. A <b>wireless</b> <b>PDA</b> can browse while remotely controlling the multimedia capabilities of nearby devices. The architecture consists of an XML metadata policy file defining access privileges to XML tags on a Web page, a middleware proxy that splits XML Web content to create partial views, and a client-side component, e. g. applet, enabling user login and reception of pushed browsing data. Service discovery finds and registers proxies, browsing sessions, and device capabilities. We demonstrate the feasibility of splitting the different tags in an XML Web page to different end users' browsers, and of pushing updates from the browsing session to heterogeneous devices, including a laptop and a PDA...|$|E
