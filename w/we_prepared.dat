500|$|Money is an {{important}} motivator for the characters: both Wilton and Nola come from modest backgrounds and wish to enter the Hewett family using their sex appeal. That family's secure position is demonstrated by their large country estate, and, early on in their relationships, both prospective spouses are supported by Mr. Hewett, Wilton with a position on [...] "one of his companies" [...] and Nola reports being [...] "swept off her feet" [...] by Hewett's attention and presents. Roger Ebert posed the film's underlying question as [...] "To what degree are <b>we</b> <b>prepared</b> to set aside our moral qualms in order to indulge in greed and selfishness? Wilton is facing a choice between greed and lust, but his sweet wife, Chloe, herself has no qualms about having her father essentially 'buy' her husband for her." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool {{improved}} their League performances {{over the next}} two years, finishing third in 1967–68 and then second in 1968–69, although to Shankly himself it was [...] "a mediocre time in the late 1960s as <b>we</b> <b>prepared</b> for the 1970s". Shankly made two controversial signings in this period which did not turn out as he had hoped. In 1967, he signed striker Tony Hateley from Chelsea for a club record £96,000 and then felt obliged to transfer him to Coventry City only a year later. He claimed bad luck and injuries disrupted the progress of two other prospects Alf Arrowsmith and Gordon Wallace; Shankly compared the latter to Tom Finney. In September 1968, Shankly paid £100,000 to Wolverhampton Wanderers for their teenage striker Alun Evans who thus became [...] "football's first £100,000 teenager". Evans started well and produced some outstanding performances during his four years at the club but Shankly eventually had to sell him to Aston Villa. Shankly recalled that Evans was scarred by a glass in a nightclub incident which, in Shankly's opinion, had a detrimental impact on his career.|$|E
500|$|When night {{began to}} fall, we climbed into our boats and floated down the Danube and crossed {{over to the}} other side several miles below the place where Vlad's army was stationed. There we dug {{ourselves}} trenches, so that cavalry could not harm us. After that we crossed back {{over to the other}} side and transported other janissaries over the Danube, and when the entire infantry had crossed over, then <b>we</b> <b>prepared</b> and set out gradually against Vlad's army, together with the artillery and other equipment that we had brought with us. Having halted, we set up the cannon, but not in time to stop three hundred janissaries from being killed ... Seeing that our side was greatly weakening, we defended ourselves with the 120 guns which we had brought over and fired so often that we repelled the prince's army and greatly strengthened our position ... Vlad, seeing that he could not prevent the crossing, withdrew. After that the emperor crossed the Danube with his entire army and gave us 30,000 coins to be distributed among us.|$|E

500|$|U2's {{delivery}} of Zooropa in late May caught PolyGram somewhat off-guard, {{because they were}} not expecting a new album by the group for several years. With Achtung Baby, PolyGram had approximately six months to market the record and plan its release strategy, but the sudden completion of Zooropa necessitated a more hurried promotional plan. PolyGram president/CEO Rick Dobbis explained: [...] "For the last one, <b>we</b> <b>prepared</b> for six months. It was like a marathon. But this is like a sprint, and that is the spirit it was made in. The band was so excited about it, they sprinted to complete the album before the ... tour. We want to bring it to the street with that same spirit." [...] Island/PolyGram's and U2's marketing for Zooropa was intended to focus less on singles and more on the record as a whole, and ultimately, only three singles were released, compared to Achtung Babys five singles. The first single [...] "Numb" [...] was released in June 1993 exclusively on VHS as a [...] "video single". The music video was directed by Kevin Godley. The song peaked at number seven in Australia and number nine in Canada, while reaching number two on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. However, it failed to chart on the singles charts in the UK or US.|$|E

In the group there were 12 Chechen men, two Chechen women, nine Ingush, three Russians, two Arabs, two Ossetians, one Tartar, one Kabardinian and one Guran.

Louden-Brown, consultant to the Cameron film, has stated that he thought this characterisation of Ismay was unfair {{and he tried to}} challenge this.

Are <b>we</b> <b>prepared</b> to see France do its work instead and take action in Germany? – {{or are we going to}} sit sanctimoniously on the fence, disapproving, but secretly relieved?

The Captain answered, and now a regular conversation commenced. He requested them to come alongside, and the reply was, [...] " [...] We have no boat hook to hold on by." [...] "I will throw you a rope" [...] said the Captain. [...] "If you do we have nothing to make it fast to" [...] was the answer. However, they at length came on board, exemplifying not the least fear, but their astonishment was unbounded." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the 1955 general election, Attlee {{retired as}} leader. Bevan contested the {{leadership}} against both Morrison and Labour right-winger Hugh Gaitskell, {{but it was}} Gaitskell who emerged victorious. Bevan's remark that [...] "I know {{the right kind of}} political Leader for the Labour Party is a kind of desiccated calculating machine" [...] was assumed to refer to Gaitskell, although Bevan denied it (commenting upon Gaitskell's record as Chancellor of the Exchequer as having [...] "proved" [...] this). However, Gaitskell was prepared to make Bevan Shadow Colonial Secretary, and then Shadow Foreign Secretary in 1956. Bevan was as critical of the Egyptian dictator Colonel Nasser's seizure of the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956 as he was of the subsequent Anglo-French military response. He compared Nasser with Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. He was a vocal critic of the Conservative government's actions in the Suez Crisis, noticeably delivering high-profile speeches in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956 at a protest rally, and criticising the government's actions and arguments in Commons on 5 December 1956. At the Trafalgar rally, Bevan accused the government of a [...] "policy of bankruptcy and despair". Bevan stated at the Trafalgar rally: We are stronger than Egypt but there are other countries stronger than us. Are <b>we</b> <b>prepared</b> to accept for ourselves the logic we are applying to Egypt? If nations more powerful than ourselves accept the absence of principle, the anarchistic attitude of Eden and launch bombs on London, what answer have we got, what complaint have we got? If we are going to appeal to force, if force is to be the arbiter to which we appeal, it would at least make common sense to try to make sure beforehand that we have got it, even if you accept that abysmal logic, that decadent point of view.We are in fact in the position today of having appealed to force {{in the case of a}} small nation, where if it is appealed to against us it will result in the destruction of Great Britain, not only as a nation, but as an island containing living men and women. Therefore I say to Anthony, I say to the British government, there is no count at all upon which they can be defended.They have besmirched the name of Britain. They have made us ashamed of the things of which formerly we were proud. They have offended against every principle of decency and there is only one way in which they can even begin to restore their tarnished reputation and that is to get out! Get out! Get out!
