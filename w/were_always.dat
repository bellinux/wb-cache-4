5|$|Although it is {{believed}} that relations between Umar and Khalid, cousins, <b>were</b> <b>always</b> something short of cordial, both of them apparently harboured no ill-will towards each other. Upon his death, he bequeathed his property to Umar and made him the executor of his will and estate.|$|E

5|$|Lemmons {{was full}} of impossibly glamorous older people and a core commune of writers, {{painters}} and inventors; even the dogs and cats shared a communal basket, and there <b>were</b> <b>always</b> stray writers and publishers whose marriages were unravelling. The drink flowed as freely as an open artery at family dinners.|$|E
5|$|The 1969 {{tour was}} a three Test series. The captains were Ray Illingworth for England and Sobers for the West Indies. The West Indies had an ageing team and, with Sobers {{suffering}} {{a loss of}} form, <b>were</b> <b>always</b> the weaker side.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the loaned {{locomotives}} {{and passenger}} carriages, the LNC owned its dedicated hearse vans outright. Despite this, they <b>were</b> <b>always</b> painted in whichever colour scheme was currently in {{use by the}} LSWR (SR after 1923), to match the livery of the passenger cars and locomotives loaned to the LNC.|$|E

50|$|In Marx's view, {{consciousness}} <b>was</b> <b>always</b> political, for it <b>was</b> <b>always</b> {{the outcome}} of politic-economic circumstances. What one thinks of life, power, and self, for Marx, <b>is</b> <b>always</b> a product of ideological forces.|$|R

5|$|All {{bodies were}} in similar flexed {{positions}} lying on their left sides with knees raised up towards their chin. In comparison, most bodies excavated from Egypt {{dating to the}} predynastic period are in a similar position, however at Merimda Beni Salama and El-Amra bodies were found on their right sides. From the time these bodies were buried up until the Middle Kingdom period, the dead were laid on their sides. After this period they were buried on their backs (dorsal position), and from the Fifth Dynasty the bodies <b>were</b> <b>always</b> fully extended.|$|E
5|$|Although pranks that {{involved}} public locations, figures, and organisations <b>were</b> <b>always</b> {{a feature of}} the series, the APEC pranks yielded unprecedented local and international publicity, both positive and negative. Some team members faced charges for breaching the APEC zone, but these were dropped because police had allowed their entry into the restricted zone. Other less controversial and less publicised stunts were also shown on The Chaser's War on Everything, with ratings peaking at almost three million Australian viewers for the APEC wrap-up episode.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{population}} statistics, Villani {{also offered}} statistics on education. He wrote that {{boys and girls}} learning to read numbered 8,000 to 10,000 each year. There were 1,000 to 1,200 children learning to use the abacus and algorism for mathematics. In the four large, prestigious schools of Florence, there <b>were</b> <b>always</b> 550 to 600 students in attendance to learn proper grammar and scholastic logic.|$|E

5|$|Mary met {{her husband}} in Zagreb on 4July. She officially {{remained}} Sigismund's co-ruler {{until the end of}} her life, but her influence on government was minimal. Sigismund's land grants <b>were</b> <b>always</b> confirmed with Mary's own great seal {{during the first year of}} their common rule, but thereafter the grantees rarely sought her confirmation. Royal charters counted her regnal years not from her ascension, but from her husband's coronation. Nevertheless, Mary persuaded her husband to torture and execute John Horvat who was captured in July 1394 although Sigismund would have been willing to spare his life.|$|E
5|$|Poedjangga Baroe paid {{subscribers}} <b>were</b> <b>always</b> {{fewer than}} 150. According to historian Heather Sutherland, this low circulation {{was rooted in}} several cultural factors. Firstly, the native populace at the time had limited literacy and education. Secondly, native intellectuals mainly spoke Dutch during formal discourse, while others kept to local languages; this led to comprehension issues for the Indonesian-language Poedjangga Baroe.|$|E
5|$|The {{rearward}} {{of the two}} ports {{was fitted}} with plumbing to allow the station to be refueled by unmanned Progress spacecraft. These freighters, which brought supplies and extra equipment to keep the station replenished, helped ensure that the crew <b>were</b> <b>always</b> {{able to carry out}} useful scientific work aboard the station. In all, twelve Progress flights delivered over 20tonnes of equipment, supplies and fuel.|$|E

5|$|Union {{infantry}} attacked {{from the}} east side of the battlefield, while most of the cavalry attacked from the south and west. Capehart's brigade attacked from the southwest, and eventually was on the extreme western side of the battlefield. At times, the cavalry fought dismounted, with their horses led at a safe distance behind. The opposing forces <b>were</b> <b>always</b> within range of the Union cavalry carbines, keeping the weapon's seven-shot advantage—and not enabling the Confederate infantry to utilize the advantage of their longer range weapons.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completing}} training McKellar {{was deemed}} to have exceptional eyesight which {{earned him a}} reputation as a good marksman in air-to-air combat. Yet, paradoxically, when shooting with his rifle he was a well below average shot – a trait he shared with some other successful pilots. MacKellar was a keen sportsman. He believed physical fitness was a critical attribute in aerial combat; fitness, he believed, would ensure that the mind and body <b>were</b> <b>always</b> at their peak of alertness, and enable a pilot to react swiftly within a fluid battle situation.|$|E
5|$|With {{the economy}} {{so focused on}} one crop, Mobile's {{fortunes}} <b>were</b> <b>always</b> tied to those of cotton, and the city weathered many financial crises. Mobile slaveholders owned relatively few slaves compared to planters in the upland plantation areas, but many households had domestic slaves, and many other slaves worked on the waterfront and on riverboats. The last slaves to enter the United States from the African trade were brought to Mobile on the slave ship Clotilde. Among them was Cudjoe Lewis, who in the 1920s was the last survivor of the slave trade.|$|E
50|$|Normal females <b>are</b> <b>always</b> of {{genotype}} Dw/-, while dwarf females <b>are</b> <b>always</b> of genotype dw/-, because female is the heterogametic sex {{having only}} one Z chromosome. That is, females carrying a sex-linked gene of dwarfism <b>are</b> <b>always</b> pure and exhibit the trait. On the other hand, normal males may be either homozygous Dw/Dw or heterozygous Dw/dw, but dwarf males <b>are</b> <b>always</b> homozygous dw/dw.|$|R

5|$|A {{tower was}} {{built out of}} {{the remains of the}} roof, similar to one that had existed at Claremont Road, and a system of defences and {{blockades}} were built. A core of around 30 protesters ensured that there <b>were</b> <b>always</b> people staying there (a legal requirement for a squatted home, as well as a defence against eviction). They were finally evicted on 21 June 1995, whereupon, as at Claremont Road, the building was immediately demolished. The total cost of removing the protesters from Munstonia was given to be £239,349.52, not including additional costs of security guards.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, Sam took up {{an offer}} from Dee to become Professor of Natural Philosophy at Glasgow University. In Glasgow, the Currans, {{together}} with a few friends, set up the Scottish Society for the Parents of Mentally Handicapped Children (Enable), which eventually grew to 100 branches and more than 5000 members. Later, when Joan {{was a member of}} the Greater Glasgow Health Board and the Scottish Special Housing Association, the needs of the disabled <b>were</b> <b>always</b> at the forefront of her mind, and she did much to promote their welfare. She took a close interest in the work of the Council for Access for the Disabled and helped improve the range of facilities, especially for disabled university students.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women <b>were</b> <b>always</b> welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
