5|$|According {{to friends}} and family, he had {{extensive}} historical knowledge and was deeply disillusioned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> communist Poland. He supported the protesting students during the March 1968 Polish political crisis in Poland, printing bibuła leaflets and asking his daughter to distribute them. According to health professionals, he was of sound mind, and fully rational, {{at the time of}} his suicide. Siwiec planned his self-immolation months in advance, writing out a last will in April, and leaving written and tape-recorded statements explaining his revulsion at both the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of Poland's participation in it.|$|E
25|$|Brenner, {{torn between}} hope and despair, {{struggled}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the Zionist enterprise in the Land of Israel. Agnon, Brenner's contemporary, fused {{his knowledge of}} Jewish heritage with the influence of 19th and early 20th century European literature. He produced fiction dealing with the disintegration of traditional ways of life, loss of faith, and the subsequent loss of identity. In 1966, Agnon was co-recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature.|$|E
25|$|Once victims {{leave their}} perpetrator, {{they can be}} stunned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> {{the extent to which}} the abuse has taken away their autonomy. Due to {{economic}} abuse and isolation, the victim usually has very little money of their own and few people on whom they can rely when seeking help. This has been shown to be one of the greatest obstacles facing victims of DV, and the strongest factor that can discourage them from leaving their perpetrators.|$|E

25|$|Reviews have {{praised the}} novel's realism, {{believable}} characters and dialogue, {{sense of place}} and {{the complexity of the}} novel. The Guardian picked out Pelecano's ability to provide authentic voices for his characters but criticised instances where the narrative voice was inconsistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the character. Other reviewers have commented that the gory detail and social realism may be offputting for some readers. The New York Times commented that the blaming of some of the characters' behaviour on the absence of father figures may be an oversimplification.|$|E
25|$|Training and {{preparing}} for war also involves significant dangers, as do other military duties. Consequently, many military brats live <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> risk to one or both parents even {{when there is no}} active war. Peacetime military accidents claim lives every year at a significantly higher rate than accidents for the civilian population; some service professions such as military pilots, paratroopers and other airborne soldiers, aircraft carrier flight deck workers, Coast Guard sea rescue, ordnance or munitions workers, Naval firefighters, as well as those training or drilling in live ammunition exercises, all experience higher annual death rates. Such casualties are difficult, if not impossible, to keep hidden from children or teenagers in small base communities.|$|E
25|$|Unger's ideas {{developed}} in a context where young intellectuals and radicals attempted to reconcile the conventional theories of society and law being taught in university classrooms <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> social protest and revolution of the 1960s and 70s. Disillusioned with Marxism, they turned to thinkers like Levi-Strauss, Gramsci, Habermas, and Foucault in attempt to situate understandings of law and society as a benign science of technocratic policy within a broader system of beliefs that legitimized the prevailing social order. Unlike Habermas, however, who formulates procedures for attaining rational consensus, Unger locates resolution in institutions and their arrangements that remain perpetually open to revision and reconstruction. And, unlike Foucault, who also emphasizes the constructed character of social life, Unger takes {{this as an opportunity}} to reimagine institutions and social conditions that will unleash human creativity and enable liberation.|$|E

25|$|Beginning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> disaster, Lamentations {{concludes with}} the bitter {{possibility}} that God may have finally rejected Israel (chapter 5:22). Sufferers {{in the face}} of grief are not urged to a confidence in the goodness of God; in fact God is accountable for the disaster. The poet acknowledges that this suffering is a just punishment, still God is held to have had choice over whether to act in this way and at this time. Hope arises from a recollection of God's past goodness, but although this justifies a cry to God to act in deliverance, {{there is no guarantee that}} he will. Repentance will not persuade God to be gracious, since he is free to give or withhold grace as he chooses. In the end, the possibility is that God has finally rejected his people and may not again deliver them: if God is predictable, then God is just a tool of humans. Nevertheless, it also affirms confidence that the mercies of Yahweh (the God of Israel) never end, but are new every morning (3:22–33).|$|E
25|$|Ruiz de Burton uses {{irony and}} satire to mock American {{political}} discourses and practices by ridiculing socio-political {{structures of the}} period. Using a variety of rogues, who have pretentious and comical names, Ruiz de Burton represents the vices of nineteenth-century middle-class society. The preachers, Mr. Hackwell and Mr. Hammerhard, the neighbors, the Cackles, and other political figures in Who Would Have Thought It? are unmasked to break down ideological myths of American political rhetoric by contrasting {{the expectations of the}} nation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> their actions. American expectations include promoting civil virtue and acting against corruption. However, Mr. Hackwell, the primary religious figure in the novel, schemes to increase his wealth in order to satisfy his ravenous greed. The Cackles clan represents Northern politicians who are only motivated by self-interest. Ruiz de Burton implies that the national practice of self-deception, misrepresentation and secrecy are deeply rooted in the American character, though very rarely revealed. Juxtaposed to this satire of American life are the virtues of the good and beautiful Lola.|$|E
25|$|Towards this end, Hamilton {{added to}} the Committee local {{attorney}} Hughes Spalding, chairman of the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority, which owned and operated Grady Memorial Hospital. Hamilton and Spalding proposed the separate but equal black facility, in spite of leaders {{in the black community}} pressing for full integration in society. Hamilton saw it as a beginning, but black leaders saw it as being out of touch <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the times. The Hospital Authority donated the land for the hospital site, adjacent to Grady. Spalding won endorsements from county commissioners of Fulton and DeKalb, as well as the Fulton County Medical Society and area newspapers, which helped promote the concept. By 1949, $1.725 million in funds had been raised, with the remaining funding to come from the state and the Hospital Authority. Ground was broken on February 1, 1950. Named the Hughes Spalding Pavilion, it was dedicated May 29, 1952. Hamilton was named as secretary to the advisory board of trustees. In 1955, Hamilton and black members of Atlanta's legal and medical community organized Foundation for the Advancement of Medical and Nursing Education, with Hamilton as secretary. The foundation raised $10,000. No one applied for the money. Black interns could not serve at Grady. The United States Public Health Service provided $40,000 in surgery grants.|$|E

500|$|Alexander Nasmyth (1758–1840) {{trained in}} the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh under Runciman. He visited Italy, where he met with More, and worked in London, but {{returned}} to his native Edinburgh {{for most of his}} career. He produced work in a large range of forms, including his portrait of Romantic poet Robert Burns, which depicts him against a dramatic Scottish background, but he is chiefly remembered for his landscapes and is described in the Oxford Dictionary of Art as [...] "the founder of the Scottish landscape tradition". He produced both urban landscapes, like Edinburgh from Caton Hill (1825), which put Edinburgh its geological context, and rural scenes such as Castle Huntly and The Tay (c. 1800). His works combined Claudian principles of an ideal landscape <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> Scottish topography.|$|E

Solowoniuk was confirmed to have the disease, which causes anything from numbness in the limbs to paralysis or loss of vision, in January 1999. His neurologist prescribed him medication {{that he would have to}} self inject three times a week, possibly for the rest of his life. Although it was a struggle for Solowoniuk to come to terms <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the disease, going to numerous doctor appointments and touring with a mini-fridge in their van has become normal routine.

500|$|Other {{critics were}} more positive. The New Statesmans Robert Potts found the stories [...] "entertaining and {{intriguing}} for readers familiar with their background {{and with the}} genre", {{and for the most}} part charmingly innocent, [...] "especially when compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> boarding-school life". [...] The evocation of adolescent homoeroticism was deliberate and playful rather than pornographic. In a similar vein, Richard Canning in The Independent found the Willow Gables fiction vibrant, well-constructed and entertaining, and praised Larkin's [...] "sly Sapphic spin". In a more recent analysis Terry Castle, writing in the journal Daedalus, disagrees profoundly with the notion expressed by Adam Kirsch in The Times Literary Supplement, that the publication of the Coleman works was damaging to Larkin's reputation. On the contrary, argues Castle, [...] "the Brunette phase speaks volumes about the paradoxical process by which Philip Larkin became 'Larkinesque'—modern English poetry's reigning bard of erotic frustration and depressive (if verse-enabling) self-deprecation".|$|E
