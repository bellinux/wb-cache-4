5|$|Centuries after Lisa's death, Mona Lisa {{became the}} world's most famous {{painting}} and {{took on a}} life separate from Lisa, the woman. Speculation by scholars and hobbyists made the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> a globally recognized icon and an object of commercialization. In 2005, Lisa was definitively identified {{as the model for}} the Mona Lisa.|$|E
5|$|Funerary art is any <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> forming, or placed in, a {{repository}} for {{the remains of}} the dead.

Banksy unveiled {{at least one}} <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> daily, documenting it on both a dedicated website and an Instagram account. The majority of the works were stencil graffiti and chiefly political, a distinctive characteristic of Banksy. Other pieces and multimedia exhibits toyed with dark humor and satire.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{a larger}} {{beautification}} plan for the Midway Plaisance, Time was constructed from {{a new type of}} molded, steel-reinforced concrete that was claimed to be more durable and cheaper than alternatives.

Before the completion of Millennium Park in 2004, it was considered the most important installation in the Chicago Park District. Time is one of several Chicago works of art funded by Benjamin Ferguson's trust fund.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps no <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> so {{imperfect}} ever announced {{such power}} in the artist—perhaps no artist so powerful ever rested his fame on so imperfect a production—as Thalaba. The author calls it a metrical romance; he might have called it a lyrical one; for the story is told, as in an ode, by implication; not directly, as in an epopoeia. It is a gallery of successive pictures. Each is strikingly descriptive... but the personages, like the figures of landscape-painters, are often almost lost in the scene: they appear as the episodical or accessory objects.|$|E

40|$|The master's thesis {{deals with}} the ways modern <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> can stimulate the {{development}} of empathy among pupils. The survey presented in the theoretical part is accompanied by the explanation of the term empathy and the ways people can emphatically react to understanding and accepting emotions coming from the <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b> Following is the presentation <b>of</b> how <b>art</b> lessons and reactions to <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> can encourage pupils to think about values and standpoints, in order to sharpen their sensitivity to emotions and therefore increase their empathy. Next is a detailed explanation {{of ways in which}} visiting art galleries and developing competence help pupils to interpret <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b> A few examples of good practice of analysing and evaluating <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> in numerous art galleries and museums are presented. Additionally, the appreciation and understanding <b>of</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> as a way of guided interpretation, developed by the Getty museum in Los Angeles, is researched. Moreover, the teaching methods of the founder of museum pedagogics in Slovenia, which are applicable to educational work in museums and galleries, are dealt with. The Tate Modern approach Ways In is discussed in more detail. In order to develop empathy in pupils through <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> several examples <b>of</b> cross-curriculum teaching are provided. A selection <b>of</b> Slovene contemporary <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> that help develop empathy is included in the next section. Selected are the examples with appropriate content and communicativeness that may be used in cross-curricular teaching, in order to help increase empathy among pupils. Analyses <b>of</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> by Vladimir Leben, Vesna Bukovec and Uroš Weinberger are presented. The methods used in analysing the <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> are the following: formal analysis (focused on visual and physical aspects of artwork), iconographic-iconological method (focused on artwork content and meaning) and contextual analysis (focused on the contextual interpretation of artwork). Curriculum goals are taken into consideration in order to provide a thorough experience <b>of</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b> According to curriculum guidelines, several sets of questions for individual <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> encouraging pupils to increase empathy, have been put together...|$|R
5|$|Poe eschewed the {{scientific}} method in Eureka and instead wrote from pure intuition. For this reason, he considered it a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> not science, but insisted that it was still true and considered it to be his career masterpiece. Even so, Eureka is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions ignored Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets.|$|E
5|$|Yūgen (幽玄, {{profound}} sublimity): Yūgen is {{a concept}} valued in various forms of art throughout Japanese culture. Originally used to mean elegance or grace representing the perfect beauty in waka, yūgen is invisible beauty that is felt rather than seen in a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b> The term is used specifically in relation to Noh to mean the profound beauty of the transcendental world, including mournful beauty involved in sadness and loss.|$|E

In {{a letter to}} the editor of The New York Times, he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to September Morn status as a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> whereas Gerald Carson, writing in American Heritage, attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.|$|E

5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless is a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b> It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why {{they did what they}} did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E

5|$|Van Meegeren {{felt that}} his genius had been misjudged, {{and he set}} out to prove to the art critics that he could not only copy the style of the Dutch masters in his paintings, but produce a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> so {{magnificent}} that it would rival the works of master painters. He moved with Jo to the South of France and began preparations for this ultimate forgery, which took him six years, from 1932 to 1937. In a series of early exercises, he forged works by Frans Hals, Pieter de Hooch, Gerard ter Borch, and Johannes Vermeer. Finally, he chose to forge a painting by Vermeer as his masterpiece. Vermeer had not been particularly well-known until {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century; his works were both extremely valuable and scarce — only about 35 had survived.|$|E
5|$|After Cage {{finished}} {{teaching at}} the New School {{in the summer of}} 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street that she used as a studio and living space. Supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society, Ono allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961, with people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending, and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be Stepped On, which was a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.|$|E

5|$|Following the destruction, the Munneswaram Pattuva area {{came under}} the control of the {{expanding}} Kingdom of Sitawaka, led by its king Rajasinghe I (1581–1593), who continuously harassed the Portuguese during his reign. Rajasinghe I rebuilt the temple again, but due to continuous conflict most of the area around the temple was depopulated, and proper cultivation of lands abandoned. Irrigation tanks, which provided water for cultivation, fell into disuse. The Portuguese again destroyed the temple in the early 17th century, but the temple was rebuilt by the local people. It was nominally in usage when Kirti Sri Rajasinha (1747–1782) of the Kandyan Kingdom had the superstructure rebuilt in the 1750s. The Kalasam or Kotha on top was made of silver, a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> displaying affinity to South India's Dravidian architecture. The kumbhabhishekham (consecration) ceremonies were performed in the year 1753, and for the performance of daily and special rites of the temple, Kirti Sri Rajasinghe made a grant of lands to the priests, recorded through a copper plate in 1753.|$|E

The first statue of Leif (by Anne Whitney) was erected in Boston in 1887 at the instigation of Eben Norton Horsford, who was among those who believed that Vinland could have been located on the Charles River or Cape Cod; not long after, another casting of Whitney's statue was erected in Milwaukee. A statue was also erected in Chicago in 1901, having been originally commissioned for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition to coincide with the arrival of the reconstructed Viking ship from Bergen, Norway. Another <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> made for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, the painting Leiv Eiriksson oppdager Amerika by Christian Krohg, was in the possession of a Leif Erikson Memorial Association in Chicago before being given back to the National Gallery of Norway in 1900.|$|E
