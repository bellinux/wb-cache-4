5|$|The game's use of The Simpsons-style humor {{received}} a mixed reception. Both GameSpot and GameTrailers {{said that the}} game delivered more than enough laughs to make it worth playing through at least once. It was considered enjoyable for both hardcore and casual The Simpsons fans by IGN and GameDaily, who also called it a particularly appealing game for diehard fans. Despite the few problems that the game had, GameSpy said that it <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> to see the humorous parodies. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, however, believed that the game's humor could only carry it so far, and suggested that those interested in The Simpsons humor should purchase a box set {{of one of the}} television series' seasons instead. Joe Juba of Game Informer called the game an average experience. He elaborated that the game would appeal primarily to fans of the television series, but would not be worth playing for people unfamiliar with it.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} on The Don Lane Show, Lane also hosted a morning radio program with Bert Newton on radio station 3UZ in Melbourne. Newton tells a story of how he and the {{producer}} pretended to be on-air and gave out Lane's home address to the listeners. Newton claims that the joke <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> to see Lane's reaction but that Lane repaid him for the practical joke. The program on 3UZ had many guests who had also appeared on the television show the night before. When moving to Sydney in 1987, Lane hosted a morning show on 2UE for two years. After ending his affiliation with 2UE, he moved to 2KY and hosted a competing breakfast program in 1989. His radio programs usually involved music and interviews with visiting entertainers.|$|E
25|$|The Republic of Texas era {{with the}} Indians {{can be divided}} into three phases: the {{diplomacy}} of Houston during his first term, the hostility of Lamar, and the resumed diplomatic efforts of Houston's second term. Sam Houston led the Republic to negotiate with the Comanche. They said they would stop raiding if they were given sufficient amounts of what they considered prerequisites for peaceful relations: gifts, trade, and regular face-to-face diplomacy. Houston, who enjoyed a good reputation among Indians, had married a mixed-race woman of Cherokee descent. He had lived in Indian Territory for years and learned about their cultures. He was willing to meet with the Comanche on their terms and believed, as a matter of policy, that it <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> to buy a few thousand dollars worth of presents. The Republic could not support the huge cost of a standing army for defense, and it {{might not be able to}} defeat the assembled might of the entire Comanche-Kiowa alliance, especially if they received Mexican help.|$|E

25|$|In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis {{stated that}} he at first regretted writing Scar Tissue saying “I did regret the book for a while as there was some pain caused then, I started seeing the long term {{positive}} reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools and it was having a positive effect. I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E
500|$|Rosenbaum's {{return as}} Lex Luthor {{was met with}} {{positive}} critical reception. Jensen felt that Rosenbaum's cameo was too short, but that it <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> to see him play Lex one last time. Carabott felt that the scene between Lex and Clark was [...] "worth the wait". Dyess-Nugent praised Rosenbaum's acting, arguing that it shook [...] "the show awake, sending the needle hurtling rudely into the red zone". He ultimately stated that Rosenbaum's acting—in both the finale and the series as a whole—was [...] "one of the great TV series performances of the past 10 years and proof once again that talent will blossom in the least expected places".|$|E
500|$|In Paris, Slidell {{had been}} {{approached}} by the banking firm Erlanger et Cie. [...] The company offered {{to float a loan}} to benefit the Confederacy. The proposed terms provided a large commission to Erlanger and would entitle the bondholder to cotton at a discounted price once the South won the war. Baron Frederic Emile d'Erlanger, head of the firm, journeyed to Richmond in early 1863, and negotiated with Benjamin, although the transaction properly fell within the jurisdiction of Treasury Secretary Memminger. The banker softened the terms somewhat, though they were still lucrative for his firm. [...] Benjamin felt the deal <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it,</b> as it would provide the Confederacy with badly needed funds to pay its agents in Europe.|$|E

500|$|Keith DeCandido, in a 2012 {{review for}} Tor.com, gave the episode {{a score of}} 7 out of 10. He said that the {{majority}} of the guest cast were [...] "pretty nowhere", but that the backbone of the episode was Lenard portraying Sarek, [...] "one of the most beloved recurring roles in the franchise's history, and this episode is a beautiful illustration of why". He called the telepathy plot [...] "dopey sci-fi stuff", but praised the direction of Landau in—among others—the concert scene, which he called a [...] "tour de force". He said, however, that the standout part of the episode was the interaction of Stewart and Lenard, who he referred to as [...] "two great actors at the absolute top of their game". He said that [...] "Stewart simply owns the mind-meld, a turbulent, raw scene that leaves the character of Sarek completely exposed, and Stewart sells it amazingly. At that point, the plot contrivances are forgotten, as you realize that the whole episode <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> to watch this amazing scene".|$|E
500|$|In the {{alternate}} timeline, Shannon {{does not go}} back with Boone. In [...] "LA X", Boone goes back alone on Flight 815 and sits beside Locke, where he finds out about Locke supposedly going on a Walkabout in Australia. In a parallel with the island timeline, Boone tells Locke if they crashed, he would follow him. Once the plane lands, Boone shakes Locke's hand and exits the plane. Boone reappears in the final episode of Lost. In [...] "The End", we see Hurley and Sayid talking in a car on a dark street, and they witness a thug beating up a guy (Boone) outside of a bar. Shannon shouts [...] "Leave my brother alone," [...] and Sayid {{gets out of the}} car to intervene. His and Shannon's memories are restored the moment they touch. Boone, having conspired with Hurley to bring Shannon and Sayid together, wanders over to the car. He jokes with Hurley about how he had to take a beating and [...] "thanks for taking your time." [...] He also comments how difficult it was to get Shannon to return from Australia with him, but he and Hurley agree the effort <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> for this moment to have her and Sayid's memories restored. Boone is one of the first people Jack greets in the church where everyone reunites to move on to the afterlife together.|$|E
500|$|Russo was not {{involved}} in the selection of the sourced songs used throughout the show, with Hawley already knowing the songs he wanted to use and working with music supervisor Maggie Phillips to get the license for them. With the influence of Pink Floyd's music on both Hawley and Russo, Hawley wanted to use their music in the season's finale, as Phillips noted it [...] "never quite fit in the other episodes". He chose the songs [...] "Breathe" [...] and [...] "On the Run", as [...] "they flow into each other on the record. There’s no pause in between those songs. So {{there was no way to}} go with just one song." [...] This posed an issue with the series' budget that became the hardest licensing struggle for the series. Phillips described [...] "an extremely difficult negotiation process, but we were working with some great people that recognized what we were doing was interesting. We ended up getting a price that we were able to persuade FX <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it.</b> But, it took months." [...] The songs were confirmed on the day of the final sound mix for the show. In case the songs could not have been secured, Hawley asked Phillips to choose an alternative from the works of The Flaming Lips. Phillips said she was [...] "not a huge fan of Flaming Lips, but I listened to every single song they’ve ever done". They ultimately decided that none of the songs would work for the sequence, so Russo composed original music to replace the Pink Floyd songs if necessary.|$|E

Commenting on the original development of the episode, series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane stated, [...] " [...] was the result of our ongoing desire to let the series stagnate, and kind of evolve things that may have run their course. There's only so many times you can do the Evil Monkey jumping out of that closet, before the joke gets old, and I think often times there's a fear to mess with what works, and change things permanently. [...] We literally retired the Evil Monkey in this episode, and got a great episode out of it, which <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it,</b> and kind of evolved the series in a way." [...] Singer and actress Candace Marie provided the voice of Miley Cyrus. Marie received the role when her producer alerted her of the audition, and she eventually received a call from the Family Guy casting director a month later. Even though the episode mocked Cyrus, Marie did not think she would upset any of Cyrus' fans. She added that she is a fan herself, and [...] "was very impressed by the way Family Guy developed the episode," [...] and thought it was [...] "a huge compliment for them to refer to Miley as the [...] "perfect popstar."" [...] After voicing Cyrus, Marie was called back to Family Guy to voice Meg's friend Beth for [...] "several upcoming episodes." [...] Marie described Beth as a girl that is [...] "rarely addressed in conversation but loves to chime in whenever she can."

2500|$|After a {{brief period}} of leave in Britain during 1958, Burgess took up a further Eastern post, this time at the Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin College in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei. Brunei had been a British {{protectorate}} since 1888, and was not to achieve independence until 1984. In the sultanate, Burgess sketched the novel that, when it was published in 1961, was to be entitled Devil of a State and, although it dealt with Brunei, for libel reasons the action had to be transposed to an imaginary East African territory similar to Zanzibar, named Dunia. In his autobiography Little Wilson and Big God (1987) Burgess wrote:"This novel was, is, about Brunei, which was renamed Naraka, Malay-Sanskrit for 'hell.' Little invention was needed to contrive a large cast of unbelievable characters and a number of interwoven plots. Though completed in 1958, the work was not published until 1961, for what it <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> was made a choice of the book society. Heinemann, my publisher, was doubtful about publishing it: it might be libellous. I had to change the setting from Brunei to an East African one. Heinemann was right to be timorous.

[...] He names [...] "Please Let Me Wonder" [...] as the first song he wrote on pot, with [...] "She Knows Me Too Well" [...] and [...] "Let Him Run Wild" [...] following soon after. Of his first acid trip, he recalls that LSD had subjected him to [...] "a very religious experience" [...] which enlightened him to indescribable philosophies. The music for [...] "California Girls" [...] came from this first LSD experience, as did much of the group's subsequent work where they would partake in drug use during recording sessions. Wilson spoke of his LSD trips as a [...] "religious experience", and during a session for his a cappella hymn [...] "Our Prayer", Brian can be heard asking the other Beach Boys: [...] "Do you guys feel any acid yet?" [...] In 1993, Wilson testified in a legal deposition that by 1965, he was consuming three or four marijuana cigarettes and one LSD pill a day.
