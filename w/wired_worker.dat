50|$|The ISTC {{was later}} {{joined by the}} Amalgamated Association of Steel & Iron Workers of Great Britain in 1920 and the Tin and Sheet Millmens Association in 1921. The <b>Wire</b> <b>Workers</b> Union joined in 1922, but withdrew in 1924. The <b>Wire</b> <b>Workers</b> Union rejoined in 1991. In 1985 the National Union of Blastfurnacemen joined the ISTC.|$|R

5000|$|The Worshipful Company of Tin Plate <b>Workers</b> alias <b>Wire</b> <b>Workers</b> {{is one of}} the Livery Companies of the City of London. Tin {{craftsmen}} {{were originally}} part of the Ironmongers Company, while the <b>wire</b> <b>workers,</b> who made <b>wire</b> objects such as cages, animal traps and fishhooks, were part of the Girdlers Company. The two groups combined, and were incorporated by a Royal Charter in 1670. Now, the use of tin plate and steel wire does not remain work done by craftsmen, instead being performed by machines. Thus, the Company is no longer a trade association for craftsmen. Instead, it supports the industry through grants, as it does charities.|$|R
50|$|Purdie {{was born}} in the parish of Fenwick, East Ayrshire, Scotland. After his {{schooling}} he moved to Glasgow acquiring a trade as a <b>wire</b> <b>worker</b> which he pursued in England and Scotland for several years, while also following his interest in natural history. He emigrated with his wife Ellen in 1860 from Glasgow to New Zealand on the ship “Pladda”, and settled in Dunedin.|$|R
50|$|The {{resultant}} {{union was}} named the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation. Both the Amalgamated Association of Steel and Iron Workers of Great Britain and the Tin and Sheet Millmens' Association balloted their members unsuccessfully in 1916 but were later successful. The <b>Wire</b> <b>Workers</b> Union joined the confederation in 1922 but left in 1924, rejoining in 1991. Other members left in 1924 to form the Constructional Engineering Union.|$|R
50|$|The union {{originated}} in 1840 as the Federated Wire Drawers Association, bringing together various local unions. Although {{it had some}} success among {{those involved in the}} manufacture of thick <b>wire,</b> <b>workers</b> in thin <b>wire</b> did not join. By 1868, its total membership was only 700 and based entirely in England, but it adopted the new name of the Thick Iron and Steel Wire Drawers Association.|$|R
5000|$|In 1901, the {{federation}} adopted a more centralised structure and was again renamed, as the Amalgamated Wire Drawers Trade and Sick Benefit Society of the United Kingdom, then in 1908 {{it became the}} Amalgamated Wire Drawers Society of Great Britain, membership soon moving over 2,000. From 1916, unskilled <b>wire</b> <b>workers</b> were admitted, taking membership to 5,000 and prompting a further name change to the Amalgamated Society of Wire Drawers and Kindred Workers. [...] In 1922, it merged into the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation (ISTC), but left again only two years later, re-establishing an independent existence.|$|R
50|$|The WLBT Tower was a 610 m guy-wired {{aerial mast}} for the {{transmission}} of FM radio and TV-programs in Raymond, Mississippi, United States, for the Jackson metro area. The mast was constructed in 1966. On October 23, 1997, the mast, which was property of Cosmos Broadcasting (WLBT a local NBC affiliate), collapsed during the renovation of its guy <b>wires.</b> Three <b>workers</b> were killed. The tower was rebuilt in 1999.|$|R
5000|$|In 1916, the {{organisation}} renamed itself the [...] "National Union of General Workers", merging with the Amalgamated Union of Machine and General Labourers. Further mergers followed, principally with the British Labour Amalgamation, the Amalgamated Society of Gas, Municipal and General Workers, the Amalgamated Enginemen, Cranemen, Boilermen, Firemen and <b>Wire</b> Rope <b>Workers</b> Union and the National Union of Women Workers. In 1924, it {{joined with the}} National Amalgamated Union of Labour and the Municipal Employees Association to form the National Union of General and Municipal Workers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{death of}} the sitting MP in 1919 led to a sensational {{by-election}} gain for the Labour Party, which was described by historian Maurice Cowling as the worst result for the Coalition during the 1918-22 Parliament; John Ramsden admitted that Labour's win had a big psychological impact on the Coalition but thought {{the result was a}} [...] "freak win" [...] given that Labour had under 40% of the vote. At the ensuing general election, the Manchester Guardian described the constituency as [...] "scattered between the three towns of Leeds, Bradford and Huddersfield", centred on Cleckheaton, and populated by [...] "woollen and <b>wire</b> <b>workers,</b> miners, card manufacturers". A significant presence of Irish voters was also noted. Sir John Simon, a former Home Secretary who had lost his seat in the 1918 election, regained the seat for the Liberals in 1922 and held it until given a Peerage in 1940. During this period Simon moved from declaring his basic sympathy with the Labour Party's objects, to forming the Liberal Nationals who went into alliance with the Conservatives. Simon found his constituency marginal, and had a majority of under 1,000 in his last election, and Labour gained it in the 1945 election landslide.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began in}} the summer of 1993 at the west end, {{employing}} the conventional mining technique of drilling and blasting due to the loose mixture of materials. More than 75 tons of explosives were used and mining progressed about a mile into the hill. East end construction began in August 1994 with a customized tunnel boring machine. About a thousand workers from 230 construction firms were involved in the 18-mile westside MAX line, including those who built the tunnel and installed the reinforced concrete liner, tracks and <b>wiring.</b> One <b>worker</b> was killed while operating equipment.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the end of World War II, Northwestern Steel and <b>Wire</b> attracted <b>workers</b> from several states away, especially from the Southern states such as Texas and Oklahoma that {{were in the midst of}} a post-war recession. These workers were housed in 100 railroad box cars converted to homes and arranged in 4 rows of 25 each along the Rock River. The cars were all painted silver with paint left over from the war and the residents referred to the place as [...] "Silver City". The rental charges were taken out of the employee's pay and there was a [...] "Company Store" [...] adjacent that could be used to buy groceries with company credit.|$|R
50|$|For {{those who}} don't know, the queen {{excluder}} {{is a series}} of parallel wires placed closely together in a bee hive. It sits between the lower brood boxes and the upper supers, the boxes where the honey is stored. It functions to keep the queen from laying eggs in the boxes that contain the honey in them. She's too big to fit between the <b>wires,</b> but the <b>worker</b> bees can still come and go unimpeded.|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{local area}} network (WLAN) {{technology}} {{is one of the}} fastest growing areas in the information technology sphere, and with good reason. The benefits of using wireless include reduced move/add/change costs, the elimination of wire plant requirements in new workspace or older structures that pose challenges for traditional <b>wiring,</b> mobility of <b>workers</b> and data, and many others. While this growth is beneficial, it also provides new security challenges that the marketplace has not adequately addressed. This paper addr [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|This {{depiction}} of events was challenged by others. William Miller of the rival Communist Party (Majority Group), headed by Jay Lovestone, asserted that about 30,000 workers had answered {{the call to}} demonstrate on March 6, joined {{for a brief time}} by about 45,000 downtown employees off during lunch hour. While the gathering had been [...] "splendid" [...] as a spontaneous protest of unemployed workers, [...] "as an organized demonstration it was a fiasco," [...] Miller asserted, noting that the space where the gathering was scheduled was inadequate and that no platform had been constructed so that party leaders were unable to address the assembled crowd. Moreover, Miller notes, CPUSA District Organizer Jack Stachel had gone into hiding two days before the event and did not even witness the purported incidents about which he so breathlessly <b>wired</b> the Daily <b>Worker.</b>|$|R
40|$|THE {{apparent}} {{beneficial effects}} of built-up litter in keeping down losses from cecal coccidiosis {{are not well}} under-stood. It can be theorized that early exposure to coccidial oocysts induces an immunity which is perpetuated by oc-casional ingestion of a few sporulated oocysts from the droppings in the litter. This paper deals with {{an investigation of the}} development of immunity in chicks to cecal coccidiosis when specific numbers of sporulated oocysts were administered to chicks at various ages brooded in chick batteries with <b>wire</b> floors. Different <b>workers</b> have explored the field of the development of immunity to cecal coccidiosis in chicks. Herrick et al. (1936) showed that chickens infected when three months old or older were con-siderably more resistant to the effects of Eimeria tenella than are birds infected when not over two months old. Mayhew (1934) and Rosenberg (1941) presented evidence suggesting that resistance and susceptibility to E. tenella is hereditary in chickens. The studies of Horton-Smit...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages [72]- 77. With many {{significant}} {{technological advancements}} in Journalism, the local, or mid-sized, newspapers {{have been put}} into positions of facing {{a different type of}} competing media from both the local and non-local areas. This study takes {{a look at some of}} the changes among these papers after an eight-year span, 1976 and 1984. Six newspapers from Illinois were selected for a content analysis, each falling into the circulation range of 30, 000 to 70, 000. Five issues of each newspaper from July 1976 and from July 1984 were analyzed. Stories from the news, editorial and sports departments were analyzed by measuring column inches. Stories and photos were measured to determine if they were done by a staff member (local) or by a <b>wire</b> service <b>worker</b> (non-local). A total of 60 newspapers representing 59, 394 column inches was examined. The study found four major changes: 1) The editorial opinion pages have dramatically increased the use of wire copy. 2) The wire material used in the news sections of the newspapers went up slightly, but it was enough of a change for wire material to take a majority hold. 3) The front pages saw a major decrease in wire stories and an increase in local material, which included three newspapers changing entire philosophies of not using any local material on the front pages. 4) There was an increase of wire service bylined material. The study also contains a discussion on reasons why some of these changes have taken place. During the period of 1976 and 1984, there were some new factors and competitive advancements which midsized newspapers did not have to contend with in the past. The rapid advancements of Cable television, a successfully national newspaper, economics, social ideological trends and new target market groups have all contributed to some of the changes. They are each discussed in the final chapter of the study. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} F {{should be}} {{represented as a}} Boolean circuit on which the key generation algorithm would be applied. The key generation algorithm runs Yao’s garbling procedure over this Boolean circuit to compute the public and secret keys. The public key (PK) is composed of all the ciphertexts that represent the garbled circuit, and the secret key (SK) is composed of all the random wire labels. The generated secret key is then used in the problem generation algorithm. This algorithm first generates {{a new pair of}} public and secret keys for the homomorphic encryption scheme, and then uses these keys with the homomorphic scheme to encrypt the correct input wires, represented as the secret key of the garbled circuit. The produced ciphertexts represent the public encoding of the input (σx) that is given to the worker, while the secret key (τx) is kept private by the client. After that, the worker applies the computation steps of the Yao’s protocol over the ciphertexts generated by the problem generation algorithm. This is done by recursively decrypting the gate ciphertexts until arriving to the final output wire values (σy). The homomorphic properties of the encryption scheme enable the worker to obtain an encryption of the correct output <b>wire.</b> Finally, the <b>worker</b> returns the ciphertexts of the output to the client who decrypts them to compute the actual output y = F(x) or ⊥.|$|R
5000|$|Polish {{workers were}} {{required}} to wear a clearly visible letter [...] "P" [...] badge, {{in addition to a}} work permit with a photo. The letter [...] "P" [...] badge was to be to worn on the right breast of every garment worn. Those who did not obey the rules were subject to a fine of up to 150 RM Reichsmarks and arrested with a possible penalty of six weeks detention. They should also be kept away from German [...] "cultural life" [...] and [...] "places of amusement" [...] (this included churches and restaurants). Sexual relations between Poles and Germans was prohibited as Rassenschande (race defilement), and so it was recommended that the same numbers of Polish males and females should be recruited, or that brothels should be set up. To keep them segregated from the German population, they were often housed in segregated barracks behind barbed <b>wire.</b> Mobility of <b>workers,</b> housed as far away as possible from Germans, was to be restricted, hence they were barred from using public transportation. They were also affected by after dark curfew. Wages paid to Polish workers were to be lower than those paid to the German workers, even through they had to work longer hours. Polish workers were also to receive substandard nutrition. They were not allowed certain types of possessions (bicycles, cameras). They often were denied holidays and had to work seven days a week. They could not enter a marriage without permission. Births were discouraged, and children were sometimes taken away from their families (see kidnapping of Polish children by Nazi Germany).|$|R
