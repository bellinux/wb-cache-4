5000|$|Beam lead {{technology}} is a method of fabricating a semiconductor device. Its original application was to high-frequency silicon switching transistors and high-speed integrated circuits. It eliminated the labor-intensive <b>wire-bonding</b> process used for integrated circuits at the time, and allowed automated assembly of semiconductor chips onto larger substrates to produce hybrid integrated circuits.|$|E
50|$|This {{technique}} {{is far more}} complex than traditional AFM. Unlike AFM, SJEM needs to consider the type of polymer, the thickness of polymer used to coat the sample and the frequency to drive the device. This additional processing often can degrade or compromise {{the integrity of the}} sample. For micro/nano devices, <b>wire-bonding</b> is usually necessary to apply voltage, further increasing processing and decreasing throughput. During scanning, the magnitude of the voltage, frequency, and scanning speeds need to be considered. Calibration must also be done using a reference system in order to ensure accuracy. Finally, a complex model must be used to account for all these factors and parameters.|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} NPN transistor {{structure is}} often used in common bipolar processes as the antifuse. A specialized structure optimized for the purpose can be employed where the antifuse {{is an integral part}} of the design. The terminals of the antifuses are usually accessible as bonding pads and the trimming process is performed before <b>wire-bonding</b> and encapsulating the chip. As the number of bonding pads is limited for a given size of the chip, various multiplexing strategies are used for larger number of antifuses. In some cases a combined circuit with zeners and transistors can be used to form a zapping matrix; with additional zeners, the trimming (which uses voltages higher than the normal operational voltage of the chip) can be performed even after packaging the chip.|$|E

Four different types of electrode patterns were used to optimize the sensor outputs. When the ring-shaped electrode of the sensor was subdivided into four different sections, namely the top, bottom, left, and right sections, different output signals were observed during the <b>wire-bonding</b> process.

40|$|A sensor {{integrated}} in a smart ultrasonic transducer {{was used to}} monitor the bonding quality during <b>wire-bonding</b> process. The sensor was a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ring located {{in the middle of}} the Langevin sandwich driver of a <b>wire-bonding</b> transducer, where the electrode of the sensor was sub-divided into several regions. The specially designed electrode pattern can increase the bandwidth of the sensor, while the signal patterns for different bonding conditions, such as wire missing, good bond, peeled off bond and non-stick bond, were identified. The bonding quality has been experimentally correlated with the area under the normalized sensor signal. Hence, the sensor in the smart transducer provides a useful tool for in situ bonding monitoring of an automatic <b>wire-bonding</b> system. Department of Applied Physic...|$|E
40|$|This paper, for {{the first}} time, investigates the {{reliability}} of <b>wire-bonded</b> low-voltage discrete power trench n-MOSFETs that {{have been subjected to}} repetitive unclamped inductive switching (RUIS). Automotive MOSFETs driving inductive loads may be subjected to RUIS; hence, {{there is a need to}} characterize the failure mechanisms in such applications. The failure mechanisms of repetitively avalanched <b>wire-bonded</b> MOSFETs are shown to be <b>wire-bond</b> lift-off and source metal degradation/fatigue due to thermomechanical stress cycling. Temperature excursions from avalanche pulses cause thermomechanical stresses on the wire-bond/source-metal interface as a result of differences in thermal expansion coefficients between silicon and aluminum. Trench MOSFETs exhibited an average of 10 % increase in on-state resistance due to source metal fatigue after 100 million cycles of repetitive avalanche. The number of cycles to failure is investigated as a function of the avalanched induced temperature changes and is shown to follow the Coffin-Manson law. These results are important for designers of automotive systems since they are capable of predicting the long-term reliability of <b>wire-bonded</b> discrete power semiconductor components...|$|R
5000|$|Advanced <b>wire-bond</b> packages, unlike {{traditional}} Ball Grid Array (BGA) packages, {{have multiple}} pad rows on the die and multiple tiers on the substrate. This package technology has brought new challenges to failure analysis. To date, Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM), Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) analysis, and Real-Time X-ray (RTX) inspection were the non-destructive tools {{used to detect}} short faults. Unfortunately, these techniques do not work very well in advanced <b>wire-bond</b> packages. Because of the high density wire bonding in advanced <b>wire-bond</b> packages, it is extremely hard to localize the short with conventional RTX inspection. Without detailed information as to where the short might occur, attempting destructive decapsualtion to expose both die surface and bond wires is full of risk. Wet chemical etching to remove mold compound in a large area often results in over-etching. Furthermore, even if the package is successfully decapped, visual inspection of the multi-tiered bond wires is a blind search.|$|R

40|$|Packaging of MMIC LNA (monolithic {{microwave}} {{integrated circuit}} low-noise amplifier) chips at frequencies over 200 GHz {{has always been}} problematic due to the high loss in the transition between the MMIC chip and the waveguide medium in which the chip will typically be used. In addition, above 200 GHz, <b>wire-bond</b> inductance between the LNA and the waveguide can severely limit the RF matching and bandwidth of the final waveguide amplifier module. This work resulted {{in the development of}} a low-loss quartz waveguide transition that includes a capacitive transmission line between the MMIC and the waveguide probe element. This capacitive transmission line tunes out the wirebond inductance (where the <b>wire-bond</b> is required to bond between the MMIC and the probe element). This inductance can severely limit the RF matching and bandwidth of the final waveguide amplifier module. The amplifier module consists of a quartz E-plane waveguide probe transition, a short capacitive tuning element, a short <b>wire-bond</b> to the MMIC, and the MMIC LNA. The output structure is similar, with a short <b>wire-bond</b> at the output of the MMIC, a quartz E-plane waveguide probe transition, and the output waveguide. The quartz probe element is made of 3 -mil quartz, which is the thinnest commercially available material. The waveguide band used is WR 4, from 170 to 260 GHz. This new transition and block design is an improvement over prior art because it provides for better RF matching, and will likely yield lower loss and better noise figure. The development of high-performance, low-noise amplifiers in the 180 -to- 700 -GHz range has applications for future earth science and planetary instruments with low power and volume, and astrophysics array instruments for molecular spectroscopy. This frequency band, while suitable for homeland security and commercial applications (such as millimeter-wave imaging, hidden weapons detection, crowd scanning, airport security, and communications), also has applications to future NASA missions.

40|$|International audienceThe {{nanoporous}} {{nature of}} the inkjet printed silver nanoparticles entail low hardness and surface effective contact area for being compatible with pads that are suitable for <b>wire-bonding</b> in electronic packaging. Electroless nickel plating is a selective metal deposition technique which can brings the required thickness and hardness for further pads processing. Here, a 1. 7 μm thick nickel layer is deposited on top of 600 nm thick printed and sintered silver nanoparticles using Kapton polyimide as substrate. Prior to plating, a special attention was put on tuning microstructures of printed silver pads by sintering nanoparticles at various temperature ramps (0. 1, 10 and 50 °C/s) up to 200 °C. Results show that fast sintering exhibits the lowest electrical resistivity which is suitable in printed interconnects. However, <b>wire-bonding</b> on nickel pads is best achieved when low sintering ramp is used. This slow sintering presents the highest adhesion strength at the nickel/silver interface since the pores dimensions were restricted to the nanoscale. The validation of the optimized bonding process came from the low electrical contact resistance between plated nickel and the bonded gold wire, and from the wire-pull test which is {{in accordance with the}} MIL-STD 883 standard. The actual results show that a compromise has to be found when emphasis is on patterning low resistive interconnects or stiff pads for <b>wire-bonding</b> applications.

40|$|Interface {{formation}} between 25 -m AlSi 1 {{wire and}} flash-Au substrate metallization during a bonding time of 50 ms has been investigated.

During the entire bonding time, the fraction of the interface covered with Au 8 Al 3 increases, and at the end of the bonding time, the interface is nearly completely covered with that phase. Finite-element modeling (FEM) of the temperature in the interface region indicates maximum temperatures well below 100 °C, thus making solely thermally activated intermetallic phase growth impossible. However, it is demonstrated that the phase growth observed during the ultrasonic <b>wire-bonding</b> process could result from an accelerated diffusion process caused by a higher vacancy concentration.
