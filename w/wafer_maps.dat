An analysis of <b>wafer</b> <b>map</b> data helps to better understand ongoing process problems. This paper proposes a new methodology in which spatial correlogram is used for the detection of the presence of spatial autocorrelations and for the classification of defect patterns on the <b>wafer</b> <b>map.</b> After the detection of spatial autocorrelation based on our proposed spatial randomness test using spatial correlogram, the dynamic time warping algorithm which provides non-linear alignments between two sequences to find optimal warping path is adopted for the automatic classification of spatial patterns based on spatial correlogram.

As with any fabrication process there is inherent variation, which is acceptable when controlled within suitable limits. The ability to monitor and respond to this variation is paramount in maintaining a viable fabrication process. Electrostatic comb-drive resonators are candidate test structures used to validate uniformity in the MEMS fabrication process. Although directly dependent on mass and spring constant, a measure of their resonant frequencies generally provides a good indicator of both process repeatability and geometric variation. In this study, sets of five graduated comb-drive resonator structures, located at each die on a wafer, were stimulated to resonant frequency using the “blur envelope ” technique.

Initial pre-production yields were below expectations where the switch {{was found to be}} the cause. Stringent application-specific DC die sort test requirements, increased process complexity and switch design topology employing a high gate density were all factors in the depressed yield. Failure analysis showed {{that for the first time}} at TriQuint, an RF product was yield-limited due to process defects, rather than parametric variation. Reducing defects to enable high yield and reliability has long been critical for Silicon manufacturing, however, for GaAs manufacturing, parametric failures are often on top of the yield Pareto. This paper will first outline the development of a DC die sort test methodology which not only assured high final test yield but also prevented test escapes due to limitations in the measurement of IMD 2 and third-order Harmonics in the production test.

40|$|We {{present results}} of a non-contact, {{real-time}} feedback corona-Kelvin characterization of the ferroelectric properties of Si:HfO 2 thin films. Measurements were performed on free dielectric surfaces. The method uses corona charging pulses coupled with Kelvin probe-measured surface voltage and gives non-contact QV and CV characteristics. Analogous to voltage biasing of metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors, large corona charge biasing is found to provide an effective means for poling of the ferroelectric films. Subsequent small increment corona charging is used to acquire hysteresis loops and determine the coercive field and permittivity characteristics. Negative and positive coercive fields of about ± 1. 2 [*]MV/cm for the 3. 5 [*]mol% Si film and ± 1. 0 [*]MV/cm for the 4. 6 [*]mol% Si film were determined from the hysteresis loops.

This paper discusses the use of NiP/Pd as bond pad copper-capping layers. Because the electroless process is relatively new to this application, it has a steep learning curve. One issue with copper and nickel films is corrosion during electroless processes, which {{is not only a}} yield detractor but also a reliability concern. Two types of corrosion mechanisms have been identified during electroless processes: (1) corrosion of copper substrate and (2) corrosion of electroless nickel.

The advantage of spatially resolved μPCD was applied for <b>wafer</b> <b>mapping.</b> Emitter saturation current, J 0, mapping was obtained directly from small perturbation decay lifetime using the Basore-Hansen procedure.

Our research involved photoluminescence measurements on passivated test wafers in sequence with the QSS-μPCD unified lifetime measurement including J 0. On selected sites the value of J 0 was intentionally varied with corona charge induced field-effect. This enabled a unique PL calibration to J 0 and other recombination parameters. Quantitative characteristics enabled us to compare PL procedures for the determination of J 0 and to select a practical version for J 0 imaging that uses direct J 0 determination from the ratio of generation rate G to PL intensity.

However, the XRD method cannot observe {{the surface morphology}} or roughness because of the method s limited resolution. Therefore the authors used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with samples prepared in two ways, the focused ion beam (FIB) method and the tripod method to study the structure between Si 1 -xGex and sapphire substrate and Si 1 ?xGex itself. The sample preparation for TEM should be {{as fast as possible}} so that the sample should contain few or no artifacts induced by the preparation. The standard sample preparation method of mechanical polishing often requires a relatively long ion milling time (several hours), which increases the probability of inducing defects into the sample. The TEM sampling of the Si 1 -xGex on sapphire is also difficult because of the sapphire s high hardness and mechanical instability. The FIB method and the tripod method eliminate both problems when performing a cross-section TEM sampling of Si 1 -xGex on c-plane sapphire, which shows the surface morphology, the interface between film and substrate, and the crystal structure of the film.

For selective gate recessing we investigated both wet and dry etch processes. Viable procedures have been found with a citric acid: H 2 O 2 :H 20 wet etching solution and with an HBr/Ar gas mixture for reactive ion etching (RIE). The selectivities obtained for InGaAs with respect to InAlAs were 14 : 1 for the wet etchant and 6. 7 : 1 for RIE. Another crucial process step is the MODFET isolation. Earlier work by other groups has shown that implant isolation is difficult on InGaAs (S. J. Pearton et al., Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. 144, 433 (1989)). Therefore, we studied both oxygen ion implantation as well as wet-chemical mesa etching for device isolati on on the same wafer.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{density of}} electronics within {{portable electronic devices}} provides the motivation to develop more compact power electronics, such as DC-DC converters. Typically, integrated circuits and each passive component, such as inductors, are discreetly packaged and mounted on printed circuit board (PCB), to implement the converter. Hence for further size reduction there has been growing interest for integration schemes such as Power supply in package (PwrSiP). However, {{the ultimate goal is}} the monolithic integration of the power supply solution, in an integration scheme known as Power Supply on Chip (PwrSoC). The economic effectiveness of the converter will be determined by the device footprint and number of processing steps required to fabricate the inductor. Hence, the motivation behind this thesis is the need for microinductors with large inductance density (inductance per device footprint) while maintaining low losses, which can be integrated with silicon IC. Furthermore, the need for thick layers will result in issues with yield and reliability of the fabricated device. Hence {{there is a need to}} identify, characterise and integrate materials with low residual stress into the microinductor fabrication process. A typical choice of inter-coil dielectric is the photo-definable epoxy SU- 8. However, SU- 8 suffers from intrinsic issues with high residual stress and adhesion. One possible replacement for SU- 8 as a structural and dielectric layer is Parylene-C. The first objective of this thesis proposes a test-bed inductor process, which incorporates Parylene as a structural and dielectric layer and has a short turnaround time of one week. This fabrication process involves the filling of high aspect ratio gaps between copper structures with Parylene and subsequent chemical mechanical planarisation, and a test chip has been designed to characterise these processes. Additionally, Scotch-tape testing has been used to confirm suitable Parylene adhesion to patterned and unpatterned films used in this process. Subsequently, complete microinductors, with magnetic cores, have been fabricated, characterised and benchmarked against other inductor technologies and architectures reported in the literature. Parylene is expected to produce films with low residual stress due to its room temperature deposition process. However, the test-bed inductor process requires thermal treatments up to 140 °C. Hence it was necessary to characterise the stress in Parylene films as a result of processing temperature and compare this to stress levels in SU- 8 5 and 3005 films. This study has determined the spatial variation of residual stress in Parylene-C and SU- 8 films, by combining automated measurements of strain indicator test structures and local nanoindentation measurements of Young’s modulus. These measurements have been used to <b>wafer</b> <b>map</b> strain, Young’s modulus, and subsequently residual stress in these films, as a result of processing parameter variation. It is well known that placing ferromagnetic material in close proximity to current carrying coils can further enhance the measured inductance value. However, the conductive magnetic core is also a source of loss for the microinductor. Hence, magnetic permeability, electrical resistivity and mechanical stress in the magnetic core influence the inductance value, eddy current losses and reliability of the fabricated microinductor, respectively. The ability to characterise these properties on wafer is essential for process control and verification measurements. This thesis details a test chip capable of routine measurements on NiFe films to characterise the spatial variation of these properties. Furthermore, <b>wafer</b> <b>mapping</b> measurements are reported to identify the correlation between high frequency permeability, electrical resistivity, mechanical strain and the chemical composition of two-component Permalloy film (NixFe(100 -x)) electroplated on the surface of 100 mm silicon wafers. Finally, MEMS-based inductor fabrication processes typically require a number of electrodeposition steps, which require conductive seed layers for the deposition of the coils and magnetic core material. A typical choice of seed layer is copper. However, due to copper’s paramagnetic behaviour (μ = 1) and low electrical resistivity (ρ= 6. 69 μΩ. cm) this layer contributes to eddy current losses, while acting as a thin ‘screening layer’. It is very likely that using a magnetic seed layer, within the magnetic core, will noticeably reduce eddy current related losses. However, detailed systematic experimental studies on any such improvement have not been documented in the literature. This study involves compositional, structural, electrical and magnetic characterisation of Ni 80 Fe 20 films electro-deposited on non-magnetic and magnetic seed layers (i. e. copper and nickel respectively). Mechanical strain test structures and X-ray analysis have been used to characterise the stress levels and structural properties of Ni 80 Fe 20 films electro-deposited on both copper and nickel seed layers. In addition, planar spiral micro-inductors, both with and without patterned magnetic cores, have been fabricated to determine the effect of patterning on their performance. This is in addition to quantifying the improvement in the electrical performance resulting from the enhanced magnetic and resistive contribution provided by magnetic seed layers...|$|R
