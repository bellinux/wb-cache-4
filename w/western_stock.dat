5|$|Denver {{used to be}} a major trading {{center for}} beef and {{livestock}} when ranchers would drive (or later transport) cattle to the Denver Union Stockyards for sale. As a celebration of that history, {{for more than a century}} Denver has hosted the annual National <b>Western</b> <b>Stock</b> Show, attracting as many as 10,000 animals and 700,000 attendees. The show is held every January at the National Western Complex northeast of downtown.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} 400 North Atlantic {{right whales}} live in the western North Atlantic Ocean. In {{northern}} spring, summer and autumn, they feed in areas off the Canadian and northeast U.S. coasts in a range stretching from New York to Newfoundland. Particularly popular feeding areas are the Bay of Fundy and Cape Cod Bay. In winter, they head south towards Georgia and Florida to give birth. There have been a smattering of sightings further east {{over the past few}} decades; several sightings were made close to Iceland in 2003. These are possibly the remains of a virtually extinct eastern Atlantic stock, but examination of old whalers' records suggests {{they are more likely to}} be strays. However, a few sightings are regular between Norway, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands and even Italy and Sicily; at least the Norway individuals come from the <b>Western</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
25|$|While the {{population}}s of the eastern and Asian stocks appear stable, {{the population of the}} <b>western</b> <b>stock,</b> particularly along the Aleutian Islands, was estimated to have fallen by 70–80% since the 1970s. As a consequence, in 1997, the <b>western</b> <b>stock</b> of Steller sea lions was listed as endangered and the eastern stock was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. They have since been the object of intense study and the focus of much political and scientific debate in Alaska.|$|E

25|$|The {{range of}} the Steller sea lion extends from the Kuril Islands and the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia to the Gulf of Alaska in the north, and south to Año Nuevo Island off central California. They {{formerly}} bred {{as far south as}} the Channel Islands, but have not been observed there since the 1980s. Based on genetic anаlyses and local migration patterns, the global Steller sea lion population has traditionally been divided into an eastern and <b>western</b> <b>stock</b> at 144°W longitude, roughly through the middle of the Gulf of Alaska. Recent evidence suggests the sea lions in Russia in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Kuril Islands comprise a third Asian stock, while the sea lions on the eastern seaboard of Kamchatka and the Commander Islands belong to the <b>western</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E

500|$|Ruby was {{influential}} in saving {{some of the}} highest-quality Ranger stock during the severe drought of the 1930s, by driving them over [...] to better pasture in a history-making journey. When the rains returned to eastern Colorado, he again made the drive to return the horses to their original pasture. After re-establishing his herd, Ruby developed a practice of leasing groups of his Rangerbred horses to other ranchers throughout the western United States for use as breeding stock. Through this practice, Colorado Ranger horses influenced, and were in return influenced by, the Quarter Horse, Appaloosa and other <b>western</b> <b>stock</b> horse breeds.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the results}} from egg and larvae surveys, {{mackerel}} and horse mackerel are thought to form three more or less distinct stocks each in the North Sea and in the waters west of the British Isles.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the optimal {{management of the}} Northern Atlantic bluefin tuna, both eastern and <b>western</b> <b>stocks.</b> The analysis {{is based on a}} deterministic multi-gear and age-structured bioeconomic model. In order to assess the importance of the gear structure in this fishery, the model is optimized in two scenarios. In the first, the strategies are restricted to the gear mix of the base year, whereas in the second, the optimal gear mix is estimated. For both scenarios, optimal constant strategies are determined. The corresponding optimal use is then compared with an open-access scenario. Also, optimal non-constant strategies are explored. As expected, the gear structure of the fishery proved to be highly relevant in the optimal payoffs. In particular, the unrestricted strategies yield rents substantially higher than the restricted ones. Also, the optimal management of the bluefin tuna fishery, in both the East and West Atlantic, would imply significant reallocation of the gear shares. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|Investigations {{concerning}} {{the intensity and}} duration of spawning seasons of cod stocks are parts {{of the work of}} the reproductions ecology of commercial fish stocks in the Baltic Sea. The Institute of Baltic Fisheries Rostock has sampled and analysed data for this goal since 1992. The first data analyses for the spawning season 1997, sampled in the areas Kiel Bay, Mecklenburg Bay and Arkona Sea showed that the process of the spawning season is different compared to the years before. The spawning process starts earlier than the other years in Kiel Bay and Mecklenburg Bay. The results show that a high proportion of the spawning stock was part of the spawning process in this area. The Arkona Sea cod are regarded by ICES definition as belonging to the <b>western</b> cod <b>stock.</b> In this ICES sub-division only a low number of spawned cod was observed in March, the main spawning time of the <b>western</b> cod <b>stock.</b> Opposite to the theory of the stock units intensive spawning activities were observed in June as in the years before in the Arkona Sea...|$|R

30|$|A {{study with}} high {{frequency}} data was undertaken by Egert and Kocenda (2007); the authors analyze the interconnections between <b>Western</b> European <b>stock</b> markets and stock {{markets in the}} Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. Using Granger causality tests based on 5 -min tick intra day data from mid- 2003 to early 2005, they do not find any robust cointegration relationship between Central European and <b>Western</b> European <b>stock</b> markets. In a similar vein, Kocenda and Egert (2011) study ultra-high frequency data for three developed (France, Germany, and Britain) and three emerging (CzechRepublic,Hungary, and Poland) European stock markets and find weak correlations between these developed and emerging markets during the trading day. The authors conclude that the transmission of shocks among these markets materializes more at daily or even weekly frequency, rather than at tick- by-tick data frequency. Egert and Kocenda (2007) analyze the co-movements among stock markets in Central and Eastern Europe using 5 -min intraday price data spanning from mid- 2003 to early 2005 for stock indices, using cointegration relationships. The study observed signs of short-term spillover effects {{both in terms of}} stock returns and stock price volatility and identified a number of short term relationships among the stock markets.|$|R
