5|$|The {{delegation}} traveled back to Wisconsin by rail, {{spreading the}} good news to the various Ojibwa bands as they went. Buffalo also announced that all the tribal representatives should gather at La Pointe for payments the next summer (1853), and he <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> {{the specifics of the}} agreement.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} {{of resistance to}} batrachotoxins {{and the use of}} those toxins as chemical defences by several bird families have led to competing theories as to its evolutionary history. Jønsson (2008) suggested that it was an ancestral adaptation in Corvoidea songbirds, and that further studies <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> more toxic birds. Dumbacher (2008) argued instead that it was an example of convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez {{proposed}} Muon tomography in 1965 {{to search}} the Egyptian pyramids for unknown chambers. Using naturally occurring cosmic rays, his scheme was to place spark chambers, standard equipment in the high-energy particle physics of this time, beneath the second pyramid of Chephren in a known chamber. By measuring the counting rate of the cosmic rays in different directions the detector <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> the existence of any void in the overlaying rock structure.|$|E
5000|$|Nagano Prefecture's {{residents}} were naive people and <b>would</b> not <b>reveal</b> secrets.|$|R
5000|$|A {{contestant}} {{could call}} for the [...] "Eye Guess" [...] space if they thought that the correct answer was not among the eight choices revealed {{at the start of}} the game. In such instances, the answer <b>would</b> be <b>revealed</b> only if it was correct for that question. Otherwise, a blank card <b>would</b> be <b>revealed.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... {{they had}} {{finished}} recording {{and that the}} artwork and track listing <b>would</b> be <b>revealed</b> soon.|$|R
5|$|As, {{according}} to Bulgarian mythology {{and some other}} traditions, tortoises were the only beings who knew {{the appearance of the}} herb and the location where it grows, such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the tortoise is away. When it returns, the tortoise would be unable to access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, the tortoise <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> the herb and people would acquire it from the tortoise, which does not need it anymore.|$|E
5|$|By {{trapping}} initially and blackmailing later, Shankar gets hold of Delhi Suri with whose help, {{he creates}} a rift between Damodar and Nagaraju {{which leads to}} the latter's murder. By blackmailing Sukanya that they <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> her past to Damodar, they trap Mallikharjun with her help and accuse him of a rape attempt on Sukanya. However, the fact that Mallikharjun was gay, which was concealed by him for a long time, was believed by none. He is murdered by eating poisoned food.|$|E
5|$|Emanuel's mayoral {{campaign}} was {{the inspiration for}} a satirical Twitter account called MayorEmanuel, which received over 43,000 followers, more popular than Emanuel's actual Twitter account. Emanuel announced on February 28 that if the author <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> himself, he would donate $5,000 to the charity of the author's choice. When Chicago journalist Dan Sinker revealed himself, Emanuel donated the money to Young Chicago Authors, a community organization which helps young people with writing and publishing skills.|$|E
5000|$|Details of {{the nature}} of Saint-Mars's {{expenses}} <b>would</b> provide <b>revealing</b> information about the prisoner's identity.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} by Simon Cowell that a twist <b>would</b> be <b>revealed</b> during Thursday's live semi-final.|$|R
5000|$|... 25 April 2007, the Osorios were {{insolvent}} by {{this point}} as court papers <b>would</b> later <b>reveal.</b>|$|R
5|$|Obligatory {{psychological}} {{testing for}} gun owners {{is a common}} subject of discussion, but {{it has always been}} rejected. Gun advocates point out that the nature of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear. It is also pointed out that it is unlikely that any psychological testing <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the past were members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.|$|E
5|$|Square Enix {{chose to}} update Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2s {{graphics}} for a remastered release in high-definition. With a production cycle longer than two years, the graphics were not merely upscaled to higher resolutions and feature updated models and textures. Kitase commented {{that he wanted}} to excite new and returning players and added more depth to do so and opened up the possibility of further remasters based on reception. Many views could not simply be reframed to 16:9 because that <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> characters waiting for their cues off-screen, so the remastering team performed a lot of redrawing and additions to the visuals.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the mid-1950s, new car {{introductions}} in {{the fall}} once again became an anticipated event, as all dealers <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> the models for the upcoming year each October. In this era before the popularization of computerization, {{the primary source of}} information on new models was the dealer. The idea was originally suggested in the 1930s by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression, as a way of stimulating the economy by creating demand. The idea was reintroduced by President Dwight Eisenhower for the same reasons, and this method of introducing next year's models in the preceding autumn lasted well into the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|After {{the fifth}} discipline, a final task <b>would</b> be <b>revealed</b> (it <b>would</b> be {{completing}} a heart-shaped jigsaw puzzle).|$|R
5000|$|The angel {{declares}} that {{the mystery of}} God <b>would</b> be <b>revealed</b> on the sounding of the seventh trumpet.|$|R
50|$|Both Capcom and High Voltage Software {{stated that}} they <b>would</b> be <b>revealing</b> two new games each at E3 2009.|$|R
5|$|TED {{community}} director Tom Rielly {{helped the}} film's producers gain {{approval for the}} use of the TED brand, which had not previously been used for promotional purposes. Rielly was involved in designing the 2023 conference, and said that the association generated millions of unique visits to the TED website. The video's release was accompanied by a fictional TED blog about the 2023 conference and a tie-in website for the fictional Weyland Corporation. On March 6, 2012, the Weyland website was updated to allow visitors to invest in the company as part of a game, which <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> new Prometheus media.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} between Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero, where the stipulation {{was that if}} Guerrero won the match, he <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> the secret he has been hiding from the public that neither Mysterio's nor Guerrero's families wanted revealed. If Mysterio won, however, Guerrero would not reveal the secret. Guerrero executed the Three Amigos on Mysterio and performed a frog splash. Guerrero then tried to score the pinfall, but Mysterio countered by pinning Guerrero to win the match. As a result, Guerrero {{was not able to}} reveal the secret.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} {{attempted}} {{to extend the}} gear for landing, they encountered difficulties, since hydraulic power to the landing gear in that aircraft was normally supplied by the two right side engines, now shut down. The crew initially selected runway 33 for landing, then decided on runway 02, and when they realized they were too high for landing on runway 02, they decided to climb and go around for runway 33 again. While climbing on the two operating engines, with asymmetric thrust, the number one engine (outboard on left side) failed due to over-boosting, leading to a rapid loss of airspeed and eventual stall. The aircraft crashed into trees, and a fire broke out which engulfed the entire aircraft in flames and smoke. The captain and flight engineer were able to escape, but all others were trapped inside the wreckage and were overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning before they could exit, as later autopsies <b>would</b> <b>reveal.</b>|$|E
50|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} of Adderton <b>would,</b> potentially, <b>reveal</b> early building construction techniques, materials and early land {{use of the}} site.|$|R
5000|$|Images <b>would</b> not <b>reveal</b> {{license plate}} numbers or home {{addresses}} and would obscure {{the faces of}} people on streets ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If our {{civilisation}} {{were turned}} upside down and subsequently this gallery were excavated, what <b>would</b> the remnants <b>reveal?</b> <b>Would</b> the forms prove that the subject was evolving, devolving or just coming around again?" [...] (Swallow on Nicholson 1999a) ...|$|R
5|$|Dean {{later said}} {{he had tried to}} commit suicide because he feared he would break under torture and divulge {{critical}} intelligence to the North Koreans. He had been aware of the plans for Operation Chromite, and feared he <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> the information to the North Koreans under torture. Still he remained defiant during interrogations, refusing to divulge any information and acting unafraid, sometimes laughing off threats. He was given better treatment than most UN prisoners in North Korea, as he was regularly fed and rarely subjected to interrogations after his initial capture. He tried several times to escape but failed in doing so. He may have been moved to Manpo when the UN forces took P'yongyang, and returned when the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered the war and forced the UN forces back.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke) is {{examining}} evidence relating to Johnston's murder; she discovers that Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) had suppressed infrared post-mortem photographs. Learning of this, the Elder (Philip Baker Hall)—a high-ranking Group official—demands an explanation; Watts divulges that the murdered {{man had been}} conspiring to pit conflicting faction within the Group against each other. Watts had found evidence {{in one of the}} photographs which may have influenced such a schism and wished to keep it hidden until its significance could be known. The Elder agrees, and similarly decides to hold off on testing which <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> if an artefact in Johnston's possession was an authentic piece of the True Cross.|$|E
5|$|Production did not recommence and the Hoover {{production}} line remained closed permanently. On 19 September 1985, Sinclair Vehicles {{changed its name}} to TPD Limited, with a direct subsidiary named Sinclair Vehicles Sales Limited continuing to sell C5s. TPD only lasted until 15 October, when it was placed into receivership. The receivers announced that 4,500 C5s had been sold by Sinclair Vehicles, with another 4,500 remaining in the company's hands. £7.75 million was reportedly owed to creditors, of which £7 million was owed to Sir Clive Sinclair himself in reflection of his personal investment in the project. Hoover was not among the creditors, as Sinclair had managed to settle the dispute on terms that neither company <b>would</b> <b>reveal.</b>|$|E
50|$|In one version, Phaedra's nurse told Hippolytus of her love, and {{he swore}} he <b>would</b> not <b>reveal</b> {{her as a}} source of information.|$|R

50|$|Eventually, Richardson {{resigned}} {{his seat}} on October 11, 2002, citing personal reasons. It <b>would</b> be <b>revealed</b> {{years later that}} Richardson suffered from Alzheimer's Disease.|$|R
5|$|Realizing he is {{powerless}} to defeat Julius, the Hero learns from Cibba about a powerful sword called Excalibur. Cibba helps him find the Excalibur {{only to find}} a rusty Sword instead. He explains that the rusty sword is the Excalibur and <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> its true strength to whoever it finds worthy. The Hero then raises Dime Tower to reach the Mana Sanctuary and meets a robot known as Marcie. After reaching the top, the tower begins to collapse and Marcie sacrifices himself by throwing the Hero across. After obtaining and passing the sword's trials, the Hero confronts and defeats Julius {{at the cost of}} the Mana Tree's life. The Heroine's mother reveals she is the current Mana Tree and before dying, asks the Heroine to succeed her position. The Heroine agrees and bids farewell to the Hero as she becomes the next Mana Tree and the Hero her guardian.|$|E
5|$|The Shangani Patrol {{continued}} its approach {{during the late}} evening, and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula. Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves. The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not understand why {{there appeared to be}} so few Company soldiers, nor why they <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> their position like this. They concluded that it must be a trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times. Following the fifth call from Napier, Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending to pocket it. Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak. When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them.|$|E
5|$|Arkane were {{influenced}} by some criticisms of the first Dishonored. Although the difficulty was not considered a major problem, a sizeable number of players had complained the first was too easy, and thus the harder difficulty settings were reworked. The chaos system of Dishonored, considered as merely a binary ersatz meter, was intended more depth in the sequel. The altered chaos system, where different individuals grant varying amounts of chaos, was implemented due to how many players used the Heart in the original game. As the Heart <b>would</b> <b>reveal</b> secrets about whomever it was pointed at, players would use it to decide which NPCs to kill and which to leave be or spare. Also intended to yield additional improvements was the upgrade system, which would {{for the first time}} level up based on a skill tree. Bonecharms were made into craftable items, with 400,000 possible combinations available. While taking into account the intricacies of how supernatural abilities would be used, designers faced increased difficulty in relation to the play-style where the game is traversed in their absence, noting the accommodation of the play-style {{in a way that would}} not cancel out the other as a challenge.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Origins and Omens" [...] backup {{story in}} Booster Gold #17 hinted that Black Beetle would return {{and that his}} true {{identity}} <b>would</b> be <b>revealed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Super Dave {{would often}} respond to critics in a disreputable or trashy news source; he <b>would</b> often <b>reveal</b> {{the name of}} the source, a reputable source such as 60 Minutes.|$|R
50|$|Iris (Ode Bitton): Pregnant nanny of Emilie and Igor's children. Solves {{their problem}} by giving to Thomas Emilie's {{letters to the}} {{newspapers}} which <b>would</b> have <b>revealed</b> the Thirteen and scandalized Pierre.|$|R
