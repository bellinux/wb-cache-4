5|$|In the mid-1920s Nick Prata (as he {{was then}} known) began working in the film industry, doing odd jobs around the set for Fox Film, such as prop boy, script clerk, and {{assistant}} cameraman. While working as an assistant on Raoul Walsh's <b>What</b> <b>Price</b> Glory? in 1926, Prata was given a screen test, after which his name was changed to Nick Stuart. Shortly after, he became Howard Hawks's personal assistant. He appeared in minor roles in two film shorts, before being {{given an opportunity to}} act in a featured role by Hawks, in 1927's, The Cradle Snatchers. After the success of The Cradle Snatchers, Stuart would star in several shorts, many of which again paired him with his Snatchers co-star, Sally Phipps, which included Gentlemen Prefer Scotch, and Cupid and the Clock (based on a short story by O. Henry). The two would star in Stuart's next three films in 1927 and 1928: High School Hero, Why Sailors Go Wrong, and News Parade. Stuart's next role was that of Sandy, starring alongside Victor McLaglen in William K. Howard's The River Pirate in 1928. Stuart and Sue Carol had been linked together romantically since early in 1928, and would co-star in Stuart's next project, Girls Gone Wild.|$|E

25|$|During {{the filming}} of Monsieur Beaucaire, both Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks {{approached}} Valentino privately, due to his contract with Ritz-Carlton, about joining with United Artists. Valentino's contract with United Artists provided $10,000 a week for only three pictures a year, plus a percentage of his films. The contract excluded Rambova from production of his films and the film set. Valentino's acceptance of the terms caused a major rift in his marriage to Rambova. George Ullman, who had negotiated the contract with United Artists, offered Rambova $30,000 to finance a film of her own. It became her only film, titled <b>What</b> <b>Price</b> Beauty? and starred Myrna Loy.|$|E

25|$|Republic's {{anxiety was}} erased by the resounding success of The Quiet Man (Republic, 1952), a pet project which Ford {{had wanted to}} make since the 1930s (and almost did so in 1937 with an {{independent}} cooperative called Renowned Artists Company). It became his biggest grossing picture to date, taking nearly $4million in the US alone {{in its first year}} and ranking in the top 10 box office films of its year. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won Ford his fourth Oscar for Best Director, as well a second Best Cinematography Oscar for Winton Hoch. It was followed by <b>What</b> <b>Price</b> Glory?

25|$|There {{will usually}} be an {{estimate}} of <b>what</b> <b>price</b> the lot will fetch. In an ascending open auction it is considered important {{to get at least}} a 50-percent increase in the bids from start to finish. To accomplish this, the auctioneer must start the auction by announcing a suggested opening bid (SOB) that is low enough to be immediately accepted by one of the bidders. Once there is an opening bid, there will quickly be several other, higher bids submitted. Experienced auctioneers will often select an SOB that is about 45 percent of the (lowest) estimate. Thus there is a certain margin of safety to ensure that there will indeed be a lively auction with many bids submitted. Several observations indicate that the lower the SOB, the higher the final winning bid. This is due to {{the increase in the number}} of bidders attracted by the low SOB.|$|E

We consider <b>what</b> <b>prices</b> a social planner imposes to drive the players' choice towards the equilibrium distribution of first best. Moreover, we consider <b>what</b> <b>prices</b> (and <b>what</b> distribution) a monopolist, maximizing his profit, chooses, when he has to satisfy an universal service requirement and when he may restrict his supply. Finally, we determine which capacity level is optimal to install for either a social planner or a monopolist in this setting. ...|$|R
