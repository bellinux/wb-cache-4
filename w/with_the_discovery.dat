5|$|Before {{the discoveries}} {{of the early}} 21st century, astronomers had no real need for a formal {{definition}} for planets. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of Pluto in 1930, astronomers considered the Solar System to have nine planets, along with thousands of smaller bodies such as asteroids and comets.

5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of Pluto in 1930, most astronomers {{considered}} the Solar System to have nine planets, along {{with thousands of}} significantly smaller bodies (asteroids and comets). For almost 50years Pluto {{was thought to be}} larger than Mercury, but <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> in 1978 of Pluto's moon Charon, it became possible to measure Pluto's mass accurately and to determine that it was much smaller than initial estimates. It was roughly one-twentieth the mass of Mercury, which made Pluto by far the smallest planet. Although it was still more than ten times as massive as the largest object in the asteroid belt, Ceres, it had one-fifth the mass of Earth's Moon. Furthermore, having some unusual characteristics, such as large orbital eccentricity and a high orbital inclination, it became evident that it was a different kind of body from any of the other planets.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{a home for}} some species of birds, Surtsey has also {{been used as a}} stopping-off point for migrating birds, particularly those en-route between Europe and Iceland. Species that have been seen briefly on the island include whooper swans, various species of geese, and common ravens. Although Surtsey lies {{to the west of the}} main migration routes to Iceland, it has become a more common stopping point as its vegetation has improved. In 2008, the 14th bird species was detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of a common raven's nest.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, a {{significant}} part of the world's production of cobalt blue (a dye made with cobalt compounds and alumina) and smalt (cobalt glass powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting) was carried out at the Norwegian Blaafarveværket. The first mines for the production of smalt in the 16th century were located in Norway, Sweden, Saxony and Hungary. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of cobalt ore in New Caledonia in 1864, the mining of cobalt in Europe declined. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of ore deposits in Ontario, Canada in 1904 and the discovery of even larger deposits in the Katanga Province in the Congo in 1914, the mining operations shifted again. When the Shaba conflict started in 1978, the copper mines of Katanga Province nearly stopped production. The impact on the world cobalt economy from this conflict was smaller than expected: cobalt is a rare metal, the pigment is highly toxic, and the industry had already established effective ways for recycling cobalt materials. In some cases, industry was able to change to cobalt-free alternatives.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the {{classification}} of Herrerasaurus was unclear because it was known from very fragmentary remains. It was hypothesized to be a basal theropod, a basal sauropodomorph, a basal saurischian, or not a dinosaur at all but another type of archosaur. However, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of an almost complete skeleton and skull in 1988, Herrerasaurus has been classified as either an early theropod or an early saurischian in at least five recent reviews of theropod evolution, with many researchers treating it at least tentatively as the most primitive member of Theropoda.|$|E

5|$|HAT-P-33b is {{a planet}} in the orbit of HAT-P-33, which lies 1,367 light years away from Earth. Its {{discovery}} was reported in June 2011, although it was suspected to be a planet as early as 2004. The planet is about three-fourths the mass of Jupiter, but is almost eighty percent larger than Jupiter is; this inflation has, as <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of similar planets WASP-17b and HAT-P-32b, {{raised the question of}} what (other than temperature) causes these planets to become so large.|$|E
5|$|In 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele {{discovered}} that a new acid, tungstic acid, could be made from scheelite (at the time named tungsten). Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested {{that it might be}} possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid. In 1783, José and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, at the Royal Basque Society in the town of Bergara, Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal, and they are credited <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of the element.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Chaplin {{established}} his official filmography {{with the publication}} of his book, My Autobiography. The filmography consisted of 80 motion pictures released since 1914.

5|$|In 1994, Mikhailov {{suggested}} that Macroolithus represented the eggs {{of a large}} theropod, specifically Tarbosaurus, based on the large size of the eggs and the largely overlapping distribution. However, the discovery of an oviraptorid embryo inside an elongatoolithid egg cast doubt on this hypothesis. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of multiple oviraptorosaur-elongatoolithid associations in the late 1990s, the eggs of elongatoolithids came to be accepted as belonging to oviraptorosaurian dinosaurs. Oviraptorid parentage was confirmed for Macroolithus when, in 2008, oviraptorid embryos resembling Heyuannia were discovered inside a pair of M. yaotunensis eggs in Jiangxi.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Lorenzo Hagglund, {{a veteran}} of World War I and a history buff, began searching the strait for remains of the battle.
