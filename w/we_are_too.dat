They would take us back to a meaner time when money was the measure of all things. We stand for the future that was sought and won and which must now be defended and enhanced.|$|E
2500|$|... ust {{as in the}} {{sciences}} {{we have learned that}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> ignorant to safely pronounce anything impossible, so for the individual, since we cannot know just what are his limitations, we can hardly say with certainty that anything is necessarily within or beyond his grasp. Each must remember that no one can predict to what heights of wealth, fame, or usefulness he may rise until he has honestly endeavored, and he should derive courage from the fact that all sciences have been, at some time, in the same condition as he, and that it has often proved true that the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.|$|E
2500|$|He {{elaborated}} on {{his opposition}} to the program: [...] "I think we are removing much of the burden from those that could actually help reach these objectives, particular the growth and employment objectives, and we are putting that onus strangely on ourselves rather than letting it rest where it should lie. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> accepting of dangerous policies from others that have been long in the making, and we should put the burden on them." [...] While Federal Reserve officials routinely offer their views on non-monetary questions such as taxes, spending and regulations, it is unusual for a Federal Reserve official to suggest that monetary support should be withheld in order to compel other branches of government to enact the Federal Reserve's favored policies.|$|E

2500|$|In 231, a Wu officer Sun Bu (孫布) {{secretly}} sent {{a messenger}} to meet Wang Ling, the Wei inspector of Yang Province, and convey {{his desire to}} defect to Wei. Sun Bu also said in his message: [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> far apart from each other, I cannot come to you. You will need to send troops to escort me over." [...] Wang Ling then passed the letter to Man Chong {{and asked him to}} send a convoy of troops to escort Sun Bu to Yang Province. Man Chong suspected that Sun Bu was pretending to defect so he refused and wrote a reply to Sun Bu in Wang Ling's name: [...] "It is good to hear that you have recognised the folly of your ways and now desire to leave your tyrannical government and return to the path of righteousness. This is truly commendable. However, as much as I would like to send troops to escort you over, I do not think it is a good idea. If I send too few troops, {{they will not be able}} to protect you. If I send too many troops, the Wu government will find it suspicious. I think you should secretly make plans for yourself first and act accordingly when the time comes." ...|$|E
2500|$|No, we do {{not love}} humanity; {{but on the other}} hand we are not nearly [...] "German" [...] enough, in the sense in which the word [...] "German" [...] is {{constantly}} being used nowadays, to advocate nationalism and race hatred and to be able to take pleasure in the national scabies of the heart and blood poisoning that now leads the nations of Europe to delimit and barricade themselves against each other as if it were a matter of quarantine. For that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> open-minded, too malicious, too spoiled, also too well-informed, too [...] "traveled": we far prefer to live on mountains, apart, [...] "untimely," [...] in past or future centuries, merely in order to keep ourselves from experiencing the silent rage to which we know we should be condemned as eyewitnesses of politics that are desolating the German spirit by making it vain and that is, moreover, petty politics:—to keep its own creation from immediately falling apart again, is it not finding it necessary to plant it between two deadly hatreds? must it not desire the eternalization of the European system of a lot of petty states? ... We who are homeless are too manifold and mixed racially and in our descent, being [...] "modern men," [...] and consequently do not feel tempted to participate in the mendacious racial self-admiration and racial indecency that parades in Germany today as a sign of a German way of thinking and that is doubly false and obscene among the people of the [...] "historical sense." [...] We are, in one word—and let this be our word of honor!— good Europeans, the heirs of Europe, the rich, oversupplied, but also overly obligated heirs of thousands of years of European spirit: as such, we have also outgrown Christianity and are averse to it, and precisely because we have grown out of it, because our ancestors were Christians who in their Christianity were uncompromisingly upright; for their faith they willingly sacrificed possessions and position, blood and fatherland. We—do the same. For what? For our unbelief? For every kind of unbelief? No, you know better than that, my friends! The hidden Yes in you is stronger than all Nos and Maybes that afflict you and your age like a disease; and when you have to embark on the sea, you emigrants, you, too, are compelled to this by— a faith! ...|$|E

6000|$|How we had wasted Ireland!
