It depicted {{construction workers}} who were satisfied with the working conditions at the construction site. However, further analysis of the <b>work</b> <b>site</b> showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of One World Trade Center, including 34 not reported to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Workers also left post-9/11-related graffiti at the site, which are supposed to symbolize rebirth and resilience.|$|E
5|$|Churches {{managed to}} {{convince}} {{the commander of the}} brigade to conduct an operation to free the rest of the work party the following day, by giving him crucial information regarding the <b>work</b> <b>site</b> and the guards. Next morning Churches and Laws returned with some hundred Partisans to await the arrival of the work party by the usual train. As soon as work had begun the Partisans disarmed the eight guards and captured the four civilian overseers. In a short time the POWs, guards, and civilian overseers were being escorted south along a different route than that used by the first seven escapees the previous afternoon.|$|E
40|$|The Ten Thousand Islands (TTI) {{region of}} {{southwest}} Florida contains extensive prehistoric shell middens and mounds called shell works. Though shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> comprise {{some of the}} largest and most complicated prehistoric shell constructions in the world, prior to this study, none had been thoroughly examined in their spatial, temporal and functional contexts, and shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> remain very poorly understood. This thesis aims to define the archaeological characteristics of shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> within the TTI region, including their spatial patterns, function, geographic extent, and temporal affiliation. Though shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> are complex, complicated sites that are analogous to palimpsests, I argue that shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> are more than just large shell midden accumulations, amalgamations of shell mounds, or assemblages of features; they are distinct, socially constructed prehistoric landscapes. In order to understand these complex histories, I contend that they need to be examined on several complementary temporal and spatial scales, and I incorporate a multi-scalar landscape approach. This includes examining shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> as individually constructed features and sites, as human centered social landscapes, and within a larger, regional settlement pattern context. Central to my thesis is the hypothesis that shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> reflect changes in social complexity. I posit that shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> throughout the region are arranged in spatially similar patterns, ranging from small, simple shell midden rings, to massive islands completely constructed out of complex arrangements of shell. I test the theory that similarity or diversity in site layouts, and the presence or absence of certain architectural features reflects changes in community and social organization over time, and thus, social complexity.

5|$|However, wall {{construction}} continued {{regardless of}} court politics during this time. The Ordos walls underwent extension, elaboration, and repair {{well into the}} 16th century. Brick and stone started to replace tamped earth as the wall building material, because they offered better protection and durability. This change in material {{gave rise to a}} number of necessary accommodations with regard to logistics, and inevitably a drastic increase in costs. Instead of being able to draw on local resources, building projects now required brick-kilns, quarries, and transportation routes to deliver bricks to the <b>work</b> <b>site.</b> Also, masons had to be hired since the local peasantry proved inadequate for the level of sophistication that brick constructions required. Work that originally could be done by one man in a month with earth now required 100 men to do in stone.|$|E
5|$|Other {{visitors}} {{stayed to}} prospect for and mine deposits of copper, gold, lead, and silver. These sporadic mining ventures were hampered by their remote location and the harsh desert environment. In December 1903, two men from Ballarat were prospecting for silver. One was an out-of-work Irish miner named Jack Keane {{and the other}} was a one-eyed Basque butcher named Domingo Etcharren. Quite by accident, Keane discovered an immense ledge of free-milling gold by the duo's <b>work</b> <b>site</b> and named the claim the Keane Wonder Mine. This started a minor and short-lived gold rush into the area. The Keane Wonder Mine, along with mines at Rhyolite, Skidoo and Harrisburg, were the only ones to extract enough metal ore to make them worthwhile. Outright shams such as Leadfield also occurred, but most ventures quickly ended after a short series of prospecting mines failed to yield evidence of significant ore (these mines now dot the entire area and are a significant hazard to anyone who enters them). The boom towns which sprang up around these mines flourished during the 1900s (decade) but soon declined after the Panic of 1907.|$|E

25|$|The {{prisoners are}} {{assigned}} numbers for easy identification {{and in an}} effort to dehumanize them; Ivan Denisovich's prisoner number is Щ-854. Each day, the squad leader receives their work assignment for that day, and the squad are then fed according to how they perform. Prisoners in each squad are thus forced to work together and pressure each other to get their task done. If any prisoner is slacking, the whole squad will be punished. Despite this, Solzhenitsyn shows that a surprising loyalty exists among the work gang members, with Shukhov teaming up with other prisoners to steal felt and extra bowls of porridge; even the squad leader defies the authorities by tar-papering over the empty windows at their <b>work</b> <b>site.</b> Indeed, only through such solidarity can the prisoners do anything more than survive from day to day.|$|E
25|$|The {{track laying}} was divided up into various parts. In {{advance of the}} track layers, {{surveyors}} consulting with engineers determined where the track would go. Workers then built and prepared the roadbed, dug or blasted through hills, filled in washes, built trestles, bridges or culverts across streams or valleys, made tunnels if needed, and laid the ties. The actual track-laying gang would then lay rails on the previously laid ties positioned on the roadbed, drive the spikes, and bolt the fishplate bars to each rail. At the same time, another gang would distribute telegraph poles and wire along the grade, while the cooks prepared dinner and the clerks busied themselves with accounts, records, using the telegraph line to relay requests for more materials and supplies or communicate with supervisors. Usually the workers lived in camps built near their <b>work</b> <b>site.</b> Supplies were ordered by the engineers and hauled by rail, possibly then to be loaded on wagons if they were needed ahead of the railhead. Camps were moved when the railhead moved a significant distance. Later, as the railroad started moving long distances every few days, some railroad cars had bunkhouses built in them that moved with the workers—the Union Pacific had used this technique since 1866. Almost all of the roadbed work {{had to be done}} manually, using shovels, picks, axes, two-wheeled dump carts, wheelbarrows, ropes, scrapers, etc., with initially only black powder available for blasting. Carts pulled by mules, and horses were about the only labor saving devices available then. Lumber and ties were usually provided by independent contractors who cut, hauled and sawed the timber as required.|$|E

The diving bell is the elevator or lift that transfers divers from the system to the <b>work</b> <b>site</b> and back. At the completion of work or a mission, the saturation diving team is decompressed gradually back to atmospheric pressure by the slow venting of system pressure, at rates of about of [...] to [...] per day, (schedules vary).

40|$|Use of plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) charging infrastructure at six <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> in California varied from site to site, {{based on a}} number of factors that include the following:- The cost of charging- Employee commute distance- Demand for charging station use- Policies for how long a vehicle can be connected to workplace charging stations. In general, drivers with longer commutes tended to charge more often at work. However, some employees with short commutes still charged at work when cost was low. The <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> studied employed a mix of policies to manage charging station use, including levying fees for charging, requiring the use of a reservation system, providing employees tools to self-manage charging, and requiring drivers to move their vehicles upon completion of charging. At three <b>work</b> <b>sites,</b> the combination of policies employed effectively enabled numerous vehicles to frequently use a fixed number of charging stations.
