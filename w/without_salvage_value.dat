Strong assumptions are made to obtain tractable models. While such mathematical models can hardly represent real-life situations, they help understanding the relationship between price and customers purchasing behavior. Two mathematical models are presented: (i) A stochastic dynamic pricing model for time dated items <b>without</b> <b>salvage</b> values; (ii) A stochastic dynamic pricing model for time dated items with <b>salvage</b> <b>values.</b> We limit ourselves to time dated items with no supply option in monopolistic environments with myopic customers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Salvage</b> <b>value</b> or {{resale value}} {{is one of}} the cost {{components}} of machinery replacement models. Some replacement models exclude <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> in the build-up of cost. Yet it is the value that is adversely affected by deterioration. Various mathematical formulas for machinery <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> have been formulated. The formula for <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> presented by Lake and Muhlemann is of interest. It is presented in an exponential form. The suitability of this function to our industrial environment has to be justified bearing in mind that some assets have little or no secondhand value. To ensure a balanced investigation, efforts are made to obtain <b>salvage</b> <b>values</b> for motor grader, representing large scale industrial environment and photocopier, representing small and medium scale industrial environment. It is difficult to obtain <b>salvage</b> <b>values</b> because records are hardly kept for such values. However, two sets of <b>salvage</b> <b>values</b> are obtained for each of the machines. One set is for the calibration of the <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> function by Lake and Muhlemann while the other is for comparison between the measured and predicted <b>salvage</b> <b>values.</b> This paper therefore sets out to investigate and verify the suitability of <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> function formulated by Lake and Muhlemann to our industrial environment. It is hoped that the investigation will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> function for proper application in our industrial environment...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of the Newsvendor model, little {{attention has been paid to}} its robustness with respect to the estimation of one of its inputs, the <b>salvage</b> <b>value.</b> This oversight is inappropriate because we show that the performance of the Newsvendor model is quite sensitive to the particular method chosen to estimate the <b>salvage</b> <b>value.</b> We highlight two reasons for this sensitivity: small errors in the estimate of the <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> can lead to a signi…cant pro…t loss and, more interestingly, there exists a dependence between the estimation method used and the resulting data obtained. To explain, the ex ante <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> inputted into the model determines the order quantity which then results in some ex post observed salvagevalue. Anestimationmethodshouldbeevaluatedintermsofits equilibrium performance, i. e., the inputted <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> equals the expected observed <b>salvage</b> <b>value.</b> We evaluate several intuitive estimation methods and …nd that they perform poorly in equilibrium. We also identify an estimation method that yields the optimal pro…t. We conclude that the Newsvendor model is robust to errors in the estimation of the <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> as long as the proper estimation method is utilized...|$|R

50|$|Straight-line {{depreciation}} is {{the simplest}} and most often used method. In this method, the company estimates the residual value (also known as <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> or scrap value) of the asset {{at the end of}} the period during which it will be used to generate revenues (useful life). (The <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> may be zero, or even negative due to costs required to retire it; however, for depreciation purposes <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> is not generally calculated at below zero.) The company will then charge the same amount to depreciation each year over that period, until the value shown for the asset has reduced from the original cost to the <b>salvage</b> <b>value.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytical}} {{solution for the}} after-tax replacement investment decision for an asset subject to deteriorating operating costs and <b>salvage</b> <b>value.</b> The advantages of solving the threefactor replacement model analytically are that it extends the scope to include <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> and the depreciation tax shield, while yielding a solution more efficiently than purely numerical methods. We show that the incremental value rendered by the replacement has to exceed the net re-investment cost, a finding that mirrors the standard result for one-factor models. The replacement policy is shown to vary with asset age, with younger assets being replaced at a lower operating cost threshold than older assets, and to vary with the <b>salvage</b> <b>value,</b> which is inversely related to the threshold. In line with expectations, an operating cost volatility increase raises the threshold, but {{an increase in the}} <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> volatility or a decrease in the correlation between the operating cost and <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> lowers the threshold...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this article}} is to analyse the asset {{replacement}} problem in the perspective of optimal replacement time given a certain tax environment and depreciation policy. Using a real options approach, our model minimises current operation and maintenance costs and permits a new valuation of the replacement flexibility under a multi-cycle environment. The innovation on the valuation process comes from adding an autonomous <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> factor. Results from partial differential equations reveal relevant differences from those observed in one-factor models, specifically in optimal replacement levels and in the non-monotonous effects of <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> variation. This paper provides enhancements to existing literature on equivalent annual cost by formulating a cost-minimisation problem conditioned by autonomous <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> dynamics, and it contributes to Real Options literature by introducing a <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> factor in the valuation model...|$|R

40|$|The newsvendor {{model is}} {{designed}} to decide {{how much of a}} product to order when the product is to be sold over a short selling season with stochastic demand and there are no additional opportunities to replenish inventory. There are many practical situations that reasonably conform to those assumptions, but the traditional newsvendor model also assumes a fixed salvage value: all inventory left over {{at the end of the}} season is sold off at a fixed per-unit price. The fixed <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> assumption is questionable when a clearance price is rationally chosen in response to the events observed during the selling season: a deep discount should be taken if there is plenty of inventory remaining at the end of the season, whereas a shallow discount is appropriate for a product with higher than expected demand. This paper solves for the optimal order quantity in the newsvendor model, assuming rational clearance pricing. We then study the performance of the traditional newsvendor model. The key to effective implementation of the traditional newsvendor model is choosing an appropriate fixed <b>salvage</b> <b>value.</b> (We show that an optimal order quantity cannot be generally achieved by merely enhancing the traditional newsvendor model to include a nonlinear <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> function.) We demonstrate that several intuitive methods for estimating the <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> can lead to an excessively large order quantity and a substantial profit loss. Even though the traditional model can result in poor performance, the model seems as if it is working correctly: the order quantity chosen is optimal given the <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> inputted to the model, and the observe...|$|R
