5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{it does not matter}} really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
500|$|In Japan, {{there have}} been critics and other filmmakers who have accused his work of elitism, because of his focus on exceptional, heroic {{individuals}} and groups of men. In her DVD commentary on Seven Samurai, Joan Mellen maintains that certain shots of the samurai characters Kambei and Kyuzo, which to her reveal Kurosawa [...] "privileging" [...] these samurai, [...] "support the argument voiced by several Japanese critics that Kurosawa was an elitist... Kurosawa was hardly a progressive director, they argued, since his peasants could not discover among their own ranks leaders who might rescue the village ... Kurosawa defended himself against this charge in his interview with me. 'I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> after everything the peasants were the stronger, closely clinging to the earth... It was the samurai who were weak because they were being blown by the winds of time.|$|E
500|$|On March 5, 2009 at the O2 Arena, Jackson {{announced}} that he was to perform 10 concerts as part of a comeback. Jackson suggested likely post-show retirement by stating: [...] "I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> these will be my final show performances in London. When I say this is it, it really means this is it, this will be the final curtain call." [...] On March 11, two days before pre-sale began, an extra 40 dates were added to meet high demand, bringing the number of shows to 50— five of these dates were reserved in their entirety for the public sale. Jackson's 50 dates would make the concerts the longest residency at the arena. In May 2009, the show was originally set to have begun on July 8, 2009, and finished on March 6, 2010.|$|E

500|$|B in the Mix: The Remixes {{received}} little promotion compared to Spears' standards. A promotional extended play (EP) titled Key Cuts from Remixed with several remixes from {{the album was}} released in September 2005. A contest was launched on Spears' paid fan site for those who pre-ordered the album. The winner received a copy of , a bottle of Spears' fragrance Fantasy with an additional lotion and make-up kit, and a personalized autographed picture of Spears. On November 22, 2005, the day the album was released, a release party was held at an unspecified nightclub in Los Angeles, California, organized by Spears' management and the webmaster of the fansite WorldOfBritney.com. It was a limited event to five hundred people, including members of the fansite or her official fan club. Spears commented: [...] "I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I {{love the idea of}} all my fans getting together to celebrate the release of my new album. I was happy to help! I hope you have a great night out at the club and dance all night long!".|$|E
2500|$|The {{announcement}} of Jackson's first 10 performances {{was made by}} the singer himself, during a press conference at the O2 Arena on March 5, 2009. As many as 7,000 fans and 350 reporters awaited the singer's arrival, many donning Jackson-related clothing. The singer commented at the conference, [...] "I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> these will be my final show performances in London. When I say this is it, it really means this is it", adding that it was his [...] "final curtain call", although he may have just been referring to performing in London. Organizers touted the residency as, [...] "dramatic shows [...] promise an explosive return with a band of the highest calibre, a state-of-the-art stage show and incredible surprise support acts". Hours before the press conference, promotional posters for the residency were displayed around London. Further promotion took up an entire commercial break period on ITV London during Dancing on Ice, the first time this has ever happened for a musical artist. The advert, which cost £1 million to air, was viewed by 11 million people.|$|E
2500|$|At a February 2014 {{listening}} {{session for}} the album, Schoolboy Q {{spoke on the}} album's opening track: [...] "When I first made [...] all I wanted to say was that my grandma showed me my first strap. That's all I wanted {{to put in the}} song. I just thought that was so gangsta. It was kind of weird, too, now that I really think about it. She used to take her bullets out of the gun and leave the clip in her room and let me play with her gun. I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.' Like, 'Your dickies is cut super perfect and they got the right amount of dirt on them. That shit is fly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His priests {{have told}} Jana to kill us; {{we are about}} to die," [...] he said. [...] "Before I die I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the lady, the wife of the lord----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] said Meg, [...] "he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we're all schaming to rob Anty of her money--only he daren't, for {{the life}} of him, spake it out {{straight}} forrard." ...|$|R
6000|$|Directly I had uttered {{these words}} I asked myself angrily why the deuce did I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that?</b> Mr. Burns in answer had only blinked at me. What {{on earth did}} he mean? ...|$|R
60|$|He paused. He had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> {{but it was}} not {{the thing}} we had to say.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{perhaps we}} shall {{be able to talk}} for five minutes," [...] she says. [...] "I've so often <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I shall never forgive you. You have been simply horrid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we {{will both}} go {{to call on}} her very soon. If I sent you, she might think I was mad, and I won't give her that satisfaction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did; I'd {{only a few}} loose {{dollars on}} me. Now I see what you're driving at, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> any little {{reputation}} I possess can pretty well take care of itself." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{other man}} was {{suddenly}} ablaze with passion. His form {{had lost its}} stoop. His voice was firm. [...] "I merely <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> if you play the goat with that girl, I'll kill you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I should hate any one {{who bought}} Pardons ten times worse than I used {{to hate the}} second Mrs. Chapin. Think what we've put into it of our two selves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} say to you--I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I was sorry if I made you angry yesterday. I didn't mean to make fun. I didn't, indeed. It is only my way of talking. It was so good of you, so noble of you, to let it make no difference." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's me--Short'--a {{voice called}} through the keyhole. 'I only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{we must be}} off early to-morrow morning, my dear, because unless we get {{the start of the}} dogs and the conjuror, the villages won't be worth a penny.

6000|$|... "Oh, no! The rascal is {{come over}} to my side.

60|$|There {{was such}} an utter and abrupt change in the speaker's voice and manner--which until then had been lazily fastidious and confident--that Cissy was startled. And the change being rude and dictatorial, she was startled into opposition. She had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the {{improvement}} had been suggested by HER, but she took a more aggressive attitude.|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse me," [...] he stammered, {{without raising}} his eyes, [...] "I was looking for--for--the old lady. I--I beg your pardon. I didn't know that you--the young ladies--company--were here. I intended--I only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> my friend--" [...] He {{stopped at the}} slight smile that passed quickly over Mrs. Hale's mouth, and his pale face reddened with an angry flush.|$|E
60|$|Merton <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{the most}} {{magnificent}} of natural varieties {{would only be}} in its proper place.

6000|$|... "Sure. I'd {{only a few}} loose dollars with me." [...] Vane frowned again. [...] "Now I {{see what}} you're driving at; and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> any little {{reputation}} I possess can pretty well take care of itself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Davy, eagerly wriggling {{down on his}} knees, [...] "I can {{say them}} now all right. I ain't scared now <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'if I should die before I wake,' like I was when I was <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she confessed, [...] "not long ago, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hate you, and I guess I 'most succeeded. It {{made things}} easier.

6000|$|... "Shush! She wouldn't of done it if /you'd/ been home, Alviry. Lord knows, I hope we'll {{be there}} before fall's over.

60|$|This {{speech was}} grating on Deronda, {{and he would}} not answer it, but looked gravely before him.

That constraint seemed to last a long while, neither Gwendolen nor Deronda looking at the other, till Lush slowly relieved the wall of his weight, and joined some one at a distance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not going}} to repeat it, Charlie. I only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I do not think my father and yours are very {{friendly}} together, which is natural, when my father is all for King William, and your father for King James. He makes no secret of that, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{small part}} of it," [...] assured Wyllard. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> when I first saw this house, and how you seemed fitted to it, my misgivings about Gregory's {{decision}} troubled me once more.

6000|$|As {{they were}} about to start on their homeward trail, Serviss sought {{opportunity}} to say: [...] "Mr. Lambert, I met this man Clarke at your house last night, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I don't think his influence on your family is particularly wholesome. He's morbid and given to fads." ...|$|R
