40|$|The author holds a PhD in {{economics}} and {{works at the}} Riksbank's Forecast Division. The development of wages in an economy {{can have an impact}} on infla-tion and as it is the objective of the Riksbank to keep inflation at a low and stable level we have to regularly analyse and produce forecasts for <b>wage</b> <b>development.</b> Historically, wages and prices in Sweden have covaried fairly well. However, instability in price and wage formation, for example in the form of upward or downward price-wage spirals, can occur in an economy for various reasons. The aim {{of this article is to}} provide a greater understanding of how instability in price and wage formation can arise, but also of how the Swedish wage-formation model works. The article analyses wage for-mation in Sweden from the historical, institutional and international perspectives. It also presents an econometric model for wage formation that makes it possible to analyse how a number of factors affect wage formation in the Swedish economy. This model shows that the situation on the labour market and the collective agreements between the central employee and employer organisations are of great significance for wage formation in the short term. Why do central banks produce forecasts of <b>wage</b> <b>development?</b> Safeguarding price stability is an overall objective for most central banks today. The main tool that the central banks use to keep inflation low and stable is the policy rate. As the interest rate decisions affect inflation with a certain time lag, the central banks must base their decisions on forecasts of future inflation and the factors that may affect it. One such factor may be <b>wage</b> <b>development</b> in the economy. Many central banks thus attempt to forecast the development of wages. <b>Wage</b> <b>development</b> can, however, be measured in different ways and the measure or measures used var...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} Germany's wage growth relative to {{the other members of}} the euro-zone with the aim of isolating the factor(s) that triggered the country's recent impressive gain in relative cost competitiveness. To our knowledge, this is the first exercise that uses relative measures to explain the key driver(s) of intra-EU 12 competitiveness. We find that German <b>wage</b> <b>developments</b> have been importantly affected by the actual EMU regime and in particular by the fact that the monetary policy conducted by the ECB had the "perverse effect" of delivering above-average real interest rates to a slow-(wage) -inflation country like Germany. Even if the country's strong export performance has started delivering growth as of 2006, the role of the EMU regime in explaining intra-area <b>wage</b> <b>developments</b> casts doubts on the sustainability of the recent adjustment, and ultimately on the automatic smoothing of divergences inside the monetary union. Furthermore, if German unions increase their wage demands on the back of more favourable economic conditions, it is not to be excluded that their price behaviour will affect average inflation in the euro-zone, given that Germany represents one third of the euro-area's GDP, thereby prompting a restrictive response from the ECB...|$|R

40|$|The {{significance}} of the manufacturing sector for the economies of both the European Union and the euro area has declined dramatically {{over the past ten}} years. However, development varied between the individual member states, which is particularly evident in a comparison between France and Germany. The manufacturing industry in Germany was able to maintain its position within the national economy, halting the structural change towards the service sector. Conversely, there has been rapid deindustrialization in France: here, value added from the manufacturing sector {{as a percentage of the}} overall economy is now even lower than in eastern Germany. Within the German industrial sector, the manufacture of technically complex goods has continued to gain ground. In France, on the other hand, the production of such goods has always been relatively insignificant and, over the last decade, has become even less important. The gap between these two countries is also widening with regard to <b>wage</b> <b>development</b> as well as price competitiveness: in Germany, wage growth has lagged behind increases in production, whereas in France salaries have increased at a much faster pace than production. German manufacturing was, therefore, able to expand substantially into foreign markets, while the French industrial sector is the poorest performing in the EU. If national currencies had been retained, the ramifications of such diverging developments would have been mitigated through exchange rate adjustments.
