5|$|On 4 July 2007, the {{technology}} was to be displayed at the Kinetica Museum, Spitalfields Market, London. A unit constructed of clear plastic was prepared so that the arrangement of magnets could be seen and {{to demonstrate that the}} device operated <b>without</b> <b>external</b> power sources. The public demonstration was delayed and then cancelled because of technical difficulties. Steorn initially said that the problems had been caused by excessive heat from the lighting.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{operational}} doctrine {{developed by the}} RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission <b>without</b> <b>external</b> guidance and be reliant upon {{the effectiveness of their}} individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great emphasis was placed on continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise {{the operational}} lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E
5|$|Knights of the Nine is {{identical}} to the gameplay of Oblivion; the basic design, maneuvers, and interfaces remain unchanged. As such, it is a fantasy-based role-playing adventure game. Players begin Oblivion by defining their character; deciding on its skill set, specialization, physical features, and race. Knights of the Nine is an example of open-ended-style gameplay: the main quest may be delayed or completely ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, interacts with NPCs, and develops a character according to their taste. Furthering the goal of open-ended gameplay, Knights of the Nine, unlike Bethesda's prior content packs for Oblivion, begins with no explicit prodding towards the newly introduced content; players must seek out and find the game's quest <b>without</b> <b>external</b> aid.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{problems}} that have affected the F-FDTL throughout its existence were caused by the process used to establish the force. A key flaw in this process was that FALINTIL's high command was allowed to select candidates for the military from members of FALINTIL <b>without</b> <b>external</b> oversight. As a result, the selection was conducted, to a large degree, on the basis of applicants' political allegiance. This led to many FALINTIL veterans feeling that they had been unfairly excluded from the military and reduced the force's public standing. Furthermore, UNTAET failed to establish adequate foundations for the East Timorese security sector by developing legislative and planning documents, administrative support arrangements and mechanisms for the democratic control of the military. These omissions remained uncorrected after East Timor achieved independence on 20 May 2002.|$|E

25|$|The {{technique}} uses normal incident plane {{waves in}} a shaped spectrum of acoustic noise to impact directly on all exposed test article surfaces <b>without</b> <b>external</b> boundary reflections.

In general, Republican thinking on defense and international relations is heavily influenced by the theories of neorealism and realism, characterizing conflicts between nations as struggles between faceless forces of international structure, {{as opposed to being}} the result of the ideas and actions of individual leaders. The realist school's influence shows in Reagan's Evil Empire stance on the Soviet Union and George W. Bush's Axis of evil stance.|$|E
25|$|The Coast Guard's {{main task}} is to assert and uphold Norwegian {{sovereignty}} over its inland waters, territorial waters and exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Its structure is centered around a peace-time role, with judicial basis in the Coast Guard Act (Kystvaktloven) of 1997. It states that {{the authority of the}} Coast Guard lies with the primary agency responsible for a situation and that the Coast Guard's powers supplement these. However, the Coast Guard also holds a series of independent capabilities in which it can take action <b>without</b> <b>external</b> instruction. The act also grants the Coast Guard law enforcement jurisdiction in given circumstances.|$|E
25|$|In the English {{civil war}} Samuel More fought for Parliament and {{commanded}} a garrison at Hopton Castle in Shropshire. Hopton Castle {{was one of}} the few castles to be held for Parliament in that county. Samuel More was commandant of the castle when, in 1644, it was besieged by a force of Cavaliers led by Sir Michael Woodhouse, with a force of about 500. Samuel More‚Äôs garrison numbered around 30 men, and the end result of such an action was inevitable. <b>Without</b> <b>external</b> support, More would be forced to surrender. It seems that Colonel Samuel More was offered quarter (the option of a surrender) twice and refused. After this accounts differ.|$|E
