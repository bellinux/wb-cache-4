40|$|The Master's Thesis {{research}} {{focuses on}} analyzing the possibilities of using Direct Current distribution systems to distribute power to end users. Considering the shift in load types {{in the past few}} decades and also a growing demand of distributed generation, DC distribution can potentially offer higher efficiencies and cost savings to utilities. The incorporation of DC distribution offers the opportunity to eliminate multiple conversion stages for devices which are powered using DC electricity. The integration of power sources such as photovoltaics and fuel cells, which produce DC power, offer further incentives to consider the use of DC systems. Using DC systems can help eliminate the conversion losses associated <b>with</b> <b>rectifiers</b> and inverters which would be part of the infrastructure if AC distribution was used. In the literature, the study of DC distribution has been limited to customized systems. The objective of this research is to analyze DC distribution when applied to systems based on standard IEEE test feeder systems. The IEEE 13 node test feeder and the IEEE 37 node test feeder will be used as the basis for the analysis. Issues such as associated costs, protection and integration of appliances will also be addressed. M. S. Committee Chair: Meliopoulos, A.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a two-phase cooling method using R 134 a refrigerant to dissipate the heat energy (loss) generated by power electronics (PE) {{such as those}} associated <b>with</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> converters, and inverters for a specific application in hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs). The cooling method involves submerging PE devices in an R 134 a bath, which limits the junction temperature of PE devices while conserving weight and volume of the heat sink without sacrificing equipment reliability. First, experimental tests that included an extended soak for more than 300 days were performed on a submerged IGBT and gate-controller card to study dielectric characteristics, deterioration effects, and heat flux capability of R 134 a. Results from these tests illustrate that R 134 a has high dielectric characteristics, no deterioration on electrical components, and a heat flux of 114 W/cm 2 for the experimental configuration. Second, experimental tests that included simultaneous operation with a mock automotive air-conditioner (A/C) system were performed on the same IGBT and gate controller card. Data extrapolation from these tests determined that a typical automotive A/C system has more than sufficient cooling capacity to cool a typical 30 kW traction inverter. Last, a discussion and simulation of active cooling of the IGBT junction layer with R 134 a refrigerant is given. This technique will drastically increase the forward current ratings and reliability of the PE device. I...|$|E
