500|$|Visiting Lagos, Nigeria, in 1976 for the Festival of African Culture (FESTAC), Gil met fellow musicians Fela Kuti and Stevie <b>Wonder.</b> <b>He</b> became {{inspired}} by African music and later integrated {{some of the}} styles he had heard in Africa, such as juju and highlife, into his own recordings. One {{of the most famous}} of these African-influenced records was the 1977 album Refavela, which included [...] "No Norte da Saudade" [...] (To the North of Sadness), a song heavily influenced by reggae. When Gil returned to Brazil after the visit, he focused on Afro-Brazilian culture, becoming a member of the Carnaval afoxé group Filhos de Gandhi.|$|E
500|$|Samuel Mines {{took over}} from Merwin {{at the end}} of 1951, both at Startling Stories and Thrilling <b>Wonder.</b> <b>He</b> argued against {{restrictions}} in science fiction themes, and in 1952 published Philip José Farmer's [...] "The Lovers", a ground-breaking story about inter-species sex, in Startling. He followed this in 1953 with another taboo-breaking story from Farmer, [...] "Mother", in Thrilling Wonder, in which a spaceman makes his home in an alien womb. In the December 1952 Thrilling Wonder, Mines published Edmond Hamilton's [...] "What's It Like Out There?", a downbeat story about the realities of space exploration that had been considered too bleak for publication when it had originally been written in the 1930s. Sherwood Springer's [...] "No Land of Nod", in the same issue, dealt with incest between a father and his daughter {{in a world in which}} they are the only two survivors. These stories were all well received by the readership.|$|E

500|$|When Bacon {{undertook}} {{the series}} late in 1948, he {{was something of}} a two-hit <b>wonder.</b> <b>He</b> had had success in 1944 with Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion {{and to a lesser extent}} with Painting (1946), both of which were highly regarded but viewed as sensationalist. The exhibition was a success, and marked his critical breakthrough. Until then, he had been highly regarded but capable of only occasional brilliance. While some found his images horrifying and unnerving, they wrote about him all the same, sealing his reputation as the enfant terrible of post-war British art. The critic for The Observer wrote, [...] "The recent paintings... horrifying as they are, cannot be ignored. Technically they are superb, and the masterly handling of large areas of pearly grey, flushed with a sudden pink or green, only makes me regret the more that the artist's gift should have been brought to subjects so esoteric".|$|E
500|$|With The Legend of Zelda, Miyamoto {{wanted to}} take the idea of a game [...] "world" [...] even further, giving players a [...] "miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer." [...] He drew his {{inspiration}} from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves, and through the Zelda titles he always tries to impart to players some of the sense of exploration and limitless <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> felt. [...] "When I was a child," [...] he said, [...] "I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this." [...] The memory of being lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family's home in Sonobe was recreated in Zeldas labyrinth dungeons.|$|E
500|$|LaVey {{explains}} that, {{in order}} to control a person, one must first attract his or her attention. He gives three qualities that can be employed for this purpose: sex appeal, sentiment (cuteness or innocence), and <b>wonder.</b> <b>He</b> also advocates the use of odor. In the Book of Belial, he discusses three types of rituals: those for sex, compassion, and destruction. Sex rituals work to entice another person; compassion rituals work to improve health, intelligence, success, and so on; destruction rituals work to destroy another person. LaVey advocates finding others with whom to practice Satanic rituals {{in order to}} reaffirm one's faith and avoid antisocial behavior. He particularly advocates group participation for destruction rituals, as compassion and sex rituals are more private in nature. LaVey goes on to list the key components to successful ritual: desire, timing, imagery, direction, and [...] "The Balance Factor" [...] (awareness of one's own limitations). Details for the various Satanic rituals are explained in The Book of Belial, and lists of necessary objects (such as clothing, altars, and the symbol of Baphomet) are given.|$|E

While on BET's 106 & Park, Ashanti said {{the concept of the}} Christmas Album came from a guest spot she did on Steve Harvey's radio show. While playing a game with Stevie <b>Wonder,</b> <b>he</b> began playing Christmas medleys on the piano and Ashanti began singing them, giving her label head the idea to push for a Christmas album. Ashanti went into the studio to record the album during the summer of 2003. Ashanti's Christmas was released that October and sold just around 100,000 units in the U.S.|$|E

In March 2014, his track [...] "Stronger Than Ever" [...] from Black and Blue was remixed by UK garage producer M. J. Cole and released as a standalone single.
