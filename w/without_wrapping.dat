40|$|Introduction: Patient {{immobilisation}} {{is critically}} important for both highly conformal conventionally fractionated radiotherapy and for stereotactic body radiotherapy. Different immobilisation devices are available to maintain patient position for radiotherapy but the most suitable one remains unknown. Methods: Forty-five patients were randomly allocated {{to one of three}} immobilisation devices; the Q fix arm shuttle, BodyFIX <b>without</b> <b>wrap</b> or BodyFIX with wrap. Patients were imaged before and after treatment to ascertain intra-fraction and inter-fraction motion. Bony anatomy was used for matching to determine the positional accuracy of each device. Treatments were timed using a standard method. Patient comfort and staff satisfaction questionnaires were also issued to determine comfort, ease of use and preferences for each device. Results: The BodyFIX <b>without</b> <b>wrap</b> was the more accurate device; however, the differences between the devices were not statistically significant. The BodyFIX with wrap was found to take significantly longer to set up and set down compared to the arm shuttle and the BodyFIX <b>without</b> <b>wrap</b> (all P < 0. 001). Patients (37 %) marginally preferred the BodyFIX with wrap. Most (81 %) staff preferred the BodyFIX <b>without</b> <b>wrap.</b> Conclusion: Immobilisation using the BodyFIX <b>without</b> <b>wrap</b> was deemed to be suitable for clinical use. It was a clinically accurate device, the more efficient in terms of set up and set down time, the most preferred by staff and was accepted by patients...|$|R

For a simple ferrite ring, the wire is simply wrapped around the core through the center, typically five or seven times. Clamp-on cores are also available, which attach <b>without</b> <b>wrapping</b> the wire: this type of ferrite core is usually designed so that the wire passes only once through it. If the fit is not snug enough, the core can be secured with cable ties or, if the center is large enough, the cabling can loop through one or more times. Small ferrite beads can be slipped over component leads to suppress parasitic oscillation.|$|E

40|$|Overhead {{earth wire}} {{breakage}} accident may occur frequently, which can seriously affect the reliable {{operation of the}} power grid. The main reason of the earth wire breakage is the contact resistance inside the clamp as short-circuit current flows through it. To understand the mechanism of the earth wire breakage, this paper conducts the theoretical study on the skin effect and contact resistance of the wire suspension string with winding preformed armor rods. The temperature rise experiments using of the new and old earth wire suspension string are performed to verify the theoretical analysis. The {{results show that the}} hotspots locate in the fracture of the preformed armor rods and the inside the clamp when short-circuit current flows through the earth wire suspension string. The reason could be the increase of the contact resistances in these two locations due to rust of the suspension string. Comparing with the earth wire suspension string <b>without</b> <b>wrapping</b> preformed armor rods, the number of hotspots in the earth wire may increase and accordingly the possibility of earth wire breakage can increase...|$|E

Based on this nature, we investigate the paraphrase of the words including the Hanzi LUO(裸) from the view that Hanzi dynamically combines to be a word. We collect out-of-vocabulary words from the Internet text, and compare them with the dictionary. We find that the senses of the LUO(裸) in out-of-vocabulary words are developed, i. e. the senses in dictionary are “nude, especially for human body, and bare, <b>without</b> <b>wrapping</b> ” and the senses in out-of-vocabulary words add the meaning of “without any additional content, and abandon all the thing which a person had hold (such as property, social position, and so on) ”.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our current}} research into nonprehensile palm manipulation. The term "palm" {{refers to the}} use of the entire device surface during manipulation, as opposed to use of the fingertips alone. The term "nonprehensile" means that the palms hold the object <b>without</b> <b>wrapping</b> themselves around it, as distinguished from a force/form closure grasp often employed by a fingered hand. Indeed, nonprehensile operations such as purposeful sliding and constrained dropping constitute important palm primitives. We have implemented a system for orienting parts using two palms. The system consists of a planner and an executive. As input, the system expects a geometric description of a part, its center of mass, the coefficients of friction between the part and each of the palms, and a start and goal configuration of the part in stable contact with one of the palms. As output, the system computes and executes a sequence of palm motions designed to reorient the part from the specified start to the specified goal configuration. 1. 1 System Specific...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} {{estimation of}} applications running on Multi-Processor System-On-Chip (MPSoC) {{is required to}} perform software and hardware design choices and design validations. As cycle accurate simulation is very time consuming, and may have a level of accuracy that is not always needed, simulation at higher levels of abstraction is recognized {{as a way to}} perform early validation of software. Although even very abstract executable models provide interesting functional validation capabilities, they quickly become unsuitable when timing becomes an issue. Several approaches have been advocated for fast hardware/software system simulation. Many rely on the use of instruction set simulators, others simply wrap the thread code in SystemC hardware modules. Recently, native simulation, i. e. direct execution on the host <b>without</b> <b>wrapping</b> into a SystemC hardware module, has been introduced as yet another solution. This chapter briefly reviews the above mentioned approaches and focuses on native simulation. Native simulation is a promising solution to fast and accurate simulation of software that can be linked with state of the art abstract hardware simulators for both functional and temporal hardware/software system validation...|$|E
