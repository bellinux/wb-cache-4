5|$|The cadet pledge was {{considered}} a statement of intention rather than a binding contract. The attrition rate for cadets was comparable to that reported for other schools of nursing in the same period. The main cause of withdrawals was homesickness; some married students withdrew to be <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> when they were released from the military; others when the hostilities ceased; some failed in their studies; others left for health reasons; and some left because of the realities of a nursing career.|$|E
5|$|Important {{literary}} {{contributions in}} Kannada were made {{not only by}} court poets, noblemen, royalty, ascetics and saints who wrote in the marga (mainstream) style, but also by commoners and artisans, including cobblers, weavers, cowherds and shepherds who wrote in the desi (folk) style. These Vachana poets (called Vachanakaras) revolutionised Kannada literature, rejecting traditional themes that eulogised kings and noblemen, and writing didactic poems that were closer to the spoken and sung form of the language. In addition to hundreds of male poets, over thirty female poets have been recorded, some of whom wrote along <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands.</b>|$|E
5|$|Women {{acted as}} an {{important}} part of the workforce. Many unmarried women worked away from their families as farm servants and married women worked <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> around the farm, taking part in all the major agricultural tasks. They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest, forming most of the reaping team of the bandwin. Women also played an important part in the expanding textile industries, spinning and setting up warps for men to weave. There is evidence of single women engaging in independent economic activity, particularly for widows, who can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading.|$|E

25|$|Some {{women who}} officially bear the -né form will {{nevertheless}} introduce themselves <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husband's</b> family name {{and their own}} first name (in our example, Kovács Júlia or Kovácsné Júlia, rather than Kovács Jánosné), to avoid confusion about how to address them.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, women had a very limited legal status. A married woman had few property rights and could not make a will without her husband's permission, although jurists expected this to be given. Men had considerable latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases turn up in higher courts, and the kirk session did intervene to protect women from domestic abuse, it was usually only when the abuse began to disturb public order. The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> fathers and kin. As a result, a married woman could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, at {{the urging}} of Garrison and Wendell Phillips, Lucretia Coffin Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton {{traveled}} <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> and a dozen other American male and female abolitionists to London for the first World's Anti-Slavery Convention, with the expectation that a motion put forward by Phillips to include women's participation in the convention would be controversial. In London, the proposal was rebuffed after a full day of debate; the women were allowed to listen from the gallery but not allowed to speak or vote. Mott and Stanton became friends in London and on the return voyage, and together planned to organize their own convention to further the cause of women's rights, separate from abolition concerns.|$|E
5|$|The {{years after}} the Black Death left many women widows; in the wider economy labour was in short supply and land was {{suddenly}} readily available. In rural areas peasant women could enjoy a better standard of living than ever before, but {{the amount of work}} being done by women may have increased. Many other women travelled to the towns and cities, {{to the point where they}} outnumbered men in some settlements. There they worked <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> or in a limited number of occupations, including spinning, making clothes, victualling and as servants. Some women became full-time ale brewers, until they were pushed out of business by the male-dominated beer industry in the 15th century. Higher status jobs and apprenticeships, however, remained closed to women. As in earlier times, noblewomen exercised power on their estates in their husbands' absence and again, if necessary, defended them in sieges and skirmishes. Wealthy widows who could successfully claim their rightful share of their late husband's property could live as powerful members of the community in their own right.|$|E

50|$|During the 1940s many {{teachers}} were soldiers’ wives and taught for only 6-8 weeks {{before moving on}} <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husband.</b> In 1945 a war surplus building was placed by the gym.

30|$|Through {{analysis}} of the in-depth interview data, we now explore why Chinese women say they will give up paid work in favor of domestic labor. Women were divided into four types according to their situation {{in the job market}} and in comparison <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husband’s</b> jobs. Income levels and career development opportunities were also taken into account (Fang Ying 2009).|$|R
5|$|There {{were also}} {{women in the}} Gold Rush. However, their numbers were small. Of the 40,000 people who arrived by ship in the San Francisco harbor in 1849, only 700 were women. They held various roles {{including}} prostitutes, single entrepreneurs, married women, poor and wealthy women. They were of various ethnicities including Anglo-American, African-American, Hispanic, Native, European, Chinese, and Jewish. The reasons they came varied: some came <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> refusing {{to be left behind}} to fend for themselves, some came because their husbands sent for them, and others came (singles and widows) for the adventure and economic opportunities. On the trail many people died from accidents, cholera, fever, and myriad other causes, and many women became widows before even setting eyes on California. While in California, women became widows quite frequently due to mining accidents, disease, or mining disputes of their husbands. Life in the goldfields offered opportunities for women to break from their traditional work.|$|E
5|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or {{spinster}} to teach reading, sewing and cooking. Among the nobility there were many educated and cultured women. Women formed {{an important part of}} the workforce. Many unmarried women worked away from their families as farm servants, and married women worked <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> around the farm, taking part in all major agricultural tasks. They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest, forming most of the reaping team of the bandwin. Women also played an important part in the expanding textile industries, spinning and setting up warps for men to weave. There is evidence of single women engaging in independent economic activity, particularly for widows, who can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading. Some were highly successful, such as Janet Flockhart, an Edinburgh Wadwife or moneylender, who had been left a widow with seven children after her third husband's suicide, and who managed her business affairs so successfully that she amassed a moveable estate of £22,000 by her death in the late sixteenth century. Lower down the social scale, the rolls of poor relief indicate that large numbers of widows with children endured a marginal existence.|$|E
5|$|Early modern Scotland was a {{theoretically}} patriarchal society, {{in which}} men had total authority over women, but how this worked is practice is difficult to discern. Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature {{and the subject of}} complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating and finding marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient. At the beginning of the period, women had a very limited legal status. The criminal courts refused to recognise them as witnesses or independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> fathers and kin. In the post-Reformation period there was a criminalisation of women, partly evident in witchcraft prosecutions from 1563. Through the 1640s, independent commissions were set up to try women for child murder, and after pressure from the kirk a law of 1690 placed the presumption of guilt on a woman if she concealed a pregnancy and birth, and her child later died.|$|E
25|$|In a divorce, Malagasy women {{traditionally}} {{receive a}} third of the property acquired during <b>their</b> marriage, <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husband</b> receiving the remaining two-thirds; they may also choose to keep their property separate during marriage. When the husband dies, a Malagasy widow who has borne a child receives half of the joint property. However, if the couple was childless then the husband's family received most of the inheritance.|$|R
50|$|Women were {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husband's</b> status. However, as craftsmen saw <b>their</b> status sink <b>with</b> {{the introduction of}} industrialism, the proletarian class grew during the period. There also was an economic segregation in the city, with the present old town and the lower parts of Norrmalm being the wealthiest (more than 150% above average); the suburbs (today part of central Stockholm) were poor (50% below average).|$|R
50|$|People {{belong to}} one of sixteen clans with intra-clan {{marriage}} forbidden, although the taboo is beginning to broken as the novel opens. Names consist of a given name, a patronymic and a clan name. The patronymic for a son is the prefix pe concatenated with the father's given name, while the prefix ge indicates a daughter. Wives add a spousal name consisting of the prefix i <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husband's</b> given name.|$|R
5|$|Historian Ban Zhao (45116 CE) {{wrote in}} her Lessons for Women that, like the {{opposite}} and complementary forces of yin and yang, men's great virtues were strength and rigidity, while a woman's great virtues were respect and compliance. Throughout her life, a Han woman was to bend {{to the will of}} first her father, then her husband, and then her adult son (三從四德). However, there are many recorded deviations from this rule, as some Han women are written to have engaged in heated arguments <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> over concubines (sometimes beating concubines out of jealousy and to punish the husband), wrote essays and letters for husbands serving as government officials, and sometimes husbands turned to their wives for advice on political affairs of the court. When a father died, the eldest son was theoretically the senior member of the family, yet as hinted in various works of Han literature, they still had to obey the will of their mother and she could even force them to kowtow to her when apologizing for an offense. Deviations from common customs regarding gender were especially pronounced in the imperial family. The empress was able to give orders to her male relatives (even her father) and if they disobeyed her, she could publicly reprimand and humiliate them.|$|E

25|$|Some mothers {{travelling}} {{with children}} whose husbands either {{stayed in the}} islands or had joined the armed services initially found attempts were tried to take their children away as it was considered they could not possibly look after them <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> away.|$|E
50|$|Married {{women are}} {{typically}} more responsible for caring for <b>their</b> <b>husband's</b> parents than her own. Many Nepali women move in <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>husband's</b> parents after marriage and {{usually do not}} have say in the matter. Therefore, sons are viewed as security for their parents during old age while their wives are viewed as unpaid care takers. To prepare for their responsibilities after marriage, sons are then {{more likely to be}} sent to school in order to earn money for the future and daughters stay at home to perform housework. Such patriarchal norms lead to less female participation in household decision-making processes.|$|R

25|$|Women's clubs {{also looked}} at issues of consent.

25|$|The {{day after}} Diwali, is celebrated as Padwa. This day ritually celebrates {{the love and}} mutual devotion between the wife and husband.
