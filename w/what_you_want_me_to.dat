500|$|On 6 January 1969, the band's {{third day}} at Twickenham Film Studios, in {{south-west}} London, an argument was captured on film where McCartney criticised Harrison's guitar {{playing on the}} song [...] "Two of Us". A resigned Harrison told him: [...] "I'll play <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play, or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play." [...] With the sessions being recorded by film director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, tapes reveal Beatles associates Neil Aspinall and George Martin sympathising with Harrison's position, recognising that McCartney and Lennon [...] "don't offer him enough freedom within their compositions". Ringo Starr, who had quit the band briefly during the White Album sessions, {{partly as a result}} of McCartney's hectoring of his drumming, recalled of Harrison's refusal to be [...] "dominated" [...] by McCartney any longer: [...] "Paul [...] wanted to point out the solo to George, who would say, 'Look, I'm a guitarist. I'll play the solo.' And he always did, he always played fine solos." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the band}} waited for [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] to be released, they began a {{residency}} at Ciro's Le Disc nightclub on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood. [...] The band's regular appearances at Ciro's during March and April 1965 {{allowed them to}} hone their ensemble playing, perfect their aloof stage persona, and expand their repertoire. [...] In addition, it was during their residency at the nightclub that the band first began to accrue a dedicated following among L.A.'s youth culture and hip Hollywood fraternity, with scenesters like Kim Fowley, Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, Arthur Lee, and Sonny & Cher regularly attending the band's performances. [...] On March 26, 1965, {{the author of the}} band's forthcoming debut single, Bob Dylan, made an impromptu visit to the club and joined the Byrds on stage for a rendition of Jimmy Reed's [...] "Baby <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> Do". [...] The excitement generated by the Byrds at Ciro's quickly made them a must-see fixture on L.A.'s nightclub scene and resulted in hordes of teenagers filling the sidewalks outside the club, desperate to see the band perform. [...] A number of noted music historians and authors, including Richie Unterberger, Ric Menck, and Peter Buckley, have suggested that the crowds of young Bohemians and hipsters that gathered at Ciro's to see the Byrds perform represented the first stirrings of the West Coast hippie counterculture.|$|E
500|$|... "Suga Mama" [...] {{features}} the female protagonist offering up {{the keys to}} her house and car, and her credit card just to keep her love interest and his good loving at home, presumably {{so that he can}} listen to her collection of old soul records. These interpretations are shown in the lines: [...] "It's so good to the point that I'll do anything just to keep you home ... Tell me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> buy, my accountant's waiting on the phone ...". The woman also sees the man as a sex object, asking him to sit on her lap and [...] "take it off while I watch you perform". Staff members of USA Today contrasted [...] "Suga Mama" [...] with the 1999 song [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] by Destiny's Child (of which Knowles was a member), writing that [...] "From needing somebody to pay her automo-bills, [...] now doling out the cash as a satisfaction-seeking 'Suga Mama'." [...] Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that Knowles sings: [...] "I could be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store" [...] with the same sense of mischief as Christina Aguilera on 'Candyman' (2007)." [...] On the other hand, Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine noticed that the song's lyrical arrangement was similar to that of Tina Turner's work. A remix of the song features American rapper Consequence.|$|E

2500|$|Presley sings many of {{the songs}} he was famous for including: [...] "That's All Right", [...] "Heartbreak Hotel", [...] "One Night", [...] "Love Me Tender" [...] and [...] "Are You Lonesome Tonight?". He also reprises Jimmy Reed's [...] "Baby <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> Do" [...] on several {{occasions}} and includes the less well known songs, [...] "Tryin' To Get To You", [...] "When My Blue Moon Turns To Gold Again" [...] and [...] "Lawdy Miss Clawdy". As each session progresses, he can be observed playing and singing with such gusto that he occasionally feels the urge to rise up and sing off mike, even when he uses the electric guitar with no strap (during a reprise of [...] "One Night").|$|E
2500|$|Side two of {{the live}} album is taken up in its {{entirety}} by a sixteen-minute, extended version of [...] "Eight Miles High", which proved to be popular on progressive rock radio during the early 1970s. The track is highlighted by the dramatic guitar interplay between McGuinn and White {{as well as the}} intricate bass and drum playing of Battin and Parsons. The song begins with improvisational jamming, which lasts for over twelve minutes and culminates in an iteration of the song's first verse. The Byrds' biographer, Johnny Rogan, has noted that the revamping of [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] featured on (Untitled) represented the ultimate fusion of the original Byrds and the newer line-up. At the end of the live performance of [...] "Eight Miles High", the band can be heard playing a rendition of their signature stage tune [...] "Hold It", which had first been heard on record {{at the close of the}} [...] "My Back Pages/B.J. Blues/Baby <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> Do" [...] medley included on Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde.|$|E
