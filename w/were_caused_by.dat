5|$|From the {{earliest}} times, the Chinese {{were concerned with}} the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian of 91BC that in 780BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known {{at the time that}} earthquakes <b>were</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.500–428BC) believed that they <b>were</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460–370BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.585–c.525BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384–322BC) believed they <b>were</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> instability of vapor (pneuma) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.|$|E
