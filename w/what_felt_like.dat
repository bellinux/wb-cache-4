We had largely all the elements of the episode in place and Fox called and said, 'Hey, how would you guys feel about if we asked you to have some musical element in the show? Anything, like just feature a song playing.' They didn't ask us to do Glee. And we instantly, before we got off the phone, said, 'Well, this is what we're thinking for the episode and here's an idea how that could work for us.' We turned their request into <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a positive for us and really deepened and sort of blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking it".|$|E

[...] He called her voice [...] "beyond-beautiful" [...] when she {{performed}} [...] "for a stunned audience at the NPR Music offices. She clearly is a very happy girl with an amazing musical gift." [...] A review of her 2011 Sun Valley concert stated that [...] "Evancho transported [...] with pure, joyous, unaffected notes". Marcia Adair of the Los Angeles Times commented in reviewing Dream With Me that [...] "her voice has matured quite a lot over the past 10 months. ... hat makes us feel like she will survive the journey from child star to adult performer is her magnificent sense of pitch, her natural ability to shape phrases and the ease with which she performs." [...] Jon Caramanica, in The New York Times, reviewed her Avery Fisher Hall concert: [...] "In {{the first half of the}} show Ms. Evancho often receded, but toward the end of the night she found purpose, delivering 'A Time for Us' with punch, and closing out Sarah McLachlan’s 'Angel' with <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> real yearning". The Wall Street Journal called Evancho's 2011 performance of the song [...] "Angel" [...] on the Tonight Show [...] "moving".|$|E

Slater of Pocket Gamer too felt the pacing was [...] "swift but uninspiring", and Eurogamer Whitehead called its rhythm [...] "weird" [...] as he waited for the right opportunity some puzzles and could finish others with a single trick. Game Informer Ryckert also found the final puzzles too aggravating, especially the ones with invisible elements. Campbell of TouchArcade appreciated the [...] variety of puzzles from [...] "twitch" [...] to [...] "slow and thoughtful" [...] to, her favorite, the [...] "cerebral" [...] puzzles that required specific tricks as well as the ability to skip puzzles. She also found the last level nigh impossible. Multiple reviewers felt that the cipher puzzles were out of place, and TouchArcade said it was easy to ignore them as <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> an [...] "utterly distinct" [...] game. The Atlantic Bogost thought that the hidden ciphers were the [...] "surest clue" [...] of its status as [...] "a design object and not a consumable media experience". Slater of Pocket Gamer wrote that the ciphers felt forced and unexciting, and was disappointed overall in consideration of [...] "the incredible talent involved". Whitehead of Eurogamer called the puzzles [...] "deftly constructed" [...] and said the game [...] "delights more than it frustrates". Wired Ryan Rigney wrote that Hundreds distinguished itself among iOS puzzle games in its style and design.|$|E

500|$|At the 2005 World Music Awards, Carey {{performed}} [...] "Shake It Off" [...] alongside Dupri. Wearing black {{shorts and}} a pink blouse, the performance started as Carey got out of a Lamborghini Murciélago on stage, a re-enactment of the video. Additionally, a large lighted 'MIMI' sign was placed behind the stage, also a prop used {{at the end of}} the song's music video. The following week, Carey performed the song, as well as its accompanying number [...] "Get Your Number," [...] on the British music chart program, Top of the Pops. On November15,2005, the Chicago Tribune announced that Carey would perform during half-time of the Thanksgiving game between the Detroit Lions and the Atlanta Falcons. Airing on the 24th, Carey performed [...] "Shake It Off", as well as her newly released single from the album's re-release, [...] "Don't Forget About Us". Two months later, she celebrated the new year on television, placing as the featured performer at the Times Square Ball drop on New Year's Eve in New York. The special, titled Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest, aired on ABC at 10pm on December31, and featured Carey on stage wearing a short sparkling dress, and performing a selection of the album's singles, including [...] "Shake It Off". Aside from performing the song live on several high-profile televised events, Carey included the song on both her Adventures of Mimi and Angels Advocate Tours. On the former tour, the performance began as a large Broadway-styled prop reading 'MIMI', similar to the one from the video, descended from the rafters. As the song began, Carey walked down a spiraled staircase, ushered by one of her several back up dancers. Sporting a black bikini and matching sheer cape, Carey sang the song while, according to some critics, performing some of her most diverse physical movements from the entire show. On her Angels Advocate Tour, Carey performed the song during the first quarter of the concert. According to Ryan J. Downey of MTV News, Carey gave a [...] "rousing rendition" [...] of the song, and [...] "set the tone for <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a celebratory evening." ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Closing Time {{took place at}} Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood, California—where Buffalo Springfield, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and The Doors had previously recorded—during spring 1972. Yester fronted production and the sessions were held almost immediately after Waits' record deal, and were described [...] "quick and efficient." [...] Waits was [...] "nervous, but confident enough in his own material" [...] during {{the beginning of the}} sessions; however, as the sessions progressed, Waits and Yester [...] "were pulling against each other" [...] over the direction which the album would take, with Waits wanting a jazz-laden record and Yester more focused on producing a folk-based album. Despite this, Waits was [...] "absolutely communicative" [...] with his fellow musicians, articulating his direction and using metaphors to describe how he wanted the songs to sound. The sessions took a total of ten days, with the first two days focusing on [...] "getting used to [...]" [...] Both Waits and Yester wanted to record during the evening, but as no slots were available, it was recorded through the morning and afternoon [...] "from ten to five every day." [...] During the recording of [...] "Ol' '55", Seiter contributed backing vocals and [...] "came up with a perfect harmony line that started faintly before the chorus even began." [...] The sessions concluded with a total of nine songs completed. Though unsatisfied with the amount of songs, a second recording session was arranged the following week in United Western Recorders. The final session for Closing Time began the following Sunday, with guest musicians Arni Egilsson replacing Plummer and Jesse Erlich performing cello. The title track, [...] "Closing Time", was the only song recorded in full, and Yester later described the session as [...] "the most magical session I've ever been involved with. At the end of it, no one spoke for <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> five minutes, either in the booth or out in the room. No one budged. Nobody wanted the moment to end." [...] String overdubs were later cut for [...] "Martha" [...] and [...] "Grapefruit Moon" [...] the following day. The final recordings were mixed and mastered at Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the liner}} notes for the {{compilation}} album, Natural Selection (October 2003), Seymour described [...] "Back on the Breadline" [...] and wrote [...] "This song spearheaded the North American campaign of 1987.

In a following interview with Noisey, Weinman said the Dillinger Escape Plan would stop performing, with Puciato later saying [...] "we're breaking up." [...] Puciato was quoted saying that the band still enjoyed writing, recording and performing together but nonetheless [...] "we started to reach <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a thematic conclusion to our band", comparing the decision to a filmmaker who enjoys the current film his is creating but can't continue the process indefinitely.

2500|$|Britvic, who had {{acquired}} the Tango brand in 1988, {{were looking to}} radicalize Tango's image and advertising. They hired London-based advertising agency Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury and Partners (HHCL) to create a brand new television advertisement for the brand, which would {{form the basis of}} a new advertising campaign. HHCL, who had been operating since 1987, had earned a reputation in the business for breaking several norms in advertising and established a avant-garde theme in 1989, when, in launching the direct banking service, First Direct, aired two advertisements simultaneously on ITV and Channel 4, interrupting an Audi advert, one offering an optimistic and the other a pessimistic view, and a number of short, surreal spots in which the visual had little or {{nothing to do with the}} message. Orange Man was created by HHCL, using their staff Trevor Robinson OBE as art director, Al Young as copywriter, John Leach as planner, Axle Chaldecott and Steve Henry as creative directors and Matt Forrest as director. Production company Limelight also worked on the project. Robinson and Young were creative partners, and were [...] "pretty anti-advertising in [...] mindsets" [...] at the time because of their boredom and frustration with the industry norm of [...] "cause and effect advertising", and were desperate to make a name for themselves after [...] "spending <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> eons trying to get into a West End agency." ...|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{began at}} the Cinecittà studio in Rome again in mid-May 1966, {{including}} the opening scene between Eastwood and Wallach when Blondie captures Tuco {{for the first time}} and sends him to jail. The production then moved on to Spain's plateau region near Burgos in the north, which doubled for the southwestern United States, and again shot the western scenes in Almería in the south. This time, the production required more elaborate sets, including a town under cannon fire, an extensive prison camp and an American Civil War battlefield; and for the climax, several hundred Spanish soldiers were employed to build a cemetery with several thousand grave stones to resemble an ancient Roman circus. For the scene where the bridge was blown up, it had to be filmed twice as in the first take all three cameras were destroyed by the explosion. Eastwood remembers, [...] "They would care if you were doing a story about Spaniards and about Spain. Then they'd scrutinize you very tough, but the fact that you're doing a western that's supposed to be laid in southwest America or Mexico, they couldn't care less what your story or subject is." [...] Top Italian cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli was brought in to shoot the film and was prompted by Leone to pay more attention to light than in the previous two films; Ennio Morricone composed the score once again. Leone was instrumental in asking Morricone to compose a track for the final Mexican stand-off scene in the cemetery, asking him to compose <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> [...] "the corpses were laughing from inside their tombs", and asked Delli Colli to create a hypnotic whirling effect interspersed with dramatic extreme close ups, to give the audience the impression of a visual ballet. Filming concluded in July 1966.|$|E
