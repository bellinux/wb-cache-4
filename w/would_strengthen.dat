5|$|VThe king of Spain (of the time) {{commissioned}} Jacques-Louis David's Napoleon Crossing the Alps as {{a friendly}} gesture towards Napoleon, {{hoping that the}} flattering gift <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> relationships between France and Spain, {{to the degree that}} Napoleon would not consider invading Spain and taking it over, after he became emperor. However, the king of Spain's attempt failed, and, soon after Napoleon crowned himself emperor, he crossed the Pyrenees and conquered Spain.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February, several {{news outlets}} {{reported}} that JAL would decide {{to keep its}} alliance with American Airlines and end talks with Delta. Inamori and ETIC officials, according to the reports, decided that switching alliances from Oneworld to Skyteam would be too risky and could hinder JAL's ability to turn around quickly. Two days later, JAL officially announced that they <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> their partnership with American, including a joint application for antitrust immunity on transpacific routes. The airline would also fortify its relationship with other partners in the Oneworld alliance.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the conflict of interest materialized in a few ways. First, Stewart declined to cross-examine one of the witnesses, who could implicate Kretske but not Glasser, for fear that it <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> the case against Kretske. Stewart also failed to object to the testimony of other witnesses regarding prior statements of Kretske; under the rules of hearsay, these statements were obviously admissible against Kretske, but less obviously admissible against Glasser without a predicate showing that Glasser was a co-conspirator. Stewart feared that an objection only on behalf of Glasser would highlight the admissibility of the statements against Kretske.|$|E

5|$|The Stuarts {{used their}} {{connection}} with Fleance and {{his marriage to}} the Welsh princess to claim a genealogical link with the legendary King Arthur. This, they hoped, <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> the legitimacy of their claim to the throne. In 1722, however, Richard Hay, a Scottish historian, presented strong evidence {{that not only was}} James not a descendant of Fleance, but also that neither Fleance nor Banquo ever even existed. Most modern scholars now agree that Fleance is not a real historical figure.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1968 NUSAS {{conference in}} Johannesburg, {{many of its}} members {{attended}} a July 1968 conference of the University Christian Movement at Stutterheim. There, the black African members decided to hold a December conference to discuss {{the formation of an}} independent black student group. The South African Students' Organisation (SASO) was officially launched at a July 1969 conference at the University of the North; there, the group's constitution and basic policy platform were adopted. The group's focus was on the need for contact between centres of black student activity, including through sport, cultural activities, and debating competitions. Though Biko played a substantial role in SASO's creation, he sought a low public profile during its early stages, believing that this <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> its second level of leadership, such as his ally Barney Pityana. Nonetheless, he was elected as SASO's first president; Pat Matshaka was elected vice president and Wuila Mashalaba elected secretary. Durban became its de facto headquarters.|$|E
5|$|In 1308, Edward's {{marriage}} to Isabella of France proceeded. Edward crossed the English Channel to France in January, leaving Gaveston as his custos regni {{in charge of}} the kingdom in his absence. This arrangement was unusual, and involved unprecedented powers being delegated to Gaveston, backed by a specially engraved Great Seal. Edward probably hoped that the marriage <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> his position in Gascony and bring him much needed funds. The final negotiations, however, proved challenging: Edward and Philip IV did not like each other, and the French King drove a hard bargain over the size of Isabella's dower and the details of the administration of Edward's lands in France. As part of the agreement, Edward gave homage to Philip for the Duchy of Aquitaine and agreed to a commission to complete the implementation of the 1303 Treaty of Paris.|$|E

5|$|In 1903, {{a dispute}} between the FVdG and the Free Trade Unions in Berlin led the party {{commission}} to intervene and to sponsor talks aimed at re-unification of the two wings of the German labor movement. At the meeting, the FVdG {{made a number of}} compromises, which led to member protests. Soon, over one-third of the members left the union. The 1903 FVdG congress elected a panel to continue negotiations with the Free Trade Unions. This panel demanded that the Free Trade Unions adopt localist organizational principles as a prerequisite for re-unification. The FVdG panel realized this demand was unrealistic, but hoped the expulsion of revisionists from the SPD during the debate on Eduard Bernstein's theses <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> their position. The impossibility of a reconciliation between the two became obvious by March 1904, since the re-unification envisioned by both the leadership of the SPD and the Free Trade Unions was more along the lines of an integration of the FVdG into the Free Trade Unions.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the IMD {{expected}} Chapala would intensify {{further into}} a super cyclonic storm, and the JTWC anticipated it <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> to {{the equivalent of}} a Category5-equivalent on the Saffir-Simpson scale. However, the storm began an eyewall replacement cycle on 30October, causing the inner eyewall to degrade and for an outer eyewall to form; this resulted in a slight drop in intensity. In addition, drier air began affecting the storm, causing the thunderstorms around the eye to diminish. However, Chapala maintained much of its intensity due to strong outflow in all directions, especially to the northeast due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough over India, despite increased wind shear. On 31October, the outer eyewall became established, reaching a diameter of , although the thunderstorms around the eye continued to weaken. On 1November, Chapala passed just north of the island of Socotra, marking the area's first hurricane-force impact since 1922.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{understood}} {{the problems facing}} his multi-ethnic patrimony and the ambivalent position the Austrians held in the Holy Roman Empire. Although the Habsburgs and their successor house of Habsburg-Lorraine had, with two exceptions, held the position of Emperor since the early 15th century, the basis of 18th-century Habsburg power lay not in the Holy Roman Empire itself, but in Habsburg territories in Eastern Europe (where the family had vast domains), the Italian peninsula, and the Lowlands. For Joseph or his successors to wield influence in the German-speaking states, they needed to acquire additional German-speaking territories. Acquisition of Central European territories with German-speaking subjects <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> the Austrian position in the Holy Roman Empire. As far as Joseph was concerned, only this could shift {{the center of the}} Habsburg empire into German-speaking Central Europe. This agenda made dispensable both the Austrian Netherlands—Habsburg territories which lay furthest west—and Galicia, furthest east. It also made the recovery of German-speaking Silesia and acquisition of new territories in Bavaria essential.|$|E

5|$|On November 15, {{near the}} end of the Battle of Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting of the Military Affairs Commission's Supreme National Defense Council to {{undertake}} strategic planning, including a decision on what to do in case of a Japanese attack on Nanking. Here Chiang insisted fervently on mounting a sustained defense of Nanking. Chiang argued, just as he had during the Battle of Shanghai, that China would be more likely to receive aid from the great powers, possibly at the ongoing Nine Power Treaty Conference, if it could prove on the battlefield its will and capacity to resist the Japanese. He also noted that holding onto Nanking <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> China's hand in peace talks which he wanted the German ambassador Oskar Trautmann to mediate.|$|E
5|$|The first {{forecast}} {{for the year}} was issued by CSU on December 11, who anticipated that one of four different scenarios could occur. The scenario considered most likely was that Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and thermohaline circulation (THC) would be stronger, but effects from El Niño would remain, resulting in a slightly above average season. The next most likely scenario was that both the AMO and THC <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> and the El Niño effects would cease to exist, causing a well above average season. In the other two scenarios, which were given the same probability of occurrence, the AMO and THC would weaken {{and the effects of}} El Niño would either disappear or some would remain, resulting in either a near average or well below average season.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{development}} of Tropical Storm Earl, tropical storm watches were issued for Barbados, St. Vincent, and St. Lucia. This watch was modified to a tropical storm warning by August14 at 2100UTC, {{with the addition of}} the islands of the Grenadines, Trinidad, Tobago, and Grenada. The tropical storm warning for Barbados was changed to a tropical storm watch the following day at 1200UTC, and all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued by 1800UTC. In preparation of the storm, several hundred people in Grenada evacuated from low-lying areas to schools set up as shelters. Shopkeepers boarded windows, while airports were temporarily shut down across the Leeward Islands. Initial forecasts predicted that Earl <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> considerably into a hurricane and head towards Florida once in the Caribbean Sea, a state already impacted heavily earlier in the month by Hurricane Charley. The local officials urged residents to exercise caution, but not panic due to the large errors in long-range forecasts. These warnings eased upon the system's degeneration into an open tropical wave.|$|E

5|$|On September 7, Paul {{called for}} a vote of no {{confidence}} in United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Later that month, Paul blocked legislation that <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> safety rules {{for oil and gas}} pipelines, because, he stated, the bill was not strong enough. In October, Paul blocked a bill that would provide $36million in benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, saying that he was concerned that it could be used to aid domestic terrorists. This was in response to two alleged terrorists who came to the United States through a refugee program and were receiving welfare benefits when they were arrested in 2011 in Paul's hometown of Bowling Green. Paul lifted his hold on the bill after Democratic leaders promised to hold a Congressional hearing into how individuals are selected for refugee status and request an investigation on how the two suspects were admitted in the country through a refugee program. In June 2012, Paul endorsed Mitt Romney after it became apparent that he would be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election. However, he was later vocal about his disagreements with Romney on a number of policies.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion of the 35th Infantry {{took up a}} hill {{position}} {{northwest of}} Hamch'ang and south of Mun'gyong {{on the south side}} of a stream that flowed past Sangju to the Naktong. On the north side of the stream an ROK battalion held the front line. Brigadier General Vennard Wilson, the 25th's Assistant Division Commander, ordered F Company of the battalion to be inserted in the center of the ROK line north of the stream, and this was done over the strong protests of the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel John L. Wilkins. Wilson thought the American troops <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> the ROK defense but Wilkins did not want the untried company to be dependent on ROK stability in its first engagement. Behind the ROK and F Company positions the ground rose to another hill within small arms range. Heavy rains had swollen the stream behind the ROK and F Company positions to a torrent that was rolling large boulders along its channel. In the meantime, the ROK 2nd Battalion, 17th Regiment, ambushed a battalion of North Korean troops near Tongkwanri, forcing it to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|The Sathyamangalam forests were {{declared}} as {{a sanctuary}} {{with effect from}} 3 November 2008 by the Governor of Tamil Nadu as per the Wild Life Protection Act of 1972. In 2008, the Government of Karnataka sent a proposal to declare the contiguous Billigiriranga Swamy Temple Wildlife Sanctuary as a tiger reserve which was subsequently approved in 2010. In a wildlife {{survey conducted by the}} Government of Tamil Nadu in 2010, 46 tigers were sighted in the Sathyamangalam forest area. In July 2010, the Minister of State for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh requested the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to consider the possibility of proposing the Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary as a Project Tiger tiger reserve as per the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 as the area is contiguous with the forests of Bandipur and Mudumalai tiger reserves. On 1 April 2010, the Government of Tamil Nadu announced that it would initiate action to declare the sanctuary as a tiger reserve because of the consistent sighting of tigers in the forest area and the tiger reserve declaration <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> wildlife conservation efforts, as the sanctuary managers will get more financial support from the central government and the Government of India may also provide support to appoint an additional anti-poaching watchers and fund the establishment of anti-poaching camps.|$|E

5|$|According to Sugiura, Monolith Soft's {{relations}} with Namco {{had undergone a}} negative change after Nakamura retired as head of Namco in 2002, three years before the merger with Bandai. The company underwent changes and Monolith Soft felt they were being given less creative freedom, and the newly-created Namco Bandai was less willing to take creative risks. The company then received consultation from Shinji Hatano, an executive director at Nintendo, who advised them to continue creating innovative projects. Spurred on by Hatano's supportive attitude, Monolith Soft decided {{to break away from}} Namco Bandai to become a Nintendo subsidiary; this provided Monolith Soft creative freedom in exchange for software development exclusivity for Nintendo platforms. Nintendo's purchasing of the majority of Monolith Soft's shares from Bandai Namco Holdings was publicly announced in April 2007. Nintendo became the majority shareholder of Monolith Soft with 80% of shares, while Bandai Namco retained 16% and remained as a development partner. Namco Bandai stated that the exchange of Monolith Soft shares <b>would</b> <b>strengthen</b> their relationship with Nintendo. The remaining shares were divided between Takahashi, Sugiura and Honne. Nintendo's acquisition of Monolith Soft contrasted against the company's previous publicized approach of not taking part in mergers and acquisitions of other studios and companies. In a statement on the matter, then-CEO of Nintendo Satoru Iwata said that the deal was initiated due to the positive relations between Sugiura and Nintendo, and the two company's parallel design and development philosophies.|$|E
