Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, thus, highly improbable.|$|E
5|$|As Master of the Rolls he {{selected}} cases he {{felt to be}} particularly important to hear and, rather than having an American system (where judges had a rota for taking cases), assigned cases to those judges who had expertise in that particular area of law. In 1963 he chaired a committee investigating <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> archive of legal documents kept by the Public Record Office; by that point the files for civil cases of the High Court alone occupied four miles of shelving. The final report {{was presented to the}} Lord Chancellor on 16 May 1966, with the conclusion being that 'if our proposals are implemented the Public Record Office alone will be relieved of two hundred tons of records (occupying 15,000 feet of shelving)'. The Lord Chancellor took Denning's report to heart, and had the changes he recommended implemented immediately.|$|E
5|$|As {{traffic levels}} increased, {{bottlenecks}} at the two-lane tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{became a major}} problem. By the late 1950s, traffic jams formed at the tunnels, especially during the summer. In 1959, four Senators urged state officials {{to work with the}} turnpike commission to study <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> traffic jams. That year, the commission began studies aimed at resolving the traffic jams at the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain tunnels; studies for the other tunnels followed. At the conclusion of the studies, the turnpike commission planned to make the entire turnpike four lanes by either adding a second tube at the tunnels or bypassing them. The new and upgraded tunnel tubes would feature white tiles, fluorescent lighting, and upgraded ventilation.|$|E

5|$|Universal Pictures {{reported}} that it greenlit American Gangster with a budget of $80million, which escalated to $93million, with $10million for development costs and $3million for the delay of the production start date. Sources close to the director insist that the budget was $93million from the beginning. The studio also sought for American Gangster to be produced in Toronto rather than New York City to save money, but Fuqua resisted the re-location. The studio's parent company General Electric received tax credits in New York City, so production {{was moved to the}} city. The move, however, inflated the budget to $98million. Fuqua's camp insisted that it was seeking <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> budget, but the studio contended several aspects of the project under him. The director had wanted to film a Vietnam sequence in Thailand and to cast notable names such as Ray Liotta and John C. Reilly in minor roles. To add to the studio's budgetary concerns, Fuqua was rewriting the script during the preproduction process. The director also did not have a shot-list, final locations, and supporting actors signed to initiate production.|$|E

25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Fowler suggested to Edward Ardern, his chief chemist, and William Lockett, the chief research assistant, that they research <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> growth of algae. They lowered the light levels, as sunlight often triggered the growth of algae, and kept the precipitant floc, which contained many bacteria, from one experiment to the next. Each subsequent experiment was more successful than the last, as the sludge showed better clarifying properties as it got older. Ardern and Lockett had discovered the Activated Sludge Process, which was soon being used worldwide. The research was carried out at Manchester University, and Fowler presented the results at the Grand Hotel in Manchester in April and November 1914.|$|E
25|$|With {{help from}} QualPro, Boise Cascade {{discovered}} {{there was no}} connection between the quality of wood they purchased as raw material {{and the quality of}} wood pulp it produced for paper and packaging products. QualPro worked with Elo TouchSystems to find out why 25 percent of the touch-screens they manufactured had bubbles between the screen and coating. Statisticians identified three causes, which reduced the defects to less than 1 percent: the type of polyester, the coversheet shaping process and the type of adhesives used. A Unifi yarn plant worked with QualPro to identify <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> number of broken yarns. Out of the 25 quality improvement ideas Unifi had, testing found that five were effective.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> {{concentration}} of inclusions. In order to reduce oxide formation the metal can be melted with a flux, in a vacuum, or in an inert atmosphere. Other ingredients can be added to the mixture to cause the dross to float to the top where it can be skimmed off before the metal is poured into the mold. If this is not practical, then a special ladle that pours the metal from the bottom can be used. Another option is to install ceramic filters into the gating system. Otherwise swirl gates can be formed which swirl the liquid metal as it is poured in, forcing the lighter inclusions to the center and keeping them out of the casting. If some of the dross or slag is folded into the molten metal then it becomes an entrainment defect.|$|E

25|$|Applying a pinch {{current in}} a plasma {{can be used}} to {{counteract}} expansion and confine the plasma. A simple {{way to do this is}} to put the plasma in a linear tube and pass a current through it using electrodes at either end, like a fluorescent lamp. This arrangement still produces no confinement along the length of the tube, so the plasma flows onto the electrodes, rapidly eroding them. This is not a problem for a purely experimental machine, and there are <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> rate. Another solution is to place a magnet next to the tube; when the magnetic field changes, the fluctuations cause an electric current to be induced in the plasma. The major advantage of this arrangement is that there are no physical objects within the tube, so it can be formed into a torus and allow the plasma to circulate freely.|$|E
25|$|Still later, wind-tunnel {{testing was}} applied to automobiles, {{not so much to}} {{determine}} aerodynamic forces per se but more to determine <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> power required to move the vehicle on roadways at a given speed. In these studies, the interaction between the road and the vehicle plays a significant role, and this interaction must be taken into consideration when interpreting the test results. In an actual situation the roadway is moving relative to the vehicle but the air is stationary relative to the roadway, but in the wind tunnel the air is moving relative to the roadway, while the roadway is stationary relative to the test vehicle. Some automotive-test wind tunnels have incorporated moving belts under the test vehicle in an effort to approximate the actual condition, and very similar devices are used in wind tunnel testing of aircraft take-off and landing configurations.|$|E
25|$|The Peruvian {{government}} {{has played a}} moderate role in responding to corporate-community conflict arising from the mineral industry. In January 2012, the Humala administration established an international commission {{with the task of}} identifying <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> environmental effects of the Newmont Mining Corporation's Conga project. Newmont was forced to comply with the revised measures before resuming operations. When government officials presented the new terms to local community members in order to gain their consent, they were faced with considerable opposition and violent protests ensued. Thus, though the national {{government has}} taken some steps towards addressing social protest, it is often unable to adequately address communities' expectations about corporate accountability and the regulation of environmental damage caused by mining activities. Another example concerns mining conflict in Peru's Piura region. Between 1998 and 2003, conflicts arose between the Canadian company Manhattan Minerals and members of the Tambogrande community. Following a local referendum in which 93% of the community voted against mining operations, Manhattan Minerals left the region. Similar conflicts ensued when another corporation, Monterrico Minerals, began conducting exploration work in Piura's highland provinces. This conflict led to the death of two farmers during violent protests and incited many national and international actors to intervene. A referendum took place once again and more than 90% of the population voted against mining. Despite such opposition, Monterrico Metals and the government of Peru insisted that the mining operations go forward. According to the Community Development Journal, such conflicts demonstrate that the government is largely absent in helping community members and corporations to reach mutual agreements. As a result, local community members often view the government as a biased mediator that favors corporate interests. With a lack of government intervention, community members resort to protest in attempt to resolve issues stemming from the mineral industry.|$|E
