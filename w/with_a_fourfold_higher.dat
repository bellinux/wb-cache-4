40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{estimate}} the associations of acidity and concentration of selected minerals in household tap {{water with the}} risk of type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We designed a population-based case-control study with 64 cases of type 1 diabetes and 250 randomly selected control subjects. Acidity, color, and mineral content were measured in tap water from each participant’s house-hold. RESULTS — Tap water pH 6. 2 – 6. 9 was associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fourfold</b> <b>higher</b> risk of type 1 diabetes compared with pH 7. 7 (OR 3. 73, 95 % CI 1. 52 – 9. 15). This result was similar after exclusion of individuals with the highly protective HLA-DQB 1 * 0602 allele, but adjustment for maternal education, urban/rural residence, sex, and age tended to strengthen the estimated association. Higher tap water concentration of zinc was associated with lower risk of type 1 diabetes after adjustment for pH and other possible confounders, but the overall association was strictly not significant. CONCLUSIONS — These results suggest the possibility that quality of drinking water in-fluences the risk of type 1 diabetes. The possible mechanisms by which water acidity or minera...|$|E

40|$|International audienceButyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a serine {{hydrolase}} that {{is present}} in all mammalian tissues. It can accommodate larger substrates or inhibitors than acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in {{the central nervous system}} and neuromuscular junctions. AChE is the specific target of organophosphorous pesticides and warfare nerve agents, and BChE is a stoichiometric bioscavenger. Conversion of BChE into a catalytic bioscavenger by rational design or designing reactivators specific to BChE required structural data obtained using a recombinant low-glycosylated human BChE expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. This expression system yields ≈ 1 mg of pure enzyme per litre of cell culture. Here, we report an improved expression system using insect cells <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fourfold</b> <b>higher</b> yield for truncated human BChE with all glycosylation sites present. We developed a fast purification protocol for the recombinant protein using huprine-based affinity chromatography, which is superior to the classical procainamide-based affinity. The purified BChE crystallized under different conditions and space group than the recombinant low-glycosylated protein produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The crystals diffracted to 2. 5 Å. The overall monomer structure is similar to the low-glycosylated structure except for the presence of the additional glycans. Remarkably, the carboxylic acid molecule systematically bound to the catalytic serine in the low-glycosylated structure is also present in this new structure, despite the different expression system, purification protocol and crystallization conditions...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{ascertain}} {{the association between}} pubertal stage and deliberate self-harm. Method: Cross-sectional survey of 12 - to 15 -year-olds in 300 secondary schools in the U. S. state of Washington in February-April 2002 and the Australian state of Victoria in June-August 2002. A total of 3, 332 students in grades 7 and 9 provided complete data on episodes of deliberate self-harm in the previous 12 months and pubertal stage. Pubertal stage was assessed with the Pubertal Development Scale. Results: The prevalence of deliberate self-harm was 3. 7 % <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more than twofold higher rate in females. Late puberty was associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more than <b>fourfold</b> <b>higher</b> rate of self-harm (odds ratio 4. 6, 95 % confidence interval 1. 5 - 14) after adjustment for age and school grade level. In contrast age had a protective association (odds ratio 0. 7, confidence interval 0. 4 - 1. 0). The sharpest rises in prevalence across puberty were for self-laceration and self-poisoning in females. Higher rates of depressive symptoms, frequent alcohol use, and initiation of sexual activity largely accounted for the association between self-harm and pubertal stage in multivariate models. Conclusions: Puberty is associated with changes in the form and frequency of self-harm. For adolescents <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gap between puberty and brain development, risk factors such as early sexual activity and substance abuse may be particularly potent. <br /...|$|R
40|$|A {{library of}} new bis-picolinamide ruthenium(III) {{dihalide}} complexes {{of the type}} [RuX 2 L 2] (X=Cl or I, L=picolinamide) have been synthesised and characterised. The complexes exhibit different picolinamide ligand binding modes, whereby one ligand is bound (N,N) and the other bound (N,O). Structural studies revealed a mixture of cis and trans isomers for the [RuCl 2 L 2] complexes but upon a halide exchange reaction to yield [RuI 2 L 2], only single trans isomers were detected. High cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell lines was observed, with the potencies of some complexes similar to or better than cisplatin. The conversion to [RuI 2 L 2] substantially increased the activity towards cancer cell lines by more than twelvefold. The [RuI 2 L 2] complexes displayed potent activity against the A 2780 cis (cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer) cell line, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more than <b>fourfold</b> <b>higher</b> potency than cisplatin.

However, there are no prospective studies that allow good estimates of the incidence of depression and anxiety. In this study, the authors assess the long-term incidence of depression and anxiety in the spouses of patients with dementia as recorded by general practitioners. Design: Prospective naturalistic cohort study <b>with</b> <b>a</b> comparison group. Data from medical records in 2001 - 2007 were analyzed. Participants: Two hundred eighteen spouses of patients with dementia and 353 age and gender-matched spouses of nondemented persons. Setting: Seventy-one general practices in the Netherlands <b>with</b> <b>a</b> listed source population of 320, 309 patients. Measurements: Incidence rates (IRs) per 1, 000 person-years and hazard ratios (HRs) of depression and anxiety; prescription rates (per 1, 000 person-years) for antidepressants and anxiolytics. Results: A new episode of depression was diagnosed in 18 spouses and 7 comparison spouses (IRs of 18. 8 / 1, 000 person-years and 4. 4 / 1, 000 person-years, respectively). Spouses of patients with dementia were far more likely to be diagnosed with depression than the comparison spouses (HR, 4. 16; 95 % CI: 1. 73 - 9. 98). Spouses did not have a higher incidence of anxiety than the comparison group (HR, 1. 26; 95 % CI: 0. 58 - 2. 71). The prescription rates for both antidepressants and anxiolytics were significantly higher for spouses than for the comparison group.

30|$|Consistent with {{previous}} studies, {{patients with a}} poor neurological outcome had lower BIS and higher SR values during the entire period of TTM. Up to now, the optimal time point and threshold to predict poor neurological outcome remain questionable. In the post-CA setting, mean BIS values below 40 or mean SR values above 40 during the first 4  h after cardiopulmonary resuscitation were shown to be early predictors for poor outcome [24]. According to Stammet et al. [14], a mean BIS value of 23 calculated over 12.5  h achieved a specificity and sensitivity of 89 and 86 %, respectively. In line with these data, the optimal time point to predict poor neurological outcome in our patient cohort was at hour 12 using a mean BIS value of 25 reaching a specificity of 97 %. As such, {{this is the first}} study which found a nearly similar BIS threshold to predict poor neurological outcome at a more or less identical time point. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a SR value of 3 at hour 23 had an even higher predictive power for poor outcome and its presence was associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fourfold</b> <b>higher</b> risk to decease. Unfortunately, others did not assess the prognostic performance of SR longitudinally, which prevents us from comparing these results with current literature [10, 24]. For that reason, future studies are warranted to validate the value of SR as early prognostic marker in comparison to BIS.|$|E
40|$|Purpose In this {{retrospective}} population-based cohort study, {{we analyzed}} breast MRI use {{and its impact}} on type of surgery, surgical margin involvement, and the diagnosis of contralateral breast cancer. Methods All Dutch patients with cT 1 – 4 N 0 – 3 M 0 breast cancer diagnosed in 2011 – 2013 and treated with primary surgery were eligible for inclusion. Using multivariable analyses, we analyzed in different categories whether MRI use was related to surgery type, margin involvement, and diagnosis of contralateral breast cancer (CBC). Results MRI was performed in 10, 740 out of 36, 050 patients (29. 8 %). Patients with invasive ductal cancer undergoing MRI were more likely to undergo primary mastectomy than those without MRI (OR 1. 30, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 22 – 1. 39, p < 0. 0001). Patients with invasive lobular cancer undergoing MRI were less likely to undergo primary mastectomy than those without MRI (OR 0. 86, 95 % CI 0. 76 – 0. 99, p = 0. 0303). A significantly lower risk of positive surgical margins after breast-conserving surgery was only seen in patients with lobular cancer who had undergone MRI as compared to those without MRI (OR 0. 59, 95 % CI 0. 44 – 0. 79, p = 0. 0003) and, consequently, a lower risk of secondary mastectomy (OR 0. 61, 95 % CI 0. 42 – 0. 88, p = 0. 0088). Patients who underwent MRI were almost four {{times more likely to be}} diagnosed with CBC (OR 3. 55, 95 % CI 3. 01 – 4. 17, p < 0. 0001). Conclusions Breast MRI use was associated with a reduced number of mastectomies and less positive surgical margins in invasive lobular cancer, but with an increased number of mastectomies in ductal cancers.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo compare {{physical}} activity (PA) patterns in pregnant woman {{with and without}} gestational diabetes (GDM) and to assess the effects of an exercise intervention on change in PA patterns, blood glucose levels and pregnancy outcomes in GDM women. MethodsFor the first objective, PA patterns were studied in 795 pregnant women with and without GDM. For the second objective, the Women in India with Gestational Diabetes Strategy-Model of Care (WINGS-MOC) intervention were evaluated in 151 women out of 189 with GDM. PA was assessed using a validated questionnaire and a pedometer. Changes in PA patterns, glycemic parameters and neonatal outcomes were evaluated. ResultsOverall, only 10 % of pregnant women performed recommended levels of PA. Women with GDM were significantly more sedentary compared to those without GDM (86. 2 vs. 61. 2 %, p< 0. 001). After the MOC was implemented in women with GDM, {{there was a significant}} improvement in PA and a decrease in sedentary behaviour amongst women (before MOC, moderate activity: 15. 2 %, sedentary: 84. 8 % vs. after MOC-moderate: 26. 5 %, sedentary: 73. 5 %; p< 0. 001), and an increase in their daily step count from 2206 /day to 2476 /day (p< 0. 001). Fasting 1 and 2 -h postprandial glucose values significantly decreased (p< 0. 001 for all). Sedentary behaviour was associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fourfold</b> <b>higher</b> risk (p= 0. 02), and recreational walking with 70 % decreased risk, of adverse neonatal outcomes (p= 0. 04) after adjusting for potential confounders. ConclusionsPA levels are inadequate amongst this group of pregnant women studied i. e. those with and without GDM. However, a low-cost, culturally appropriate MOC can bring about significant improvements in PA in women with GDM. These changes are associated with improved glycemic control and reduction in adverse neonatal outcomes...|$|E

We used fasting plasma glucose and 2 -h glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test to assess the prevalence of IFG, IGT, and pre-diabetes and used the log-binomial model to estimate the prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95 % CIs. |The unadjusted prevalences of IFG, IGT, and pre-diabetes were 13. 1, 3. 4, and 16. 1 %, respectively. Boys had a 2. 4 -fold higher prevalence of pre-diabetes than girls (95 % CI 1. 3 - 4. 3). Non-Hispanic blacks had a lower rate than non-Hispanic whites (PR 0. 6, 95 % CI 0. 4 - 0. 9). Adolescents aged 16 - 19 years had a lower rate than those aged 12 - 15 years (0. 6, 0. 4 - 0. 9). Overweight adolescents had a 2. 6 -fold higher rate than those with normal weight (1. 3 - 5. 1).

40|$|The {{substrate}} specificity of porcine pepsin has been altered by site-directed mutagenesis {{in an attempt}} to selectively cleave bovine hide collagen at only a few sites, similar to cathepsin D, for the production of high quality gelatin. Kinetic parameters were determined using chromogenic peptide substrates based on the sequence Lys-Pro-Xaa-Yaa-Phe*Nph-Arg-Leu (where Xaa is Ile or Pro, Yaa is Glu, Leu, Gln or Lys, Nph is p-nitrophenylalanine, and *is the site of cleavage). Substitution of Thr 222 and Glu 287 within the S subsite of pepsin by Val and Met, respectively, produced <b>a</b> double mutant <b>with</b> <b>a</b> two- to <b>fourfold</b> <b>higher</b> k(cat) /K(m), compared with wild-type pepsin, for the chromogenic peptides with residues Leu, Gln, and Glu at position P (Yaa). The results suggest that the functional group of the P side chain may be exposed to solvent, while the aliphatic portion interacts with hydrophobic residues comprising S. Wild-type pepsin cleaved a peptide corresponding to the carboxy-terminal telopeptide region of bovine type I collagen α 1 chain, SGGYDLSFLPQPPQE, predominantly at three sites (Asp-Leu, Leu-Ser, and Phe-Leu) and at a significantly lower rate at Ser-Phe. However, Thr 222 Val/Glu 287 Met cleaved site Ser-Phe at a rate 20 -fold higher than the wild-type. Significantly, enzymes containing the double substitution Phe 111 Thr/Leu 112 Phe cleaved this peptide predominantly at one site Leu-Ser (similar to cathepsin D) and at a rate 23 -fold higher than the wild-type. These mutants can potentially enhance the rate of solubilization of bovine hide collagen under conditions mild enough to maintain the triple helix structure and hence minimize the rate of subsequent denaturation and proteolytic cleavage...|$|R
40|$|Aspergillus {{is among}} {{a growing list of}} allergens that {{aggravate}} asthmatic responses. Significant pulmonary pathology is associated with Aspergillus-induced allergic and asthmatic lung disease. Environments with high levels of exposure to fungi are found in animal production facilities such as for swine and poultry, and farmers working with these are at increased risk for occupational respiratory diseases. Seven Portuguese poultry and seven swine farms were analyzed in order to estimate the prevalence, amount, and distribution of Aspergillus species, as well as to determine the presence of clinical symptoms associated with asthma and other allergy diseases in these highly contaminated settings. From the collected fungal isolates (699), an average incidence of 22 % Aspergillus was detected in poultry farms, while the prevalence at swine farms was 14 %. The most frequently isolated Aspergillus species were A. versicolor, A. flavus, and A. fumigatus. In poultry farms, A. flavus presented the highest level of airborne spores (> 2000 CFU/m 3), whereas in swine farms the highest was <b>A.</b> versicolor, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> incidence <b>fourfold</b> greater <b>higher</b> than the other mentioned species. Eighty workers in these settings were analyzed, ranging in age from 17 to 93 yr. The potentially hazardous exposure of poultry workers to mold allergens using sensitization markers was evaluated. Although no significant positive association was found between fungal contamination and sensitization to fungal antigens, a high incidence of respiratory symptoms in professionals without asthma was observed, namely, wheezing associated with dyspnea (23. 8 %) and dyspnea after strenuous activities (12. 3 %), suggesting underdiagnosed respiratory disturbances. Further, 32. 5 % of all exposed workers noted an improvement of respiratory ability during resting and holidays. From all the analyzed workers, seven were previously diagnosed with asthma and four reported the first attack after the age of 40 yr, which may be associated with their occupational exposure. Some of the fungi, namely, the Aspergillus species detected in this study, are known to induce hypersensitivity reactions in humans. This study confirmed the presence and distribution of Aspergillus in Portuguese poultry and swine farms, suggesting a possible occupational health problem and raising the need for preventive and protective measures to apply to avoid exposure in both occupational settings...|$|R

Aim: To characterize occupational biological risk exposure among Chilean workers {{which have been}} registered by the Toxicology Information Center, between January 2006 and December 2009. Material and Methods: All incoming calls reporting exposure to biological agents during the studied period were analyzed. The information obtained from the caller was registered using the Communication Record Instrument of the WHO International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS INTOX). Results: In the studied period, 77 calls were received. The mean age of exposed patients was 35 ± 15 years and 57 % of them were females. The most common involved agents were vaccines for veterinary use (42 %) followed by Loxosceles laeta bites in 16 %. The main routes of exposure were injections, cuts and needle stick injuries in 39 % and stings and bites in 38 %. The highest exposure rates were observed in Southern Chile due to self-inoculation of veterinary vaccines used in the salmon industry (22. 7 / 100. 000 actual workers). Fifty-eight percent of calls were from health care workers, and 51 % of them were from health care facilities. Sixty percent of exposures occurred during summer and spring.

40|$|The radiolabeling of {{the natural}} octapeptide CCK 8, derivatized <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{cysteine}} residue (Cys-Gly-CCK 8), by using the metal fragment [99 mTc(N) (PNP 3) ] 2 + (PNP 3 = N,N-bis(dimethoxypropylphosphinoethyl) methoxyethylamine) is reported. The [99 mTc(N) (NS-Cys-Gly-CCK 8) (PNP 3) ]+ complex was obtained according to two methods (one-step or two-step procedure) that gave the desired compound in high yield. The complex is stable in aqueous solution and in phosphate buffer. In vitro challenge experiments <b>with</b> <b>an</b> excess of cysteine and glutathione indicate that no transchelation reactions occur, confirming the high thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of this compound. Stability studies carried out in human and mouse serum, {{as well as in}} mouse liver homogenates, show that the radiolabeled compound remains intact for prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C. Binding properties give Kd (19. 0 +/- 4. 6 nmol/l) and Bmax (approximately 10 (6) sites/cell) values in A 431 cells overexpressing the CCK 2 -R. In vivo evaluation of the compound shows rapid and specific targeting to CCK 2 -R, <b>a</b> <b>fourfold</b> <b>higher</b> accumulation compared to nonreceptor expressing tumors...|$|R

2500|$|Bicalutamide has a cyano {{group at}} the para {{position}} instead of a nitro group like flutamide and nilutamide. This change in groups avoids the nitro reduction observed in nilutamide. Bicalutamide has a chiral carbon in its structure (labeled <b>with</b> <b>an</b> asterisk in figure 6), which {{is connected to the}} hydroxyl and methyl groups [...] It is therefore administered as a racemate. Post-approval investigation revealed that its antiandrogenic activity resides almost entirely in the (R)-enantiomer. (R)-bicalutamide has <b>an</b> almost <b>fourfold</b> <b>higher</b> affinity for the prostate AR than hydroxyflutamide and has a better side-effect profile compared to other antiandrogens.|$|R

Based on a decreased rate of dissociation of O 2 {{in the presence}} of dithionite and an increased rate of binding of CO by the deoxy form, we have concluded that the kinetic basis of the high affinity exhibited by Hb Hiroshima is the concurrence of a faster combination rate and a slower dissociation rate for ligands...|$|R
40|$|Background: An {{investigation}} of intergenerational {{factors associated with}} psychiatric disorder in late adolescence/early adulthood was undertaken to differentiate influences from maternal disorder, maternal poor psychosocial functioning and poor parenting, on offspring. Method: The sample comprised an intensively studied series of 276 mother–offspring pairs in a relatively deprived inner-city London area with high rates of lone parenthood and socio-economic disadvantage. The paired sample was collected over two time periods: first a consecutively screened series of mothers and offspring in 1985 – 90 (n ¼ 172 pairs) and second a ‘vulnerable’ series of mothers and offspring in 1995 – 99 (n ¼ 104 pairs). The vulnerable mothers were selected for poor interpersonal functioning and/or low self-esteem and the consecutive series were used for comparison. Rates of childhood adversity and disorder in the offspring were examined in the two groups. Maternal characteristics including psychosocial vulnerability and depression were then examined in relation to risk transmission. Results: Offspring of vulnerable mothers had <b>a</b> <b>fourfold</b> <b>higher</b> rate of yearly disorder {{than those in the}} comparison series (43...|$|R
40|$|Antibody titers to {{cytomegalovirus}} {{were determined}} in 204 single-serum specimens and in 138 serum pairs, utilizing as antigen extracts of infected cells prepared by either freezing and thawing cells (FT antigen) or extracting them <b>with</b> <b>a</b> glycine buffer (GE antigen). With the serum pairs, 40 % {{of the early}} sera and 44 % of the late sera showed <b>a</b> <b>fourfold</b> or <b>higher</b> antibody titer with the GE antigen compared with those with the FT antigen, whereas 39 % of the single sera had <b>a</b> <b>fourfold</b> or <b>higher</b> titer <b>with</b> the GE antigen. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the two antigen preparations indicated that the GE antigen contained two peaks of complement-fixing activity, one at a density of 1. 18 to 1. 22 g/cm 3 and one at 1. 06 to 1. 10 g/cm 3. The FT antigen had only one discernible peak of complement-fixing activity at 1. 04 to 1. 10 g/cm 3. On electron microscopy, the more dense peak contained mainly nucleocapsids with some dense bodies and occasional enveloped virions, and the lighter peak was composed of amorphous material. Antibody titers obtained with the crude GE antigen and the more dense peak (designated viral antigen) were in agreement, whereas titers with the FT antigen agreed with those obtained with the lighter peak (soluble antigen). The antibody detected with both antigens was mainly immunoglobulin G...|$|R
40|$|In the {{presence}} of saddle points having the same energy, multi-barrier transitions, which normally are quenched in the over-damped regime, become allowed when the friction is small enough. The model described by the Fokker-Planck equation for the angle and its velocity <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fourfold</b> potential is examined in order to illustrate {{the role of the}} friction in the multi-barrier crossing. Both exact numerical calculations and asymptotic analysis of the Fokker-Planck equation are performed. Some general conclusions are drawn for the butane isomerization...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} new method for {{measuring}} the CP phase α. It requires the measurement of the pure penguin decays Bd 0 (t) →K(∗) K̄(∗) and Bs 0 →K(∗) K̄(∗). The method is quite clean: we estimate the theoretical uncertainty to be at most  5 %. By applying the method to several K(∗) K̄(∗) final states, α can be extracted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fourfold</b> ambiguity. An additional assumption reduces this ambiguity to twofold: {α,α+π}. Since no π 0 detection is needed, this method can be used at hadron colliders...|$|R

40|$|MgrA is a known {{regulator}} of {{the expression}} of several multidrug transporters in Staphylococcus aureus. We identified another regulator of multiple efflux pumps, NorG, by its ability, like that of MgrA, to bind specifically to the promoter of the gene encoding the NorA efflux pump. NorG {{is a member of}} the family of the GntR-like transcriptional regulators, and it binds specifically to the putative promoters of the genes encoding multidrug efflux pumps NorA, NorB, NorC, and AbcA. Overexpression of norG produces a threefold increase in norB transcripts associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fourfold</b> increase in the level of resistance to quinolones. In contrast, disruption of norG produces no change in the level of transcripts of norA, norB, and norC but causes an increase of at least threefold in the transcript level of abcA, associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fourfold</b> increase in resistance to methicillin, cefotaxime, penicillin G, and nafcillin. Overexpression of cloned abcA caused an 8 - to 128 -fold increase in the level of resistance to all four β-lactam antibiotics. Furthermore, MgrA and NorG have opposite effects on norB and abcA expression. MgrA acts as an indirect repressor for norB and a direct activator for abcA, whereas NorG acts as a direct activator for norB and a direct repressor for abcA...|$|R
