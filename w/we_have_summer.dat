"Words {{spoken at}} parting, and {{which may be}} the last we ever hear from a fri'nd are not soon forgotten," [...] he repeated, [...] "and so Judith, I intend to speak to you like a brother, seein' I'm not old enough to be your father. In the first place, I wish to caution you ag'in your inimies, of which two may be said to ha'nt your very footsteps, and to beset your ways. The first is oncommon good looks, which is as {{dangerous}} a foe to some young women, as a whole tribe of Mingos could prove, and which calls for great watchfulness--not to admire and praise--but to distrust and sarcumvent. Yes, good looks may be sarcumvented, and fairly outwitted, too. In order to do this you've only to remember that they melt like the snows, and, when once gone, they never come back ag'in. The seasons come and go, Judith, and if we have winter, with storms and frosts, and spring with chills and leafless trees, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>summer</b> with its sun and glorious skies, and fall with its fruits, and a garment thrown over the forest, that no beauty of the town could rummage out of all the shops in America. 'Arth is in an etarnal round, the goodness of God bringing back the pleasant when we've had enough of the onpleasant. But it's not so with good looks. They are lent for a short time in youth, to be used and not abused, and, as I never met with a young woman to whom providence has been as bountiful as it has to you, Judith, in this partic'lar, I warn you, as it might be with my dyin' breath, to beware of the inimy--fri'nd, or inimy, as we deal with the gift." ...|$|E

Knauth gained widespread notoriety for his expertise on sailing the Sound. He spent summer vacations sailing his boat in the Caribbean Sea. Commenting on his sailing activities in an article in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Knauth noted: [...] "You know, I've found that living on a boat is the cheapest way of all.

"Besides," [...] said my wife, [...] "a form {{of worship}} kept up {{from year to}} year in a family--the {{assembling}} of parents and children for a few sacred moments each day, though it may be a form many times, especially in the gay and thoughtless hours of life--often becomes invested with deep sacredness in times of trouble, or in those crises that rouse our deeper feelings. In sickness, in bereavement, in separation, the daily prayer at home has a sacred and healing power. Then we remember the scattered and wandering ones; and the scattered and wandering think tenderly of that hour when they know they are remembered. I know, when I was a young girl, I was often thoughtless and careless about family prayers; but now that my father and mother are gone forever, there is nothing I recall more often. I remember the great old Family Bible, the hymn-book, the chair where father used to sit. I see him as he looked bending over that Bible more than in any other way; and expressions and sentences in his prayers which fell unheeded on my ears in those days have often come back to me like comforting angels. We are not aware of the influence things are having on us till <b>we</b> <b>have</b> left them far behind in years. When <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>summered</b> and wintered them, and look back on them from changed times and other days, we find that they were making their mark upon us, though we knew it not." ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} characteristics of atmospheric aerosols is their volatility. Volatility affects the formation, life time, and removal of aerosol particles (Huffman et al., 2009). Accurate description of volatility of atmospheric aerosols can lead to a better identification of their sources and it is also crucial for models incorporating condensation and aging of aerosols. However, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding aerosol properties such as volatility especially in case of organic aerosols. To increase our understanding of aerosols volatility, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> performed <b>summer</b> (21. 8. - 2. 10. 2012; 17. 6. - 18. 8. 2014) and winter (19. 2. - 28. 5. 2013; 9. 1. - 13. 3. 2014) measurement campaigns with a thermodenuder at a suburban site in Prague Suchdol and at a rural site Košetice, respectively...|$|R

It was all the way downhill, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the loveliest <b>summer</b> weather for it. So we set the pedometer and then stretched away on an easy, regular stride, down through the cloven forest, drawing in the fragrant breath of the morning in deep refreshing draughts, and wishing <b>we</b> might never <b>have</b> anything to do forever but walk to Oppenau and keep on doing it and then doing it over again.|$|R
40|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> always bemoaned the wetness of the 'Great British Summer'. The {{summer of}} 2007 was, without a doubt, {{one of the}} wettest on record, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> wet <b>summers</b> before, indeed some quite recently. Analysis of the Meteorological Office's {{rainfall}} series for 1914 - 2007 for the United Kingdom (Figure 1) shows that in about 20 % of years the UK's summer rainfall was greater than the median winter and autumn rainfalls. However, the UK’s summer rainfall for 2007 (357. 1 mm) was the second highest on record, and only marginally less than in the wettest year (1956, 358. 4 mm).

50|$|The {{device of}} Mulberry's father being Death and mother being Springtime is loosely {{borrowed}} from Greek mythology. Hades, {{lord of the}} underworld married a young maiden goddess named Persephone. Demeter was her mother and was heartbroken at the fate of Persephone having to live forever in hell. As the goddess of fertility and agriculture, her grief caused winter to come. As a compromise it was arranged for Persephone to only spend half the year with her husband. Thus <b>we</b> <b>have</b> winter and <b>summer</b> annually. Since springtime comes when Persephone returns to the surface she {{has become a symbol}} of youth, rebirth and spring. However, in Greek mythology, Hades and Persephone never have any children. With the programme's cancellation viewers never find out which parent eventually wins Mulberry's heart and mind.|$|R
