50|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September 10. A weak high-level trough and a <b>warm</b> <b>anticyclone</b> to the east-northeast generated low wind shear, allowing a tropical depression to develop at 18:00 UTC on September 11, while located about 225 mi (360 km) southeast of Praia, Cape Verde. Although satellite imagery indicated a well-defined tropical depression, it did not organize further until at least September 13. Two days later, the ship Sal Mela observed wind speeds of 69 mph. Thus, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Edna on September 15. Around that time, Edna attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1001 mbar (29.6 inHg). By September 18, upper level cold trough began producing unfavorable conditions, with the storm weakening to a tropical depression that day. Edna degenerated into a tropical wave early the following day, while situated about 395 mi (635 km) east of Barbuda.|$|E

40|$|Weather events {{over the}} central {{third of the}} United States {{during the first week}} of August 1970 provide an {{excellent}} example of an upper level summer continental <b>warm</b> <b>anticyclone</b> accompanied by well-defined moist tongues. This type of situation, in which significant amounts of convective precipitation can occur with anticyclonic northwesterly flow aloft, was discovered originally with the help of isentropic analysis and described by Namias (1938) and Wexler and Namias (1938). Since the advent of weather satellites, many cases of the cyclonic cloud vortex have been illustrated in the literature, but to our knowledge, none of the large-scale anticyclonic eddy. As shown by Stark (1970, fig. 7), a narrow band of precipitation in southern Texas was associated with th...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims at {{analysing}} {{the impact}} of oceanic turbulence and air-sea interactions on the sea surface temperature (SST) of the extra-tropical oceans on spatial scales {{of a few hundred}} kilometres (the so-called "mesoscale"). Using satellite-based measurements of SST and sea level, as well as surface tracks of mesoscale oceanic cyclones and anticyclones, it is shown that turbulence does not transport heat through systematic motions of cold cyclones and <b>warm</b> <b>anticyclones,</b> as was previously thought in regions of strong mean flows like the Gulf Stream. Rather, it is suggested that heat is transported {{as a result of the}} slight phase shift between temperature and pressure fluctuations developing on the mean flow. In addition, tentative estimates of the rate at which air-sea heat fluxes damp the SST signatures of cyclones and anticyclones are provided. The weak values obtained (20 W/m 2 K) contrast sharply with theoretical expectations, but are in agreement with the observed long-lived thermal heat content anomalies associated with the cyclones and anticyclones. These observations provide important benchmarks for high-resolution ocean models and may moreover guide the parametrization of subgrid-scale heat transport in climate models.

40|$|Moored {{observations}} of currents and temperatures {{made in the}} upper 600 m on eddy-resolving scales over a 2 -year period are {{used to examine the}} spatial and temporal characteristics of the California Current mesoscale circulation. The observations were made at three principal longitudes: 124 °W, 126 °W, and 128 °W in the vicinity of Point Arena. They bracket the 600 -km-wide band of high mesoscale variability found along the eastern boundary of the North Pacific. At all locations, the mesoscale variability was larger than the mean flow, and the spatial modes of variability as determined from empirical orthogonal function analysis consisted of an alongshore mode, a cross-shore mode, and a rotational mode. Observations made near the continental slope (124 °W) were dominated by the poleward flowing California Undercurrent, with mesoscale eddies and meanders superposed. The nearshore eddy kinetic energy peaked in a band centered around 60 days. Observations made at 128 °W, near the offshore boundary between the energetic mesoscale band and the "eddy desert" of the northeast Pacific, were characterized by small means, fewer eddy events, and a peak in eddy kinetic energy at 120 - 180 days. The good horizontal resolution of the current meter arrays allowed us to estimate the relative vorticity, horizontal divergence, and Rossby number and therefore to evaluate the relative strength and occurrence of anticyclones and cyclones. We found the mesoscale eddy field to be strongly nonlinear, with Rossby numbers ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 5. All of the eddies observed at the offshore site were nonlinear, deep, <b>warm</b> <b>anticyclones.</b> Shipboard hydrography revealed the origin of one of these anticyclones to be the California Undercurrent, and this eddy retained its strong anomalies after several months and several hundred kilometers of propagation. Despite the lower incidence of eddies as one moves west from the coast, the eddies that we observed offshore provide evidence for propagation and transport of properties from the coast to the central North Pacific across the California Current Syste...|$|R
40|$|TWO {{definite}} {{levels of}} subsidence inversions were found over the tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean {{during the winter}} of 1964; both were mainly persistent and continuous. The existence of the lower inversion has been known, but that of the upper inversion at a mean height of 550 mb. has not. It is hypothesized that the upper inversion is caused and maintained by the subsidence in the <b>warm</b> “dynamic ” <b>anticyclone</b> centered over Central America during winter. Both inversions appear to act as “lids ” on cloud height development. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{threat of}} {{dangerous}} concentrations {{of air pollution}} developed over several Eastern States in late July when a. cold Canadian High gradually transformed into a <b>warm</b> <b>anticyclone.</b> As the atmosphere became more stable and air currents more sluggish, contaminants remained where they formed. Advisories of high pollution potential began on July 28 for an area from the southern Appalachians to southern Pennsylvania and continued for several days as the threatened area slowly diminished in size. By August 1, {{the state of the}} circulation had improved so much that advisories were no longer necessary. Tropical storm Becky went inland at Port St. Joe, Fla., on the morning of July 22, bringing heavy rains and squalls to the Florida Panhandle.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of O 3  and its precursors over North America are simulated for three summer months with a three-dimensional, continental-scale photochemical model using meteorological {{input from the}} Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) general circulation model (GCM). The model has 4 °× 5 ° grid resolution and represents non linear chemistry in urban and industrial plumes with a subgrid nested scheme. Simulated median afternoon O 3  concentrations at rural U. S. sites are within 5 ppb of observations in most cases, except in the south central United States where concentrations are overpredicted by 15 – 20 ppb. The model captures successfully the development of regional high-O 3  episodes over the northeastern United States {{on the back side}} of weak, <b>warm,</b> stagnant <b>anticyclones.</b> Simulated {{concentrations of}} CO and nonmethane hydrocarbons are generally in good agreement with observations, concentrations of NOx are underpredicted by 10 – 30 %, and concentrations of peroxyacylnitrates (PANs) are overpredicted by a factor of 2 to 3. The overprediction of PANs is attributed to flaws in the photochemical mechanism, including excessive production from oxidation of isoprene, and may also reflect an underestimate of PANs deposition. Subgrid nonlinear chemistry as captured by the nested plumes scheme decreases the net O 3  production computed in the United States boundary layer by 8 % on average...|$|R
40|$|Different {{remote sensing}} data were {{combined}} to characterise a winter anticyclonic eddy {{in the southeastern}} Bay of Biscay and to infer its effects on cross-shelf exchanges, in a period when typical along shelf-slope currents depict a cyclonic pattern. While the joint analysis of available satellite data (infrared, visible and altimetry) permitted the characterisation and tracking of the anticyclone properties and path, data from a coastal high-frequency radar system enabled a quantitative analysis of the surface cross-shelf transports associated with this <b>anticyclone.</b> The <b>warm</b> core <b>anticyclone</b> had a diameter of around 50 km, maximum azimuthal velocities near 50 cms− 1 and a relative vorticity of up to − 0. 45 f. The eddy generation occurred after the relaxation of a cyclonic wind-driven current regime over the shelf-slope; then, the eddy remained stationary for several weeks until it started to drift northwards along the shelf break. The surface signature of this eddy was observed by means of high-frequency radar data for 20 consecutive days, providing {{a unique opportunity to}} characterise and quantify, from a Lagrangian perspective, the associated transport and its effect on the Chl-a surface distribution. We observed the presence of mesoscale structures with similar characteristics in the area during different winters within the period 2011 – 2014. Our results suggest that the eddy-induced recurrent cross-shelf export is an effective mechanism for the expansion of coastal productive waters into the adjacent oligotrophic ocean basin...|$|R
40|$|The surface {{signature}} of Agulhas rings propagating across the South Atlantic Ocean is observed based on three independent data sets: Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System/Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) (TMI/AMSR-E) satellite sea surface temperature, Argo profiling floats and a merged winds product derived from scatterometer observations and reanalysis results. A persistent pattern of cold (negative) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the eddy core, with warm (positive) anomalies at the boundary, is revealed. This pattern {{contrasts with the}} classical idea of a <b>warm</b> core <b>anticyclone.</b> Taking advantage of a moving reference frame corresponding to the altimetry-detected Agulhas rings, modifications of the surface winds by the ocean-induced currents and SST gradients are evaluated using satellite SST and wind observations. As obtained, the averaged stationary thermal expression and mean eddy-induced circulation are coupled to the marine atmospheric boundary layer, leading to surface wind anomalies. Consequently, an average Ekman pumping associated with these mean surface wind variations consistently emerges. This average Ekman pumping is found to explain very well the SST anomaly signatures of the detected Agulhas rings. Particularly, this mechanism {{seems to be the}} key factor determining that these anticyclonic eddies exhibit stationary imprints of cold SST anomalies near their core centers. A residual phase with the maximum sea surface height (SSH) anomaly and wind speed anomaly is found {{to the right of the}} mean wind direction, apparently maintaining a coherent stationary thermal expression coupled to the marine atmospheric boundary layer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In 2007, {{just after}} the {{recession}} of the Changma, anomalously long rainy period (from July 30 to August 15) occurred in Korea. To identify {{the cause of the}} sustained rainy period, we performed synoptic analysis and the associated air motions. The behavior of each air parcel trajectory associated with atmospheric motion was then investigated. As a result, three particular phenomena occurring at latitudes lower than 40 o N were discovered. First, a mass of relatively cold air, referred to as E, made a deep intrusion from 20 o N to 60 o N. Second, this intrusion was accompanied by another mass of air called dE. It was colder and drier than E and originated from the mid-troposphere over the tropical ocean. Third, dE and E rotated clockwise three times over a period of 17 days over the Northwestern Pacific and blocked the westerly waves imbedded in the zonal flow from propagating. Two additional phenomena were observed at latitudes higher than 40 o N. First, the cold core system, while approaching from the west with low geopotential values at its center, was stagnated over Shanxi China. It enhanced the northward intrusion of dE and E, and then diminished. The subsequent low system showed similar evolution as the first one. Second, a <b>warm</b> core <b>anticyclone</b> was formed over Lake Baikal, blocking the westerlies for 13 days and contributed to the persistent northward incursion of warm moist air. Moreover, a horizontally extended intrusion of upper level clouds from the tropics to 50 o N, which may be interpreted as a tropical plume, was found around the end of the period (from August 12 to 15, 2007) with successive tropical nights over Korea...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{large-scale}} temperature {{rise in the}} Japanese Islands was taken up. The daily values of AMeDAS in 2004 were used for data. Large-scale temperature rise {{was defined as the}} case when the deviation from the normal of the daily maximum temperature is 10 ℃ or more. First of all, the region and the season of large-scale temperature rise were clarified. Then, the generation was analyzed. The results are as follows. 1) Large-scale temperature rise occurs mainly in the Sea of Japan coast from San-in to Tohoku. A lot of generations are also seen in Pacific coast and the Okhotsk coast from Kanto to Hokkaido. Many appear in spring. 2) Large-scale temperature rise starts from West Japan, and shifts to East Japan. Moreover, it starts from the inland, and shifts to the coast. Before and after the generation of a large-scale temperature rise, the anticyclone advances toward the east around Japanese Islands. When the Japanese Islands are covered with the <b>anticyclone,</b> <b>warm</b> air is formed in the inland. The warm air is carried to the leeward coast by the southerly wind {{on the west side of}} the anticyclone. This wind blocks the invasion of a cool sea breeze, and promotes the temperature rise...|$|R
