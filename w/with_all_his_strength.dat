He wrote numerous pamphlets during the short-lived Second French Republic, attacked the Roman expedition <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> and was from the first an uncompromising opponent of Prince Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (Napoleon III).|$|E
2500|$|Neither man {{wanted the}} blame for causing the {{impending}} war. Cavour noted that Napoleon began by stating that {{he was determined to}} support [...] <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> in a war against Austria, on the condition that the war was not in support of a revolutionary cause and could be justified in diplomatic terms and, more importantly, before public opinion in France and in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Escrivá {{conceived}} the Mass as the [...] "Source and {{summit of the}} Christian's interior life," [...] a terminology which was later used by the Second Vatican Council. According to Giovanni Battista Re, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, [...] "St. Josemaría strove <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> to make the Eucharist {{the center of his}} life... For him, Jesus was not an example to imitate from afar, an abstract moral ideal, but his Jesus, a person we should live alongside continuously." ...|$|E
60|$|The child scampered, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> little <b>strength,</b> {{after the}} prize, while his master laughed.|$|R
5000|$|David Jeffries of AllMusic gave Dame Fortune 4 stars out of 5, {{calling it}} [...] "a {{culmination}} album with an artist's evolution pushing things forward <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strengths</b> in tow." [...] Meanwhile, Adam Kivel of Consequence of Sound gave the album a grade of C+, noting that [...] "the entirety of the record, in fact, feels like it's trailing {{a few years}} behind." ...|$|R
60|$|The man swung <b>his</b> ax <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> mighty <b>strength,</b> but the {{powerful}} brute seized it in those terrible hands, and tearing it from Clayton's grasp hurled it far to one side.|$|R
60|$|Nathan {{tried again}} <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength.</b> The sides came {{together}} very slowly.|$|E
60|$|The old man {{grabbed the}} oars and began rowing <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E
60|$|Our hero {{seized the}} oars {{from the hands}} of the latter and pulled <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> for the yacht.|$|E
60|$|Both crawled {{from the}} narrow opening, and Dan pulled upon the ring <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of <b>his</b> <b>strength.</b> Up came a trap-door {{about two feet}} square. Beneath this was a space of inky darkness.|$|R
60|$|The animal heaved {{in a final}} convulsion, and, {{despite the}} rope, kicked out <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> last <b>strength.</b> A tablespoonful of black clot came forth, the {{trickling}} of red blood having ceased for some seconds.|$|R
60|$|<b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> {{remaining}} <b>strength</b> the ape-man {{drove home}} the blade--once, twice, thrice, {{and then all}} went black before him as he felt himself, still in the clutches of the Tor-o-don, topple from the recess.|$|R
60|$|Striking out <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength,</b> {{his cane}} {{came in contact}} with the leader's weapon, {{shattering}} the former, and the fight was over.|$|E
6000|$|The sophomore pulled {{and tugged}} <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength,</b> yet {{he could not}} {{dislodge}} Ken. The freshmen howled gleefully for him to [...] "Hang! hang!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Why, suppose,” {{said his}} father, “that he should dart off at once {{as soon as}} he is harnessed, and pull <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength,</b> and furiously.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a cock-and-bull {{story to}} make him a prisoner," [...] said Tom. [...] "I'm going to find him if I can," [...] and he threw himself on the door <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of <b>his</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|R
60|$|Another hour {{passed and}} his thirst {{seemed to grow}} upon him every minute. Then he grew desperate, and bracing himself, tried <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> to burst the hollow tree asunder. But the effort availed nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is a sharp rock; I think I {{can pull}} myself up on that," [...] said Tom. He tried <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> {{and went up}} off Sam's shoulders. Then the {{youngest}} Rover heard him crawling around the wet flooring carefully.|$|R
60|$|Almayer {{gripped the}} edge of the table <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength.</b> He {{resisted}} manfully an almost uncontrollable impulse to fly at her and box her ears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Or this," [...] {{bellowed}} Sir John, and, {{lifting the}} tightly rolled umbrella he carried, he struck Godfrey <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> upon {{the side of}} the head.|$|E
60|$|That he was {{a victim}} of foul play the young {{messenger}} could have no doubt, and he struggled <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> to free himself, but in vain.|$|E
60|$|The {{bridge was}} now {{less than two}} hundred feet away, and {{whatever}} was to be accomplished must be done quickly. At last Dick had the reins, {{and he began to}} pull upon them <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of <b>his</b> <b>strength,</b> at the same time calling upon Tom to hold him to the seat.|$|R
6000|$|... "On these I {{would have}} Pharaoh <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> {{remaining}} <b>strength</b> pour {{from the northern}} and the southern gates of Amada, for so shall they be caught like wounded lions between two wild bulls and torn and trampled and utterly destroyed. Only I know not how to tell Pharaoh what he must do, and when." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fred Tatasciore as AAARRRGGHH!!!, Jim's ally {{who has a}} deep {{bond with}} Toby. He was born a Krubera troll but joined the Gumm-Gumm army - after his traumatizing {{experience}} there, he became a self-proclaimed pacifist and remains guilty about his past. Despite his peaceful demeanor, he will fight <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> considerable <b>strength</b> to protect those he cares about.|$|R
60|$|Eric {{gave way}} <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength,</b> and, as he pulled, {{when he was}} no more than five fathoms from her, the Raven {{vanished}} with a huge swirl.|$|E
6000|$|... "If we {{only had}} a pick or a crowbar we could get these stones out in no time," [...] grunted Tom, as he pulled away <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Jethro said, [...] "but I dare {{to execute}} him," [...] {{and he brought}} his heavy club down <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> upon {{the head of the}} priest.|$|E
60|$|Once more Whitefire shone above him. Eric {{rushed in}} beneath the sword, and <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> mighty <b>strength</b> thrust the buckler-point at Blacktooth's face. It struck fair and full, and lo! {{the helm of}} Ospakar burst asunder. He threw wide his giant arms, then fell as a pine falls upon the {{mountain}} edge. He fell back, and he lay still.|$|R
60|$|Then just {{as things}} began to grow black, {{something}} sprang forward and I saw the huge hound lifted from the earth. Its jaws opened, my arm came free and fell against my side. Yes! the brute was whirling round in the air. Leo held it by its hind legs and <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> great <b>strength</b> whirled it round and round.|$|R
60|$|Presently it came. The sword, {{falling from}} Acour's {{hand into the}} grave, rested there point upward. With a last effort he drew his dagger. Dashing the blood from his eyes, he hurled it <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> dying <b>strength,</b> not at Hugh, but at Red Eve. Past her ear it hissed, {{severing}} a little tress of her long hair, which floated down on to the snow.|$|R
60|$|He went to {{the stone}} beyond it first and struck two or three blows <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength.</b> Then {{he did the same}} with the stone that they were examining.|$|E
60|$|So the Champion {{picked up}} the Scarecrow and {{balanced}} him a moment, {{to see how much}} he weighed, and then <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> tossed him high into the air.|$|E
60|$|Charlie {{drew back}} a step; and then, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength,</b> smote the {{governor}} between the eyes, {{and he fell}} in a heap beneath the table. Then Charlie grasped a decanter.|$|E
60|$|With the quickness of a cat, Bradley {{sprang to}} <b>his</b> feet and <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> great <b>strength,</b> backed by <b>his</b> heavy weight, struck the Wieroo upon {{the point of}} the chin. Without a sound the thing {{crumpled}} to the platform, while Bradley, acting almost instinctively to the urge of the first law of nature, rolled the inanimate body over the edge into the river.|$|R
60|$|There {{was nothing}} in the hold by which to reach the hatchway, but, growing weary of waiting, Tom dragged a box hither and asked Dick and Sam to stand upon it. Then he climbed on their shoulders, to find his head {{directly}} against the beams of the deck. He pushed <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> on the hatch, to find it battened down on the outside.|$|R
60|$|And Tom did pray, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> {{mind and}} <b>strength,</b> {{for the soul}} that was passing,--the soul that seemed looking so {{steadily}} and mournfully from those large, melancholy blue eyes. It was literally prayer offered with strong crying and tears.|$|R
