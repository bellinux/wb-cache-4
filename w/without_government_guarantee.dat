Using an option pricing model we show that if the <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> the principal, rational participants will shift their entire contribution to the riskiest fund available for investment, which in turn will maximize the cost of providing the guarantee. We find that the cost of the guarantee is substantially lower for younger participants than for older participants if the guaranteed principal is not indexed for inflation, but the difference is small if the guaranteed principal is indexed for inflation. Our findings suggest that the government needs to offer only one mix of funds for investment in guaranteed accounts, and to minimize guarantee costs, it would guarantee only the principal. Alternatively, it could take a more age-neutral approach by guaranteeing the inflation-indexed principal...|$|R

40|$|Driven by fiscal {{austerity}} and {{disenchantment with}} the performance of state-provided infrastructure services, many governments have turned to the private sector to build, operate, finance, or own infrastructure in power, gas, water, transport, and telecommunications sectors. Private capital flows to developing countries are increasing rapidly; 15 percent of infrastructure investment is now funded by private capital in emerging markets. But relative to needs, such private investment is progressing slowly. Governments are reluctant to raise consumer prices to cost-covering levels, while investors, mindful of experience, fear that governments may renege on promises to maintain adequate prices over the long haul. So investors ask for government support in the form of grants, preferential tax treatment, debt or equity contributions, or guarantees. These subsidies differ in how they allocate risk between private investors and government. Efficiency gains are greatest when private parties assume the risks that they can manage better than the public sector. When governments establish good policies [...] especially cost-covering prices and credible commitments to stick to them [...] investors are willing to invest <b>without</b> special <b>government</b> support. Privatizing assets <b>without</b> <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> or other financial support is possible, even where governments are politically unable to raise prices, because investors can achieve the returns they demand by discounting the value of the assets they are purchasing. But this is not possible for new investments (greenfield projects). If prices have been set too low and the government is not willing to raise them, it must give the investor financial support, such as guarantees and other forms of subsidy, to facilitate worthwhile projects that would not otherwise proceed. But guarantees shift costs from consumers to taxpayers, who subsidize users of infrastructure services. Much of that subsidy is hidden, since the government does not record the guarantee in its fiscal accounts. And taxpayers provide unremunerated credit insurance, as the government borrows based on its ability to tax citizens if the project fails, not on the strength of the project itself.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} visible causes for booms and busts in a small, open, financially {{developing}} economy include a fragile financial market, exchange rate shocks, and asset price volatility that often result in credit constraints. Because these shocks tend to exaggerate the credit cycles of collateral-based bank lending to the non-tradable sector, an emerging economy experiences a series of financial booms and busts. Further, the fundamental cause of credit frictions is related with market fragility and polarization of industrial bases (NT sector) that are increasingly exposed to various shocks. Shocks interact with fragility to necessitate greater stabilization efforts that often are accompanied by lingering side-effects. Credit flows cannot be dispersed widely since risk cannot be accommodated by investors <b>without</b> implicit <b>government</b> <b>guarantees.</b> The interaction of implicit bailout guarantees and lack of contract enforceability makes market intervention by the authorities a permanent feature of sizable balance sheet effects. Thus, financial market stability in an emerging market context requires extra efforts beyond the usual macro policy framework. For the purpose of securing stability, any serious effort to strengthen the market infrastructures by granting greater access to wider markets must entail rationalization of governance to boost absorptive capacity, which will ease credit constraints...|$|R
