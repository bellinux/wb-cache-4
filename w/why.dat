5|$|In 1936, SR85 was established, {{but it only}} {{extended}} as {{far north}} as Gila Bend and as far south as Ajo. By 1938, SR85 had been paved as well as the portion between Ajo and <b>Why</b> that would eventually become part of SR85. The portion between <b>Why</b> and the border with Mexico began showing up on maps at this time as a gravel road. In 1943, the portion of the highway between Ajo and <b>Why</b> was added to the state highway system, but as SR86, when it was extended west from Tucson to Ajo. In 1955, the highway was extended to Lukeville at the United States-Mexico border with an overlap with SR86 between Ajo and <b>Why</b> when a county road was added to SR85.|$|E

5|$|The {{addition}} of a multiplayer mode to Jedi Knight was met positively, but questions arose to <b>why</b> {{there are so few}} multiplayer maps and <b>why</b> single-player maps cannot be used in the multiplayer mode.

5|$|The {{occurrence}} of these closures {{and the change}} in traditions is the simplest explanation of <b>why</b> many musicians were out of work, and <b>why</b> their style of music had declined before the Buena Vista Social Club made it popular again.|$|E
5|$|There {{is general}} {{consensus}} that many factors helped trigger the Cambrian explosion, {{but there is}} no generally accepted consensus about the combination and the Cambrian explosion continues to be an area of controversy and research over <b>why</b> so rapid, <b>why</b> at the phylum level, <b>why</b> so many phyla then and none since, and even if the apparent fossil record is accurate.|$|E

5|$|As Kupfer explains, Rehm did {{not justify}} <b>why</b> he {{believed}} Urnula craterium should be allied to Geopyxis, or <b>why</b> Podophacidium terrestre {{should be considered}} an Urnula. Kupfer's macro- and microscopic analysis of tissues from these and related genera clearly showed the inconsistency in Rehm's taxonomical choices, and that Urnula craterium represented an entirely different genus not related to Geopyxis; Fries's naming was restored.|$|E
