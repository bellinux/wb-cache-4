[...] Cobain intended the album title as a joke; he stated he was [...] "tired of taking this band so seriously and everyone else taking it so seriously". [...] Novoselic convinced Cobain to change the title due to fear that it could potentially result in a lawsuit.

He faced charges of parole violations, but due to problems with the case, he was not served with the charges until 2004. His attorney argued the parole violation charges should be dropped because so much time had passed, and they were subsequently dismissed. Clemmons was granted parole on the robbery charges in 2004. He told the parole board he was [...] "not ready" [...] {{the first time he}} was released, but that he [...] "doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> in prison" [...] and will [...] "try to do the right thing".

500|$|Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was very}} {{negative}} towards the episode, saying, [...] "This episode conveys {{a strong sense}} of a writer, director and actors merely going through the motions, collecting their sizable paychecks while running out the clock on the season and series. The plot is not compelling, the agents themselves seem not to take it seriously, and the doppelgangers around whom the action revolves are little more than ciphers." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two wrote, [...] "'Fight Club' is a marker for a series that seems to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> now, please. [...] it's tonally one of the most atypical episodes the series ever made, conceived in spite and self-loathing and sheer exhaustion." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris criticized the use of Kathy Griffin and asserted, [...] "the guest cast {{is one of the worst}} ever. [...] Griffin [...] simply is not up to the task; she can not differentiate Betty and Lulu at all [...] and she reads every line as if she were still on her cancelled sitcom." [...] i09 reviewer Cyriaque Lama named [...] "The Kathy Griffin Twins" [...] the tenth [...] "Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters of the Week", and derided her performance as the Templeton twins. In 2016, in a ranking of all episodes of the series from best to worst, Vulture.com named [...] "Fight Club" [...] the worst episode of the series.|$|E
