5|$|As the {{political}} winds of the Cultural Revolution shifted, Bo and his siblings were either imprisoned or {{sent to the}} countryside, and Bo Xilai <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> up for five years. After the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, {{the members of the}} Gang of Four were officially blamed for the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, and Bo's father was released. Bo Yibo was politically rehabilitated, and, in 1979, became vice premier.|$|E
5|$|She's so soft. She's {{beautiful}} too. I {{always tell}} her this story: When I <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> up in jail, that song 'Vision of Love' was the hottest {{song in the}} world. I used to always say, 'Man, if I could meet her!' So I worked with her, then Pharrell hooked it up for me {{to work with her}} again this time.|$|E
5|$|All clues lead F.E.A.R. {{to believe}} Fettel is being {{controlled}} by Alma, who <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> in the Origin facility when ATC closed down the project {{owing to the}} danger the woman posed; Fettel is searching for that same facility to free his mother. The player takes the Point Man to the abandoned structure, fighting back both the clone soldiers and ATC guards, who have received orders {{to cover up the}} whole affair. When the protagonist comes to finally face Fettel, he is drawn into a hallucination where the player learns how the Point Man is Alma's first son and is thereafter enabled to kill Fettel himself.|$|E

Finally, B > A and C > A <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> in. Hence, the full ranking is B > C > A > D. Thus, B is elected Ranked pairs winner.|$|R
5|$|Australia {{proceeded}} to the 1953 Ashes tour. During a stopover at Naples, Miller <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> inside after entering a private opera rehearsal without authorisation, {{but managed to}} escape and rejoin the boat as {{it was about to}} leave. During his career, several cricket books were published under Miller's name, and he was embroiled in further controversy when one ghost-written tome, which was printed as the team left for England, criticised his captain Hassett as being too cautious.|$|E
5|$|Carney {{arrived as}} U.S. Ambassador to Haiti on January 14, 1998. At {{the time of}} his appointment, Haiti was in {{political}} turmoil: former president, Jean-Bertrande Aristide, <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> in a battle to retake power in the election of 2000. Upon arrival in Haiti, Carney laid out U.S. concerns—lack of governance, lack of economic sustainability programs and an inability to prevent narco-trafficking through Haiti as the first port of call by the Cali drug cartels from Colombia.|$|E
5|$|Following Juventus's {{return to}} Serie A, Del Piero <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> in months of fractious {{negotiations}} over {{the signing of}} a new contract with Juventus' new management. After successfully negotiating a new contract till 30 June 2010, he was greeted with news {{of the birth of}} his first child, Tobias Del Piero. This was quite a staggering turnaround in his fortunes, as only two weeks earlier, he was dropped by Claudio Ranieri for the Serie A match with Fiorentina, and was then axed from Roberto Donadoni's Italy squad for the games with Georgia and South Africa.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lock</b> files <b>are</b> often named with a tilde (...) prefixed to {{the name}} of the file they <b>are</b> <b>locking.</b> If they <b>are</b> <b>locking</b> a {{resource}} other than a file, they may be named more arbitrarily.|$|R
50|$|XKB {{allows a}} {{modifier}} to <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> or latched, other than being in its regular state. Normally, a modifier is active exactly {{when it is}} pressed, like the Shift. However, a modifier may also <b>be</b> <b>locked,</b> like the Caps Lock modifier. When a modifier <b>is</b> <b>locked,</b> it remains active until it is explicitly deactivated. An intermediate condition between regular and <b>locked</b> <b>is</b> the latched state: When a modifier is latched, it remains active, but only until the next non-modifier key is pressed.|$|R

5|$|In Legacy of the Void, it is {{revealed}} that before Fenix's defeat at Antioch in StarCraft, his personality was cloned and inserted into an experimental mechanical body of ancient Purifiers. This body <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> inside a stasis vault on planet Glacius. Artanis obtained Fenix {{and with his}} help {{he was able to}} gain the Purifiers as allies against Amon. During the campaign he concludes that despite having Fenix's memories, he was a different being. Because of this he changed his name to Talandar.|$|E
5|$|Since Smyth {{still had}} his {{commitments}} at Princeton and Chicago, he could only work on the report part-time. He wrote the report {{in his office in}} Princeton's Palmer Laboratory. Bars were installed on the windows of Smyth's office and the one adjacent to it. The hallway door to his office <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> and blocked by a large safe so that the only access was through the adjacent office, where there was an armed guard. The guards worked in eight-hour shifts, and one was present around the clock. When Smyth sent papers to Groves in Washington, D.C., they went by military courier.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match on}} the card was the main event, which saw The Undertaker face off against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) in a Handicap match. Per the pre-match stipulation, Paul Bearer would be {{cemented}} in a glass crypt if Undertaker lost. Throughout {{the duration of the}} match, Bearer <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> on a chair inside a glass crypt with the pump of cement truck above him. After a match evenly controlled by The Undertaker and The Dudleys, Undertaker pinned D-Von following a Tombstone Piledriver to win. After the match, Undertaker pulled the lever to the cement truck, which in turn filled the crypt with Bearer inside full of cement.|$|E

5|$|After reading The Last Tycoon, Zelda {{began working}} on a new novel of her own, Caesar's Things. As she had missed Scott's funeral, so she missed Scottie's wedding. By August 1943 she had {{returned}} to the Highland Hospital. She worked on her novel while checking {{in and out of the}} hospital. She did not get better, nor did she finish the novel. On the night of March 10, 1948, a fire broke out in the hospital kitchen. Zelda <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> into a room, awaiting electroshock therapy. The fire moved through the dumbwaiter shaft, spreading onto every floor. The fire escapes were wooden, and they caught fire as well. Nine women, including Zelda, died.|$|E
5|$|After the {{partition}} Rejtan withdrew from political life. He never married. He {{spent the rest}} of his days in a small estate at Hruszówka, where he died on August 8, 1780. His mental health had deteriorated; according to some due to distress with the loss of a part of his homeland, but rumours about his erratic behavior date to soon after the Partition Sejm begun in 1773, before its final motions were passed in 1776. He {{is said to have been}} escorted by his brothers from Warsaw on 19 March 1775 after he had a fit, and <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> in a small family's mansion which he would never leave up till his death. Eventually he committed suicide, cutting himself with glass (most detailed accounts say he swallowed it, to prevent being taken by pursuing Russian soldiers). His exact place of burial is unknown, and exhumation in Hruszówka in 1930 failed to conclusively find his grave.|$|E
5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door <b>was</b> <b>locked.</b> He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E

5|$|Charles advised {{his brother}} of the French Directory's offer, but it was flatly refused by the Emperor and the {{civilian}} military advisers on the Aulic Council. Charles was instructed to lay siege to the fortresses, to take them, and secure any possible French access to southern Germany via the Rhine. The Aulic Council still believed Austrian forces could relieve Mantua. Consequently, by tying Charles down at the Rhine, besieging the highly defensible Vauban fortresses at the river at Kehl and Hüningen, the Council effectively sealed the fate of Wurmser's troops in Mantua. After {{it became clear that}} Charles <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> into place on the Rhine, Moreau moved 14 demi-brigades to Italy, leaving behind modest forces on the French border. Two Austrian columns sent from Vienna failed to reach their beleaguered counterparts in Mantua, which fell on 2 February 1797.|$|E
5|$|In November, Silahdar Yusuf Pasha {{left behind}} a strong {{garrison}} and returned to Constantinople for the winter. There however, he fell foul of the Sultan and was executed. Nevertheless, Ottoman preparations continued in order to renew and expand the war, while the Venetians were frantically trying to raise money and men, and attempting to induce other European powers to join them against the Ottomans. However, as most of Europe <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> into the fierce antagonisms of the Thirty Years' War, their pleas fell mostly on deaf ears. The Venetians were hard pressed by the financial demands of the war: besides placing taxes on the Italian mainland possessions (the Terraferma), they resorted to the sale of nobility titles and state offices to fill their war coffer. To lead the effort against the Ottomans, the Senate initially appointed the 80-year-old doge Francesco Erizzo, but {{after his death in}} early 1646, he was replaced by the 73-year old Giovanni Cappello as Captain General of the Sea.|$|E
5|$|Koufax had {{his strong}} season despite an injured {{pitching}} hand. While batting in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from Earl Francis. A numbness developed in Koufax's index finger {{on his left}} hand, and the finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching better than ever, however, so he ignored the problem, hoping that the condition would clear up. By July, though, his entire hand was becoming numb and {{he was unable to}} complete some games. In a start in Cincinnati, his finger split open after one inning. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery. Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> in a tight pennant race with the Giants. But after the long layoff, Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers {{at the end of the}} regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.|$|E

30|$|The IR laser can <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the high-finesse IR cavity {{by using}} {{standard}} Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) locking techniques [83, 84]. Since the other optical modes for intra-cavity cooling in the high-finesse IR cavity are derived via EOMs and AOMs from the fundamental laser mode (see Section  7.2. 3), they also follow any {{changes of the}} cavity resonance frequency. In addition, these higher-order modes can in turn <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the cavity via PDH locking. We will also use an EOM to generate a mode to <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the IR + UV cavity. To this end, each of the modes to <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the cavities will separately be frequency modulated in the MHz range {{to allow for the}} generation of distinct PDH error signals from the light reflected from the cavity.|$|R
5|$|Ottawa <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> in a {{contract}} dispute with then-captain Alexei Yashin during the 1999–2000 season. Yashin {{held out for}} the entire season, hoping either to play elsewhere or claim his contract was for 1999–2000, not a year of service. The team responded by suspending him for the entire season and granting the captaincy to Daniel Alfredsson. Yashin tried to sign on with a team in Switzerland, but the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) banned him from playing internationally until the dispute with the Senators was resolved. An NHL arbitrator rejected Yashin's request {{to make him a}} free agent, instead ruling that he owed the Senators one more season if he ever returned to the NHL. The Senators even took legal action to recover damages suffered {{as a result of the}} dispute.|$|E
5|$|Serb forces {{singled out}} a number of {{prominent}} individuals. Among them was Dr. Vesna Bosanac, the director of the town's hospital, who was regarded as a heroine in Croatia but demonised by the Serbian media. She and her husband were taken to Sremska Mitrovica prison, where she <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> up in a single room with 66 other women for several weeks. Her husband was subjected to repeated beatings. After appeals from the International Committee of the Red Cross, the couple were eventually released in a prisoner exchange. Croatian Radio journalist Siniša Glavašević, whose broadcasts had become iconic in Croatia, was taken to Ovčara, severely beaten and shot along with the other victims of the massacre.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 NHL season <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> out, and {{eventually}} cancelled, {{because of a}} labour dispute between the league and the players.

Three months later, Sweden defeated the Czech Republic and won the 2006 World Championships. They became the first team to win Olympic gold and a separate World Championship tournament in the same year. At the 2007 World Championship in Moscow, Canada defeated Finland to win the gold medal. The following year, the tournament was held in Canada for the first time. Russia defeated the home team to win their first gold medal since 1993. The Russian team successfully defended their title with a 2–1 win over Canada in 2009.|$|E
