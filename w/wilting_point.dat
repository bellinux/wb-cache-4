To conserve water, a vine will try to conserve water by limiting its loss through transpiration. The plant hormone abscisic acid triggers the stomata {{on the underside of}} the plant leaf to stay close in order to reduce the amount of water that is evaporated. While conserving water this also has the consequences of limiting the intake of carbon dioxide needed to sustain photosynthesis. If the vine is continually stressed it will keeps it stomata closed for longer and longer periods of time which can eventually cause photosynthesis to stop all together. When a vine has been so deprived of water it can exceed what is known as its permanent <b>wilting</b> <b>point.</b> At this point, the vine can become permanently damaged beyond recovery even if later watered.

40|$|Geomorphic {{reclamation}} is {{a relatively}} new technique in which landforms are built to be similar to those that eventually form in nature given the particular conditions of a location, making them self-sustaining and functional. The near surface water balance will have a large impact on the establishment and health of vegetation which in turn is important for maintaining a stable landform. This study developed a one-dimensional water balance model for a geomorphically reclaimed site and used the model to investigate seed germination and plant survival for a range of slope aspects and climate conditions. Disturbed and undisturbed samples of reclaimed soil were collected for laboratory tests from the mine site located in northwest New Mexico. Saturated and unsaturated hydraulic properties were determined from falling head tests, hanging column tests, pressure plate tests, and dew point potentiometer measurements. In addition, hydraulic properties were estimated from field tension infiltrometer tests. Laboratory and field tests accounted for the variable soil density in the near surface. Periodic soil moisture measurements at the reclaimed site were made from August 2012 to March 2014. Simulated and measured water contents were compared by statistical analyses to validate the numerical model, and indicated that a reasonable comparison was attained between predicted and observed soil water contents. The water balance simulations revealed {{that it is necessary to}} consider near surface variability in soil hydraulic properties to produce reasonable predictions of soil moisture. The numerical model was then used to predict soil water potential and temperature for different climates (one wet year and one dry year) and aspect conditions. A population based hydrothermal time model was used to predict the seed response to environmental condition available at soil surface. Germination potential of a native plant bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), and an invasive species cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) was determined in terms of cumulative progress towards germination (PTG). Survivability of existing plant blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis) and cheatgrass was also predicted by comparing soil water potential at different depths with the <b>wilting</b> <b>points</b> of the respective plants. The results show that establishment of vegetation in geomorphically reclaimed soil is dependent on climate and aspect conditions. The study of germination potential indicates that for a range of climates studied, cheatgrass has higher germination potential than bottlebrush squirreltail. Germination potential and survivability is greater on the northern aspect than the southern aspect. Wet conditions provide favorable conditions for germination and survival for all species. Potential for invasion by cheatgrass is greater on the northern aspect in dry climate conditions when bottlebrush squirreltail is seeded on reclaimed soil. This study reveals that the method of placement of soil and watershed design followed in geomorphic reclamation provide favorable environment for vegetation during the wet climate conditions. The dependence of plant germination and survivability on climate and aspect in this study suggest that geomorphic reclamation - which results in numerous small watersheds with slopes with varying aspects - may result in a healthier overall ecosystem compared to the larger, more uniform aspects associated with traditional reclamation. Comparing the predictions of seed germination and plant survival with long term field measurements and observation of vegetation cover is suggested to validate the approach described in this study.

40|$|Crown gall tumors {{induced by}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens {{represent}} a sink {{that has to}} be provided with nutrients and water by the host plant. The lack of an intact epidermis or cuticle results in uncontrolled loss of water. However, neither the tumor nor the host plant displays <b>wilting.</b> This phenomenon <b>points</b> to drought adaptation in both tumors and the crown gall host plant. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of protection against desiccation the gene expression pattern of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) tumors was integrated with the profile of stress metabolites: Arabidopsis tumors accumulated high amounts of abscisic acid (ABA), the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropyl carboxylic acid, osmoprotectants, and form a suberized periderm-like protective layer. Suberization of the outer tumor cell layers most likely is mediated by ABA since external application of ABA induced suberization of Arabidopsis roots. However, the expression level of the classical marker genes, known to respond to drought stress and/or ABA, was lower in tumors. Instead another set of drought and/or ABA-inducible genes was more highly transcribed. Elevated transcription of several ABA-dependent aquaporin genes might indicate that ABA controls the water balance of the tumor. The retarded tumor growth on abi and aba mutant plants underlined the importance of a tumor-specific ABA signaling pathway. Taken together, we propose that ABA is an important signal for protection of tumors against desiccation and thus supports tumor development...|$|R
500|$|In 1957, 23 teams {{played for}} the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. The Midwest {{regional}} tourney was held in Dallas, Texas, {{which at the time}} was segregated.

We were spat on, pelted with debris, and subjected to the vilest racial epithets possible." [...] KU won 73–65 in overtime, after which police had to escort the Jayhawks out. The next game against Oklahoma City was equally unpleasant, with KU winning 81–61 under intense racist abuse. In the semi-finals, Chamberlain's Jayhawks handily defeated the two time defending national champion San Francisco, 80–56, with <b>Wilt</b> scoring 32 <b>points,</b> grabbing 11 rebounds, and having at least seven blocked shots. (Game film is unclear whether an 8th block occurred, or the ball just fell short due to Chamberlain's withering defensive intimidation). Chamberlain demonstrated his growing arsenal of offensive moves, including jump shots, put-backs, tip-ins, and his turnaround jump shot. He was far more comfortable and effective at the foul line than he would later be during his pro career. He had outstanding foot speed throughout the game, and several times led the fast break, including blocking a shot near the basket and then outracing the field for a layup. His stellar performance led Kansas to an insurmountable lead, and he rested on the bench for the final 3:45 remaining in the game.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{important}} element of his work was {{in the field of}} soil-water-plant relations, and led to the standardisation of characteristic soil-water properties. Together with scientists at the USDA Salinity Laboratory in Riverside, Richards correlated water content at certain water potential values with then current soil water parameters. The currently accepted moisture potential values defining the lower and upper limits for plant growth; at field capacity (−1/3 bar, or −33 J/kg) and permanent <b>wilting</b> <b>point</b> (−15 bar, or −1500 J/kg) were determined through experimental work by Richards and his colleagues.|$|E
5000|$|The general {{features}} of a water retention curve {{can be seen in}} the figure, in which the volume water content, θ, is plotted against the matric potential, [...] At potentials close to zero, a soil is close to saturation, and water is held in the soil primarily by capillary forces.

In retrospect, Eddie Gottlieb remarked: [...] "My mistake was not getting a strong-handed coach.... wasn't ready for big time." [...] In Chamberlain's third season, the Warriors were coached by Frank McGuire, the coach who had masterminded Chamberlain's painful NCAA loss against the Tar Heels.

Chamberlain once again broke the 2,000-rebound barrier with 2,052. Additionally, {{he was on the}} hardwood for an average of 48.53 minutes, playing 3,882 of his team's 3,890 minutes. Because Chamberlain played in overtime games, he averaged more minutes per game than the regulation 48; in fact, Chamberlain would have reached the 3,890-minute mark if he had not been ejected in one game after picking up a second technical foul with eight minutes left to play.|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{diversity}} {{in relation to}} Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance was investigated among 295 European winter wheat cultivars and advanced breeding lines using 47 wheat SSR markers. Twelve additional wheat lines with known FHB resistance were included as reference material. At least one SSR marker per chromosome arm, including SSR markers {{reported in the literature}} with putative associations with QTLs for FHB resistance, were assayed to give an even distribution of SSR markers across the wheat genome. A total of 404 SSR alleles were detected. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 21, with an average of 8. 6 alleles. The polymorphism information content of the SSR markers ranged from 0. 13 (Xwmc 483) to 0. 87 (Xwmc 607), with an average of 0. 54. Cluster analysis was performed by both genetic distance-based and model-based methods. In general, the dendrogram based on unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages showed similar groupings to the model-based analysis. Seven clusters were identified by the model-based method, which did not strictly correspond to geographical origin. The FHB resistance level of the wheat lines was evaluated in field trials conducted over multiple years or locations by assessing the following traits: % FHB severity, % FHB incidence, % diseased kernels, in spray inoculation trials, and % FHB spread and % <b>wilted</b> tips, in <b>point</b> inoculation trials. Association analysis between SSR markers and the FHB disease traits detected markers significantly associated with FHB resistance, including some that have not been previously reported. The percentage of variance explained by each individual marker was, however, rather low. Haplotype analysis revealed that the FHB-resistant European wheat lines do not contain the 3 BS locus derived from Sumai 3.

40|$|A great {{attribute}} of almost modern, liveable city {{is the presence}} of trees. Homeowners enjoy gardens with shrubs and trees which can improve real estate value, shade, and energy efficiency. Street trees are provided by local government authorities to improve the landscape, enhance the environment and to increase land values. Trees, however, can also cause problems if they become too large for the streetscape. They obstruct light, lose branches in storms and uplift pavements. More importantly, trees can cause damage to lightly loaded structures such as pavement and residential buildings. Trees use soil moisture for transpiration, the loss of water from the leaves generate a negative potential or suction on the leaves, which provides the pulling power to drive water from the soil to the leaves through the root and xylem. During the dry season, when evaporation rates are high, the tree roots must extend more deeply for finding water. This can cause greater ground movements in the dry season than would be expected without the presence of trees. Trees near to a residential building, especially Australian native species can extract large quantities of moisture from soils and lead to localized settlement. If the shrinkage settlement is significant, the buildings may deflect significantly which can result in structural damage. In Australia, distortions of pavements and dwellings caused by trees are widely reported, particularly in areas of expansive soil. Current engineering guidelines given in Australian Standard AS 2870 (2011) are not based on adequate field research and measurement. Consequently, attempts to design footings to resist the additional ground movement due to trees are often flawed owing to poor understanding of the water demands of various tree species, <b>wilting</b> <b>points</b> and potential root development. This study is part of a long-term and comprehensive research programme aimed at minimising the risk of planting trees on clay soils in an urban environment. It involves field monitoring, laboratory testing, numerical simulation and case studies. In order to collect high-quality field data and develop an improved understanding of the physical processes that drive tree root-expansive soil interaction, a field site was established in 2011 in Glenroy, a northern suburb of Melbourne. This site was selected because it is a highly reactive site with basaltic clay in an urban environment. A 2. 4 m high Eucalyptus ficifiolia and a 2 m high Meyer Lemon tree were planted on the site. Eucalyptus ficifiolia was chosen for this study because it is widely used as a street tree while the Meyer Lemon tree {{is one of the most}} popular citrus trees for home gardens. The instrumentation installed at the site includes: (a) automatic weather station; (b) HRM sap flow meters; (c) neutron moisture probe (soil moisture contents); (d) surface and sub-surface movement probes; (e) soil moisture sensors. Daily transpiration of the trees, in-situ soil moisture variations, ground movements, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind direction and velocity and rainfall have been closely monitored since May 2011. Field monitoring over a period of 5. 5 years reveals that the presence of the tree resulted in an increase in the depth of soil moisture (suction) variation and a larger shrinking settlement of the ground. The changes in soil moisture and the associated soil movements were recorded mainly in the upper 2. 0 m of the soil profile as the tree is still young. The experience gained to date from the field monitoring has shown that a sap flow meter is a reliable tool for measuring transpiration rate and water uptake by tree. The measured transpiration rate of the tree increases as the tree grows. The transpiration rate recorded in dry seasons is significantly higher than in wet seasons. A comprehensive laboratory investigation was also performed to complement the field data, which include (a) soil shrink-swell tests, (b) permeability tests, (c) soil suction measurements, (d) triaxial tests, (e) shear box tests and (f) suction-controlled oedometer tests (soil water characteristic curve, SWCC). The outcome of the field and laboratory investigation led to the publication of a comprehensive data set that not only benefits practitioners but also researchers as it can be used to evaluate the numerical models. As well as the field and laboratory work, a numerical model for tree root-soil interaction analysis has been developed to study the influence of tree root drying on the behaviour of unsaturated soil. A three-dimensional finite element approach based on ABAQUS has been employed to back-analysis the field experiment at the Glenroy site. The predicted results calculated using the soil, tree and atmospheric parameters obtained from the laboratory tests and field measurement, compared favourably with the field measurements. In addition to the field monitoring and numerical modelling, a case study of a cracked residential house in a southwest suburb of Melbourne was carried out. During the field investigation, daily transpiration and water uptake of a large street tree, located about 7 m from the northwest corner of the property, was monitored using two sap flow meters. The soil suction, shrink-swell indices and SWCC were measured. A numerical analysis was also conducted to estimate the soil suction distribution and soil movement under influence of large Eucalypt tree. The case study revealed the major cause of house distortion could be attributed to tree root drying, which resulted in non-uniform soil moisture conditions and significant footing settlement at the northwest corner. It has clearly shown that trees, growing in close proximity to a house could cause more severe damage to the buildings than the expected moisture changes due to seasonal influences and re-distribution of soil moisture arising from construction on the site. This research project has been unique in that it has incorporated and integrated a range of disciplines such as plant science, tree physiology, geotechnical and structural engineering. It includes the field monitoring, laboratory tests, numerical modelling and case study. The outcomes of this study have added valuable information to the body of knowledge in geotechnical and environmental engineering, therefore contributing to a higher level of understanding of the behaviour of unsaturated soil, daily transpiration and water uptake of trees, physical processes of the root-soil interaction and the impact of tree on residential footings...|$|R

60|$|And {{what then}} do you see? Spread far below you, and {{basking in the}} sunshine, a {{comparatively}} flat and wide, open valley; olive and stone pine and mulberry on its slopes; pasture land and flowery vale in its midst. North and south, in two long ridges, the Apennines stretch their hard, blue outlines from Carrara to Siena against the afternoon sky--outlines of a sort that one never gets in northern lands, but which remind one so exactly of the painted background to a fifteenth-century Italian picture that nature seems here, to our topsy-turvy fancy, to be whimsically imitating an effect from art. But in between those two tossed and tumbled guardian ridges, {{the valley of the}} Arno, as it flows towards Pisa, with the minor basins of its tributary streams, expands for a while about Florence itself into a broad and comparatively level plain. In a mountain country so broken and heaved about as Peninsular Italy, every spare inch of cultivable plain like that has incalculable value. True, on the terraced slopes of the hillsides generation after generation of ingenious men have managed to build up, tier by tier, a wonderful expanse of artificial tilth. But while oil and wine can be produced upon the terraces, it is on the river valleys alone that the early inhabitants had to depend for their corn, their cheese, and their flesh-meat. Hence, in primitive Italy and in primitive England alike, every such open alluvial plain, fit for tilth or grazing, had overhanging it a stockaded hill-fort, which grew with time into a mediæval town or a walled city.

Zum einen sind sie direkt am onkogenen Prozess beteiligt, indem sie die Proliferation von transformierten Zellen fördern und physiologische Anpassungen im entstehenden Tumor steuern. Auf der anderen Seite vermitteln Phytohormone aber auch Abwehrreaktionen der Pflanze als Folge eines Befalls mit onkogenen Pathogenen. Um diese verschiedenen Wirkungen der Phytohormone während der Tumorgenese besser zu verstehen, wurde die Genexpression durch Microarrays zu unterschiedlichen Zeitpunken dieses Prozesses an der Modellpflanze Arabidopsis thaliana charakterisiert und die Rolle ausgewählter Phytohormone, wie Abscisinsäure, Salizylsäure, Jasmonsäure, Ethylen und H 2 O 2 durch Mutanten in entsprechenden Signalwegen funktionell untersucht. Die Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit deuten darauf hin, dass die bekannten Pathogenabwehrwege bei Befall durch onkogene Agrobacterien mit einer zeitlichen Verzögerung aktiviert werden. Diese Verzögerung wird wahrscheinlich durch das vom Bakterium abgegebene Auxin reguliert, und somit könnte dieses Auxin die Integration der T-DNA indirekt fördern. Sind die pflanzlichen Abwehrmechanismen jedoch vor dem Transformationsprozess aktiviert, wie z. B. in cpr 5 –Mutanten, kann die T-DNA nicht integrieren und es entsteht kein Tumor. Beim Wildtyp akkumulieren in Folge der T-DNA Integration mit Pathogenabwehr assoziierte Signalmoleküle, wie H 2 O 2, Ethylen und Salizylsäure, nicht aber Jasmonsäure. Die Analyse des Tumorwachstums an Mutanten mit unterschiedlichen Defekten in diesen Signalwegen zeigte jedoch, daß Ethylen und Salizylsäure keinen Einfluß auf das Tumorwachstum haben. Vielmehr regulieren Ethylen und H 2 O 2 morphologische Anpassungen und Adaptationen an Trockenstress in Tumoren. Die von Agrobacterium tumefaciens induzierten Tumore beziehen außer Nährstoffe, vor allem Wasser von der Wirtspflanze. Das Fehlen einer intakten Epidermis oder Kutikula führt allerdings zu unkontrolliertem Wasserverlust. Da aber weder der Tumor noch die Pflanze welken, muss eine Trockenstressadaptation stattzufinden. In dieser Arbeit konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Phytohormone Abscisinsäure (ABA) und Ethylen an diesem Prozess beteiligt sind. Zum einen regulieren sie die Akkumulation von Osmoregulatoren, sowie Suberineinlagerungen in den äußeren Zellschichten des Tumors, wodurch eine dem Periderm ähnliche Schutzschicht entsteht. Diese Suberinisierung wird im Tumor wahrschein-lich von ABA induziert, wie Experimente an Arabidopsis Wurzeln belegten. Die Microarray-Analysen ergaben, dass im Tumor ein spezielles Muster an ABA- und Trockenstress-induzierten Markergene exprimiert wird, sowie einigen Aquaporinen, die den erhöhten Wasserbedarf des Tumors regulieren könnten. Das verminderte Tumorwachstum an abi- and aba-Mutanten belegt die Bedeutung von ABA-Signalen für die Homeostase des Wasser-haushalts im Tumor. Phytohormones are {{important}} signaling molecules involved in Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated tumor development. On the one hand, they are {{directly involved in}} the infection process by supporting proliferation of transformed plant cells and mediating physiological adaptations of the developing tumor. On the other hand, phytohormones also mediate defense responses of the host plant upon bacterial infection. In order to get further insight into these supplementary roles of phytohormones during tumor development, microarray techniques have been used to analyze changes in gene expression of Arabidosis thaliana upon infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens at distinct time points during tumor development. The functional relevance of selected phytohormones, e. g. abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, ethylene and H 2 O 2 was analyzed by the use of Arabidopsis mutants with defects in the respective signaling pathways. This work suggests a delayed activation of the well known defence response pathways to take place upon infection by agrobacteria. This delay is most likely mediated by auxin, which is synthesized and secreted by the bacteria. Hence, auxin indirectly promotes T-DNA integration by causing delay of the plant´s defence responses. However, if pathogen defence is active before agrobacterial infection, e. g. in cpr 5 mutant plants, T-DNA integration is prevented and tumor growth cannot be observed. Signaling molecules associated with defence responses, e. g. H 2 O 2, ethylene and salicylic acid, but not jasmonic acid accumulate due to T-DNA integration in wild type plants. However, Arabidopsis mutants with defects along the ethylene or salicylic acid signalling pathways revealed wild type like tumor development neglecting their involvement in tumor associated defence responses. Rather, this work supports the hypothesis that ethylene and H 2 O 2 are involved in regulating tumor morphology and drought stress adaptations. Crown gall tumours induced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens represent a sink that is provided with nutrients and water by the host plant. The lack of an intact epidermis or cuticle results in uncontrolled loss of water. However, neither the tumor nor the host plant display <b>wilting.</b> This phenomenon <b>points</b> to drought stress adaptations in both, tumours and the host plant. In order to understand the protecting molecular mechanisms against desiccation, the gene expression pattern of Arabidopsis thaliana tumors was compared with the profile of stress metabolites: Arabidopsis tumors accumulated high amounts of ABA, the ethylene precursor ACC, osmoprotectants and form a suberized periderm-like layer. Suberization of the outer tumor cell layers most likely is mediated by ABA since external application of ABA induced suberization of Arabidopsis roots. However, the expression level of the classical marker genes, known to respond to drought stress and/or ABA, was lower in tumors. Instead another set of drought and/or ABA-inducible genes, was higher transcribed. Elevated transcription of several ABA-dependent aquaporin genes might indicate that ABA controls the water balance of the tumor. The retarded tumor growth on abi and aba mutant plants underlined the importance of a tumor-specific ABA signaling pathway. Taken together, we propose that ABA is an important signal for protection of tumors against desiccation and thus supports tumor development...|$|R
50|$|Plinthite is a redoximorphic {{feature in}} highly {{weathered}} soil. The product of pedogenesis, it commonly occurs as dark red redox concretions that usually form platy, polygonal, or reticulate patterns. Plinthite changes irreversibly to an ironstone hardpan or to irregular soil aggregates on exposure to repeated wetting and drying, {{especially if it}} is also exposed to heat from the sun. The lower boundary of a zone in which plinthite occurs generally is diffuse or gradual, {{but it may be}} abrupt at a lithologic discontinuity. Generally, plinthite forms in a soil horizon that is saturated with water for some time during the year. Initially, iron is normally segregated in the form of soft, more or less clayey, red or dark red redox concretions. These concretions are not considered plinthite unless there has been enough segregation of iron to permit their irreversible hardening on exposure to repeated wetting and drying. Plinthite is firm or very firm when the soil moisture content is near field capacity and hard when the moisture content is below the permanent <b>wilting</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
