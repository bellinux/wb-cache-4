Had the Giants knelt on the {{subsequent}} play, there still would have been one second left on the game clock once the play clock ran down, requiring a fourth-down play to be run (the play clock at the time ran for 30 seconds; it now runs for 40).|$|E
25|$|Olsen {{introduced}} the Legislative Transparency Act during the 2012 Legislative Session {{which would have}} required potential legislation to be reviewable online for public viewing at least 72 hours prior to being voted on. Olsen's bill <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> the popular practice utilized by Assembly and Senate Democrats where legislation is introduced and passed simultaneously thus nullifying the normal vetting and public review process. This process has been utilized to pass bills with wide ranging and substantial policy effects in recent years.

25|$|Richberg's {{later life}} {{was marked by}} {{increasing}} conservatism and anti-labor attitudes, the practice of law, and writing. He attempted in 1936 to establish his own law firm in Washington, D.C., but this failed. He joined an existing firm, which took the name Davies, Richberg, Beebe, Busick & Richardson. He was frequently consulted by members of Congress for his expertise in drafting legislation, and {{played a major role}} in authoring the Taft-Hartley Act. In 1956, he helped author a bill introduced into the Virginia General Assembly which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> school desegregation.

25|$|After Wei Zheng's {{death in}} 643, the emperor commented {{that he was}} a mirror to show the {{mistakes}} of the court, and built an elaborate tomb for him near his own imperial tomb and betrothed one of his daughters, Princess Hengshan, to Wei Shuyu (魏叔玉), Wei Zheng's son. Subsequently, as a result of false accusations made by others in the court, the stone monument that Emperor Taizong had built for Wei Zheng was destroyed, and Emperor Taizong cancelled the planned marriage between Princess Hengshan and Wei Shuyu. However, after the failure of the campaign against Goguryeo in 646, Emperor Taizong, believing that Wei Zheng <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> him from going on the campaign had he lived longer, restored the stone monument. Wei Zheng's effect and influence has been examined by many historians long after his death. Wei Zheng is also revered as a minor god of doorways in parts of Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|An 1836 scheme envisaged {{a railway}} between Nottingham and Boston which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> at Sleaford, but the plans {{never left the}} drawing board. Another attempt, the Eastern Counties scheme, unsuccessfully tried to build a railway between Lincoln and Cambridge, with a branch to Boston via Heckington and an {{extension}} to Sleaford. After protests from the Navigation company, the necessary Bill never passed. In 1845, the Ambergate Company designed a railway from Ambergate to Nottingham, with branches to Boston, Spalding, Grantham and Sleaford. A Bill to that effect passed through the Houses of Parliament in 1846, but the railway only reached Grantham. In the meantime, the more ambitious Great Northern Railway from London to York was also endorsed by an Act of Parliament; it passed through Grantham and a loop line from Boston to Lincoln was operating by 1848, yet its planned extension between Boston and Sleaford was not sanctioned.|$|E
25|$|On October 25, 2016, four people—two men aged 35 and 38, and {{two women}} aged 32 and 42—were killed when the raft they were riding hit another stopped raft, causing it to flip. Eyewitness {{accounts}} noted that the water level in the channel had dropped prior to the incident, but the drop did not trigger a sensor that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> the ride. Investigators believe that the occupied raft was pushed up onto a stopped raft by a conveyor belt, at first mounting the stopped raft then flipping over. Of the six passengers aboard the raft, two children—aged 10 and 12—were ejected from the raft but survived, while {{the two men were}} believed to be crushed under the raft and the two women were trapped underneath the conveyor belt. Dreamworld officials stated that the ride had just passed its annual inspection in September.

25|$|Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini had {{imperial}} ambitions in Abyssinia. Italy {{was already}} in possession of neighboring Eritrea and Somalia. In December 1934 there was a clash between Italian and Abyssinian troops at Walwal, near the border between British and Italian Somaliland, in which Italian troops took possession of the disputed territory and in which 150 Abyssinians and 50 Italians were killed. When Italy demanded apologies and compensation from Abyssinia, Abyssinia appealed to the League, Emperor Haile Selassie famously appealing in person to the assembly in Geneva. The League persuaded both sides to seek a settlement under the Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1928 but Italy continued troop movements and Abyssinia appealed to the League again. In October 1935 Mussolini launched an attack on Abyssinia. The League declared Italy to be the aggressor and imposed sanctions, but coal and oil were not included; blocking these, it was thought, would provoke war. Albania, Austria and Hungary refused to apply sanctions; Germany and the United States {{were not in the}} League. Nevertheless, the Italian economy suffered. The League considered closing off the Suez Canal also, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> arms to Abyssinia, but, thinking it would be too harsh a measure, they did not do so.|$|E

500|$|Davison was {{a staunch}} feminist and a passionate Christian whose outlook [...] "invoked both medieval history {{and faith in}} God {{as part of the}} armor of her militancy". Her love of English literature, which she had studied at Oxford, was shown in her {{identification}} with Geoffrey Chaucer's The Knight's Tale, including being nicknamed [...] "Faire Emelye". Much of Davison's writing reflected the doctrine of the Christian faith and referred to martyrs, martyrdom and triumphant suffering; according to Collette, the use of Christian and medieval language and imagery [...] "directly reflects the politics and rhetoric of the militant suffrage movement". Purvis writes that Davison's committed Anglicanism <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> her from committing suicide because it would have meant that she could not be buried in consecrated ground.

500|$|Al Jean, showrunner since season thirteen, {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} criticism, with some arguing that the show has {{continued}} to decline in quality under his tenure.

500|$|Jean {{continued}} as showrunner after the movie. Critics {{have argued that}} the quality of the show has declined in Jean's tenure.

Club argues in an online debate over this issue that [...] "The Simpsons has come to rely too much on wacky Homer shtick and tired, meaningless guest stars" [...] and that the writers are [...] "content to amuse themselves with in-jokes, non sequiturs, and self-consciously silly plot twists." [...] Jean responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined.

500|$|Ward's role {{on behalf}} of MI5 was {{confirmed}} in 1982, when the Sunday Times located his former contact [...] "Woods". Although Denning always asserted that Ward's trial and conviction were fair and proper, most commentators {{believe that it was}} deeply flawed—an [...] "historical injustice" [...] according to Davenport-Hines, who argues that the trial was an act of political revenge. One High Court judge said privately that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> the trial before it reached the jury. The human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson has campaigned for the case to be reopened on several grounds, including the premature scheduling of the trial, lack of evidence to support the main charges, and various misdirections by the trial judge in his summing up. Above all, the judge failed to advise the jury of the evidence revealed in the Gordon appeal that Keeler, the prosecution's chief witness against Ward, had committed perjury at the Gordon trial. In January 2014 Ward's case was being considered by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which has the power to investigate suspected miscarriages of justice and refer cases to the Court of Appeal.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{returned}} full-time to The Simpsons {{during the}} tenth season (1998). He once again became show runner with {{the start of}} the thirteenth season in 2001, this time without Reiss. Jean called it [...] "a great job with a lot of responsibility," [...] and cited [...] "the fact that people love it so much" [...] as [...] "great." [...] He adds, however, that [...] "the hardest thing at this point is just thinking of fresh ideas. People are so on top of things that we've done before, so the challenge now is to think of an idea that's good, but hasn't been seen." [...] Jean's return was initially welcomed, with MSNBC's Jon Bonné stating: [...] "Jean, who took the show's helm from executive producer Mike Scully in 2001, has guided the show away from its gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation...these are certainly brighter days for the show's long-time fans." [...] However, some critics have argued that the quality of the show has declined in recent years during Jean's tenure. Jean has responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined.

Brown had also found a will in which Epstein left his house and money {{to his mother and}} his brother, with Brown also being named as a minor beneficiary. When confronted with the notes, Epstein told Brown that he would be {{grateful}} if Brown did not tell anyone, and was sorry he had made Brown worry. He explained that when he wrote the note and composed the will he had simply taken one pill too many, and that {{he had no intention of}} overdosing, promising to be more careful in the future. Brown later wrote that he wondered if he had done the right thing by not showing the note to Epstein's doctor, Norman Cowan, who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> prescribing drugs. The coroner, Gavin Thurston, told the Westminster inquest that Epstein's death was caused by an overdose of Carbitral, and ruled it as an accidental death. The pathologist, Dr. Donald Teare, stated that Epstein had been taking bromide in the form of Carbitral for some time, and that the barbiturate level in Epstein's blood was a [...] "low fatal level".|$|E
