5|$|Plans have {{recently}} been announced for a new multimillion-pound sports facility at Down Grange, which would be suitable for many sports. Proposals include a stadium for Basingstoke Town FC and Basingstoke RFC which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to the standard of the Football League, a new 8 lane athletics track and hockey pitch, {{as well as a}} gym, swimming pool, hotel and conference facilities.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{changes were}} made to give the {{ceremony}} a sleek, interactive look while shortening {{the length of the}} ceremony. Cates announced that in certain categories, all five nominees <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> onstage prior to the announcement of the award. In other instances, the actor or actress would present the award in the audience. In addition, production designer Roy Christopher designed an technologically ambitious stage for the telecast that both saluted the past while look toward the future. The set prominently featured 26 high-definition video monitors floating over the first twelve rows of the audience and a 40-foot LED screen situated beneath a layer of plexiglass on the stage floor. Both screens were used display images of previous Oscar appearances as presenters took the stage or random film clips during several commercial breaks. A gold rod featuring 23 different life-sized Oscar statuettes spiraling upward was placed at center stage.|$|E

25|$|Trey Burke scored seven quick {{points to}} get Michigan {{out to an}} early 7-3 lead. But then he picked up two fouls and {{would be forced to}} sit on the bench. Spike Albrecht, {{replacing}} him, made four consecutive three pointers leading to a 17-point 1st half performance and Michigan <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> 35-23. But, Luke Hancock made four consecutive three-pointers to cut the Michigan lead to 38-37 at halftime.|$|E
25|$|But {{the biggest}} label {{of all was}} Columbia Records, and in 1950 Mitch Miller left Mercury to embark upon his phenomenally {{successful}} career as the A man there. Laine's contract at Mercury <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> for renewal the following year, and Miller soon brought Laine to Columbia as well. Laine's contract with Columbia was the most lucrative in the industry until RCA bought Elvis Presley's contract five years later.|$|E
25|$|Box to box midfielders {{help with}} almost {{every aspect of}} the game. They need immense stamina as they need to cover most areas of the pitch, as well as some degree of passing skills. They <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> one end of the pitch {{assisting}} the attack one moment then back helping to defend around their own penalty area the next. They normally play as central midfielders but any of the midfield players may have this attribute.|$|E

25|$|A {{convention}} {{to decide on}} the formation of a new political party was nonetheless scheduled by the National Committee for February 21, 1925, to be held in Chicago. Labor, the official organ of the railway unions, did nothing to promote this 2nd Convention of the CPPA, stating that since the executives of the various unions had taken no stance on the matter, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to subordinate sections to consider sending delegates themselves.|$|E
25|$|In June 2003, Jobs had {{introduced}} Macs {{based on the}} PowerPC G5 processor and promised that within a year, the clock speed of the part <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to 3 GHz. Two years later, 3GHz G5s were still not available, and rumors continued that IBM's low yields on the POWER4-derived chip were to blame. Further, the heat produced by the chip proved an obstacle to deploying it in a laptop computer, which had become the fastest growing segment of the personal computer industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} infrastructure in New France was almost nonexistent, with few roads and canals. The canals <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to three miles long {{at times and}} boats were thin and simple. Thus people used the waterways, especially the St. Lawrence River, as the main form of transportation, by canoes. In the winter, when the lakes froze, both {{the poor and the}} rich travelled by sleds pulled by dogs or horses. A land transportation system was not developed in the region until the 1830s, when stretches of road were built along the river, and the Rideau Canal project was not completed until 1840.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, {{there was}} some {{publicity}} in the newspapers that his VC <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> at auction. This attracted the interest of Michael Ashcroft, Baron Ashcroft who bought the VC for £29,000 (plus fees) amidst strong competition from dealers and private collectors. This was the first Victoria Cross bought by Lord Ashcroft, who, as of 2006, owned 142 medals. In July 2008 Lord Ashcroft announced a donation of £5 million for a permanent gallery at the Imperial War Museum, where Victoria Crosses already held by the museum will be put on display alongside his own. The Lord Ashcroft Gallery opened in 2010.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Choe began hosting {{an online}} {{lifestyle}} and entertainment podcast with adult film star Asa Akira entitled DVDASA. In a March 2014 podcast, Choe recounted an instance where he sexually assaulted a masseuse. He later {{released a statement}} to clarify that the story he recounted was fiction and {{should be viewed as}} an extension of his art. In June 2017, Choe was invited by Goldman Properties to paint a mural on the Houston Bowery Wall in New York City, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> until October. Less than a week after the mural was completed, graffiti crews and vandals added their own tags and paint, obscuring large portions of the work.|$|E
25|$|On January 19, 2011, Nintendo {{held two}} {{simultaneous}} press conferences in Amsterdam and New York City, where it revealed {{all of the}} features of the Nintendo 3DS. In North America, the release date was confirmed as March 27, 2011 with a retail price of $249.99. In Europe, the release date was announced as March 25, 2011, though Nintendo said that pricing <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to retailers. Most retailers have priced the handheld between £219.99 and £229.99, though some retailers, such as Amazon, lowered the price following Sony's announcement of the PSP's successor on January 26, 2011, with some retailers pricing the handheld at around £200 in February.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. EPA's {{proposed}} {{standard for}} greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit. The U.S. EPA proposed a legal limit of {{a maximum of}} 3.5 millisieverts (350 millirem) each annually to local individuals after 10,000 years, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to several percent of the exposure currently received by some populations in the highest natural background regions on Earth, though the U.S. DOE predicted that received dose would be much below that limit. Over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the United States (10 million km2) by ≈ 1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of natural radioisotopes in such a volume, but {{the vicinity of the}} site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} strategy used by cicadas of {{the genus}} Magicicada make use of prime numbers. These insects {{spend most of their}} lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects.|$|E
25|$|Another wrinkle in {{the issue}} is the unnatural {{geographic}} location of this Eastern-Time-Zoned region. In the western Indiana counties where Eastern time is observed (South Bend and Lafayette south to Terre Haute and Vincennes), around the summer solstice, the sun neither sets until after 9:20 pm, nor does it reach solar noon until almost 2:00 pm. During the winter months when standard time is observed, school buses in western regions lose a valuable hour of the sun's rays as they pick up children in the morning. Another notable observation is that schools in the Eastern Time Zone of Indiana tend to have far more 2-hour delays, mainly {{due to the fact that}} sunlight is required for many road de-icing components to work. With the sun rising as late as 8:20 am in some areas, available sunlight is inadequate to safely thaw the roads for school buses to pick up all their passengers on time. The argument is that if the same area were in its geographically natural Central time zone, the sun <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> an hour sooner, and it would have an additional hour to thaw the roads every morning.|$|E
