500|$|Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão (later Marquis of Paraná), one of Brazil's leading {{politicians}} and then serving as president (governor) {{of the province}} of Pernambuco, summarized the prevalent view among Brazil's ruling elite regarding the succession of the Empire when he addressed the Provincial Assembly: [...] "It is my painful duty to inform you {{of the death of}} the Prince Imperial D. Pedro Afonso, which occurred on 10 January of the current year. It is the second time <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> heir presumptive of the crown." [...] Honório Hermeto continued: [...] "It must serve as a consolation to us, the certainty of [...] health of H. M. the Emperor and his august wife. Both in the prime of their years, and full of life, still promise both numerous fruits from their conjugal bed as well as a male succession to the crown, as required for both the consolidation of our still recent institutions and the restless spirit of the century." ...|$|E

"Someone not {{following}} {{breaks down the}} whole system {{of being able to}} educate and being able to bring up our children with strong family values," [...] Weider told The New York Times in 1992. [...] "Why do you think we have no drugs? If we lost respect for the Grand Rabbi, <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> whole thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{feature of}} Nordström's {{theory is that}} it can be written as the theory of a certain scalar field in Minkowski spacetime, and in this form enjoys the {{expected}} conservation law for nongravitational mass-energy together with gravitational field energy, but suffers from a not very memorable force law. [...] In the curved spacetime formulation the motion of test particles is described (the world line of a free test particle is a timelike geodesic, and by an obvious limit, the world line of a laser pulse is a null geodesic), but <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> conservation law. [...] So which interpretation is correct? [...] In other words, which metric is the one which according to Nordström can be measured locally by physical experiments? [...] The answer is: the curved spacetime is the physically observable one in this theory (as in all metric theories of gravitation); the flat background is a mere mathematical fiction which is however of inestimable value for such purposes as writing down the general vacuum solution, or studying the weak field limit.|$|E

"Ay, an' {{tell them}} frae me, that if <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> brig <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> day," [...] growled Andrew Black, who, begrimed with powder, was busily loading and firing his musket {{from behind a}} thick bush, which, though an admirable screen from vision, was a poor {{protection}} from bullets, as the passage of several leaden messengers had already proved. But our farmer was too much engrossed with present duty to notice trifles! ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{only way}} to get the best of an {{argument}} is to avoid it. Whenever we argue with someone, no matter if <b>we</b> win or <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> argument, <b>we</b> still <b>lose.</b> <b>The</b> other person will either feel humiliated or strengthened and will only seek to bolster their own position. We must try to avoid arguments whenever we can.|$|R

6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> should <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> path {{it might}} be awkward," [...] said Christian. [...] "A lantern is the only shield {{that will make it}} safe for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{must stand}} it, or go ashore," [...] {{answered}} Gardiner, coolly, though in secret {{he was deeply}} concerned. [...] "Did Deacon Pratt forgive me, should <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> schooner, I never could forgive myself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bah!" [...] ejaculated another, [...] "wot gammon you do talk. If he {{lose the}} boat, don't <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> tin? Besides, are we agoin' to let sich a trifle {{stand in the}} way o' us an' our fortins?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{he spoke}} {{somebody}} beat upon a suspended iron sheet {{down in the}} valley and drowsy voices rose up from among the clustered tents. Summers went by shouting, [...] "Get a move on, before <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> bridge!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{must turn}} round {{every now and}} then," [...] said Rollo, [...] "and see what is behind us, or <b>we</b> may <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> sight of {{something}} very extraordinary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But he's gone"--continues Bill--"gone home. I {{showed him}} the road to Summit and kicked him about eight feet nearer there at one kick. I'm sorry <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> ransom; but it was either that or Bill Driscoll to the madhouse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Should <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> schooner, Captain Gar'ner, few of {{us would}} escape drowning, to feel remorse or joy. Look at that coast, sir--it is clear now, and a body can see {{a good bit of}} it--never did I put eyes upon a less {{promising}} land-fall, for strangers to make." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{before we}} enter the clouds, Mr Coxwell, having made all {{preparations}} for the descent, strictly enjoins me {{to be ready to}} put up the instruments, lest, when <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> powerful rays of the sun, and absorb the moisture of the lower clouds, we should approach the earth with too great rapidity.|$|E
6000|$|... "For what?" [...] demanded Middleton; [...] "we {{are now in}} the swiftest of the current, and {{by drawing}} to <b>the</b> shore <b>we</b> shall <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> force of the stream." ...|$|R

60|$|And {{if it were}} {{possible}} for us to recollect all the unaccountable and happy instincts of the careless time, and to reason upon them with the maturer judgment, we might arrive at more rapid and right results than either the philosophy or the sophisticated practice of art have yet attained. But <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> perceptions before we are capable of methodizing or comparing them.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> {{game with}} Rockville to-day {{it will be}} our own fault," [...] he said, to the crowd that {{had participated in the}} Gee Eyes' doings. [...] "We should have gotten home at least an hour earlier than we did last night--or rather this morning." [...] And then he made each player take a good rubbing down and just enough {{exercise}} to limber up his muscles.|$|E
60|$|To {{say that}} we do not know, at this day, what the grievances of the colonies are (be they real or pretended) would be unworthy of us. But whilst we are thus waiting to be {{informed}} of what we perfectly know, we weaken the powers of the commissioners,--we delay, perhaps <b>we</b> <b>lose,</b> <b>the</b> happy hour of peace,--we are wasting the substance of both countries,--we are continuing the effusion of human, of Christian, of English blood.|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{think what}} <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> in <b>the</b> way of speeches," [...] he resumed. [...] "Cannot {{you imagine the}} best man rising:--'Ladies and gentlemen--the health of the bride.' That is what the best man has to do, isn't it?" ...|$|R
