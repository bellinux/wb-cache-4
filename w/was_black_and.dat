5|$|Georgia Tech {{also participated}} in the first {{integrated}} bowl game in the Deep South. The 1956 Sugar Bowl featured the 7th ranked Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the 11th ranked Pitt Panthers. There was controversy over whether Bobby Grier from Pitt {{should be allowed to}} play because he <b>was</b> <b>black,</b> <b>and</b> whether Georgia Tech should even play at all due to Georgia governor Marvin Griffin's opposition to integration. Ultimately, Bobby Grier played which made the game the first integrated Sugar Bowl and the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South.|$|E

Taking the colours of the banner of the Holy Roman Emperor, {{the flag of the}} Austrian Empire <b>was</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> gold. Francis II was the last Holy Roman Emperor, with Napoleon forcing the empire's dissolution in 1806. After this point, these colours continued to be used as the flag of Austria until 1918.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu was the {{smallest}} of all emus, and had darker plumage than the mainland emu. It <b>was</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> brown, and had naked blue skin on the neck, and its chicks were striped like those on the mainland. The subspecies was distinct from the likewise diminutive Kangaroo Island emu (D. n. baudinianus) {{in a number of}} osteological details, including size. The behaviour of the King Island emu probably did not differ much from that of the mainland emu. The birds gathered in flocks to forage and during breeding time. They fed on berries, grass and seaweed. They ran swiftly, and could defend themselves by kicking. The nest was shallow, and consisted of dead leaves and moss. Seven to nine eggs were laid, which were incubated by both parents.|$|E

25|$|CompuServe {{introduced}} GIF on June 15, 1987 {{to provide}} a color image format for their file downloading areas, replacing their earlier run-length encoding (RLE) format, which <b>was</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white only. GIF became popular because it used LZW data compression, which was more efficient than the run-length encoding that formats such as PCX and MacPaint used, and fairly large images could therefore be downloaded in a reasonably short time, even with very slow modems.|$|E

500|$|The 1965 season {{brought more}} {{obstacles}} for Koufax. On March 31, {{the morning after}} pitching a complete spring training game, Koufax awoke to find that his entire left arm <b>was</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> blue from hemorrhaging. Koufax returned to Los Angeles to consult with Kerlan, who advised Koufax {{that he would be}} lucky to be able to pitch once a week. Kerlan also told Koufax that he would eventually lose full use of his arm. Koufax agreed not to throw at all between games—a resolution that lasted only one start. To get himself through the games he pitched in, Koufax resorted to Empirin with codeine for the pain, which he took every night and sometimes during the fifth inning. He also took Butazolidin for inflammation, applied capsaicin-based Capsolin ointment (called [...] "atomic balm" [...] by baseball players) before each game, and soaked his arm in a tub of ice afterwards.|$|E

500|$|Based on {{his junior}} college {{performance}} and increased bulk, Mitchell was recruited by several major college programs, but he originally committed to John McKay at the University of Southern California. While {{on the golf}} course with University of Alabama coach Paul [...] "Bear" [...] Bryant, McKay casually mentioned that he had received a commitment from an Alabama native. McKay assumed that Bryant wouldn't be interested in Mitchell because he <b>was</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> Alabama had no black players on their roster. Bryant swooped in and recruited Mitchell aggressively. Although Mitchell originally was a bit nervous about the reception he would receive at Alabama, as well as the amount of playing time he could garner, his family encouraged him to return home and accept Bryant's scholarship offer. Besides his family's encouragement and Bryant's assurances that his race would not be a problem, Mitchell's opinion that Alabama's School of Social Work was one of the country's best was a big factor in his decision.|$|E
500|$|Writing about cricket in Trinidad, {{historian}} C. L. R. James {{noted that}} Dewhurst always kept wicket [...] "excellently", but that many Trinidadians considered Piggott a better wicket-keeper {{who was only}} left out because he <b>was</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> Dewhurst was white. James recalled that people were astonished when Piggott was not chosen to tour England in 1923. But he suggests {{it was not a}} surprise as without Dewhurst's selection, among the Trinidad representatives on the West Indian team, {{there would have been no}} players from the Queen's Park Club, the most prestigious club on the island, nor would there have been any white players. Writing in 1927, in the expectation that Dewhurst would tour England the following year, his 1923 team-mate C. R. Browne wrote that Dewhurst's [...] "heart is as big as his body" [...] and that his [...] "expansive smile captures many victims". He described him as [...] "very unassuming, but winning in appearance Dewhurst is effective in his job and inspires confidence in bowler and fieldsmen alike. Without Trinidad's skipper no West Indies Team is complete." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} {{discusses}} racial classification and {{the root of}} White fear of African Americans, particularly racist concerns by some Whites over the effect of miscegenation. In the song, Chuck D argues {{that they should not}} worry as the original man <b>was</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> [...] "white comes from black / No need to be confused". The song features a vocal sample of comedian and activist Dick Gregory: [...] "Black man, black woman, black baby / white man, black woman, black baby?". [...] "Pollywanacraka" [...] also concerns interracial relations, including Blacks who leave their communities to marry wealthy Whites, and societal views of the matter: [...] "This system had no wisdom / The devil split us in pairs / and taught us white is good, black is bad / and black and white is still too bad". [...] "Meet the G That Killed Me" [...] features homophobic etiology and condemns homosexuality: [...] "Man to man / I don't know if they can / From what I know / The parts don't fit". Written by hypeman Flavor Flav and Bomb Squad-producers Keith Shocklee and Eric [...] "Vietnam" [...] Sadler, [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] features Flav as the main vocalist and criticizes the inadequacy of 9-1-1, the emergency telephone number used in the United States, and the lack of police response to emergency calls in predominantly African-American neighborhoods.|$|E
