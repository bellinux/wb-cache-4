People {{may have}} poor resting {{tone of the}} anal canal, and consequently {{may not be able}} to retain an enema, in which case transanal irrigation (retrograde anal irrigation) may be a better option, as this equipment utilizes an inflatable catheter to prevent loss of the irrigation tip and to provide a <b>water</b> <b>tight</b> <b>seal</b> during irrigation. A volume of lukewarm water is gently pumped into the colon via the anus. People can be taught how to perform this treatment in their own homes, but it does require special equipment. If the irrigation is efficient, stool will not reach the rectum again for up to 48 hours. By regularly emptying the bowel using transanal irrigation, controlled bowel function is often re-established to a high degree in patients with bowel incontinence and/or constipation. This enables control over the time and place of evacuation and development of a consistent bowel routine. However, persistent leaking of residual irrigation fluid during the day may occur and make this option unhelpful, particularly in persons with obstructed defecation syndrome who may have incomplete evacuation of any rectal contents. Consequently, the best time to carry out the irrigation is typically in the evening, allowing any residual liquid to be passed the next morning before leaving the home. Complications such as electrolyte imbalance and perforation are rare. The effect of transanal irrigation varies considerably. Some individuals experience complete control of incontinence, and other report little or no benefit. It has been suggested that if appropriate, people be offered home retrograde anal irrigation.|$|E

30|$|Key {{criteria}} {{in the design}} of the imaging phantom were considered. The phantom should be anatomically realistic and simulate a patient abdomen, both visually and when imaged with scintigraphy and x-ray computed tomography. A fillable section within the structure was required to represent activity distributions within a liver. The liver section needed to accommodate multiple inserts for lesion representation and allow flexibility in insert arrangement while allowing reproducible assembly for repeated studies. All materials used in the phantom must have similar densities and attenuation coefficients to tissue. The material for the lesions should also be transparent for visualisation and ease of filling. Filling and assembly should be uncomplicated to reduce radiation exposure when preparing the phantom. When filled, the material should have low water absorption, be <b>water</b> <b>tight</b> at all <b>seals</b> and be sufficiently strong to maintain structural integrity when filled and transported. Finally, a total weight limit to the phantom was specified as 20  kg to ensure transportation and manual handing constraints were met.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{advances}} in clinical practice Sunderland 2 ̆ 7 s grades of nerve injury {{as described in}} 1951 remain a clinical measurement often aided by non specific diagnostic tools such as neurophysiological testing or indeed verified experimentally by destructive histological techniques. Furthermore regarding grade 5 injuries or nerve transection, microsurgical repair with sutures has remained the gold standard clinically despite a relatively poor outcome when the regenerative capability of the neural microenvironment is considered. The objectives of this thesis are to apply novel optical technologies across the spectrum of nerve injuries as described by Sunderland. This includes evaluation of two optical diagnostic microscopes {{as well as a}} light activated neurorrhaphy addressing a grade 5 injury. We hypothesize that Optical microscopy may have a role in analyzing injury to, and the recovery of, the peripheral nerve in vivo. Utilising Coherent Anti-stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) Microscopy to categorize peripheral nerve damage in vivo, and to monitor the recovery process of a damaged nerve and a Multifunctional Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) system to assess quantitative and qualitative changes in optical density and polarisation of nerve tissue following injury. Regarding grade 5 injury we hypothesis that isolation of the nerve repair site using photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) in combination with human amniotic membrane can improve both functional and histological recovery. Optical Diagnostics: A demyelinating crush injury was reproduced in the sciatic nerves of Sprague Dawley rats. Animals were randomised into groups and optical microscopy was undertaken at day one and weekly up to four weeks following completed following imaging. The uninjured nerve was used as a control. All animals demonstrated loss of sciatic nerve function following injury. Recovery was documented with functional data approaching normal at three and four weeks. Demyelination was confirmed using CARS Microscopy in nerves up to two weeks post injury, remyelination was observed in the three week group and beyond. Imaging of normal nerve revealed structured myelin bundles. These results were consistent with histology. OCT imaging revealed a quantifiable change in birefringence of the nerve (as measured by phase retardation graphs) following a simple crush injury. Histological markers of axonal myelination such as myelin thickness and g-ratio (axon diameter / fiber diameter) were then calculated and directly compared to the slope of the graph obtained from imaging (Birefkingence). Scatter plot analysis of the complete data set showed a statistically significant relationship with both myelin thickness and g-ratio when compared to imaging results. Optical Therapeutics: Photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) is a sutureless tissue repair process that seals the repair site allowing prompt restoration of the normal endoneural environment and healing. In PTB, a photoactive dye is applied to tissue surfaces that are then placed in contact and irradiated with green light. This technique utilises visible light at a power that does not thermally damage the tissue. The light activates the dye leading to immediate formation of covalent crosslinks between proteins on both surfaces, thereby forming a <b>water</b> <b>tight</b> <b>seal.</b> New Zealand White Rabbits (n = 24) underwent transection of the right common peroneal nerve. Standard neurorrhaphy (SN) was performed using 10 / 0 nylon sutures. The repair site was then wrapped in a cuff of human amniotic membrane(HAM), which was either secured with sutures (SN 2 ̆ 6 HAM) or sealed using PTB (SN 2 ̆ 6 HAMIPTB). Standard neurorrhaphy alone was assessed as a control group. Functional recovery was recorded at 30 day intervals post-operatively by electrophysiological assessment. At 120 days animals were sacrificed and nerves harvested for histomorphometry. Nerves treated with amnion wraps, sealed with PTB demonstrated a statistically significant improvement across both functional and histological parameters. Functional recovery, as measured by repeated electrophysiological studies over time, revealed a 26. 2...|$|E

40|$|Patch-clamp {{recording}} has {{revolutionized the}} study of ion channels, transporters, and the electrical activity of small cells. Vital to this method is formation of a <b>tight</b> <b>seal</b> between glass recording pipette and cell membrane. To better understand seal formation and improve practical application of this technique, we {{examine the effects of}} divalent ions, protons, ionic strength, and membrane proteins on adhesion of membrane to glass and on seal resistance using both patch-clamp recording and atomic force microscopy. We find that H+, Ca 2 +, and Mg 2 + increase adhesion force between glass and membrane (lipid and cellular), decrease the time required to form a <b>tight</b> <b>seal,</b> and increase seal resistance. In the absence of H+ (10 − 10 M) and divalent cations (< 10 − 8 M), adhesion forces are greatly reduced and <b>tight</b> <b>seals</b> are not formed. H+ (10 − 7 M) promotes seal formation in the absence of divalent cations. A positive correlation between adhesion force and seal formation indicates that high resistance seals are associated with increased adhesion between membrane and glass.
