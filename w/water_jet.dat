5|$|In 1970, two {{tourist attractions}} {{were added to}} the middle of Central Basin. The Captain James Cook Memorial was built by the {{government}} to commemorate the Bicentenary of (then Lieutenant) James Cook's first sighting of the east coast of Australia. It includes a <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> fountain located in the central basin (based on the Jet d'eau in Geneva) and a skeleton globe sculpture at Regatta Point showing the paths of Cook's expeditions. On 25 April 1970, Queen Elizabeth II officially inaugurated the memorial. As part of the same ceremony, Queen Elizabeth also opened the National Carillon on Aspen Island, a set of 53 bronze bells donated by the British Government to commemorate the city's 50th anniversary.|$|E
5|$|The ink sac of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} sac produces the ink, and the sac stores it. The sac is {{close enough to the}} funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a <b>water</b> <b>jet.</b> Before it leaves the funnel, the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack the ink sac.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, a {{gold medal}} {{competition}} {{was sponsored by the}} Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters to investigate a method for measuring the surface tension of liquids that had been proposed by Lord Rayleigh in 1879. This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a <b>water</b> <b>jet.</b> Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, he had to make his own glassware, creating test tubes with the required elliptical cross-sections. He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the viscosity of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the Royal Society in London for publication in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.|$|E

25|$|As an {{abrasive}} garnet can be broadly {{divided in}} two categories; blasting grade and <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> grade. The garnet, {{as it is}} mined and collected, is crushed to finer grains; all pieces which are larger than 60mesh (250micrometers) are normally used for sand blasting. The pieces between 60mesh (250micrometers) and 200mesh (74micrometers) are normally used for <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> cutting. The remaining garnet pieces that are finer than 200mesh (74micrometers) are used for glass polishing and lapping. Regardless of the application, the larger grain sizes are used for faster work and the smaller ones are used for finer finishes.|$|E

25|$|For small {{backyard}} infestations, simply spraying {{the plants}} thoroughly {{with a strong}} <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> every few days may be sufficient protection for roses and other plants. An insecticidal soap solution {{can be an effective}} household remedy to control aphids and other soft-bodied arthropods. It will only kill aphids on contact and has no residual action against aphids that arrive after application. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32Â°C (90Â°F). Some plant species are known to be sensitive to soap sprays.|$|E
25|$|An {{example is}} shown in the figure on the right with a <b>water</b> <b>jet.</b> The laminar {{two-dimensional}} jet amplifies small disturbances at the orifice to generate a vortex street. For this case, the flow speed, in terms of Reynolds number, was graphed against the disturbance frequency, in terms of the Strouhal number for a variety of disturbance amplitudes to reveal the region of instability as shown in the figure on the left. The value of D in the figure represents the ratio of the lateral disturbance displacement to the nozzle width; the disturbances were minute.|$|E
25|$|An {{unstable}} <b>water</b> <b>jet,</b> {{similar to}} the one shown in the flow instability section above, was not disturbed deliberately, but was allowed to rise to a free water surface. On contact with the surface, a slight jet asymmetry caused an unsymmetrical raised surface that fed back to the jet origin and began a process that looked like a weak version of the flow instability figure. If the jet was not powered, but warmer than the surrounding fluid, it would rise and when encountering the surface would generate a similar feedback system.|$|E

Cases of floor without <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> were included to estimate the influence of using the suggested system. Obtained results were analyzed and graphically represented. The suggested system is easy {{to be used as}} an extra element to the existing structures to increase the performance of stilling basin. Results indicated that the system of suggested floor <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> gave from 50 % to 90 % reduction in maximum scour depth and from 42 % to 85 % reduction in scour hole length compared to the case of the floor without <b>water</b> <b>jets...</b>|$|R
