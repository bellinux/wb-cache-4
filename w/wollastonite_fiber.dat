40|$|Nano-tin oxide was {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of wollastonite using the mixed solution including stannic chloride pentahydrate precursor and wollastonite by a hydrolysis precipitation process. The antistatic properties of the wollastonite materials under different calcined conditions and composite materials (nano-SnO 2 /wollastonite, SW) were measured by rubber sheeter and four-point probe (FPP) sheet resistance measurement. Effects of hydrolysis temperature and time, calcination temperature and time, pH value and nano-SnO 2 coating amount on the resistivity of SW powders were studied, and the optimum experimental conditions were obtained. The microstructure and surface properties of wollastonite, precipitate and SW were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), specific surface area analyzer (BET), thermogravimetry (TG), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier translation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) respectively. The results showed that the nano-SnO 2 /wollastonite composite materials under optimum preparation conditions showed better antistatic properties, the resistivity of which was reduced from 1. 068 × 104 Ω cm to 2. 533 × 103 Ω cm. From TG and XRD analysis, the possible mechanism for coating of SnO 2 nanoparticles {{on the surface of}} wollastonite was proposed. The infrared spectrum indicated that there were a large number of the hydroxyl groups on the surface of wollastonite. This is beneficial to the heterogeneous nucleation reaction. Through morphology, EDS and XPS analysis, the surface of <b>wollastonite</b> <b>fiber</b> was coated with a layer of 10 – 15 nm thickness of tin oxide grains the distribution of which was uniform...|$|E
40|$|<b>Wollastonite</b> <b>fibers</b> {{were tested}} in vitro {{for their ability to}} pro-duce {{reactive}} oxygen species (ROS) with two different systems: a cell-free reactive mixture containing deoxyribose and a polymor-phonuclear leukocyte suspension. After adding the fibers, we mea-sured the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances produced by de-oxyribose degradation and luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence, respectively. Compared with asbestos, <b>wollastonite</b> <b>fibers</b> pro-duced higher ROS levels both in the PMN suspensions and in the cell-free reactive mixtures. A large amount of these ROS were not hydroxyl radicals. Indeed we obtained remarkable differences in ROS generation between unground and ground <b>wollastonite</b> <b>fibers</b> and negative results with fibers modified with ferric chloride and dithionite. In addition, ROS generation was partially inhibited (by 46 - 54 %) in the reactions performed in the presence of 1, 3 -di-methyl- 2 -thiourea (DMTU), a strong hydroxyl radical scavenger...|$|R

Using a short-term inhalation bioassay, we have studied pulmonary deposition and clearance patterns and evaluated and compared the pulmonary toxicity of two previously tested reference materials, an inhaled organic fiber, Kevlar para-aramid fibrils, and an inorganic <b>fiber,</b> <b>wollastonite.</b> Rats were exposed for 5 days to aerosols of Kevlar fibrils (900 - 1344 f/cc; 9 - 11 mg/m 3) or <b>wollastonite</b> <b>fibers</b> (800 f/cc; 115 mg/m 3). The lungs of exposed rats were digested to quantify dose, fiber dimensional changes over time, and clearance kinetics. The results showed that inhaled <b>wollastonite</b> <b>fibers</b> were cleared rapidly with a retention half-time of 15 pm in length decreased from 30 % immediately after exposure to 5 % after 6 months; the percentages of fibers in the 4 to 7 pm range increased from 25 to 55 % in the same period. These data suggest that both inhaled Kevlar and <b>wollastonite</b> <b>fibers</b> have low durability in the lungs of exposed rats, {{and this may be}} responsible for the measured differences in toxicity between Kevlar and wollastonite on the one hand, and durable dusts such as silica or crocidolite asbestos fibers on the other. - Environ Health Perspect 102 (Suppl 5) : 151 - 157 (1994...|$|R

40|$|The mesothelial lining is {{a target}} for the fibrotic and carcino-genic effects of mineral fibers. Fiber geometry, dimensions, chemi-cal composition, surface reactivity, and biopersistence at the target tissue have been {{proposed}} to contribute to these toxic endpoints. We established a dose-response relationship {{between the number of}} fibers delivered to the parietal peritoneal lining, inflammation, and mesothelial cell proliferation induced by intraperitoneal injec-tion of crocidolite asbestos fibers in mice. Persistence of these in-flammatory and proliferative responses depended on persistence of fibers at the target tissue. Intraperitoneal injection of wollaston-ite fibers induced an early inflammatory and proliferative response that subsided after 21 days.

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cement (CPC) that {{is based}} on α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP) is considered desirable for bone tissue engineering because of its relatively rapid degradation properties. However, such cement is relatively weak, restricting its use to areas of low mechanical stress. <b>Wollastonite</b> <b>fibers</b> (WF) have been used to improve the mechanical strength of biomaterials. However, the biological properties of WF remain poorly understood. Here, we tested the response of osteoblast-like cells to being cultured on CPC reinforced with 5 % of WF (CPC-WF). We found that both types of cement studied achieved an ion balance for calcium and phosphate after 3 days of immersion in culture medium and this allowed subsequent long-term cell culture. CPC-WF increased cell viability and stimulated cell differentiation, compared to nonreinforced CPC. We hypothesize that late silicon release by CPC-WF induces increased cell proliferation and differentiation. Based on our findings, we propose that CPC-WF is a promising material for bone tissue engineering applications...|$|R

40|$|The in vivo {{durability}} of wollastonite materials, coated and uncoated, and of xonotlite was tested. Wollastonite is an anhydrous natural silicate and xonotlite is a hydrated synthetic calcium silicate. UICC crocidolite {{was used as}} a positive control with high durability. Using a dry-sizing technique, fractions from the stock materials were prepared according to the definition of "thoracic particulate mass" and "respirable particulate mass" of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. Fibers were instilled intratracheally into female Wistar rats, and the evenness of their distribution in the lung was checked by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After serial sacrifices at 2 and 14 days, 1, 3, and 6 months, and low temperature ashing of the lung, the fibers were analyzed by SEM. The number and size distribution of fibers were investigated. The total number of crocidolite fibers decreased with a half-time of 240 days, but the number of fibers > 5 microns in length was unchanged after 6 months. The elimination kinetics of <b>wollastonite</b> <b>fibers</b> from the lung were relatively fast, with half-times of 15 to 21 days. The coating of wollastonite in Wollastocoat had no effect on this elimination process. For the thoracic fraction of wollastonite, the elimination from the lung was as fast as for the respirable particulate fraction. The elimination kinetics of xonotlite from the lung was very fast. This material consisted of single crystals of acicular morphology with a median length of 1. 3 micron and of agglomerates of these crystals. More than 99 % of single crystals and about 85 to 89 % of the agglomerates were already eliminated 2 days after instillation...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{utilization of}} 0 – 14. 6 vol. % alkaline-treated walnut shell powders (WSPs) as a functional filler {{in the proposed}} eco-friendly brake friction materials. Five non-asbestos friction material samples containing WSP and jute fibers from biomass as biodegradable components were prepared, also including several from natural resources, such as <b>wollastonite,</b> basalt <b>fibers,</b> zircon, barite, and vermiculite. The friction-wear properties of the prepared composites were tested by using Chase friction performance testing device. Furthermore, an extension evaluation method was introduced to rank the composites based on their overall friction-wear characteristics. The coefficient of friction (COF) and wear rate of the samples could be effectively improved, especially for the sample with a WSP content ≤ 5. 6 vol. %. With confirmation of the analysis and characterization results, chars were very possibly formed by the degradation of organic ingredients, such as WSP and jute fibers, which {{played a key role}} in affecting the friction performance of the friction composites.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{we study}} {{the impact of}} thermal damage on the {{physical}} and mechanical properties of ultrahigh-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC), especially on their cracking process under compressive loading. Four mixtures of UHPFRC were prepared using identical composition but reinforced with different types of fibers: mineral <b>fibers</b> (Steel or <b>Wollastonite)</b> or organic <b>fibers</b> (PP or PVA) and compared with that without fibers (UHPC). To induce a thermal damage on UHPFRC, the samples were subjected to temperatures ranging from 150 to 400 °C. After each degradation stage, the gas permeability and the P-wave velocity were measured. The mechanical behavior under loading has been studied using a uniaxial compression test which combines the gas permeability and the acoustic emission measurement. The {{results show that the}} melting of organic fibers at approximately 180 °C builds a tunnel across the cement paste and increases brutally the gas permeability. At 400 °C treatment, a decrease of compression strength by 30 % and of Young modulus by approximately 60 % was observed. However, we can see that the thermal damage results a decrease in the threshold of initial cracking (rk-ci) and that of unstable cracking (rk-pi), and this {{can be explained by the}} initiation of new cracks and their coalescence...|$|R
