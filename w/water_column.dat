5|$|Teleosts may spawn in the <b>water</b> <b>column</b> or, more commonly, on the substrate. <b>Water</b> <b>column</b> spawners {{are mostly}} limited to coral reefs; the fish will rush towards {{the surface and}} release their gametes. This appears to protect the eggs from some predators {{and allow them to}} {{disperse}} widely via currents. They receive no parental care. <b>Water</b> <b>column</b> spawners are more likely than substrate spawners to spawn in groups. Substrate spawning commonly occurs in nests, rock crevices or even burrows. Some eggs can stick to various surfaces like rocks, plants, wood or shells.|$|E
5|$|An infaunal mode of {{life can}} be quickly ruled out, as the fossils are {{sometimes}} found in alignment with the depositing current; as nothing attached them to the bottom, they must have fallen from the <b>water</b> <b>column.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} large numbers of organisms {{actually}} consumed by the walrus, its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs (bioturbates) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the <b>water</b> <b>column,</b> encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the benthos.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMany {{researches}} on Oscillating <b>Water</b> <b>Columns</b> (OWC) {{have been}} performed since the early 70 ’s {{in order to assess}} the energy yield at a given location {{on the one hand and}} to perform parametric studies in order to optimise their efficiency on the other hand. This paper synthetises a literature survey aimed at comparing the Oscillating <b>Water</b> <b>Columns</b> modelling methods, from analytical methods to more recent CFD approaches. The comparison of those different methods also yielded to an analysis of different design parameters of OWC. Therefore, in this paper, we also present some results about OWC performance sensitivity to geometrical or turbine parameters...|$|R
50|$|Oscillating <b>Water</b> <b>Columns</b> (OWCs) {{are simple}} constructions that {{act like a}} piston and cylinder. As waves rise within the OWC, it {{replicates}} the action of a piston, driving a column of air ahead of it and through the turbine.|$|R
5|$|T.chatareus {{are known}} to occur in shaded areas with {{vegetation}} overhead, usually at {{the top layer of}} the <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> They are found only where there is an intact riparian area, as this is a major source of their food. T.chatareus are usually not found in fast-flowing streams.|$|E
5|$|The bony fish lineage shows more derived {{anatomical}} traits, {{often with}} major evolutionary changes from {{the features of}} ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum, and a mouth {{at or near the}} tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping scales. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the <b>water</b> <b>column,</b> but not a cloaca. They mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the <b>water</b> <b>column.</b>|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{conducted}} {{have examined}} the metagenomes of eukaryotes; identified Prokaryotes and viruses inhabiting the lake; provided evidence of virus-mediated horizontal gene transfer and adaptive metabolic or cold protective phenotype alterations, identified microbial nanowire connections between multiple species at the ice-water interface, in the <b>water</b> <b>column,</b> and in the sediment; and established biomass estimates {{of life in the}} lake ice during the early spring growing season using laser-induced fluorescence emission (L.I.F.E.) imaging techniques.|$|E
50|$|From 1942 until 1956 two of {{the class}} were engaged in {{shunting}} carriages at Sydney Central Station. They were removed when overhead wiring was installed as using the <b>water</b> <b>columns</b> was a hazard owing {{to the location of}} the inlet.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{an effort}} to {{investigate}} the use of MOS-B imagery for land applications atmospheric water vapour was retrieved from MOS-B imagery. The atmospheric precorrected differential absorption (APDA) retrieval algorithm employs narrow spectral bands centered at 870, 940 and 1010 nm and a database with radiative transfer calculations. Maps of <b>water</b> vapour <b>column</b> were derived for multitemporal MOS-B scenes acquired in 1996. The comparison with <b>water</b> <b>columns</b> based on local radiosonde soundings agrees within 10 - 20 per cent...|$|R
40|$|Nitrification, the {{microbial}} oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and nitrate, {{occurs in a}} wide variety of environments and plays a central role in the global nitrogen cycle. Catalyzed by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase, the ability to oxidize ammonia was previously thought to be restricted to a few groups within the β- and γ-Proteobacteria. However, recent metagenomic studies have revealed the existence of unique ammonia monooxygenase α-subunit (amoA) genes derived from uncultivated, nonextremophilic Crenarchaeota. Here, we report molecular evidence for the widespread presence of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in marine <b>water</b> <b>columns</b> and sediments. Using PCR primers designed to specifically target archaeal amoA, we find AOA to be pervasive in areas of the ocean that are critical for the global nitrogen cycle, including the base of the euphotic zone, suboxic <b>water</b> <b>columns,</b> and estuarine and coastal sediments. Diverse and distinct AOA communities are associated with each of these habitats, with little overlap between <b>water</b> <b>columns</b> and sediments. Within marine sediments, most AOA sequences are unique to individual sampling locations, whereas a small number of sequences are evidently cosmopolitan in distribution. Considering the abundance of nonextremophilic archaea in the ocean, our results suggest that AOA may play a significant, but previously unrecognized, role in the global nitrogen cycle...|$|R
5|$|Mud plume feeding is {{a feeding}} {{technique}} {{performed by a}} small community of bottlenose dolphins over shallow seagrass beds (less than 1 m) in the Florida Keys in the United States. The behavior involves creation of a U-shaped plume of mud in the <b>water</b> <b>column</b> and then rushing through the plume to capture fish.|$|E
5|$|Silvertip {{sharks are}} found over {{continental}} and insular shelves {{at a depth}} of , occupying all levels of the <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> They are most common around isolated islands, coral banks, and reef drop-offs. Juveniles frequent coastal shallows or lagoons, while adults occur in deeper water, with little overlap between the two age groups.|$|E
5|$|While most marine {{bioluminescence}} {{is green}} to blue, some deep sea barbeled dragonfishes in the genera Aristostomias, Pachystomias and Malacosteus emit a red glow. This adaptation allows {{the fish to}} see red-pigmented prey, which are normally invisible in the deep ocean environment where red light has been filtered out by the <b>water</b> <b>column.</b>|$|E
40|$|Trace gases are {{generally}} {{defined as those}} with low concentrations in the normal atmosphere. Many trace gases of interest are biogenic, produced and/or consumed by micro-organisms in soils, sediments, or <b>water</b> <b>columns,</b> or produced by plants and animals. Others are entirely synthetic and are a by-product of industrial activity...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} basic types of Stromatolite, the sub-tidal (always under <b>water)</b> <b>columns</b> and the inter-tidal (exposed to air and sun during low tides) anvil or {{mushroom}} shapes depicted in most pictures. Algal mats {{form in the}} inter-tidal region and appear as areas of flat black mud flats but are actually living stromatolite.|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} study of distribution of total trace metal concentrations (Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni, Co), nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphate & silica) and physico-chemical parameters (water temperature, salinity, conc. of dissolved oxygen- DO), dissolved inorganic/organic carbon (DIC, DOC) in <b>water</b> <b>columns</b> of two anchialine caves (Bjejajka and Živa voda) from eastern Adriatic coast (Croatia) has been performed...|$|R
5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|An {{immediate}} concern of environmentalists was the potential {{use of chemical}} dispersants. To keep big slicks from washing ashore, dispersants {{can be used to}} break the oil into small droplets that disperse throughout the <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> There are significant concerns about the health effects of the dispersants and the effects on aquatic life. Coast Guard officials overseeing the cleanup indicated that no chemical dispersants were being used but did not immediately rule the use of them out.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} {{was used by}} the LIMPET 500 (Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transformer) energy converter which was installed on the island of Islay by Wavegen Ltd. It was a shore-based unit and generated power when waves run up the beach, creating pressure inside an inclined oscillating <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> This in turn creates pneumatic power which drives the twin 250kW generators. Islay LIMPET was opened in 2001 and was the world's first commercial scale wave-energy device. In March 2013 Voith Hydro decided to close down Wavegen choosing to concentrate on tidal power projects.|$|E
5000|$|The station cost £212 {{to build}} in red brick with cream painted poster boards and chocolate-coloured framing. The {{extension}} over the front was covered with red tiles, as was the main roof. A booking office and waiting room was provided. <b>Water</b> <b>columns</b> and tanks weer fitted {{at each end of}} the station platform. A station master's house was provided ...|$|R
5000|$|The trust cleared {{buildings}} and repaired the dilapidated tracks, and two <b>water</b> <b>columns</b> were repaired to allow steam locomotives {{to stay at}} the site. In 1968 the old coaling stage was converted into a two-road shed with an inspection pit to hold both acquired locomotives. In November 1966 [...] "Clun Castle" [...] was stripped and restored.|$|R
25|$|In early 2007, {{the former}} {{location}} of The Timekeeper became home to Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor. The attraction building still retains {{most of the}} elements of the previous tenant, including the <b>water</b> <b>columns</b> in the queue and the basic Circle-Vision theater. However, the Theater floor has been modified to include seating and several of the screens are now covered by other elements.|$|R
5|$|In 1900 a spur {{connecting}} the branch to the up slow {{line of the}} West Coast Main Line was constructed. The water supply for locomotives at Wolverton was insufficient, so a <b>water</b> <b>column</b> was built at the intermediate station in Bradwell. Water came from the town's own source, with many houses losing their supply. On Mondays, housewives were known to shake their fists at engine drivers when their weekly wash was interrupted. Eventually drivers were forbidden from taking water from Bradwell on Mondays.|$|E
5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into the <b>water</b> <b>column,</b> while others have developed a number of mechanisms for {{holding on to the}} eggs until they are ready to hatch. Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and thoracic limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects. Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs; some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs, while others have them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E
5|$|In stream {{communities}}, few animal groups became extinct {{because such}} communities rely less directly on food from living plants {{and more on}} detritus that washes in from the land, buffering them from extinction. Similar, but more complex patterns {{have been found in}} the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in the <b>water</b> <b>column</b> than among animals living on or in the sea floor. Animals in the <b>water</b> <b>column</b> are almost entirely dependent on primary production from living phytoplankton, while animals living on or in the ocean floor feed on detritus or can switch to detritus feeding. Coccolithophorids and mollusks (including ammonites, rudists, freshwater snails, and mussels), and those organisms whose food chain included these shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of mosasaurs, a group of giant marine reptiles that became extinct at the boundary. The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, crocodyliforms and champsosaurs, were semi-aquatic and had access to detritus. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers, can survive for months without food, and their young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. These characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous.|$|E
50|$|Oscillating <b>Water</b> <b>Columns</b> have no {{moving parts}} in the water, and {{therefore}} pose little danger to sea life. Offshore OWCs may even support sea life by creating an artificial reef. The biggest concern is that OWCs cause too much noise pollution, and could damage {{the natural beauty of}} a seascape. Both these problems could be fixed by moving OWCs farther off shore.|$|R
50|$|Black {{rockfish}} are pelagic, that is, {{they occur}} on the continental shelf. Like other pelagic fish, they {{spend most of their}} time amid the <b>water</b> <b>columns</b> and are generally associated with rougher terra. This can make it somewhat inconvenient for commercial fisheries, which are often situated in nearshore, shallow water, and rocky areas (reefs). They make up an important component of nearshore fisheries in Southeastern Alaska.|$|R
40|$|Food {{production}} {{is affected by}} climate and by climate change. The indices for climate change may be recognized in long-term systematic observations of oceanic <b>water</b> <b>columns</b> at selected referential sites. The Mediterranean Sea, {{as part of the}} global oceanic circulation system, may be sensitive to climatic variation and may have an influence upon climate. The establishment of international referencestations for the Mediterranean area is suggested...|$|R
5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} three to over thirty years. Ripe gametes (ova or sperm) float from the gonads into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity. The larvae of inarticulate brachiopods are {{miniature}} adults, with lophophores that enable the larvae to feed and swim for months until the animals become heavy enough to settle to the seabed. The planktonic larvae of articulate species do not resemble the adults, but rather look like blobs with yolk sacs, and remain among the plankton {{for only a few}} days before leaving the <b>water</b> <b>column</b> upon metamorphosing.|$|E
5|$|Mysids {{are found}} {{throughout}} the world in both shallow and deep marine waters {{where they can be}} benthic or pelagic, but they are also important in some fresh water and brackish ecosystems. Many benthic species make daily vertical migrations into higher parts of the <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> Mysids are filter feeders, omnivores that feed on algae, detritus and zooplankton. Some mysids are cultured in the laboratory for experimental purposes and are used as a food source for other cultured marine organisms. They are sensitive to water pollution, so are sometimes used as bioindicators to monitor water quality.|$|E
5|$|Occurring {{close to}} shore from the surf zone {{to a depth}} of , the milk shark favors turbid water off sandy beaches and {{occasionally}} enters estuaries. In Shark Bay, Western Australia, juvenile milk sharks inhabit seagrass meadows composed of Amphibolis antarctica and Posidonia australis. Although some sources state this species avoids low salinities, it has been reported several times from fresh water in Cambodia, as far upstream as the Tonlé Sap. Milk sharks may be found anywhere in the <b>water</b> <b>column</b> from the surface to the bottom. Off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, its numbers fluctuate annually with a peak in summer, suggesting some form of seasonal movement.|$|E
50|$|The {{inspector}} {{recommended that}} a 5000 imp gal water tank should be installed at Reedness, with a petroleum gas-engine capable of filling {{it in two}} hours, and two <b>water</b> <b>columns,</b> one to fill locomotives on the main line and another in the sidings. He also noted {{that there was no}} signalling, but he expected the company to install such equipment as the Board of Trade required.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} located in sparsely {{populated}} moorland, along a dirt track near the junction of the A939 and A940. The purpose of a station at this location {{was to provide a}} passing loop with <b>water</b> <b>columns,</b> (15 miles from [...] and 16 miles to the first junction at [...] ) although the station did provide some facilities for the area, such as a post office.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} impacts of {{turbulent}} mixing on nutrient load in the Swan Estuary using field measurements. Results showed that both down-gradient and upgradient fluxes influence the vertical mixing process. Assessing eddy diffusivity of mass and turbulent viscosity of Swan estuary, three distinct stratification zones were identified as low, medium and high. Results further showed that turbulence is even active in high stratified <b>water</b> <b>columns</b> in natural <b>water</b> bodies...|$|R
