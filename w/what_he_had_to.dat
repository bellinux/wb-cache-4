25|$|Finkel's opponents {{argued that}} the pure focus on the Talmud would {{automatically}} create greatness in both scholarship and ethics. But Finkel believed that, while {{this might have been}} true in previous generations, the modern age was different. In his view, too many new enticing secular ideologies, such as Socialism and Zionism and the very real lure of atheism in universities, were becoming a replacement for traditional Judaism for many young Jews. He was determined to prove that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> offer was more appealing than anything the outside world could offer.|$|E

25|$|After a lap {{behind the}} safety car, the field were let loose {{again at the}} {{beginning}} of lap three. Vernay closed in on his Italian team-mate, slipstreaming past him on the run to the Mandarin, and doing enough to hold off Mortara into Lisboa. For the ensuing laps, Vernay was doing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do to keep his team-mate, who had stepped back from GP2 to rid himself of his close defeat to Keisuke Kunimoto in the previous year's race. Further back, Bianchi, who had avoided the first lap incidents was quietly moving his way up the field, and was eleventh by the end of lap seven. Sims had also dropped to the tail of the field, after a move on Cozzolino failed, and he made an unscheduled trip up the Lisboa escape road. Mortara started charging back towards Vernay, and in the process, broke the Frenchman's lap record set the day before. Mortara lowered it to a lap of 2:10.732, lapping the circuit at close to 105mph, and well under the previous record held by Marko Asmer. Cozzolino exited the race on lap eleven, crashing at Black Sands without the need for the safety car to reappear.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though he}} used over sixty mules, he knew to the item what {{each of them}} carried, where they were being {{delivered}} to and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> charge. And although he ran mule trains for over half a century he never lost a pound of cargo, except in one instance when his secundo, upon smelling a two-pound package of Limburger Cheese, decided it was rotten and threw it away. Once aware of the error, Cataline made sure it was replaced and delivered. One of the best stories about him involves a loan {{that he had to}} make after a fatal disease had killed several of his mules. The bank manager questioned Cataline's collateral, wondering how many mules and horses he owned before consenting to lend him the money. When Cataline returned to the bank in the fall to repay the debt, he counted out the exact amount owing and paid it in full. The bank manager noted that Cataline had more money on his person and suggested that he deposit it in the bank. Cataline responded with a query as to how many horses and mules the bank owned, and upon learning it was none, decided to keep his money.|$|E
25|$|Ivo Josipović gave a short speech {{after the}} exit polls were {{announced}} saying he was confident the official results would match the results they predicted. After the official results were published, he gave a victory speech shortly after midnight thanking his colleagues and especially his voters for their support and expressed conviction {{he would be the}} victor once again two weeks later. He said the citizens of Croatia have a choice between the light and the dark, with him being the light, referring to his untarnished political record, and Bandić being the dark, referring to his allegations of corruption. Milan Bandić arrived to his campaign headquarters {{just a couple of minutes}} before midnight and just a couple of minutes after the results were announced he gave his speech. He congratulated all the other candidates and said a new race began that night. He said he would be an independent president, not a remote-control of Zoran Milanović and accused Josipović of being a project of the highest-ranking members of SDP. He claimed Croatia needs a president that works for them, not for his party. While he was speaking, most television networks were showing scenes from Josipović headquarters in the corner, with Milanović observing Bandić's remarks. During the middle of his speech, right when Bandić was bashing his former party and its leader, Josipović came to the stage and all television stations switched to hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say.|$|E

25|$|Head faced his {{debilitating}} illness with a {{great degree}} of heroism. As Dr.George Riddoch wrote:When his final work on aphasia was finished we discussed the situation together. With his practical philosophy he accepted it at once, and his amazing power of adaptation enabled him to plan the rearrangement of his life. With his excellent general health he well knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> face — long years of steadily increasing physical disablement, with his mind unimpaired except in its capacity for continuous effort; {{in the grip of}} a relentless foe which medical science could not restrain. Without a word of self-pity, with distress only for his devoted wife's heavy burden, he set himself in his methodical way to make his plans, and nothing was omitted. It was as if he was dealing with one of his own patients. His attitude of mind, as always, was constructive and never defeatist. Essentially an individualist, whilst dependent upon friends and kindred spirits, he succeeded in keeping alive his wide interests and, through the attraction of his personality, the contacts which were necessary to him. Science, literature, music, human affairs, all retained their accustomed importance, although in a increasingly restricted sense as the enemy, whom he could not conquer, but who never defeated his active mind, encircled him ever more tightly. Each outpost lost led to new adjustments, every cold or minor ailment added to the rate of downward progress without hope of improvement. But his courage, tenacity and constructiveness remained unimpaired.|$|E

500|$|While at high school, Miller {{formed a}} trio that played at {{cocktail}} parties. His elder brother recommended that he listen to pianist Oscar Peterson, {{but there was}} no way of doing this in Greenwood until Peterson appeared on The Joey Bishop Show on television when Miller was about 14. After watching Peterson's performance, Miller decided to become a pianist: [...] "It was a life changing event. I knew right then that I would be a jazz pianist". Miller later mentioned Art Tatum and Erroll Garner as piano influences during his teenage years. Miller reported years later that he always found that playing fast was easy, so playing slowly and with more control were <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> work hardest on.|$|E

500|$|Historically, {{the press}} had enjoyed {{considerable}} prestige and respect to that point, though some Republicans complained of bias. But in his Des Moines speech, Agnew attacked the media, complaining that immediately after Nixon's speech, [...] "his words and policies {{were subjected to}} instant analysis and querulous criticism... by {{a small band of}} network commentators and self-appointed analysts, the majority of whom expressed {{in one way or another}} their hostility to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say... It was obvious that their minds were made up in advance." [...] Agnew continued, [...] "I am asking whether a form of censorship already exists when the news that forty million Americans receive each night is determined by a handful of men... and filtered through a handful of commentators who admit their own set of biases".|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{gameplay}} {{being created}} first, Mitsuda had difficulty pinning down <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do, and wrote songs for the soundtrack {{based on the}} gradually-emerging visuals and scenario. Mitsuda estimated that he had written around one hundred songs for the game including test tracks. The opening vocal track, titled [...] "Ring", was written for the opening movie and set {{to a piece of}} poetry written by Takahashi: to portray the themes of the game, Mitsuda used three female vocalists, Eri Kawai, Koko Komine, and Tamie Hirose, and recorded in a multiplexer to produce as clear a sound as possible. Kawai also performed vocal work for the track [...] "Destruction". For each of the location themes, Mitsuda used a different primary instrument to create an impression: for instance, for a desert location, he used a sitar, while a location dominated by machinery used electric guitar. All the instrument sounds were created using a synthesizer.|$|E

[...] In his junior year in 2000, he was a second-team All-American and first-team All-Conference USA, as he set school records by hitting three home runs in one game and 19 for the season; still, he went undrafted. [...] "He {{was kind of a}} square-shaped body, a guy [...] in a uniform didn't look all that athletic", Cleary said. [...] "He wasn't a tall, prospect-y looking guy.

500|$|In December 2003, Welling {{made his}} feature film debut as Charlie Baker, the oldest son and second oldest in the Baker family which had 12 children, {{in the family}} comedy Cheaper by the Dozen with Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, which is a remake of the 1950 movie {{starring}} Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy, based on [...] Frank and Lillian Gilbreth's 1948 book. Welling talked about why {{he was interested in}} the project in an interview with Paul Fischer: [...] "The top three reasons I decided to do this film were, one, Steve Martin, two, Steve Martin and three, Steve Martin. That was the number one draw for me. Then, after reading the script, I really liked this character, Charlie. I liked what he went through, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go through, and I felt I understood where he was coming from. And I just {{wanted to be a part}} of it." [...] Welling had always been a fan of Martin's and stated that he [...] "absolutely loved" [...] working with him.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{literary}} theorists have approached the Devotions as politically themed. Richard Strier, in particular, identifies the Devotions as an [...] "Arminian polemic", {{arguing that it}} was highly atypical of Donne to actually publish works, rather than merely let them circulate amongst friends. Both before and after ordination, Donne actively resisted publication, normally only publishing works {{that had been the}} result of a commission, such as The Anniversaries or Pseudo-Martyr. The Devotions, however, were [...] "literally rushed" [...] into print, with the volume being handed to the printers a month after he had recovered from his disease. Strier argues that Donne's rationale for publishing the Devotions matches his rationale for publishing a sermon, the Encaenia, the same year, to assert the importance of [...] "places, and of dayes, and of all outward meanes", because he felt some sense of urgency about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say. This is coupled with Devotion XVI, in which Donne explicitly comes out against Puritanism and is simultaneously [...] "purposely militant", deliberately frustrating the other extreme from Puritanism, where [...] "the Arminianism and the polemical anti-puritanism of the volume becomes explicit".|$|E
500|$|Biographers {{describe}} Rutherford as {{tall and}} solidly built with a senatorial demeanor, {{and a strong}} booming voice that helped make him a powerful orator. In 1917, The New York Times stated that Rutherford [...] "has a reputation as an eloquent, forceful speaker". Watch Tower Society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor. One Witness history book says that while Russell was kind, warm and tactful, Rutherford [...] "was warm and generous toward his associates {{but he was also}} a brusque and direct type of person, and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense." [...] Another Watch Tower Society account says he did not hide his feelings, adding, [...] "His bluntness, even when spoken in kindness, was sometimes misunderstood." [...] Fellow Watch Tower Society director A. H. Macmillan says Rutherford [...] "spoke as simply and directly to the people as he knew how, and he was an extremely forthright man. He was thoroughly convinced that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say was the truth and that {{it was a matter of}} life and death." [...] Macmillan added, [...] "He would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood the Bible to teach. He was so strict about that, he would permit nothing that would seem to show a compromise when it came to an issue of the truth." [...] Author Tony Wills describes him as charitable and generous, and says his sympathy for the poor and oppressed was exceeded only by his hatred for the rich, the oppressors. Wills also notes that he was a dynamic, impatient extrovert. Other authors also address Rutherford's abrasiveness: James Penton describes him as blunt and moody with an explosive temper, with [...] "a streak of self-righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of the Devil", while Alan Rogerson notes that he was a [...] "dogmatic and insensitive person, obsessed with his own self-importance." ...|$|E
