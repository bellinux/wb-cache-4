40|$|Abstract. Physical {{science has}} changed in the century since Lord Kelvin’s celebrated essay on Nineteenth Century Clouds over the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light, but some things are the same. Analogs <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> physics then and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> {{astronomy}} today serve to remind us why we can be confident the Virtual Observatory of the twenty-first century will have a rich list of challenges to explore. ...|$|R
25|$|In {{trying to}} {{appreciate}} how the quarter-wave plate transforms the linearly polarized light, {{it is important}} to realize that the two components discussed are not entities in and of themselves but are merely mental constructs one uses to help appreciate <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of linearly and circularly polarized light, at each point in space, there is always a single electric field with a distinct vector direction, the quarter-wave plate merely has the effect of transforming this single electric field.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} these {{multiple}} firings from multiple areas {{to be combined}} into a specific extrinsic event, there must be help from the dorsal thalamus. It is not proven whether the dorsal thalamus is the primary organizer, but it does fit the specific profile for collecting neuronal activity and rapidly coordinating between <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain and outside of it. The space {{in and around the}} dorsal thalamus, the thalomocortical area, is able to generate fast voltage-dependent membrane potential oscillations which allow it to react quickly to received messages. The types of channels that cover this area are presumed to be GABAergic. Since sensory awareness needs to be quick, the threshold for sodium and potassium in this area is quite low.|$|E
500|$|A word, phrase or {{topic that}} is {{mentioned}} at a greater rate than others {{is said to}} be a [...] "trending topic". Trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users, or because of an event that prompts people to talk about a specific topic. These topics help Twitter and their users to understand <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world and what people's opinions are about it.|$|E

It is argued that this expansion of forest research will bring it in potential competition with allied sciences but, {{in the world of}} tomorrow, this integrative nature will actually be the strength of forest science...|$|R

500|$|I, the Supreme {{is mostly}} {{composed}} of real texts by or about Francia. These range from personal memoirs by historical Paraguayan figures to passages from books written by Europeans in Paraguay at the time. [...] They are arranged by a 'Compiler' whose footnotes {{tell the story}} of how the book was put together. The body of the novel is composed of a polemical collection of versions of Paraguayan history. The first text is what the Supreme dictates to his assistant Patiño, about <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present. This includes the constant abuses Francia heaps upon Patiño and their attempts to discover the authors of a pasquinade, found nailed {{to the door of the}} Asunción Cathedral, that falsely announces Francia's death and burial arrangements. It is mostly Francia's vulgar rambling, including accusing meek Patiño of attempting to usurp him. The author of the pasquinade is never discovered in spite of their high scrutiny.|$|E
500|$|The album {{includes}} one acoustic song, [...] "Hero of War", {{which is}} about an Iraq War Veteran looking back on his war experiences. It is described by Rolling Stone as an [...] "ambivalent aggro-folk track". McIlrath said of the song, [...] "I {{wanted to take the}} perspective [...] of 'What is the war going to be looked back on as?'" [...] In another interview McIlrath stated, [...] "It was a way to document what's going on, like other artists documented for their generation and for generations to come." [...] He went on to say, [...] "There are not many songs...talking about what's going on during eight years of occupation in Iraq. That, combined with meeting active soldiers and retired soldiers at our shows and hearing those stories {{about what is going on}} on the ground amid all the bullshit, showed me the differences from what is really happening to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> news media. I just thought that this needed to go into a song." ...|$|E
500|$|Lim {{expressed}} concerns about a proposed constitutional amendment introduced in April 2010 {{that would allow}} magistrates to hear what are called [...] "first mentions" [...] through video conferencing. A first mention is a hearing that must be held within 48 hours of a person's arrest. She felt it failed to adequately assure accused people that {{they were allowed to}} complain to magistrates about injuries they had sustained or acts of misfeasance against them by the authorities. In response, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng assured MPs that processes would be in place to ensure that accused people are treated fairly. For example, during a video conference, an accused person will be alone in a room with no police officer, and {{will be able to see}} <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entire courtroom. Secondly, the screen that will be used by the judge is large enough to enable him or her to clearly see whether the accused is under duress. Finally, accused people who have been mistreated can either complain to the police or to the judge when they are later present in court.|$|E

He brought up that since the head of IRIB is selected by the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, Khamenei is either unaware of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> an organization under his control or he has direct control and is responsible for their programs.|$|R

500|$|There {{are about}} 200 minigames {{included}} in WarioWare: Smooth Moves, an amount similar to previous WarioWare titles. Abe determined which minigames were included after each team member wrote down an idea {{on a piece}} of paper and sent it to him. The minigames were inspired by [...] "very original, everyday life issues". To offer a different visual style for each minigame, developers were asked to make their own design for the minigame that they were working on. During development, one of the game's basic concepts was to [...] "make a different taste for every single game". The only rule that Abe imposed on the minigame designs was for the developers to make it instantly obvious as to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minigames. The Wii Remote's speaker is used in the game to [...] "add a greater sense of feel". For example, in one microgame, the player must bounce a tennis ball on a racquet. When the ball touches the racquet, the Wii Remote's speaker emits a bouncing sound and a rumble to [...] "add a very strong reality to the game". The game mostly forgoes the Wii nunchuk attachment and functions strictly with the Wii Remote. Its visual presentation is similar to [...] for the Nintendo GameCube, and it does not run in widescreen mode.|$|E
500|$|When {{writing a}} new script, Rucka tries {{to follow the}} world-building model used by William Gibson in Neuromancer and provide {{information}} about the environment through context instead of exposition. His biggest struggle is delivering details while maintaining a proper narrative pace. He sometimes self-censors [...] "exceptionally dark" [...] material {{because he does not}} want to make Lark draw it. After Lark receives a new script, the collaboration between them is [...] "immediate and constant". Lark questions Rucka about characterization and the direction of the story, resulting in rewrites and a better final product. Rucka says Lark intuitively knows <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story even when it isn't clearly scripted. Rucka and Lark have an ongoing conversation about how to show the injustice in the way Forever is treated without being complicit in it themselves. For example, medics must remove Forever's clothes to treat her wounds. Lark wanted to avoid sexualizing the images, but also avoid being [...] "coy" [...] by simply blocking parts of her body with another character's arm. The script gives Lark no direction for aspects like architecture, clothing, or vehicle design. Designing these technical details involves research into prototype technology and takes almost as long as drawing the actual pages for the comics. The time required to create the sets is the primary reason Lark sometimes falls behind schedule.|$|E

In addition, two other CP24 anchors would host the show, one co-hosting at 5pm {{and the other}} co-hosting at 5:30pm, bringing Toronto's Top Stories.

2500|$|In {{explaining}} {{the potential of}} cultural projects in the public sphere, the artist writes: “I try to understand <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, how the city can operate as a communicative environment… It {{is important to understand}} the circumstances under which communication is reduced or destroyed, and under what possible new conditions it can be provoked to reappear. How can aesthetic practice in the built environment contribute to critical discourse between the inhabitants themselves and the environment? How can aesthetic practice make existing symbolic structures respond to contemporary events?” For Wodiczko, disrupting the complacency of perception is imperative for passersby to stop, reflect, and perhaps even change their thinking; so he built his visual repertoire to evoke both the historical past and the political present.|$|E

Jeffrey Goldberg at The Atlantic described Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's repeated refusal to meet with representatives of J Street as a [...] "farce" [...] and added: [...] "He should argue with J Street, yell at J Street, grapple with J Street, {{but most of all}} meet with J Street. Those Israelis, and those American Jews, who believe that J Street, and the spirit it represents, are fleeting phenemona have absolutely no idea <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jewish world.|$|E
2500|$|Situation {{awareness}} involves {{being aware}} of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity to understand how information, events, and one's own actions will impact goals and objectives, both immediately and in the near future. One with an adept sense of situation awareness generally has {{a high degree of}} knowledge with respect to inputs and outputs of a system, an innate [...] "feel" [...] for situations, people, and events that play out because of variables the subject can control. Lacking or inadequate situation awareness has been identified as one of the primary factors in accidents attributed to human error. Thus, situation awareness is especially important in work environments where the information flow can be quite high and poor decisions may lead to serious consequences (such as piloting an airplane, functioning as a soldier, or treating critically ill or injured patients).|$|E

As he attends a {{travelling}} circus, he overhears a conversation between the ringmaster, Flotsam (Chafurin/Phil Proctor), and the town mayor, Need (Mitsuru Ogata/Alan Oppenheimer), in which Flotsam pressures Need to find a stone in the mines. He threatens that if the stone isn't found soon, he will tell the town's people about <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] "outside world". This would cause a panic, as the people of Palm Brinks do not leave the confines of the town. Flotsam sees Max, realizing that Max's red pendant is the stone he is looking for.

He also hopes to find his missing mother, who his father has told him is doing [...] "important work far away from here".|$|E
