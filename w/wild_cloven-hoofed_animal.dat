However, the interacting partners of VP 1 in host cells and the effects of these interactions in FMDV replication remain incompletely elucidated. Here, we identified a porcine cell protein, serine/threonine kinase 3 (STK 3), which interacts with FMDV VP 1 using the yeast two-hybrid system. The VP 1 -STK 3 interaction was further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in human embryonic kidney 293 T and porcine kidney 15 (PK- 15) cells. The carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 180 – 214) of VP 1 was essential for its interaction with STK 3. The effects of overexpression and underexpressing of STK 3 in PK- 15 cells were assessed, and the results indicated that STK 3 significantly inhibited FMDV replication.

30|$|Southern African rangelands support both {{livestock}} and a rich diversity of wildlife, {{with the latter}} also central to national economies and conservation efforts. One wild animal often mentioned in the same line with FMD outbreaks in livestock {{in the region is}} the African buffalo, though restricted to wildlife areas in Botswana. This is because African buffalo (one of the ‘big five’ and a tourist attraction) are a known natural reservoir for SAT-type FMDV in southern Africa (Condy and Hedger 1974; Mapitse 1998), which makes control of FMDV not only challenging but its eradication untenable in the near future. The role of other <b>wild</b> <b>cloven-hoofed</b> <b>animals</b> apart from the African buffalo in virus maintenance and transmission of FMD has been extensively researched in southern Africa (e.g. Anderson et al. 1993; Letshwenyo et al. 2006; Vosloo et al. 2009; Weaver et al. 2013). Thus, the presence of wild ungulates in the study area such as the greater kudu (T. strepsiceros) and impala (A. melampus), which are known intermediary transmitters of FMDV, makes outbreaks likely. This is even more so due to an increased elephant population (an Appendix I CITES species and one of the ‘big five’, approximately 200, 000 in Botswana) which damages the non-electrified cordon fence, thus enabling smaller ungulates including possibly infected livestock to cross undeterred.|$|R

Pigs {{are more susceptible to}} foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) via the gastrointestinal route, highlighting the importance of mucosal immunity to avoid initial infection, virus replication and spread. Systemic vaccines are in general poor inducers of mucosal immunity. A subunit vaccine that has the entire FMDV capsid polyprotein-coding region, delivered by replication-defective human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad 5 -A 24) has proven to be very effective against FMDV when inoculated intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC), but very little is known about its efficacy when administered via a mucosal route. We hypothesized that Ad 5 -A 24 could induce mucosal immunity and that immune response could be enhanced when this vaccine is coadministered with Ad 5 -vectored E. coli heat labile enterotoxin as a mucosal adjuvant. Specifically, four different LT-mutants (LTK 63, LTR 72, and LTB) were cloned into Ad 5 -vector and were tested in animals after intranasal (IN) administration. After two IN inoculations of Ad 5 -A 24 + Ad 5 -LTR 72, mice were protected against a lethal challenge of homologous FMDV. Furthermore, pigs inoculated with Ad 5 -A 24 + Ad 5 -LTR 72 IN and boosted IM were better protected than pigs inoculated IN-IN, after an overwhelming challenge of FMDV A 24. Further evaluation of specific immune response as well as the protective efficacy of Ad 5 -LTR 72 should be addressed with the appropriate challenge dose.

In southern africa the south african territories (Sat) 1 - 3 Sero-types of fmd virus are maintained by large numbers of african buffaloes (Syncerus caffer), Which provide a potential source of infection for domestic livestock and wild animals. During february 2001, an outbreak of sat- 2 was recorded in cattle in the fmd control zone of south africa, adjacent to the kruger national park (Knp). They had not been vaccinated against the disease since they form the buffer between the vaccination and free zones but {{in the face of the}} outbreak, they were vaccinated as part of the control measures to contain the disease. The virus was, however, isolated from some of them on several occasions up to may 2001. These isolates were characterized to determine the rate of genetic change in the main antigenic determinant, the 1 d/ 2 a gene. Nucleotide substitutions at 12 different sites were identified of which five led to amino acid changes. Three of these occurred in known antigenic sites, viz. The gh-loop and c-terminal part of the protein, and two of these have previously been shown to be subject to positive selection.

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is {{a highly}} {{infectious}} disease of <b>wild</b> and domestic <b>cloven–hoofed</b> <b>animals</b> such as cattle, swine and deer. It is caused {{by one of the}} most contagious animal diseases known; FMD virus (FMDV). Since the disease is endemic in many countries, transmission by international travel/trade presents an on-going potential threat to the UK. Very little is known at the molecular level about how FMDV replicates within host cells. In this study, FMDV replicons have been used to investigate FMDV RNA replication and to improve our understanding of the viral life cycle: a process which will aid in the production {{of a new generation of}} live-attenuated vaccine candidate strains. Sequences encoding the capsid coding region of the genome have been replaced with green fluorescent protein (GFP) such that replication can be monitored in live cells via GFP fluorescence. This provides a rapid, non-invasive screen for replicative fitness that can be used outwith high disease security facilities. Differences between replicating and non-replicating forms could easily be distinguished, highlighting the potential of this system to screen for attenuated genomes. The FMDV replicon system was improved through a series of construct modifications until an optimal system was produced. A range of different methods were used to attenuate the replication of these genomes. Of major significance is the finding that increasing dinucleotide frequencies were shown to decrease growth kinetics of Echovirus 7 – as opposed to altering the codon-pair bias - and the application of this finding to construction of further replicon systems (and RNA viruses in general) is described...|$|R

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{contagious}} infectious diseases of domestic and <b>wild</b> <b>cloven-hoofed</b> <b>animals,</b> particular in cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and domestic buffalo, as well as wild ruminants such as deer. In Taiwan, there was a severe outbreak of FMD after more than 60 years freedom from the disease. The virus strain, O Taiwan 97 from the March 1997 outbreak of FMD in Taiwan, however, has been shown to have a species-specific adaptation to pigs. Although there are 7 distinct serotypes of FMD found in different regions of the world, this study focuses on the pig-adapted type O strain of FMD. After the FMD outbreak commenced in Taiwan, the spread of disease was very rapid and the whole of the western parts of Taiwan was affected within a few days after the diagnosis of FMD was confirmed. In some situations airborne transmission of FMD virus was suspected and it was speculated that this was the explanation for such rapid spread in Taiwan. Therefore, studies were conducted to investigate the transmissibility of O Taiwan/ 97 FMDV to susceptible pigs by direct and indirect spread including airborne spread in an enclosed animal house. This study showed that pigs in direct contact with challenged pigs became infected but none of the close-contact pigs became infected. These experiments clearly demonstrated that the pig adapted strain O Taiwan/ 97 was only efficiently transmitted by direct contact. This indicates that effective control against future outbreaks of pig adapted FMDV strains could be achieved by restriction of pig movement and stamping out if the outbreak has been detected in the early stages and prior to the movements of pigs from the infected premises. The measures used to control the Taiwanese FMD outbreak in 1997 were initially the slaughter of whole herds in the infected premises. However, with the rapid spread and large numbers of cases, the decision was taken to use universal compulsory vaccination of pig herds to control the outbreak when sufficient supply of vaccines was organized. Type O FMD vaccines were imported from a number of major FMD vaccine manufactures from around the world. Initially, vaccine efficacy for the imported vaccines was tested by measurement of neutralizing antibody titers in vaccinated pigs. To establish the relationship between serum neutralizing titers and protection from foot and mouth disease in pigs after vaccination, challenge studies were conducted with O/Taiwan/ 97 FMD in vaccinated pigs. Additionally, antibody responses to structural (neutralizing antibody) and non-structural proteins (NSP) were evaluated in vaccinated pig herds after primary and secondary vaccination in herds infected before and after vaccination. In order to be able to monitor the circulation of virus in vaccinated pig populations, valid diagnostic kits based on the detection of antibody against NSP were required. These tests needed to be evaluated against pig sera derived from challenge studies and natural FMD outbreaks. Three commercially available ELISAs (Cedi, UBI and Checkit), which were available to differentiate infected from vaccinated pigs, were tested and results showed that the Cedi test had the optimal sensitivity and specificity for pig adapted type O FMD testing. This test was used to retrospectively evaluate the sera collected from infected and non-infected pig herds collected sequentially in the year after the 1997 FMD outbreak in Taiwan. These studies also showed that the early vaccines used, stimulated NSP antibody production in swine herds that were vaccinated but not infected. This resulted in the requirement for purified FMD vaccines to be used when monitoring programs for FMD infection by NSP testing were in place. In these studies, it was also demonstrated that the purified FMD vaccines used later in the control program did not induce NSP antibody after multiple double dosage to pigs. Although clinical FMD appeared to be successfully controlled with vaccination program in Taiwan it was essential for the eradication plan to maintain active surveillance for NSP reactors in the pig population. The UBI and Cedi NSP kits were applied as screening and confirmatory tests, respectively, to pig sera collected in auction markets distributed around Taiwan to monitor for evidence of the circulation of FMD virus. Herds with positive reactors were followed-up by clinical inspection and 15 sera from suspected herds were further sampled. Negative results were obtained from all these investigation. With the absence of clinical outbreaks and the lack of evidence of FMDV circulation in the field from the NSP reactor surveillance, the Taiwanese government has progressed the eradication plan to a progressive cessation of vaccination, commencing with banning of vaccination on one isolated island in December 2006. The absence of outbreaks on that island, paved the way for further cessation of FMD vaccination in Taiwan from July 2008...|$|R

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) {{causes the}} most {{contagious}} transboundary disease of animals, affecting both <b>wild</b> and domestic <b>cloven-hoofed</b> <b>animals.</b> Similarly to other RNA viruses, FMDV is highly variable {{as a result}} of the inherent low fidelity of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The accumulation of this variability and relatedness between FMDV sequences was used to provide evidence for modes of transmission (fomite) as well as a constant clock rate across two FMDV topotypes (~ 8. 70 x 10 - 3 substitutions/site/year), during the 1967 UK FMD epidemic, using full genome consensus sequencing. However, during an epidemic, virus replicates within multiple animals, where it is also replicating and evolving within different tissues and cells. Each scale of evolution, from a single cell to multiple animals across the globe, involves evolutionary processes that shape the viral diversity generated below the level of the consensus. During this PhD project, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to dissect the fine scale viral population diversity of FMDV. Collaboration with the Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine at the University of Glasgow provided the specialist bioinformatic and statistical capabilities required for the analysis of NGS datasets. As part of this collaboration, a new systematic approach was developed to process NGS data and distinguish genuine mutations from artefacts. Additionally, evolutionary models were applied to this data to estimate parameters such as the genome-wide mutation rate of FMDV (upper limit of 7. 8 x 10 - 4 per nt). Analysis of the mutation spectra generated from a clonal control study established a mutation frequency threshold of 0. 5 % above which there can be confidence that 95 % of mutations are real in the sense that they are present in the sampled virus population. This threshold, together with an optimized protocol, was used for the more extensive investigation of within and between host viral population dynamics during transmission. Analysis of mutation spectra and site-specific mutations revealed that intra-host bottlenecks are typically more pronounced than inter-host bottlenecks. NGS analysis has distinguished between the population structure of multiple samples taken from a single host, which may provide the means to reconstruct both intra- and inter-host transmission routes in the future.

40|$|Abstract Background Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an {{extremely}} contagious viral disease of cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and many <b>cloven-hoofed</b> <b>wild</b> <b>animals.</b> FMDV serotypes O and Asia 1 have circulated separately in China during the last fifty years, and eliminating infected animals and vaccination are the main policies to prevent and control FMD. Antibodies to NSPs exist in infected animals, and were utilized to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals. The reliability of detection of 3 AB or 3 ABC antibodies is {{higher than that of}} other NSPs. The test of 3 AB is still credible because 3 C protein's immunogenicity is the weakest. The 2 C protein, immediately N-terminal of 3 AB, was used to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals. The use of the immunochromatographic strip is facile for clinical laboratories lacking specialized equipment and for rapid field diagnosis. Results In this study, an immunochromatographic strip with non-structural protein (NSP) 2 C' 3 AB was developed and validated to differentiate foot-and-mouth disease infected from vaccinated animals. A part of N-terminal of 2 C protein gene and whole 3 AB gene were connected and prokaryotically expressed as the antigens labeled with colloidal gold was used as the detector, the 2 C' 3 AB protein and rabbits anti- 2 C' 3 AB antibodies were blotted on the nitrocellulose(NC) membrane for the test and control lines, respectively. 387 serum samples were collected to evaluate the characteristics of the strip in comparison with existing commercial 3 ABC antibody ELISA kit. The coincidence rate of pigs negative serum, pigs vaccinated serum, pigs infected serum was 100 %, 97. 2 %, 95. 0 %, respectively. The coincidence rate of cattle negative serum, cattle vaccinated serum, cattle infected serum was 100 %, 96. 7 %, 98. 0 %, respectively.

50|$|Foot {{and mouth}} disease virus (FMDV) {{is a part}} of the aphthovirus genera. Foot and mouth disease virus {{primarily}} is found in <b>cloven-hoofed</b> <b>animals</b> such as pigs and cows and causes severe fever for the first couple of days and then blisters in the foot and mouth of the animal. FMDV does not cross over or infect humans but is extremely infectious within <b>cloven-hoofed</b> <b>animals.</b> Foot and mouth disease 3C protease activity is responsible for the fragmentation of golgi apparatus and inhibition of microtubule regrowth. 3C protease activity is responsible for the loss of tethering of microtubules to the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) region. Both of proteolytic effects on the host cell inhibit the transport of cellular proteins to the plasma membrane. This destruction of the secretory pathway reduces expression of major histocompatibility antigens at plasma membrane therefore slowing secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Hepatitis A 3C proteinase is a member of the cysteine proteases that are responsible for the infectivity and maturation of HAV. Hepatitis A 3C protease cleaves NEMO at the Q304 residue; NEMO is a NF-κB essential modulator responsible for activation of interferon (IFN) antiviral response. Cys24Ser (C24S) is a homolog of Hepatitis 3C proteinase, is responsible for inactivating Cys172 through alkylation of the sulfur at its active site. The sulfur alkylation of Cys172 causes inactivity while the N-alkylation of His102 causes a significant rise in enzymatic activity. Modification of enzymatic activity can be controlled by solution or crystallized N-iodoacetyl-valine-phenylalanine-amide (IVF). Therefore, IVF controls proteolytic inhibition through interactions with active site of enzyme.|$|R

At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|R

A total of twenty field isolates belonging to serotype Asia 1, collected from different states in India during 1986 - 2002 were taken as BHK- 21 cell culture adapted virus from the National Repository of FMDV at the Project Directorate on Foot-and-Mouth Disease (PD FMD). RT-PCR {{products of the}} revived viruses were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the gel-purified products were subjected to cycle sequencing in an automated sequencer. Vpg protein, which on uridylation serves as a primer during FMDV replication is found conserved across serotypes O, A and C. The sequences generated in the present work were compared with respect to other serotypes {{with the objective of}} investigating the amino acid variability of the three redundant copies of VPg proteins in a diverse group field isolates of type Asia 1...|$|R
40|$|Foot-and-mouth {{disease is}} an {{extremely}} infectious and devastating disease affecting all species of <b>cloven-hoofed</b> <b>animals.</b> To understand the epidemiology of the causative virus and predict viral transmission dynamics, quantified transmission parameters are essential to decision makers and modellers alike. However, such quantified parameters are scarcely available, and recently a series of animal experiments {{was set up to}} obtain such data experimentally. In this communication, however, we report on the use of data from an animal experiment conducted 10 years ago to quantify transmission of foot-and-mouth disease virus between non-vaccinated sheep and from sub-clinically infected sheep to in-contact pigs. This new analysis utilises a state-of-the-art Generalised Linear Model to estimate the transmission rate. From the obtained results it is concluded that meta-analysis of "old" experiments using newly developed techniques can provide useful data to replace, reduce and refine future foot-and-mouth disease transmission experiments, thereby minimising animal suffering for research purposes...|$|R

The practical part contains profiles of six hobby industries, in which a field investigations has been carried out. During this investigation, photographs of buildings and equipment were taken in the game reserves. The practical part also contains a map plotting all game preserves buildings and equipment. Another part of the practical part of the work focused on the real skills of the individual field devices. When building structures and hunting equipment in specialized game preserves, but also on free hunting grounds, may be taken into consideration to conclude this work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMVD), one of {{the most}} {{contagious}} viruses of <b>cloven-hoofed</b> <b>animals,</b> may cause a prolonged, asymptomatic but persistent infection in ruminants, named the "carrier state". However, it remains an open question whether this carrier state occurs in pigs. Here we present quantitative analyses of the duration of FMDV RNA and infectivity in lymphoid and epithelial tissues in experimentally infected pigs with FMDV C-S 8 c 1. The data indicated that although FMDV RNA remained in blood until day 14 post-infection (pi), viremia was cleared by day 7 pi. However, all tissues tested were positive for FMDV until day 14 - 17 pi. Interestingly, the specific infectivity of FMDV in these tissues was in some cases even higher than the FMDV C-S 8 c 1. We therefore propose that a "pseudopersistent state" may occur in pigs in which virus replicates in lymphoid tissues for a prolonged period of time, thereby representing a potential source of virus. </p...|$|R
40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease affecting <b>cloven-hoofed</b> <b>animals.</b> Characteris-tic clinical signs of FMD include pyrexia, salivation, and lameness, with vesicles and erosions in the mouth, on the feet, and on the teats [1 - 3]. Once FMD invades a FMD-free country, susceptible animals on infected farms and surrounding areas are often culled to eradicate the disease. This causes serious economic losses to farmers and live-stock industries, both from direct losses and the suspen-sion of international trade in animal products. In April 2010, there was a large-scale FMD outbreak in Miyazaki Prefecture in Japan. Miyazaki Prefecture was the primary livestock production area of the country [4], with 315, 000 cattle at a density of 165. 0 farms/ 100 km 2 and 915, 000 pigs at a density of 9. 8 farms/ 100 km 2. A total of 292 infected farms were detected before the last case o...|$|R
