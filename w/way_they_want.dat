5|$|NHL 17, an {{ice hockey}} {{simulation}} video game, uses the Ignite engine, created by Electronic Arts. During a game, players maneuver around the ice with normal skating and deking {{and are able}} to seamlessly pass to teammates to create scoring chances. If a player scores a goal, they are able to celebrate the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to; many new celebrations were added to the game. One newly added celebration was a mimicked version of baseball player José Bautista's iconic bat flip that occurred during the 2015 American League Division Series. Defensively, the player can skate their way to the puck carrier and have a chance to break up the play. The player has multiple ways of doing so; pushing the carrier off of the puck, delivering a body check, or pushing them towards the boards of the ice. If they wish, the player can enable the On-Ice Trainer, a system made to assist the player as they play. NHL 17 features game presentation {{in the style of the}} NHL on NBC, with commentary being provided by Mike Emrick (play-by-play), Eddie Olczyk (color) and Ray Ferraro (ice-side reporter), with the network's score bug appearing on-screen as well.|$|E
25|$|Still {{the best}} {{club in the}} world for me because it doesn't care about being the best club in the world. The guys do what they want, the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> and it {{continually}} works. No VIP, no mirrors in the bathroom, no expensive cocktails, just a good sound system and great crowd.|$|E
25|$|Prince of Persia {{features}} open world exploration {{that allows}} the player to travel to any spot in the game world at any given point, and allows the player to witness the plot in any <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> Depending on how the player progresses, previously visited areas will become more challenging to traverse when the player re-visits them. However, when the player heals a spot of land, it becomes devoid of traps. The traps are manifested in various forms of the antagonist Ahriman's Corruption; black-colored blobs that coat the land and swallow the player if touched. The player can use acrobatic maneuvers to avoid these traps.|$|E

They succeeded in breaking him, just not in the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted.</b> <b>They</b> even tried mating him with another merwoman named Lori.|$|R
50|$|The show {{also allows}} the guest to {{reconstruct}} any moment in television {{history in the}} <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> it to happen, in a short sketch shown {{at the end of}} the show usually parodying a clip discussed earlier.|$|R
5000|$|Stratego allowed {{players to}} set up their army any <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted.</b> In Legends, an army could become nearly invincible if a player was allowed {{to set up}} as <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> (because all pieces have special powers). For this reason, the pieces were [...] "shuffled", and set up randomly, as were the terrain spaces.|$|R
25|$|The {{spectrum}} {{property rights}} model advocates that the spectrum resources {{should be treated}} like land, i.e. private ownership of spectrum portions should be permitted. The allocation of these portions should be implemented by means of market forces. The spectrum owners {{should be able to}} trade these portions in secondary markets. Alternatively, the spectrum owners would be able to use their bands in any <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> through any technology they prefer (service and technology neutrality). Although the spectrum property rights model advocates exclusive allocation of transmission rights, it {{is not the same as}} a licensed regime. The main difference is the service and technology neutrality advocated in the spectrum property rights approach, as opposed to strict requirements on services and communications technologies inherent in licensed governance regimes.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "The Life" [...] was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews from music critics. Joey Nolfi of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "summer banger", noting its use of [...] "upbeat, danceable production, with a tropically-tinged drop building to a purely-pop chorus." [...] Madeline Roth of MTV, called the song, [...] "a summer anthem in the making", and noted the song's themes of [...] "self-care" [...] and [...] "the importance of living stress-free". Writing for Vulture, Dee Lockett thought [...] "The Life" [...] generates a feeling as if one is [...] "floating on a summer breeze." [...] Lockett continues his review by acknowledging the success of Fifth Harmony's life, saying it is their [...] "God-given right of any young girl group" [...] to live the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to live. Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson from British entertainment website Digital Spy, listed the song at number one on their top 10 playlist songs, calling it an [...] "urban bop with an earworm refrain". They also labelled it a [...] "sunny pop number" [...] referring to the summer atmosphere the song has.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Soldier" [...] is a {{continuation}} of the previous song on Destiny Fulfilled, [...] "Lose My Breath". As the singers feel that their man does not fulfill them in the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> they tell him [...] "I need a soldier", further [...] "upping their standards". They request their man to be a [...] "", proclaiming their love for [...] "country boys"; their preference include a [...] "soldier" [...] who is [...] "street" [...] and [...] "hood". MacPherson further felt that the trio cruised the ghetto for suitable men with [...] "Soldier", an [...] "ode to gangsta love". Corey Moss of MTV felt that the song {{was one of the most}} personal moments on Destiny Fulfilled in the sense that Beyoncé's then-relatively secret relationship with rapper Jay-Z was acknowledged [...] "on record for the first time". Moss further elaborated, [...] "Albeit minor, her [...] verse (about falling for a guy from the BK, as in Jay's Brooklyn stomping grounds) offers a rare moment of commentary on the couple, which has thus far only been chronicled by tabloid photographers." [...] The song opens with T.I. rhyming lines and glorifying the profound love [...] "between a thug and a thugette". As the song progresses, each member of Destiny's Child describes their own favorite type of man, later harmonizing together for the chorus. Midway through the song, Lil Wayne's verse contains a reference to rapper B.G.. Williams is the last artist to sing her solo lines, which were described as [...] "the sexiest" [...] by Rashod Ollisong of The Baltimore Sun.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, Massive Attack {{started a}} label {{distributed}} by Virgin/EMI, Melankolic, and signed Craig Armstrong {{and a number}} of other artists such as Horace Andy, Alpha, Sunna, and Day One.

50|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with The New York Times, Martensen said {{health care in}} the United States left many stakeholders dissatisfied.

2500|$|New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg {{strongly}} {{endorsed the}} project, saying that Ground Zero was a [...] "very appropriate place" [...] for a mosque, because it [...] "tells the world" [...] that the U.S. has {{freedom of religion}} for everyone. Responding to opposition, he said: The government should never, never {{be in the business}} of telling people how they should pray, or where they can pray. We want to make sure that everybody from around the world feels comfortable coming here, living here, and praying the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to pray.|$|E
2500|$|A {{business}} partner or alliance can be crucial for businesses. However, businesses can not choose {{business partner}}s in any <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> In many instances, the potential partner {{might not be}} interested in forming a business relationship, also known as business mating. It is important that {{both sides of the}} agreement complement each other, but also that there are some common ground. For example, in management style, mindset, and also technology. If, for example, management style would be too different between the firms then a partnership could be problematic. Kask and Linton (2013) [...] investigate under what conditions business mating (formation) takes place for startup firms seeking business partners.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{described a}} plot to disrupt Libya by foreign secret services."To those services, child killing is nothing new. In this <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to prevent Libya from playing {{an important role in}} the Arab World and to disturb calm in the country. The killing of the children by that virus is a means by which those secret services achieve their ends" [...] In calling for the death penalty the prosecutor said:"These people have no moral human feelings once they have killed those children. They have sold themselves to the devil, even though the Jamahiriya has given them the right to work and live without let or hindrance."

2500|$|I couldn't {{understand}} the words. I {{wanted to hear}} the words. It was a great song, [...] "Maggie's Farm," [...] and the sound was distorted. I ran over to {{the guy at the}} controls and shouted, [...] "Fix the sound so you can hear the words." [...] He hollered back, [...] "This is the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> it." [...] I said [...] "Damn it, if I had an axe, I'd cut the cable right now." [...] But I was at fault. I was the MC, and I could have said to the part of the crowd that booed Bob, [...] "you didn't boo Howlin' Wolf yesterday. He was electric!" [...] Though I still prefer to hear Dylan acoustic, some of his electric songs are absolutely great. Electric music is the vernacular of {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, to use my father's old term.|$|E
2500|$|When first released, [...] "Brand New Key" [...] {{was banned}} by some radio {{stations}} because some heard sexual innuendo in the lyrics. Melanie has acknowledged {{the possibility of}} reading an unintended sexual innuendo in the song, stating, [...] "I wrote [...] in about fifteen minutes one night. I thought it was cute; a kind of old thirties tune. I guess a key and a lock have always been Freudian symbols, and pretty obvious ones at that. There was no deep serious expression behind the song, but people read things into it. They made up incredible stories {{as to what the}} lyrics said and what the song meant. In some places, it was even banned from the radio [...] My idea about songs is that once you write them, you have very little say in their life afterward [...] People will take it any <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to take it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Echlin's {{article in}} The Guardian, six reasons for {{choosing}} polyamory are identified: a drive towards female independence and equality driven by feminism; disillusionment with monogamy; a yearning for community; honesty and realism {{in respect of}} relational nature of human beings; human nature; and individual non-matching of the traditional monogamous stereotype. Jim Fleckenstein, director of the Institute for 21st-Century Relationships, is quoted as stating that the polyamory movement has been driven not only by science fiction, but also by feminism: [...] "Increased financial independence means that women can build relationships the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to." [...] The disillusionment with monogamy {{is said to be}} [...] "because of widespread cheating and divorce". The longing for community is associated with a felt need for the richness of [...] "complex and deep relationships through extended networks" [...] in response to the replacement and fragmentation of the extended family by nuclear families. [...] "For many", Echlin writes, [...] "it is a hankering for community... we have become increasingly alienated, partly because of the 20th century's replacement of the extended family with the nuclear family. As a result, many of us are striving to create complex and deep relationships through extended networks of multiple lovers and extended families... Polys agree that some people are monogamous by nature. But some of us are not, and more and more are refusing to be shoehorned into monogamy." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{second issue}} for the market was that each sell-side firm had a {{specific}} <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> their algorithms to be displayed on the buy-side OMS, with controls in the user interface arranged logically for easy order entry. Again this proved a challenge for the buy-side systems vendors, as each new screen for each sell-side broker required dedicated development and testing effort.|$|R
50|$|Franjo Tuđman and Ankica Žumbar {{were married}} on 25 May 1945 at the Belgrade city council.

60|$|The Bishop {{has just}} spoken of a {{condition}} of things which {{none of us can}} deny, and which ought not to exist; that is, the lust of gain--a lust which does not stop short of the penitentiary or the jail to accomplish its ends. But we may be sure of one thing, and that is that this sort of thing is not universal. If it were, this country would not be. You may put this down as a fact: that out of every fifty men, forty-nine are clean. Then why is it, you may ask, that the forty-nine don't have things the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> them? I'll tell you why it is. A good deal has been said here to-night about what is to be accomplished by organization. That's just the thing. It's because the fiftieth fellow and his pals are organized and the other forty-nine are not that the dirty one rubs it into the clean fellows every time.|$|E

Oh, I don't say their laughter's quite innocent, though it's genuine in its <b>way.</b> <b>They</b> <b>want</b> old Jink, and they couldn't do without him. I don't say I'm quite innocent.

But that's all past and gone, and nowadays {{the only thing that}} flies in an American ship is a belaying-pin. You don't know, you haven't a guess. How {{would you like to go}} on deck for your middle watch, fourteen months on end, with all your duty to do, and every one's life depending on you, and expect to get a knife ripped into you as you come out of your state-room, or be sand-bagged as you pass the boat, or get tripped into the hold if the hatches are off in fine weather? That kind of shakes the starch out of the brotherly love and New Jerusalem business. You go through the mill, and you'll have a bigger grudge against every old shellback that dirties his plate in the three oceans than the Bank of California could settle up. No; it has an ugly look to it, but the only way to run a ship is to make yourself a terror." ...|$|E
