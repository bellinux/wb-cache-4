5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the {{population}} of Belgium was overwhelmingly Catholic. Jews made up the largest non-Christian population in the country, numbering between 70–75,000 out of a population of 8 million. Most lived in the cities of Antwerp, Brussels, Charleroi and Liège. The vast majority were recent immigrants to Belgium <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fled</b> persecution in Germany and Eastern Europe, and, as a result, only a small minority actually possessed Belgian citizenship.|$|E

5|$|It is more {{reliably}} recorded that in 1455 the Bishop of Caithness, William Mudy, granted Stroma {{and other}} lands and castles {{to his brother}} Gilbert. It eventually passed {{into the hands of}} the Sinclair family, who have held the title of Earl of Caithness since 1455. In 1659 George Sinclair, the 6th Earl of Caithness, granted the wadset of Stroma to John Kennedy of Kermuck, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fled</b> to the far north after being outlawed following the fatal wounding of John Forbes of Watertown.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1965 that {{recruitment}} of fighters increased along with popular support, and the strike teams were able to increase in size. The increase in popular support was {{in part due to}} FRELIMO agencies' offer of help to exiled Mozambicans, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fled</b> the conflict by travelling to nearby Tanzania. Like similar conflicts against the French and United States forces in Vietnam, the insurgents also used landmines to a great extent to injure the Portuguese forces, thus straining the armed forces' infrastructure and demoralising soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Moscoso {{worked to}} end Panama's role in {{international}} crime, passing new laws against money laundering and supporting tax transparency.

On 18 April 1991, John Shalikashvili took command of the U.S.-led operation to ensure security for UN relief operations and the Kurdish refugees, called Operation Provide Comfort (OPC).|$|E
5|$|Richard {{was reduced}} to a figurehead with little power. As a result of the Merciless Parliament, de Vere and Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fled</b> abroad, were sentenced to death in their absence. Alexander Neville, Archbishop of York, had all his {{possessions}} confiscated. Several of Richard's council were executed. On John of Gaunt's return from Spain, Richard was able to re-establish his power, having Gloucester murdered in captivity in Calais. Warwick was stripped of his title. Bolingbroke and Mowbray were exiled.|$|E
5|$|The early 1940s was of {{particular}} importance in American art as American scene painting (Regionalism) {{came to be seen}} as an inadequate mode of artistic expression in a tumultuous time.

5|$|Alexander Aldea went to Adrianople to do {{homage to}} the Ottoman Sultan, Murad II, in 1432. Vlad wanted to invade Wallachia {{with the support of}} Wallachian boyars (or noblemen) <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fled</b> to Transylvania, but Alexander Aldea's {{principal}} official, Albu, prevented the invasion. Sigismund authorized Vlad to buy weapons and muster an army of exiled boyars only in 1434. In 1435, Alexander Aldea fell seriously ill and never recovered. Taking advantage of his brother's illness, Vlad broke into Wallachia, but Alexander Aldea and his Ottoman allies forced him to retreat.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century Jacobite Risings, Orkney {{was largely}} Jacobite in its sympathies. At {{the end of}} the 1715 rebellion, a large number of Jacobites <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fled</b> north from {{mainland}} Scotland sought refuge on Orkney and were helped on to safety in Sweden. In 1745, the Jacobite lairds on the islands ensured that Orkney remained pro-Jacobite in outlook, and was a safe place to land supplies from Spain to aid their cause. Orkney was the last place in the British Isles that held out for the Jacobites and was not retaken by the British Government until 24 May 1746, over a month after the defeat of the main Jacobite army at Culloden.|$|E
5|$|In February 1928 Peng joined general Ho Chien when Ho {{defected}} back to Chiang's forces, {{and gained}} a promotion to full colonel after rejoining Chiang. After rejoining Chiang's Nanjing government, Peng {{was stationed in}} the mountainous Pingjiang County, northwest of Changsha. His orders were to eliminate local groups of communist guerrillas <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fled</b> to the area following the Shanghai massacre of 1927. Because Peng had secretly joined the Chinese Communist Party, he instead kept his unit passive and began to organize local Communist Party branches. Peng made contact with local communist guerillas, nominally attached to the forces of Mao Zedong and Zhu De, and decided to issue a pronouncement {{in favor of the}} Communists on July 18, 1928.|$|E

5|$|Jose Sarria {{was born}} to Julio Sarria and Maria Dolores Maldonado. His parents did not marry and his father showed no {{interest}} in his son's life. Maria initially raised José Julio Sarria on her own, but when this became too difficult she placed him with another couple. Both they and his mother indulged his early interest in wearing girl's clothing. Sarria showed an affinity for languages, which led to his first serious romance with another man. Sarria tutored Paul Kolish, an Austrian baron <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fled</b> from the Nazis. Sarria and Kolish fell in love, and their relationship endured until Kolish and his son {{were killed in a}} car accident in 1947.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the city}} walls, suburbs had sprung up {{providing}} {{homes for the}} craftsmen and tradespeople who flocked to the already overcrowded city. These were shanty towns with wooden shacks and no sanitation. The government had tried to control this development but had failed and {{over a quarter of}} a million people lived here. Other immigrants had taken over fine town houses, vacated by Royalists <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fled</b> the country during the Commonwealth, converting them into tenements with different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested slums.|$|E
5|$|The brief trial {{opened on}} July 8, 1963.

Five officers were acquitted, while the remainder were imprisoned for terms ranging from five to ten years. Another VNQDĐ leader Vũ Hồng Khanh was given six years in prison. Former Diệm cabinet minister Phan Khắc Sửu was sentenced to eight years, mainly for being a signatory of the Caravelle Group which called on Diệm to reform. Dan, the spokesman was sentenced to seven years. Fourteen of the civilians were acquitted, including Tam.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between Casimir IV and Matthias Corvinus became tense in early 1471. After Stephen failed to support Poland, Casimir IV dispatched an embassy to Moldavia, insisting that Stephen should comply with his obligations. Stephen met the Polish envoys in Vaslui on 13 July, reminding {{them of the}} hostile acts Polish noblemen committed along the border and demanded the extradition of the Moldavian boyars <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fled</b> to Poland. In parallel, he sent his own envoys to Hungary to start negotiations with Corvinus. He granted commercial privileges to Saxon merchants from the Transylvanian town of Corona (now Brașov) on 3 January 1472.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of 1991 saw the fiercest {{fighting}} of the war, as the 1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia culminated in the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar. The Battle of Vukovar ended on 18 November, when the JNA captured the city after nearly three months of fighting. At the same time, Croatian Serb authorities began systematically expelling non-Serb civilians from areas under their control. The expulsions {{in the area of}} eastern Slavonia were primarily motivated by the aim of changing the ethnic composition in favour of Serbs as well as the resettling of Serb refugees <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fled</b> western Slavonia following Operation Swath-10 by the Croatian Army.|$|E
5|$|After Soviet units {{completed}} the {{operation in the}} towns, they ordered a full-scale deportation of all resident Armenians in the two towns, helicoptering them to Nagorno-Karabakh's capital, Stepanakert, and later to Armenia proper. Supplanting the previous occupants were Azerbaijani refugees <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>fled</b> from Armenia to Azerbaijan during the previous three years of fighting. Initial public outcry denounced the launching of the operation as the Soviet and Azerbaijani governments went on to defend it, stating that the villagers of Shahumyan were providing aid and harboring the militias in their homes. The Armenian government, along with the Soviet media, including Pravda and the Moskovskiye Novosti, condemned the operation and described the acts of violence {{carried out by the}} army and OMON as excessive and unnecessary; the operation continued until the first week of May.|$|E
