2500|$|Wainwright became {{addicted}} to crystal meth {{in the early}} 2000s and temporarily lost his vision. His addiction reached its peak in 2002, during {{what he described as}} [...] "the most surreal week of my life." [...] During that week, he played a cameo role in the UK comedy television program Absolutely Fabulous, spent several nights partying with George W. Bush's daughter Barbara, enjoyed a [...] "debauched evening" [...] with his mother and Marianne Faithfull, sang with Anohni of Antony and the Johnsons for Zaldy's spring 2003 collection, and experienced recurring hallucinations of his father throughout. He decided after that he [...] "was either going to rehab or I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with my father. I knew I needed an asshole to yell at me, and I felt he fit the bill." ...|$|E
2500|$|After she {{had arrived}} in the United States in 1989 with Panait, Comăneci stated, [...] "Constantin told me that I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with his wife and {{children}} for a bit. I never questioned him." [...] Her arrival initially generated some negative press, however, {{as a result of the}} media's misrepresentation of her relationship with Panait. Comăneci later stated in her memoir that her response of [...] "so what?" [...] to a reporter's comment that Panait was married was due to her poor command of the English language at the time:Constantin had offered to help me defect, and I'd accepted. I assumed that his wife knew that he was going to help a handful of Romanians get out of the country and that I was one of them. But what people took from my answer was that I was a home-wrecker. Nothing could have been further from the truth. In hindsight, I understand that I'd made a very poor choice of words. Constantin had plans to become my personal manager upon our arrival in the United States. I didn't know that, but he promised to help me get settled, and I guess I just accepted his involvement in my future career as fair payment for the risks he'd taken. People died every day trying to defect.|$|E
60|$|HASLAM. Now I come {{to think}} of it, old Methuselah must have had to think twice before he took on {{anything}} for life. If I thought I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> nine hundred and sixty years, I don't think I should stay in the Church.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fanny <b>is</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with us just now, father. She {{will be here}} a {{good deal}} in the day, but she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> outside with uncle.' ...|$|R
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. I <b>am</b> never <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> them. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> {{among these}} people. I will marry among them.|$|R
60|$|I {{believe the}} result {{would have been the}} same if we had told her we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in a balloon.|$|R
6000|$|The {{girl that}} <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in a palace and walk on ground {{of her own}} was ready to die with terror. Not for {{anything}} in the world would she have turned her head to face her sister. Her heart was beating madly. She said with subdued haste-- ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{intended}} {{to take an}} opportunity this afternoon of speaking to Irene. A word in time saved nine; and now that she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the country {{there was a chance}} for her to turn over a new leaf! He could see that Soames wouldn't stand very much more of her goings on! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] ses the cook, nodding. [...] "I {{never was}} on a ship afore with such a lot of unfortunit men aboard. Never. There's two pore fellers wot'll be dead corpses inside o' six months, sitting 'ere {{laughing}} and talking as if they <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> to ninety. Thank your stars you don't 'ave such dreams." ...|$|E
5000|$|Neighbors. The price-vector {{may allow}} the partner to predict, to some extent, {{what kind of}} people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the {{neighboring}} rooms.|$|R
60|$|He {{thought it}} an ungracious answer, {{but if they}} <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> {{together}} he must do all he could to make things go easily.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear girl, we {{must look}} into the future. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> all our lives together. We must foresee and prepare for all the chances of life.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was older}} than she by more than twenty years, and at no time the most ardent of men. Perhaps {{he had had a}} love affair in early life which he had to strangle--perhaps all early love affairs ought to be strangled or drowned, like so many blind kittens: well, at three-and-forty he was a {{collected}} quiet little gentleman in black stockings with a bald head, and {{a few days after the}} ceremony he called to see her, and, as he felt her pulse, he kept hold of her hand in his, and asked her where she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> now that the Pontypool family had come down upon the property, which was being nailed into boxes, and packed into hampers, and swaddled up with haybands, and buried in straw, and locked under three keys in green baize plate-chests, and carted away under the eyes of poor Miss Helen,--he asked her where she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> finally.|$|E
6000|$|Constance {{opened her}} eyes and {{declared}} that Uncle Frank and Aunt Mary never could do such things. Moreover, she averred that Lady Adela was always going about among the cottages, and that Miss Morton had not a bit of pride, and <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in London to teach the dust-pickers and match-box makers. 'Indeed, I don't think they are half as worldly in themselves,' she said, 'as Ida is growing with thinking about them.' ...|$|E
60|$|THE ARCHBISHOP. No. He was shot. Under the {{influence}} of his belief that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> three hundred years he became a changed man. He began to tell people the truth; and they disliked {{it so much that}} they took advantage of certain clauses of an Act of Parliament he had himself passed during the Four Years War, and had purposely forgotten to repeal afterwards. They took him to the Tower of London and shot him.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you think}} we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on that scale," [...] I said, looking {{at the table with}} an irritated eye, [...] "you are jolly well mistaken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Princess Dorothy will not," [...] replied Ozma {{with her}} sweet smile. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> {{in your own}} rooms in this palace, and be my {{constant}} companion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you married}} me," [...] he went on, [...] "you {{had an idea}} that you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in a house on Fifth Avenue with a ballroom, didn't you?" ...|$|R
60|$|For some foolish {{reason the}} last house but one in that {{imperfect}} row especially haunted me with its hollow grin and empty window-eyes. Something {{in the shape}} of this brick-and-mortar skeleton was attractive; and there being no workmen about, I strolled into it for curiosity and solitude. I gave, with all the sky-deep gravity of youth, a benediction upon the man who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> there. I even remember that for the convenience of meditation I called him James Harrogate.|$|E
6000|$|Marjorie was so {{delighted with}} his {{approval}} that she determined to show Mrs. Trafford next day how prettily at least her son <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live.</b> The good lady came and admired everything, {{and particularly the}} Bokhara hangings. She {{did not seem to}} appraise, but something set Marjorie talking rather nervously of a bargain-hunter's good fortune. Mrs. Trafford glanced at the candlesticks and the low bookcase, and returned to the glowing piece of needlework that formed the symmetrical window curtain in the study. She took it in her hand, and whispered, [...] "beautiful!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The pair were puzzled. They must celebrate, {{they were}} {{determined}} to celebrate, but since the secret must be kept, what could they celebrate? No birthdays were due for three months. Tilbury wasn't available, evidently he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> forever; what the nation COULD they celebrate? That was Sally's way of putting it; and he was getting impatient, too, and harassed. But at last he hit it--just by sheer inspiration, as it seemed to him--and all their troubles were gone in a moment; they would celebrate the Discovery of America. A splendid idea! ...|$|E
6000|$|The food list made Randy smile grimly. [...] "No luxuries there," [...] {{he whispered}} to Earl. [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> as plain as we did up in Maine, or plainer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I {{thought we}} <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in regular camping style!" [...] she declared. [...] "This {{is as good}} as what we had at the hotel in Chicago, if not better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on the ship, we'll have {{to bring}} fresh water over from the other island in a cask," [...] said Dick. [...] "That will not be very handy." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, it warn't {{good to go}} {{on talking}} about them, lovely as they was in their life, and dear to us in their life and death both, because it didn't do no good, and made us too down-hearted. Jim allowed he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> as good a life as he could, {{so he could see}} them again in a better world; and Tom kept still and didn't tell him they was only Mohammedans; it warn't no use to {{disappoint}} him, he was feeling bad enough just as it was.|$|E
60|$|Moreover, she {{was delighted}} to find that Mrs. George Wardour <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in London for the present, that Alice might be under doctors, and Sylvia under masters. Kate cared little for the why, but was {{excessively}} delighted with plans for meeting, hopes of walks, talks, and tea-drinkings together; promises that the other dear Sylvia should come to meet her; and above all, an invitation to spend Sylvia Joanna's birthday {{with her on the}} 21st of October, and go all together either to the Zoological Gardens or to the British Museum, according to the weather.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{she was a}} {{neighbour}} of ours once, at home, in Hampshire, {{and liked}} me, {{and took care of}} me when I was a little girl. Years ago, when she went away from us, she wrote down in my Prayer-book for me where she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in London, and she said, 'If you are ever in trouble, Anne, come to me. I have no husband alive to say me nay, and no children to look after, and I will take care of you.' Kind words, were they not? I suppose I remember them because they were kind. It's little enough I remember besides--little enough, little enough!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So {{well that}} I {{have been able}} to come back; and though I may perhaps be obliged to revisit the colony to settle my affairs there, I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> here at home.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in Patty's Place next winter," [...] said Anne triumphantly. [...] "Live, mark you, not board! We've rented it, and Stella Maynard is coming, and {{her aunt}} <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep house for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, love, {{unless one}} dreams. Well, I think that I must have dreamt. What was the dream now? Rachel weeping--Rachel weeping--my love, I {{think that we}} <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> here, and I think--I think----" ...|$|R
60|$|She did {{not intend}} to be a fine new woman; she {{did not intend}} to build a fine new house. She {{was going to be the}} same Mrs. Cliff that she used to be,--she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the same house. To be sure, she would add to it. She would have a new dining-room and a guest's chamber over it, and she would do a great many other things which were needed, but she would live in her old home where she and her husband had been so happy, and where she hoped he would look down from heaven and see her happy until the end of her days.|$|E
60|$|They {{held on the}} wrangle all the way by water; {{the girl}} insisted upon her knowing that I was her mother, and told her all the history {{of my life in}} the Pall Mall, as well after her being turned away as before, and of my {{marriage}} since; and which was worse, not only who my present husband was, but where he had lived, viz., at Rouen in France. She knew nothing of Paris or of where we <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live,</b> namely, at Nimeguen; but told her in so many words that if she could not find me here, she would go to Holland after me.|$|E
60|$|Up {{and down}} the length of the stone wall he scampered, looking for a place to make a home, but nothing suited him. You know he likes best to make his home in a tree. He isn't like Striped Chipmunk, who lives in the ground. Poor Chatterer! He just couldn't see how he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the old stone wall. He sat on top of a big stone to rest and think it over. He was discouraged. Life didn't seem worth the living just then. He felt as if his heart had gone way down to his toes. Just then his eyes saw {{something}} that made his heart come up again with a great bound right where it ought to be, and just then Peter Rabbit came hopping along.|$|E
6000|$|... "What; in October! If {{you think}} that I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> {{in a house in}} which I can't invite a friend to dinner, you are mistaken." [...] And with that he took his departure.|$|R
6000|$|Emily {{turned to}} Mrs. Ellmother. [...] "It's {{impossible}} to stay here, not knowing whether Mrs. Rook <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> or die," [...] she said. [...] "I shall go to Belford--and {{you will go}} with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it really}} is but a shadowy supposition; for {{unfortunately}} I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live.</b> I feel myself getting better. Thomasin, how long <b>are</b> you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay at the inn, now that all this money has come to your husband?" ...|$|R
