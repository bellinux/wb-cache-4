By 1992, seventeen states of India participated in Joint Forest Management, bringing about 2 million hectares of forests under protection.

25|$|A typical {{case for}} a {{coordination}} game is choosing {{the sides of the}} road upon which to drive, a social standard which can save lives if it is widely adhered to. In a simplified example, assume that two drivers meet on a narrow dirt road. Both have to swerve in order to avoid a head-on collision. If both execute the same swerving maneuver they <b>will</b> <b>manage</b> to pass each other, but if they choose differing maneuvers they will collide. In the payoff matrix in Fig. 2, successful passing is represented by a payoff of 10, and a collision by a payoff of 0.|$|E

25|$|Child {{partitions}} do {{not have}} direct access to hardware resources, but instead have a virtual view of the resources, in terms of virtual devices. Any request to the virtual devices is redirected via the VMBus to the devices in the parent partition, which <b>will</b> <b>manage</b> the requests. The VMBus is a logical channel which enables inter-partition communication. The response is also redirected via the VMBus. If the devices in the parent partition are also virtual devices, it will be redirected further until it reaches the parent partition, where it will {{gain access to the}} physical devices. Parent partitions run a Virtualization Service Provider (VSP), which connects to the VMBus and handles device access requests from child partitions. Child partition virtual devices internally run a Virtualization Service Client (VSC), which redirect the request to VSPs in the parent partition via the VMBus. This entire process is transparent to the guest OS.|$|E

25|$|The Israeli {{economy is}} driven by {{industries}} based on electronics, computers and communication technologies, the result of over 50 years of investment in the country’s defence infrastructure. Israeli defence industries have traditionally focused on electronics, avionics and related systems. The development of these systems has given Israeli high-tech industries a qualitative edge in civilian spin-offs in the software, communications and Internet sectors. However, the next waves of high technologies are expected to emanate from other disciplines, including molecular biology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology, material sciences and chemistry, in intimate synergy with information and communication technologies. These disciplines {{are rooted in the}} basic research laboratories of universities rather than the defence industries. This poses a dilemma. In the absence of a national policy for universities, let alone for the higher education system as a whole, {{it is not clear how}} these institutions <b>will</b> <b>manage</b> to supply the knowledge, skills and human resources needed for these new science-based industries.|$|E
25|$|On December 22, 2006 in an {{agreement}} amongst the Coast Guard, National Guard and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts a partnership {{was created in}} which the Coast Guard would assume control of the aviation facilities from the Air Force (Runways, taxiways, etc.) while the Air National Guard <b>will</b> <b>manage</b> the utilities (Electricity, water, sewerage, etc.) and the state will fund the emergency services and fire protection. The Federal Aviation Administration has released new flight procedures that identify the ICAO code KFMH {{with the name of}} Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod. This does not signify a name change as it has not been officially announced. The FAA sometimes does issue plans that call an airport a different name than is commonly known. With the control of the airfield changing hands, improvements to the lighting system were put in control of the Coast Guard. The base is still known as Otis among locals, but the media reports it as Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod.|$|E

500|$|Eight {{managers}} {{have led the}} Arizona Diamondbacks since their entry into the National League as an expansion team in 1998.

Bob Brenly, the franchise leader in regular-season wins (303) and postseason wins (11), is the only manager to win a World Series with the club, in only its fourth season of existence. During the 2004 season, Brenly was replaced by his third-base coach, Al Pedrique, who won 22 out of his 83 games managed. Bob Melvin took over beginning in 2005, amassing a [...]500 winning percentage in his 486 games managed. Kirk Gibson was promoted from bench coach to take over as manager after A. J. Hinch's dismissal in July 2010, and remained as manager before being fired with three games left in the 2014 season. After firing Gibson, bench coach Alan Trammell managed the club for the remaining three games, despite also being fired.
