25|$|Further {{warships}} in {{this class}} will have a <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> for amphibious warfare in their sterns to contain landing craft, such as the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), as in Tarawa-class LHAs and Wasp-class amphibious assault ships.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Flowers had {{the standard}} RN layout, {{consisting of a}} raised forecastle, a <b>well</b> <b>deck,</b> then the bridge or wheelhouse, and a continuous deck running aft. The crew quarters were in the foc'sle while the galley was at the rear, making for poor messing arrangements.|$|E
25|$|Loading a {{submarine}} was a lengthy process that took weeks. The {{first step was}} to pump the forward ballast tanks empty which elevated the bow out of the water. Once it was dismantled, the ballast tanks were then filled to lower the bow and flood the <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> to allow the submarine to be winched aboard. The well deck's water-tight doors were then closed and the water in the dock was pumped overboard while the submarine settled onto its wooden bilge blocks. The bow was then reassembled and hatch covers were installed over the <b>well</b> <b>deck.</b> These prevented the ship from taking on water during a storm and allowed the crew to perform any necessary maintenance on the submarine while under way.|$|E
50|$|Explicit {{requirements}} {{exist for}} drainage requirements on ships with <b>well</b> <b>decks.</b> On many vessels the cargo hatches and cargo handling booms and winches were {{located on the}} <b>well</b> <b>decks</b> between a central superstructure and raised forecastle and poop.|$|R
50|$|During {{the testing}} program for NASA's Orion spacecraft, the USS Arlington and USS Anchorage used their <b>well</b> <b>decks</b> to recover Orion {{capsules}} after splashdown. Earlier capsules such as Gemini and Apollo {{had to be}} lifted aboard their recovery vessels by crane.|$|R
5000|$|USN ship {{classes that}} precede {{and follow the}} ships classed LHD are {{designated}} as LHA (Landing Helicopter Assault) and are interchangeable with LHDs, they also have <b>well</b> <b>decks</b> {{with the exception of}} the first two [...] ships, LHA-6 and LHA-7, which take the space for larger aviation facilities.|$|R
25|$|The Minekaze class {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} distinctive design innovations including a lengthened forecastle with a break forming a <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> immediately forward of the bridge. This arrangement offered {{the advantage of a}} low, semi protected area for the forward torpedo tubes albeit at the cost of becoming awash in heavy seas.|$|E
25|$|Before {{he became}} the Under Secretary of the Navy, Robert O. Work also brought into {{question}} the usefulness of an amphibious warfare ship without a <b>well</b> <b>deck.</b> The concept of the Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH) had failed when their helicopters met enemy anti-aircraft systems {{off the coast of}} Lebanon during the late 1970s. In that case, Marines first had to be moved onto ships that had well decks.|$|E
25|$|The {{new ship}} {{improved}} upon {{the design of}} Queen Mary with sufficient changes, including {{a reduction in the}} number of boilers to twelve instead of Mary twenty-four, that the designers could discard one funnel and increase deck, cargo and passenger space. The two funnels were self-supporting and braced internally to give a cleaner looking appearance. With the forward <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> omitted, a more refined hull shape was achieved, and a sharper, raked bow was added for a third bow-anchor point. She was to be eleven feet longer and of 4,000 tons greater displacement than her older sister ship, Mary.|$|E
25|$|USS America {{can be used}} as a small {{aircraft}} carrier with a squadron of jet fighters plus several multipurpose helicopters, such as the MH-60 Seahawk. It can carry about 20 AV-8Bs, F-35Bs, or a mixture of the two, but the future ships of this class, starting with , will have smaller aircraft hangars to leave room for larger amphibious warfare <b>well</b> <b>decks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|These were {{intended}} for use in Operation Herkules, the planned but never-executed Italo-German invasion of Malta. Ten of them were specially modified to each carry a captured Russian KV-1 or KV-2 heavy tank. This required strengthening and widening of the <b>well</b> <b>decks</b> and internal ramps and outward repositioning of the bow ramp counterbalance weights {{in order to accommodate}} these vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Dock landing ships (also called landing ship, dock or LSD) is an {{amphibious warfare}} ship with a well dock to {{transport}} and launch landing craft and amphibious vehicles. Some ships with <b>well</b> <b>decks,</b> {{such as the}} Soviet Ivan Rogov class, also have bow doors {{to enable them to}} deliver vehicles directly onto a beach (like a Landing Ship, Tank). Modern dock landing ships also operate helicopters.|$|R
25|$|C Deck, the Shelter Deck, was the {{uppermost}} deck to run uninterrupted from the ships' bow to stern. It included the two well decks, {{both of which}} served as the Third Class promenade spaces. Each <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> also contained large cranes for loading cargo into the interior holds. Crew cabins were located under the forecastle and Third Class public rooms were situated under the Poop Deck. The superstructure of C Deck between the bow and stern contained mostly First Class accommodation, but the Second Class Library was also placed further aft, directly below the Second Class Smoking Room. This was the first deck to feature portholes.|$|E
25|$|While the S90-class were {{of similar}} size to {{contemporary}} foreign torpedo-boat destroyers, the German navy saw {{their role as}} primarily torpedo attack against opposing fleets, rather than defending their own fleet against attack, so the ships had a lighter gun armament than British destroyers, and a lower silhouette to avoid detection during night attacks. S115 had a gun armament of three 5 cm SK L/40 guns in single mounts, while torpedo armament consisted of three single 450mm torpedo tubes (one in a <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> between the raised forecastle and the bridge, with the remaining two tubes aft of the bridge. Two reload torpedoes were carried. The ship had a complement of 49 officers and men.|$|E
25|$|The {{forecastle}} {{machinery and}} the two cargo cranes in the forward <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> are well preserved. The foremast is bent and lies on the sea floor near the wreck with the crow's nest still attached on it. The bell was not found. Funnel #1 was found a few metres from the Boat Deck. The other three funnels {{were found in the}} debris field (located off the stern). Pieces of coal lie beside the wreck. The wreck of Britannic is in excellent condition, and the only signs of deterioration are the children's playroom and some of the captain's quarters, {{but the rest of the}} ship is in outstanding shape. The wreck lies in shallow enough water that scuba divers trained in technical diving can explore it, but it is listed as a British war grave and any expedition must be approved by both the British and Greek governments.|$|E
50|$|In December 2011 the {{government}} {{announced that it would}} purchase a commercial vessel to provide the RAN with a third ship for humanitarian and disaster relief tasks alongside Choules and Tobruk. A project is also underway to replace the LCHs and the Army and Navy's small amphibious craft. These new craft will be capable of operating from the <b>well</b> <b>decks</b> in the Canberra class ships.|$|R
5000|$|A dock {{landing ship}} (also called landing ship, dock or LSD) is an amphibious warfare ship with a well dock to {{transport}} and launch landing craft and amphibious vehicles. Some ships with <b>well</b> <b>decks,</b> {{such as the}} Soviet Ivan Rogov class, also have bow doors {{to enable them to}} deliver vehicles directly onto a beach (like a Landing Ship, Tank). Modern dock landing ships also operate helicopters.|$|R
5000|$|In {{commercial}} ship design categories, the [...] "well deck ship" [...] {{type the}} profile of the main deck line is broken rather than being [...] flush or unbroken from bow to stern. The earliest cargo steamers were flush deck with openings below rimmed only with low casings. Later designs eliminated this design as dangerous with bulwarks and eventual evolution into the [...] "three island" [...] design with raised forecastle, central bridge and poop superstructures and <b>well</b> <b>decks</b> between.|$|R
25|$|Service on Flowers in the North Atlantic was {{typically}} cold, wet, monotonous and uncomfortable. Every dip of the forecastle into an oncoming wave {{was followed by}} a cascade of water into the <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> amidships. Men at action stations were drenched with spray, and water entered living spaces through hatches opened to access ammunition magazines. Interior decks were constantly wet and condensation dripped from the overheads. The head (or sanitary toilet) was drained by a straight pipe to the ocean; and a reverse flow of the icy North Atlantic would cleanse the backside of those using it during rough weather. By 1941 corvettes carried twice as many crewmen as anticipated in the original design. Men slept on lockers or tabletops or in any dark place that offered a little warmth. The inability to store perishable food meant a reliance on preserved food such as corned-beef and powdered potato for all meals.|$|E
25|$|Desmoulea {{remained}} at Suda Bay for several weeks, {{down on the}} sandy bottom by the stern, with its after <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> awash; the cargo {{was transferred to the}} tanker Eocene. Along with the torpedo attack on the cargo ship Clan Cumming by the Italian submarine Neghelli on 19 January, this was the only Italian success against British convoys in the Aegean Sea. After the action, Allied shipping made passage into the Aegean through the Antikithera Strait. Desmoulea was finally taken in tow by the armed boarding vessel HMS Chakla and escorted to Port Said by the anti-submarine trawlers HMS Lydiard and HMS Amber. The ship arrived on 6 May and moored off the western beacon of Suez, for use as a temporary storage vessel. It was torpedoed again on 3 August 1941, while awaiting repairs, by German bombers. Desmoulea was towed to Bombay, India and ran aground twice during the passage. Desmoulea was converted into a store ship, named Empire Thane and remained in port at Cochin until 1947, from where it was towed back to the United Kingdom. It was rebuilt under its original name in 1949, before being laid up in 1955 and scrapped in 1961.|$|E
500|$|A rebuild in 1922 saw the ship's <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> built over, {{creating}} a flush deck profile. In 1930 {{the ship was}} refurbished and modernized. By this time, Kommandøren measured [...] and [...]|$|E

5000|$|In {{traditional}} nautical use, <b>well</b> <b>decks</b> were decks {{lower than}} decks fore and aft, usually {{at the main}} deck level, so that breaks appear in the main deck profile, {{as opposed to a}} flush deck profile. The term goes {{back to the days of}} sail. Late-20th-Century commercial and military amphibious ships have applied the term to an entirely different type of hangar-like structure, evolving from exaggerated deep [...] "well decks" [...] of World War II amphibious vessels, that can be flooded for lighters or landing craft.|$|R
25|$|Third Class {{accommodations}} {{also included}} their own dining rooms, {{as well as}} public gathering areas including adequate open deck space, which aboard Titanic comprised the Poop Deck at the stern, the forward and aft <b>well</b> <b>decks,</b> and a large open space on D Deck {{which could be used}} as a social hall. This was supplemented by the addition of a smoking room for men and a General Room on C Deck which women could use for reading and writing. Although they were not as glamorous in design as spaces seen in upper class accommodations, they were still far above average for the period.|$|R
500|$|The bow hit {{the bottom}} {{at a speed}} of about , digging about [...] deep into the mud, up {{to the base of}} the anchors. The impact bent the hull in two places and caused it to buckle {{downwards}} by about 10° under the forward <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> cranes and by about 4° under the forward expansion joint. When the bow section hit the sea bed, the weakened decks at the rear, where the ship had broken apart, collapsed on top of each other. The forward hatch cover was also blown off and landed a couple of hundred feet in front of the bow, possibly due to the force of water being pushed out as the bow impacted the bottom.|$|E
500|$|Harland and Wolff, the RMS Titanic builders, {{opened their}} private {{archives}} to the crew, sharing blueprints that were thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for {{artifacts from the}} era. The newness of the ship meant every prop {{had to be made}} from scratch. Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of seventeen million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunken by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, {{but the rest of the}} ship was just steel plating. Within was a fifty-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. Towering above was a [...] tower crane on [...] of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.|$|E
500|$|At 17:40, West Bridges engine {{broke down}} {{once again and}} her crew was unable to repair it. West Bridge, falling {{off the back of}} the convoy and adrift, {{signaled}} Marseillaise to request a tow. At sundown, shortly before 18:00, Montanan—still in the convoy, which was by now some [...] ahead of West Bridge—was hit by one of three torpedoes launched by German submarine [...] Montanan began to settle and was quickly abandoned. On West Bridge, Lieutenant Commander Hawkins realized the potential for another submarine attack and ordered his crew to general quarters and reduced the number of men in the mechanical spaces below decks. Noma sailed back to West Bridge, ordered the freighter to extinguish her lights, and stood by. At nearly the same time, [...] approached and launched two torpedoes at the stationary cargo ship, scoring hits with both. The first struck near the No. 3 cargo hold {{in the front of the}} ship, while the second hit amidships near the engine room. West Bridge immediately began listing to starboard, and Hawkins ordered the crew to abandon the vessel. He and two crewmen remained behind until they felt sure that everyone else had departed. By the time they left the stricken ship, water was up to the gunwales and lapping at the <b>well</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E

50|$|LCI(L) {{were armed}} {{originally}} with {{four to five}} 20mm Oerlikon automatic cannons. Each gun was mounted inside of a round gun tub with an integral splinter shield. As the war progressed, several LCI(L) were modified into LCI Gunboats. These gunboats, called LCI(G) had three of their forward mounted 20mm Oerlikon cannons removed and replaced with heavier single barrel 40mm Bofors cannons. Also, several LCI(L) had various types of Rocket Launcher racks added in place of their side ramps and inside their <b>well</b> <b>decks.</b> These ships were sometimes designated as LCI(R) for Rocket Ships. Still other LCI(L) were modified to carry three 4.2 inch Heavy Mortars. These were designated as LCI(M).|$|R
50|$|After {{operations}} {{along the}} Atlantic coast, the oiler transited the Panama Canal and sailed 18 February 1943 for Fanui Bay, Bora Bora, mothering a brood of 11 subchasers, five yard minesweepers, numerous LCI(L)’s, and one net tender. Four motor torpedo boats nested in cradles {{in the forward}} and after <b>well</b> <b>decks.</b> Pecos fueled each small craft every four days. Throughout the voyage, groups of boats came alongside the tanker for fuel; then, replenished, gave place to others. Pecos next supported the landings at Tarawa, Gilbert Islands, refueling the bombardment and transport groups. She returned to the West Coast late in 1943 and departed San Pedro, Calif., on New Year’s Eve after undergoing repairs and loading with oil and supplies.|$|R
2500|$|The {{addition}} of a <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> will leave less space for aircraft on board the ships, but the [...] "Early Operational Assessment" [...] of 2005 criticized the [...] "Flight 0" [...] design because the expanded aviation facilities gave no space for a <b>well</b> <b>deck.</b> Also, USS America has reduced stowage space for military vehicles, {{and the size of}} her hospital was reduced by two-thirds with respect to the Wasp-class ships.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ship was}} {{essentially}} a self-propelled floating dry dock with three main sections. The stern contained the engine, bridge, crew accommodations, workshops, pumps, electric generators and storage facilities for the submarine's torpedoes. The submarine's batteries were kept charged during the voyage by the current from the generators. The middle section consisted of a [...] double-hulled <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> with ballast tanks between its inner walls and the outer hull. The <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> had a capacity of [...] and was closed off {{by a pair of}} water-tight doors at its forward end. The outer plating and structural members of Kanguroos bow were designed to be partially dismantled to give access to the short tunnel through the bow to the <b>well</b> <b>deck.</b> Additional ballast tanks were positioned below and {{on each side of the}} tunnel to raise and lower the bow.|$|E
2500|$|The third ship of {{the class}} (...) {{will be the first}} in its class with a <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> for {{deploying}} amphibious vehicles. While there was emphasis on lighter ground vehicles in the late 1990s, up-armored and heavier vehicles were used during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Future counterinsurgency operations require ships that can carry and deliver those vehicles, including through use of shore connectors; cargo lift requirements are met more expensively by aircraft airlifting equipment. Adding the <b>well</b> <b>deck</b> will require the ship's island to be slightly smaller compared to its two predecessors. Early design work with funds will begin in 2015, detailed design work and construction will start in 2017, and the LHA-8 will enter service in 2024.|$|E
5000|$|Aircraft (still in {{commission}} in late 1940s or early 1950s) were fitted/retro-fitted with a prefabricated steel grated [...] "Portable Deck" [...] suspended between the wing walls {{and supported by}} removable I-beam girders. The aft end of the portable deck contained a wooden helicopter platform, enabling the ship to land and launch one helicopter at a time. Stowage of helicopters was limited to capacity of the portable deck installed for the mission. Aircraft servicing was limited to re-fueling. With portable deck and aircraft platform installed, the Landing ship, dock, was still capable of transporting, launching and repairing smaller amphibious craft and vehicles up {{to the size of}} a Landing Craft Utility (LCU) in their <b>well</b> <b>decks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The America-class {{amphibious assault}} ships (formerly the LHA(R) class) of the U.S. Navy are {{designed}} to put ashore a Marine Expeditionary Unit using helicopters and MV-22B Osprey V/STOL transport aircraft, supported by AV-8B Harrier II or F-35 Lightning II V/STOL aircraft and various attack helicopters. The first of these warships was commissioned by the U.S. Navy in 2014 to replace [...] of the as many as eleven will be built. The design of the America class is based on that of , the last ship of the Wasp class, but the [...] "Flight 0" [...] ships of the America class will not have <b>well</b> <b>decks,</b> and they have smaller on-board hospitals {{in order to give}} more space for aviation uses.|$|R
