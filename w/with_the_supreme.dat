In 1894, Parker gained {{national}} attention in a dispute <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court over the case of Lafayette Hudson. Hudson was convicted of assault with intent to kill and sentenced to four years imprisonment. He appealed to the Supreme Court and was granted bail. Parker refused to release Hudson on the grounds that statute law did not provide the Supreme Court the authority to demand Hudson's release.|$|E
5|$|After the South Carolina Supreme Court {{declined}} to rehear the case, the Capobiancos filed a petition <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari.

This included amici briefs by two former Solicitors General of the United States, Paul Clement {{on behalf of the}} guardian ad litem, and Greg Garre on behalf of the birth mother, suggesting that the Equal Protection Clause requires applying strict scrutiny to ICWA’s race-based placement preferences. The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, the National Council for Adoption, the California State Association of Counties and the Center for Adoption Policy were also among those that submitted briefs.|$|E

On December 30, 2011, after reviewing Sharif's petition, the Supreme Court constituted a Judicial Commission to conduct a broad inquiry. Ijaz was among the , as were Pakistan's intelligence chief, Ahmad Shuja Pasha and Haqqani. Pakistan's army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani submitted written testimony to the Supreme Court, as did then-Prime Minister Yousef Raza Gilani on behalf of the Zardari government.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{reforming}} actions such as the Bill of Middlesex, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative and resistant to King's Bench changes because of the impact they had on {{the business of the}} Common Pleas. This was best emphasised by Slade's Case, a struggle between the old and new forms of suing for breach of contract; although an equilibrium between the common law courts was finally reached, it eventually led to their dissolution <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court of Judicature Act 1873, and merger into a single High Court of Justice.|$|E

Another case discussed by Heins is the 1980 Supreme Court decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick, wherein the court ruled constitutional a federal law requiring a percentage of funds for a building project to be used for minority workers.|$|E

High Courts are instituted as constitutional courts under Part VI, Chapter V, Article 214 of the Indian Constitution.|$|E
5|$|German {{scholar and}} folklorist Wilhelm Mannhardt {{holds that the}} log {{represented}} an incarnation {{of the spirit of}} vegetation. The sacrifices offered to the badnjak were meant to guarantee the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. Its burning symbolized sunshine, and was intended to secure the vitalizing power of the sun in the ensuing year. The lighting of the log could be regarded as a fusion of tree worship and fire worship, attested in Slavic customs; e.g., Istrians fed the logs lighted on St. John's Day by sprinkling wheat upon them. Čajkanović characterizes the pre-Christian badnjak as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, comparing it in this respect with Attis, Osiris, Adonis, and Sandan. He also proposes that the crosses made from the thicker end of the log may have originated from idols representing deities comparable with the Roman Lares, the cruciform having developed from an anthropomorphic shape of the idols. The badnjak is preferably cut from an oak, which was the most respected tree in the old Slavic religion, associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>supreme</b> god Perun.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, the United States Supreme Court {{ruled the}} Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 unconstitutional. For the first time, Minton gave speeches criticizing {{the court for}} {{overriding}} the will of Congress. He accused the court of allowing itself {{to be influenced by}} political motives rather than the law. In response to the court ruling, Minton began drafting a bill which would allow the Supreme Court to declare a law unconstitutional only if seven out the nine justices supported the decision. In February 1937, before Minton introduced his bill, President Roosevelt introduced a plan of his own to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court. Roosevelt proposed adding more justices to the court and creating a mandatory retirement age; the changes would allow him to appoint an overwhelming majority to the court, more sympathetic to his agenda, ensuring the safety of legislation passed by his party.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, Musharraf instituted {{emergency}} rule {{for six weeks}} (see Pakistani state of emergency, 2007), under the pretext of rising Islamist militancy, {{a few days after}} Bhutto's departure for Dubai to meet with Zardari. Immediately after the state of emergency was invoked, Bhutto returned to Pakistan, while Zardari again stayed behind in Dubai. Emergency rule was initiated right before the Supreme Court of Pakistan began deliberations on the legality of Musharraf's U.S.-backed proposal—the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO)—to drop corruption charges against Bhutto and Zardari in return for a joint Bhutto-Musharraf coalition to govern Pakistan. Bhutto and Zardari sympathised with Musharraf on his feud <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court, but simultaneously criticised the imposition of martial law. Before the Supreme Court could issue a decision, Musharraf replaced its members with his supporters.|$|E
5|$|Lachanodrakon reappears in 790, {{when the}} young emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797) conspired to {{overturn}} the tutelage of Irene.

Constantine succeeded in toppling his mother in December 790; it was probably then that Lachanodrakon was rewarded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>supreme</b> non-imperial title, that of magistros. According to the account of Theophanes, he participated in the imperial campaign against the Bulgars in 792 {{that led to the}} disastrous defeat at the Battle of Marcellae on 20 July, where he was killed. The history of John Skylitzes records his death in the Battle of Versinikia, again against the Bulgars, in 813, but this is clearly an error.|$|E

The certiorari petition was circulated to the Justices for their conference on April 3, 2015, after a brief by the respondents (Peterson) opposing certiorari and a reply brief from the petitioner (Bank Markazi) were filed in March. Following the April 3rd conference, the Court called for the Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the views of the federal government, which was filed on August 19. In May and June, the Supreme Court meets only to issue orders and opinions and does not hear oral arguments until the next term begins.
