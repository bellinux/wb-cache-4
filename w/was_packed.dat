5|$|On May 17, 1898, {{the flag}} was {{delivered}} personally by Agoncillo and <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> {{among the things}} Aguinaldo brought back to Manila. This was the flag that was hoisted {{from the window of}} Aguinaldo's house in Kawit, Cavite, during the proclamation of Philippine independence on June 12, 1898 accompanied by the Philippine National Anthem Marcha Filipina. However, she did not witness either this first public display of the flag or the time when the flag was unfurled during the Malolos Congress because her husband remained in Hong Kong and she remained with him.|$|E
5|$|The Hershey brothers, Jacob, Isaac, John, Paris, and Eli, founded Hershey Creamery Company in 1894, {{with the}} company {{originally}} operating out of the Hershey family's Lancaster County farmhouse. The ice cream <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> in metal-lined wooden containers that the Hershey brothers designed and built. The containers were loaded into trucks with ice packed around them to keep the ice cream fresh and cold. Salesmen traveled daily routes to deliver product to customers in the county and in surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|The inquest into Sandra Rivett's death {{opened on}} 13November 1974 and {{was led by}} the Coroner for Inner West London, Gavin Thurston. Two {{witnesses}} were called to the courtroom, which <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> with reporters; Roger Rivett, who confirmed that he had identified his wife's body, and the pathologist, Keith Simpson, who confirmed that Rivett had died from being hit {{on the head with}} a blunt instrument. At Ranson's request, the hearing was then adjourned. Further adjournments were made on 11December 1974 and 10March 1975, before a full inquest was scheduled for 16June 1975.|$|E
50|$|The {{ammunition}} is of {{the conventional}} streamlined, fin-stabilized type. It uses the ignition cartridge and powder-increment type of propellant. The round uses the standard type 100 mortar fuze and weighs 26.4 pounds. Two rounds of ammunition <b>are</b> <b>packed</b> in a wooden box, lined with asphalt impregnated paper. The ignition cartridges are assembled into the rounds as <b>packed,</b> the fuzes <b>are</b> <b>packed</b> in tear-top cans, and the doughnut-type increments <b>are</b> <b>packed</b> in tar-paper bags.|$|R

5|$|Voss disregarded {{military}} {{procedure and}} went outside {{the chain of command}} to petition higher headquarters for Walz's removal. Faced with such a case of insubordination, all three men were transferred out of the jagdstaffel. Lersner <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> off to a bomber unit. Discovering the betrayal, Walz requested reassignment on the grounds that his honor had been impugned. On 20 May 1917, Flight Commander Voss was sent to Jagdstaffel 5 to assume temporary command.|$|E
5|$|Bainbridge {{was elected}} a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1937. His {{interest}} in mass spectroscopy led naturally to {{an interest in}} the relative abundance of isotopes. The discovery of nuclear fission in uranium-235 led to an interest in separating this isotope. He proposed using a Holweck pump to produce the vacuum necessary for this work, and enlisted George B. Kistiakowsky and E. Bright Wilson to help. There was little interest in their work because research was being carried out elsewhere. In 1943, their cyclotron was requisitioned by Edwin McMillan for use by the U. S. Army. It <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> up and carted off to Los Alamos, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|For Thanksgiving 1988, {{his family}} spent the holiday with him, {{although}} he had developed neuropathy and was increasingly bed-ridden and reliant on morphine; he died in his bed on December 16, 1988 {{at the age of}} 41. Sylvester had planned his own funeral, insisting that he be dressed in a red kimono and placed in an open-top coffin for the mourners to see, with his friend Yvette Flunder doing his corpse's makeup. He wanted Tracy to sing at his funeral, accompanied by choirs and many flowers. The whole affair took place in his church, the Love Center, with a sermon being provided by Reverend Walter Hawkins. The event <b>was</b> <b>packed,</b> with standing room only, and the coffin was subsequently taken and buried at his family's plot in Inglewood Park Cemetery. An album titled Immortal was posthumously released; it contained Sylvester's final studio recordings, and was compiled by Marty Blecman.|$|E

50|$|De Bruijn's theorem states that, if a {{harmonic}} brick <b>is</b> <b>packed</b> into a box, {{then the}} box {{must be a}} multiple of the brick. For instance, the three-dimensional harmonic brick with side lengths 1, 2, and 6 can only <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> into boxes in {{which one of the}} three sides is a multiple of six and one of the remaining two sides is even. Packings of a harmonic brick into a box may involve copies of the brick that are rotated with respect to each other. Nevertheless, the theorem states that the only boxes that can <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> in this way are boxes that could also <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> by translates of the brick.|$|R

5|$|Goldfinger was premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 17 September 1964, {{with general}} release in the United Kingdom the {{following}} day. Leicester Square <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> with sightseers and fans and police {{were unable to}} control the crowd due {{to the number of}} people. A set of glass doors to the cinema was accidentally broken and the premiere was shown ten minutes late because of the confusion. The United States premiere occurred on 21 December 1964, at the DeMille Theatre in New York. The film opened in 64 cinemas across 41 cities and eventually peaked at 485 screens. Goldfinger was temporarily banned in Israel because of Gert Fröbe's connections with the Nazi Party. The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a Jewish family publicly thanked Fröbe for protecting them from persecution during World War II.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy, {{which had}} {{oversight}} over the reactor in Oak Ridge, allowed the scientific {{use of the}} extracted berkelium. The production lasted 250 days and ended in late December 2008, resulting in 22milligrams of berkelium, enough to perform the experiment. In January 2009, the berkelium was removed from ORNL’s High Flux Isotope Reactor; it was subsequently cooled for 90 days and then processed at ORNL’s Radiochemical Engineering and Development Center to separate and purify the berkelium material, which took another 90 days. Its half-life is only 330days: after that time, half the berkelium produced would have decayed. Because of this, the berkelium target had to be quickly transported to Russia; for the experiment to be viable, {{it had to be}} completed within six months of its departure from the United States. The target <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> into five lead containers to be flown from New York to Moscow.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1959 the Admiralty {{announced}} that Vanguard would be scrapped, {{as she was}} considered obsolete and too expensive to maintain. She was decommissioned on 7 June 1960 and sold to the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain for £560,000. On 4 August 1960, when the ship {{was scheduled to be}} towed from Portsmouth to the breaker's yard at Faslane, Scotland, the whole of the Southsea sea front <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> with people who came to see her off. As Vanguard was being towed towards the harbour entrance, she slewed across the harbour and ran aground near the Still & West pub. She was pulled off by five tugboats an hour later, and made her final exit from Portsmouth. Five days later she arrived at Faslane, and by mid-1962 the demolition process was complete; she was the last British battleship to be scrapped.|$|E

5|$|The 17th Infantry Brigade was {{the last}} to land in Greece, {{arriving}} at Piraeus on 12April. Savige was placed in charge of Savige Force, consisting of the 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th and 2/11thInfantry Battalions, with armour, artillery, engineer and other support. He was given the mission of covering the Allied flank around Kalabaka. On 17April, Savige received orders to withdraw from Kalabaka, leaving only a rearguard behind. The road behind him, however, <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> with vehicles, and a crucial bridge on the only reasonably good road back had accidentally been demolished. Savige elected to disregard his orders and hold his position until the road was clear. He then managed to withdraw, although his driver's foot was broken in an air raid. Savige arrived back in Palestine on 1May 1941 and began the task of rebuilding his brigade. For the campaign in Greece, he received his fourth mention in despatches.|$|E
5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, {{it would not have been}} a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{her four}} funnels were removed, and the forward two were cut {{at an angle}} to {{resemble}} those of a German destroyer. The bow <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> with 4.5 tons of high explosives, which were set in concrete. It was decided that the explosive charge would be timed to detonate after the raiders had left the harbour. To prevent the Germans towing her away, the crew would open the ship's seacocks before abandoning the ship. Should she become disabled or sunk before getting to the dock, four motor launches had been detailed to take off the crew and put the commandos ashore. The charge would be reset to explode after the last boat had left.|$|E

5|$|Under Guatemalan law, Maya stelae {{and other}} archaeological {{artefacts}} are {{property of the}} Guatemalan government {{and may not be}} removed from the country without its permission. In the case of Machaquilá Stela2, the monument was well known before it was stolen and its illegal removal was easy to prove. The stela itself was cut into pieces, with the face being sawn off and moved to a fish packing factory in Belize, where it <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> into boxes and shipped to California. There it was seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after being offered for sale to various institutions. The stolen portion of the stela was returned to Guatemala and is now in storage at the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.|$|E
5|$|Sydney {{normally}} transported 450 soldiers—the main {{force of}} a Royal Australian Regiment (RAR) battalion—plus equipment and vehicles on each voyage. The soldiers were accommodated in the sailors mess decks, with the sailors displaced to the hangar. Vehicles were secured to the flight deck, while other cargo <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> onto pallets and stored either in the hangar or on the flight deck. Although it was originally intended that Sydney would sail to and from Saigon, the ship's commanding officer {{at the time of}} the first voyage, John Crabb, informed the Naval Board that he would refuse orders to do so, as the Saigon River could easily be mined after Sydney had sailed up. Instead, the port of Vũng Tàu was selected as the destination, with soldiers and equipment transferred to shore by helicopters, landing craft, and barges. During the early voyages, unloading and reloading was a multiple-day process, with the transport moving to deeper waters each night, but improved cargo handling practices, upgrades to Sydney (including the installation of three new cargo cranes and six embarked landing craft during mid-1968 refit), and increased access to US cargo- and troop-carrying helicopters, reduced this to a single day by 1968.|$|E
5|$|The Maya leader {{returned}} {{the following day}} with twelve canoes, as promised. The Spanish could see from afar that the shore <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> with natives. The conquistadors put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats; {{a few of the}} more daring Spaniards boarded the native canoes. The Spanish named the headland Cape Catoche, after some words spoken by the Maya leader, which sounded to the Spanish like cones catoche. Once ashore, the Spaniards clustered loosely together and advanced towards the city along a path among low, scrub-covered hillocks. At this point the Maya leader gave a shout and the Spanish party was ambushed by Maya warriors armed with spears, bows and arrows, and stones. Thirteen Spaniards were injured by arrows in the first assault, but the conquistadors regrouped and repulsed the Maya attack. They advanced to a small plaza bordered by temples upon the outskirts of the city. When the Spaniards ransacked the temples they found a number of low-grade gold items, which filled them with enthusiasm. The expedition captured two Mayas to be used as interpreters and retreated to the ships. Over the following days the Spanish discovered that although the Maya arrows had struck with little force, the flint arrowheads tended to shatter on impact, causing infected wounds and a slow death; two of the wounded Spaniards died from the arrow-wounds inflicted in the ambush.|$|E
