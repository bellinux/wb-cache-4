Lots of colour and dancing, and it's about doing something that's {{in keeping with the}} song, actually.|$|E
500|$|After Frittie's death, Alice {{attached}} herself {{more closely}} to her only surviving son, Ernest, and her newborn daughter Marie. In 1875 she resumed her public duties, including fund-raising, medical and social work, which had always held her interest. She maintained active correspondence with the social reformer Octavia Hill. However, in these years, relations with her husband deteriorated. In late 1876, she travelled to England for treatment due to an internal complaint caused by a backward curvature of the womb, and remained at Balmoral while she recovered. From Balmoral, she wrote to her husband criticising the childishness of his letters: [...] "f my children wrote me such childish letters – only short accounts – of where and what they had eaten or {{where they had been}} etc., and no opinions, observations and remarks, I should be surprised – and how much more so <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> like that!" [...] On 3 October 1876, she wrote another despairing letter to Louis: ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for Wasting Light were {{completed}} {{during the week}} each song was being recorded. Grohl said that the words were [...] "what was on my mind each week", most being [...] "written {{from the perspective of}} who I was then and who I am now", with references to the past, life and death, and [...] "time, but questioning whether it matters at all. There's so much focus on the before that people forget there's an after." [...] The frontman said this was helped by the environment - [...] "a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to the way we used to make records" [...] - and working with Vig again, which [...] "made me think a lot about starting over, and rebirth, and making your way through tragedy and coming out the other side." [...] An example was [...] "I Should Have Known", partially inspired by former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain - [...] "a song like 'I Should Have Known' is about all the people I've lost, not just Kurt". Grohl still tried to do laid-back songs such as [...] "White Limo", which had its lyrics written in just two minutes, specially after Mendel sent him an e-mail saying, [...] "I really like it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> songs that are silly and mean nothing, too. You don't have to try to write 'Imagine' every time you sit down with a pen and paper".|$|E

2500|$|<b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> a {{song and}} you mean it one way, and someone comes up and says {{something}} about it that you didn't think of—you can't deny it. Like [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds," [...] people came up and said, cunningly, [...] "Right, I get it. L-S-D," [...] and it was when papers were talking about LSD, but we never thought about it.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, McCartney {{said the}} initial {{idea for the}} song began with Bobby Rydell's hit [...] "Forget Him" [...] with its call and {{response}} pattern, and that [...] "as often happens, you think of one song <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> another ... I'd planned an 'answering song' where a couple of us would sing 'she loves you' and the other ones would answer 'yeah yeah'. We decided that was a crummy idea {{but at least we}} then had the idea of a song called 'She Loves You'. So we sat in the hotel bedroom for a few hours and wrote it—John and I, sitting on twin beds with guitars." [...] It was completed the following day at McCartney's family home in Forthlin Road, Liverpool.|$|E
2500|$|In Gutenberg's time, inks used by scribes {{to produce}} manuscripts were water-based. Gutenberg {{developed}} an oil-based ink that would better adhere to his metal type. His ink was primarily carbon, but {{also had a}} high metallic content, with copper, lead, and titanium predominating. Head of collections at the British Library, Dr Kristian Jensen, described it thus: [...] "if you look (at the pages of The Gutenberg Bible) closely you will see {{this is a very}} shiny surface. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> you use a water based ink, [...] you put your pen into it and it runs off. [...] Now [...] if you print that's exactly what you don't want. One of Gutenberg's inventions was an ink which wasn't ink, it's a varnish. So what we call printer's ink is actually a varnish, and that means it sticks to its surface." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I am," [...] she replied; [...] "I {{love her}} exceedingly, and am delighted {{to find that}} you like her too. You hardly {{mentioned}} anything of her <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> to me after your visit there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate, I {{will tell}} you the truth, now. No: I was not {{thinking}} of <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> my errands for me in French--I was thinking again of some advice that was once given to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} that you brought me here on a fool's errand?" [...] he asked viciously; [...] "that the Citizen-Deputy Déroulède cannot be sent to the {{guillotine}} on mere suspicion, eh? Did <b>you</b> know that, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> out that denunciation?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Stewart {{departed}} from Steampacket in March 1966, with Stewart {{saying he had}} been sacked and Auger saying he had quit. Stewart then joined a somewhat similar outfit, Shotgun Express, in May 1966 as co-lead vocalist with Beryl Marsden. The other members included Mick Fleetwood and Peter Green (who {{would go on to}} form Fleetwood Mac), and Peter Bardens. Shotgun Express released one unsuccessful single in October 1966, the orchestra-heavy [...] "I Could Feel The Whole World Turn Round", before disbanding. Stewart later disparaged Shotgun Express as a poor imitation of Steampacket, and said [...] "I was still getting this terrible feeling of doing other people's music. I think you can only start finding yourself <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> your own material." [...] By now, Stewart had bounced around without achieving much success, with little to distinguish himself among other aspiring London singers other than the emerging rasp in his voice.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her book}} Native Speakers, Cotera {{argues that the}} {{significance}} of the co-authorship of this novel has often been ignored, under analyzed, and wrongly criticized. [...] The novel has been criticized and rejected by both Chicana/o scholars and historically white publishers because of the unique collaboration between González and Eimer. [...] This {{played a significant role in}} the failure of getting Caballero published during their lifetimes. [...] González was extremely frustrated by this during her life. [...] There has, however, been a strong counterargument to these rejections that considers the power of these two women from such different backgrounds speaking out together against [...] "the singularity of patriarchal thinking and its bankrupt formulations of identity and authority". Another fascinating component of this collaboration is that it simultaneously tells the Mexican side of the war and reflects a partnership between a Mexican-American and Anglo-American author. [...] Cotera argues that it is only natural for these women to work together as [...] "the notion of a singular author is a construct of modernity that is inextricably linked ‘to the development of modern capitalism and of intellectual property, to Western rationalism, and to patriarchy’". [...] Caballero works to undo this discourse through collaboration as <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> together [...] "you have to desire the collaborative world under formation more than the unextended ‘yours’ and ‘mine’ of the old power structures".|$|E
