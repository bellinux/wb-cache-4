25|$|About 65,000 red-figure vases and vase {{fragments}} {{are known}} to have survived. The study of ancient pottery and of Greek vase painting began already in the Middle Ages. Restoro d'Arezzo dedicated a chapter (Capitolo de le vasa antiche) of his description of the world to ancient vases. He considered especially the clay vessels as perfect in terms of shape, colour, and artistic style. Nevertheless, initially the attention focused on vases in general, and perhaps especially on stone vases. The first collections of ancient vases, including some painted vessels, developed during the Renaissance. <b>We</b> <b>even</b> know of some imports from Greece to Italy at that time. Still, {{until the end of the}} Baroque period, vase painting was overshadowed by other genres, especially by sculpture. A rare pre-Classicist exception is a book of watercolours depicting figural vases, which was produced for Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc. Like some of his contemporary collectors, Peiresc owned a number of clay vases.|$|E

As Jean Pierre Lion has pointed out, [...] "The only serious and analytical obituary to have been published in the months" [...] after his death was by a Frenchman, Hugues Panassié. The notice appeared in October 1931 and began with a bit of hyperbole and an incorrect fact, two hallmarks of much of the subsequent writing about Beiderbecke: [...] "The announcement of Bix Beiderbecke's death plunged all jazz musicians into despair. We first believed it was a false alarm, as we had heard so often before about Bix. Unfortunately, precise information has been forthcoming, and <b>we</b> <b>even</b> know the day—August 7—when he passed away." ...|$|E

Yorke was forced to write lyrics differently, as {{he did not have}} time to rewrite them in the studio; for some songs, he returned to the method of cutting up words and arranging them randomly he had employed for Kid A and Amnesiac. Greenwood said: [...] "We didn't really have time to be stressed about what we did. We got {{to the end of the}} second week before <b>we</b> <b>even</b> heard what we did on the first two days, and didn't even remember recording it or who was playing things. Which is a magical way of doing things."

500|$|Germain and Klasky {{initially}} {{planned to}} portray the character as divorced, but Nickelodeon executives rejected the idea, feeling that the subject would be inappropriate for younger viewers. The studio also vetoed a reveal that the mother was dead, contending that such an idea would be [...] "scary" [...] and that [...] "children [...] want to see that." [...] Germain stated this prevented them from saying much about the character in earlier seasons, adding: [...] "We mention that she exists but we don't {{tell you what happened}} to her. <b>We</b> <b>even</b> made a joke out of it in one episode. But we weren't allowed to go into the subject." [...] Even when the show did portray Chuckie's mother as having died from a terminal illness, the word [...] "dead" [...] was never used by any of the characters. The character had been briefly mentioned before in the episodes [...] "Real or Robots?" [...] (1991), [...] "Chuckie vs. the Potty" [...] (1992), and [...] "My Friend Barney" [...] (1993).|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Architectural Digest, production designer Stuart Craig remarked on creating sets for Part2. Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, [...] "our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That {{was part of the}} fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and <b>we</b> <b>even</b> exaggerated the shine of the marble." [...] About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, [...] "We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver. John Richardson, the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it." ...|$|E
500|$|There was one [...] "crucial {{historical}} fact" [...] Cameron {{chose to}} omit {{from the film}} – the SS Californian {{was close to the}} Titanic the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. [...] "Yes, the [...] Californian. That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film," [...] stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. [...] "The story of the Californian was in there; <b>we</b> <b>even</b> shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set," [...] said Cameron. [...] "But I took it out. It was a clean cut, because it focuses you back onto that world. If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, {{for the end of the}} world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained." ...|$|E
500|$|After a {{creative}} spurt in October resulted in new song ideas, Bono {{proposed that the}} group release a double album. The Edge said: [...] "There would have been two records, depending on which songs we decided to finish. There was this one album, the 'blues' album that Bono was talking about, and another, much more 'European', {{which is kind of}} the way I was led." [...] Eno cautioned the group about pursuing the material, telling the Edge: [...] "I know that any one of these new ideas is good enough to make the record, but we have to draw the line somewhere. If <b>we</b> <b>even</b> consider any of them we'll still be here in three months time." [...] U2 relented, shelving the new songs to avoid missing their deadline to complete the album. Recording for The Joshua Tree wrapped up in November 1986. Rough mixes had been created throughout the sessions after each song was recorded to, in Lanois' words, take [...] "snapshots along the way ... because sometimes you go too far". The Edge explained that the arrangement and production of each song was approached individually and that while there was a strong uniform direction, they were prepared to [...] "sacrifice some continuity to get the rewards of following each song to a conclusion".|$|E

The group went on a US fall tour in October and November with support from The Maine and Bad Rabbits. On November 7, a music video {{was released}} for [...] "You Got Me". The video begins with the band wondering about Reyes whereabouts, before shifting to Reyes dancing on an empty stage. The idea for it was proposed by the group's tour manager. Cooper said: [...] "Back before <b>we</b> <b>even</b> started touring, we’d go out to clubs on Long Island together and Eddie [...] would be tearing up the dance floor ... {{is by far the}} best dancer of the band." [...] On March 21, 2012, a music video was released for [...] "This Is All Now". Directed by Greg Hunter and Josh Romero of Dionysian Entertainment, they had shot the footage during the previous summer and created a music video with it. The group was so impressed they selected it as an official video. In April, the band toured Australia with New Found Glory and This Time Next Year. Between June and August, they were one of the headliners of the 2012 edition of Warped Tour.|$|E
500|$|Lennertz {{recorded}} the soundtrack at The Village recording studio in West Los Angeles and Capitol Records. Lennertz attempted to remain [...] "authentic" [...] to the characters' progression from average worker to calculated killer. To achieve this aim, he decided against recording digitally, instead recording the tracks on two-inch analog tape, intending each musical cue to {{sound as if}} it was emanating from a vinyl record. He explained, [...] "The idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album. It isn't over-produced or shiny and digital in any way. It's brash, noisy, and full of bravado and swagger. I knew that if we could harness some of this sonic magic in the score, then the toughness and confidence of the music would play against Bateman, Sudeikis, and Charlie Day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that transpire." [...] Lennertz continued, [...] "We tracked through tape before Pro Tools to get that fat sound, and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection. <b>We</b> <b>even</b> used the same Wurlitzer that Money Mark played on Beck's classic ‘Where It's At’. At the end of the day, Seth [...] and I wanted to produce a score that is as irreverent and full of attitude as the movie itself. I think we did it...and most of all, everyone had a blast in the process." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 19, 2000, {{soon after}} Halos preview at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2000, Microsoft {{announced}} that it had acquired Bungie Software and that Bungie would {{become a part of}} the Microsoft Game Division under the name Bungie Studios. Halo would be developed as an exclusive, first-person shooter title for the Xbox. The reasons for Bungie accepting Microsoft's offer were varied. Jones stated that [...] "I don't remember the details exactly, it was all a blur. We'd been talking to people for years and years—before <b>we</b> <b>even</b> published Marathon, Activision made a serious offer. But the chance to work on Xbox—the chance to work with a company that took the games seriously. Before that we worried that we'd get bought by someone who just wanted Mac ports or didn't have a clue." [...] Martin O'Donnell, who had joined Bungie as an employee only ten days before the merger was announced, remembers that the stability of the Xbox as a development platform was not the only benefit. Shortly before Myth IIs release, it was discovered versions of the game could erase a player's hard drive; the glitch led to a massive recall of the games right before they shipped, which cost Bungie nearly one million dollars. O'Donnell stated in a Bungie podcast that this recall created some financial uncertainty, although accepting the offer was not something Bungie [...] "had to do."
