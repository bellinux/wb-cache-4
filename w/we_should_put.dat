5|$|Sir Boyle Roche, 1st Baronet (October 1736 – 5 June 1807) was an Irish politician. After a {{distinguished}} career in North America with the British Army, Roche {{became a member}} of the Irish House of Commons in 1775, generally acting in support of the viceregal government. He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than his politicsthey were riddled with mixed metaphors ("Mr Speaker, I smell a rat; I see him forming in the air and darkening the sky; but I'll nip him in the bud"), malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase ("Why <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>put</b> ourselves out of our way to do anything for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?"). Roche may have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan's model for Mrs Malaprop.|$|E

Still, he appealed a decision finding the limiting of same-sex marriage {{in the state of}} New York unconstitutional. [...] "My personal opinion is that anybody should be allowed to marry anybody. I don't happen to think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>put</b> restrictions on who you should marry.... What the city doesn't want to have happen is people getting a marriage license and then six months, or one year later, or two years later, finding out it's meaningless," [...] he said.|$|E

2500|$|He {{elaborated}} on {{his opposition}} to the program: [...] "I think we are removing much of the burden from those that could actually help reach these objectives, particular the growth and employment objectives, and we are putting that onus strangely on ourselves rather than letting it rest where it should lie. We are too accepting of dangerous policies from others that have been long in the making, and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>put</b> the burden on them." [...] While Federal Reserve officials routinely offer their views on non-monetary questions such as taxes, spending and regulations, it is unusual for a Federal Reserve official to suggest that monetary support should be withheld in order to compel other branches of government to enact the Federal Reserve's favored policies.|$|E
2500|$|Its initial {{concept was}} based on a poem Jackson had written and found in a notebook. Jackson's {{original}} lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jam commented [...] "The lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was something I had done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up." [...] Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. [...] "We ended up with two different choruses," [...] said Jam. [...] "I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'" [...] "The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' and said <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>put</b> it {{at the end of the}} song." [...] Jackson presented three songs including [...] "Doesn't Really Matter" [...] and an early version of [...] "Feels So Right," [...] later included on Jackson's following album. Segal decided [...] "Doesn't Really Matter" [...] was a better fit and a [...] "summertime record." [...] A slightly modified version was included on All for You, featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's remix by Rockwilder. The song paved the way for All for You, with Jam stating [...] "All For You" [...] and [...] "Someone to Call My Lover" [...] and all those songs came off the energy of [...] "Doesn’t Really Matter." ...|$|E

6000|$|On seeing this, Peterkin turned with a grave face {{to us and}} said, [...] "It's {{my opinion}} that these birds are all stark, staring mad, {{and that this is}} an enchanted island.

6000|$|While {{they were}} thus conversing {{together}} after dinner, Captain Merlotte {{was made to}} understand, that though the governor could not admit an open avowed trade, yet that the merchants would not be forbid coming on board our ship, and trading with us in such manner as <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be very well satisfied with; after which, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be at no hazard of getting the goods <b>we</b> <b>should</b> sell <b>put</b> on shore; and we had an experiment of this made in a few days, as follows: ...|$|R

"Tante," [...] said Marie again, [...] "at {{the back}} of your house is an old cattle kraal made by Kaffirs, and in that cattle kraal, as I have seen, there are mealie-pits where those Kaffirs stored their grain.

5000|$|Another {{factor in}} the store's {{eventual}} closure was that David Mirvish did not have his father's enthusiasm for the store, preferring the family theatre business to the store he inherited.
