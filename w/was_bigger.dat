40|$|In this dissertation, {{we study}} the partial and generic {{uniqueness}} of block term tensor decompositions in signal processing. We present several conditions for generic uniqueness of tensor decompositions of multilinear rank (1, L 1, L 1), [...] ., (1, LR, LR) terms. Our proof {{is based on}} algebraic geometric methods. Mathematical preliminaries for this dissertation are multilinear algebra, and classical algebraic geometry. In geometric language, we prove that the joins of relevant subspace varieties are not tangentially weakly defective. We also give conditions for partial uniqueness of block term tensor decompositions by proving that the joins of relevant subspace varieties are not defective. The main result is the following. For a tensor Y belong to the tensor product of three complex vector spaces of dimensions I, J, K, we assume that L 1, L 2, [...] ., LR is from small to large, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to J, and J <b>is</b> strictly <b>bigger</b> than LR. If the dimension of ambient space is strictly less than IJK, then for general tensors among those admitting block term tensor decomposition, the block term tensor decomposition is partially unique {{under the condition that}} the binomial coefficient indexed by J and LR <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R, and I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2; it has infinitely many expressions under the condition IJK is strictly less than the sum from L_ 1 ^ 2 to L_R^ 2; it is essentially unique under any of the following there conditions: (i) I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2, J, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to the sum from L 1 to LR (ii) R is 2, I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2 (iii) I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to the sum from L 1 to LR, J <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2 LR, the binomial coefficient indexed by J and LR <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R...|$|R

The sources of water came from a stream running through the Forbidden Park and under the northern city wall, two different running streams from outside the city in the south, a stream that fed into the pond of the walled East Park, which in turn fed into a canal that led to the inner city. These canal waterways in turn streamed water into the ponds of the West Palace while the lake in the Xingqing Palace connected two different canals running through the city. The canals were also used to transport crucial goods throughout the city, such as charcoal and fire wood in the winter.|$|E
