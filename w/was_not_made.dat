Wallis negotiated with the Scientology leaders, and it was agreed upon that certain sections of the book would be edited.

He also spurned {{advice from}} Lloyd George about {{his choice of}} advisors (apart from James Stevenson from the Ministry of Munitions who was briefly Deputy for Civil Recruiting), instead {{appointing}} cronies from Birmingham who were as out of their depth as he was. Chamberlain nearly resigned in June 1917 when, having not been told or consulted, he read in the newspapers {{that he had been}} given a new Parliamentary Secretary.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{balls in}} North America were first found in Iowa coal seams in 1894, {{although}} {{the connection to}} European coal balls <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> until Adolf Carl Noé (whose coal ball was found by Gilbert Cady) drew the parallel in 1922. Noé's work renewed interest in coal balls, and by the 1930s had drawn paleobotanists from Europe to the Illinois Basin in search of them.|$|E

5|$|On June 28, the Lakers {{decided that}} they would not make Morris the $1.2 million {{qualifying}} offer prior to the July 1 deadline that would have been necessary to make him a restricted free agent. Although the team expressed interest in re-signing Morris at a lower priced contract and having him represent the team again in the summer league, he would become an unrestricted free agent at the deadline because the qualifying offer <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>made.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mystic Seaport Light {{is subject}} to United States Coast Guard {{regulations}} to become operational, {{and because it is}} a full-sized replica of a lighthouse, requirements include supervisory schedules and installation of an emergency, backup light.

5|$|The U.S. {{military}} began targeting {{food crops}} in October 1962, primarily using Agent Blue; the American public <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> {{aware of the}} crop destruction programs until 1965 (and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring). In 1965, 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops. The first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the State Department in March 1966.|$|E

He then published Stone Alone, an autobiography based on scrapbooks and diaries he had been keeping since the band's early days. A few years later he formed Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings and began recording and touring again.|$|E
5|$|A severe {{fire at the}} Grand Central {{station on}} April 21, 1964, {{destroyed}} the demonstration train and manual operation had been restored since. The fire began under a shuttle train on track 3, and it became larger, feeding on the wooden platform. The train on Track 1 was saved when the motorman saw smoke, and reversed the train. The basements of nearby buildings were damaged. Tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on April 23, 1964, while Track 3 returned to service on June 1, 1964. The reinstallation of Track 3 was delayed {{because of the need}} to replace 60 beams that were damaged in the fire. Initially, a decision <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> concerning whether or not the automated shuttle train should be reintroduced.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1826, the Canal Company had {{insufficient}} funds {{to complete the}} work, and a special meeting authorised the taking out of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit. The canal was an obvious competitor to the River Tone Navigation, which was managed by the Conservators of the River Tone, a legal body created for that purpose by Act of Parliament in 1699. There was animosity between the Company and the Conservators, with the Company maintaining {{that they had a}} right to use the Tone to reach the centre of Taunton, and the Conservators maintaining that they did not. The canal was scheduled to be opened on 1 January 1827, but the opening was delayed until 3 January, as the connection to the River Tone <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> until 2 January. The opening celebrations were hampered by snow and bitter cold weather.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s Kneale {{was once again}} {{regularly}} writing for the BBC, who announced plans to produce a fourth Quatermass serial in 1972. This ultimately <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> by the BBC, but Kneale's scripts were produced in 1979 as a four-part serial for Thames Television, titled Quatermass. This time John Mills played Quatermass in an expensive and high-profile production, which was screened on the ITV network. The production company Euston Films also released a 100-minute film version titled The Quatermass Conclusion or Quatermass IV, for distribution abroad. There was, however, little interest among film distributors, and it received only a limited theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Calthrop {{appeared}} at the Light Railway Inquiry for the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway on 3–4 August 1897 and spoke particularly on the proposed open level crossings {{and the use of}} transporter wagons. Calthrop claimed it only took 3 minutes to transfer wagons, based on his experience on the Barsi Light Railway. However the Order <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> until 8 September 1899 and in early 1900 the proprietors reached agreement with the Cambrian Railways to build the line. Their engineer, Alfred J. Collins, took charge of the engineering requirements, with consequent conservative 4-wheel wagons and other provisions.|$|E
