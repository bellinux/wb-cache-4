500|$|... "Vanilla Chocolat" [...] {{was written}} by Stan, Sava Constantin, Alexandru Cotoi, Stefan Mihalache and Mika Moupondo, while {{production}} was handled by Cotoi. The track was recorded at Fonogram Studios in Bucharest, Romania, and features lyrics written in both English and French. [...] "Vanilla Chocolat" [...] was composed during the song-writing Fonocamp-camp in Azuga, Romania, where the singer worked on new songs along with fellow Romanian and international artists. Particularly, Stan {{felt that she was}} very [...] "pleased with the collaboration, because [...] really wanted to work with Romanian artists, not just with Romanian producers like on [...] second studio album." [...] She talked about the choosing of Connect-R as the guest vocalist for [...] "Vanilla Chocolat":"I chose Connect-R because it seems that he can [...] "deal" [...] with every music genre, because he is flexible and he can continue even with every unexpected change or sound combination. Connect-R can also sing in every language without any problems, because he believes in his own work. <b>We</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Fonogram Studios, and we started 'half seriously and jokingly' to work on the song, along with Alex Cotoi. The result is 'sweet and fragrant'.|$|E

50|$|From the novel, {{the lyrics}} are:Are you, are youComing to the treeThey strung up {{a man they}} say who murdered three.Strange things did happen hereNo {{stranger}} would it beIf <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> midnight in <b>the</b> hanging tree.Are you, are youComing to the treeWhere dead man called out for his love to fleeStrange things did happen hereNo stranger would it beIf <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> midnight in <b>the</b> hanging tree.Are you, are youComing to the treeWhere I told you to run, so we'd both be freeStrange things did happen hereNo stranger would it beIf <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> midnight in <b>the</b> hanging tree.Are you, are youComing to the treeWear a necklace of rope, {{side by side with}} me.Strange things did happen hereNo stranger would it beIf <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> midnight in <b>the</b> hanging tree.|$|R

6000|$|... "Cospetto!" [...] exclaimed the podestà. [...] "Then we must {{set down}} this Sir Smees, after all, for an arrant rogue; {{for this is}} <b>the</b> very man <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> Benedetta's <b>the</b> past night. An Americano, Signor Tenente, is he not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How stupid of me! I meant this Mr. Bayliss. Your son! <b>We</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{steamship}} offices. And {{before that}} he saved my life. So we are old friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One of {{the gang}} <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house in the woods. He {{introduced}} himself to me when he was made up as a tramp, on the railroad track." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I {{ask where}} you were going, when <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> port?" [...] I continued. [...] "Have you left Italy {{because there were no}} more wounded {{soldiers}} to be cured?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{no wish to}} {{kill the}} Prince," [...] Dominey protested, [...] "nor was it at my desire that <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> all. <b>The</b> Prince fought like a madman and slipped, after a wild lunge, on to the point of my {{stationary}} sword." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> were <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door by the surly steward. [...] "I shall dismiss that man," [...] Charles muttered, as Lord of Lebenstein. [...] "He's too sour-looking for my taste. Never saw such a brute. Not a {{smile of}} welcome!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said coolly, [...] "you {{are coming}} round to {{my way of}} thinking. I have been assuring you, {{from the very first}} moment <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Carlton, that I was not your Leopold--that I was Everard Dominey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can make}} sure they shall never hear of it," [...] {{returned}} Richard, as, after more urging, he took the coin. [...] "I can understand how desperate you felt that morning <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> newspaper office, and we'll let the whole matter drop." ...|$|E
60|$|I put the {{question}} to Benjamin when <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> luncheon-table before setting forth for the distant suburb in which Miserrimus Dexter lived. My old friend disapproved of the contemplated expedition as strongly as ever. He was unusually grave and unusually sparing of his words when he answered me.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> were <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station {{by one of}} the General's {{retainers}} and {{ten minutes}} later found ourselves in a mountain wagon and on our way toward Old Baldy, the mountain which stands just north of Sierra Blanca, which forms the majestic southern bastion of the Crestones.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{the duke}} went to York," [...] I {{continued}} hurriedly; {{and when he}} came back <b>we</b> <b>met</b> him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Star and Garter. He insisted that the match should come off in Hyde Park. I should have preferred the open roads north of Bedford House." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ow long my missis {{walked up}} and down there I don't know. It seemed ages to me; but at last I 'eard {{footsteps}} and voices, and Bob and the cook and the other two chaps wot <b>we</b> 'ad <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> music'all came along and stood grinning in <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window.|$|R
6000|$|... "On the {{enclosed}} {{slip of paper}} {{you will find the}} address of the young woman, of whom your brother spoke to me when <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hospital. I regret to say, that the circumstances under which I have obtained information of her residence, are of the most melancholy nature.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is seriously}} ill, poor soul," [...] he said. [...] "I am sorry I spoke so petulantly and so unfairly when <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> club. The near {{prospect}} of death has developed qualities in her nature which I {{ought to have}} seen before this. No matter how it may be delayed, I will patiently wait her time for the crossing to England." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{ran after}} me, triumphing in having roused the temper {{of a man}} {{old enough to have}} been her grandfather, and caught me by the arm. [...] "Your own conduct has exposed you." [...] (That was {{literally}} how she expressed herself.) [...] "I saw it in your eyes when <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station. You, the stranger--you who allowed poor ignorant me to introduce myself--you knew me all the time, knew me by sight!" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were all}} quietly {{disposed}} {{in the room}} in this way, when the justice, Mr. Robert Nicholson, came in with his brother. It might have been only fancy, but I thought I could see in both their faces that something remarkable had happened since <b>we</b> had <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last examination.|$|R
5000|$|Dame Shirley {{explains}} how the collaboration came about: “Blake sang Moon River at my 70th birthday party, and then <b>we</b> <b>met</b> again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> reception of charity Variety’s 70th anniversary six months ago. Ollie mentioned singing a Christmas song together, and I said I’ve never done a Christmas song before!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "--whom <b>we</b> <b>met</b> {{afterward}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spread," [...] she concluded. [...] "How did {{you manage}} it all? Mr. Irving in the 'Lyons Mail' was nothing to it. We thought we had walked directly over from the Tree; and there you were, all ready to receive us, in immaculate evening dress." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gloody {{had done}} his best to prepare Cristel for the terrible {{confidence}} which he had determined to repose in her, and had not succeeded. What the poor girl must have suffered, I could but too readily understand, on recalling the startling changes in her look and manner when <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> river-margin of the wood. She was pledged to secrecy, under penalty of ruining {{the man who was}} trying to save me; and to her presence of mind was trusted the whole responsibility of preserving my life. What a situation for a girl of eighteen! ...|$|E
60|$|Cameron's society {{never came}} {{together}} again in formal session, and I {{was not able}} to carry out my plan for developing a psychic along the line of proving the identity of the spirits manifesting. However, between the final sitting of the club and my next meeting with Fowler and Miller, I passed through a series of very interesting experiences more or less corroborative of the phenomena which the members had witnessed either individually or as a body. These additional experiments I proceeded at once to lay before my friends as <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> club one quiet afternoon a couple of weeks later.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you can {{settle a}} bet for us, I reckon. Bill Dacre thar bet me five dollars and the drinks {{that a young}} gal <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> edge of the Carquinez Woods, dressed in a long brown duster and half muffled up in a hood, was the {{daughter}} of Father Wynn of Excelsior. I did not get a fair look at her, but {{it stands to reason that}} a high-toned young lady like Nellie Wynn don't go trap'sing along the wood like a Pike County tramp. I took the bet. May be you know if she's here or in Excelsior?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{lost the}} sound of thy conch, {{wandering}} Dudley, as we fell into the deep hollow of the mountain," [...] said Content, in a pause of the discourse; [...] "since which time, neither eye nor ear of any has had trace of thy movements, until <b>we</b> <b>met</b> thee <b>at</b> <b>the</b> postern, stationed like a looker-out on his watch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, we came together," [...] I answered. [...] "We <b>met</b> <b>at</b> Charing Cross, and {{he spoke}} to me. He knew my name, and {{reminded}} me that <b>we</b> had once <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 'Vagabonds' Club.'" ...|$|R
60|$|CRAVEN. Why, I didn't know {{it until}} to-night. It's a most {{extraordinary}} thing. <b>We</b> <b>met</b> by chance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> theatre; {{and he turns}} out to be my oldest friend.|$|R
6000|$|Thus then <b>we</b> <b>met.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> {{sight of}} our guide's white form, the horse which the Khania rode reared up so violently that I {{thought it would}} have thrown her. But she {{mastered}} the animal with her whip and voice, and called out--"Who is this draped hag of the Mountain that stops {{the path of the}} Khania Atene and her dead lord? My guests, I find you in ill company, for it seems that you are conducted by an evil spirit to meet an evil fate. That guide of yours must surely be something hateful and hideous, for were she a wholesome woman she would not fear to show her face." ...|$|E
6000|$|Who come yonder? Those two fellows whom <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table-d'hote at the [...] "Hotel de Russie" [...] {{the other}} day: gentlemen of splendid costume, and yet {{questionable}} appearances, {{the eldest of}} whom called for the list of wines, and cried out loud enough for all the company to hear, [...] "Lafite, six florins. 'Arry, shall we have some Lafite? You don't mind? No more do I then. I say, waiter, let's 'ave a pint of ordinaire." [...] Truth is stranger than fiction. You good fellow, wherever you are, why did you ask 'Arry to 'ave that pint of ordinaire {{in the presence of}} your obedient servant? How could he do otherwise than chronicle the speech? ...|$|E
6000|$|Elma {{drew her}} hand away with stately reserve. [...] "I mean it, Mr. Waring," [...] she said slowly, sitting down on the bank, and gasping a little for air, {{just as she had}} done in the tunnel. [...] "I really mean it. I LIKED you in the train that day; I was GRATEFUL to you in the accident; I knew I LOVED you the {{afternoon}} <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Holkers'. There, I've told you that plainly--more plainly than I thought I ever could tell it to any man on earth--because we knew one another so well when we thought we were dying side by side, and because--because I can see you really love me.... Well, it can never be. I can never marry you." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned away}} quickly, but she lingered still. [...] "Do you {{remember}} promising me, soon after <b>we</b> first <b>met,</b> that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end {{of six months}} you would tell me definitely what you thought of me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a bad}} business, Harry," [...] {{the latter}} said, [...] "but, there is one {{satisfaction}} that, come what may, nothing can disturb our friendship. We {{have never had a}} quarrel since <b>we</b> first <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old school down there, six years ago. We have been dear friends always, and my only regret has been that your laziness has prevented our being rivals, for neither would have grudged the other victory." ...|$|R
6000|$|I was {{somewhat}} frightened, {{and was glad}} that a summons of 'my daughter' from the Princess of Conde interrupted these strange communications. I understood them better when we were called upon to ell the old Marchioness the names of every one whom <b>we</b> had <b>met</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Hotel de Rambouillet, and on hearing {{of the presence of}} Mademoiselle de Bourbon she said: 'Ah! yes, a marriage is arranged for the young lady with the Duke of Longueville.' ...|$|R
