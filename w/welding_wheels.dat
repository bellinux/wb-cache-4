40|$|The {{efficiency}} of Ultrasonic Peening (UP) application for fatigue life improvement of automotive <b>welded</b> <b>wheels</b> was studied {{based on the}} results of fatigue testing of real wheels in as-welded condition and after application of the UP. During the fatigue loading, the cracks initiate in the weld toe zone at the start and the end areas of the welds. Firstly, the fatigue cracks are observed on the surface and, with the increase in the number of loading cycles, the cracks propagate through the thickness of the material in the rim area causing at certain stage the air leakage. The improvement treatment of <b>welded</b> <b>wheels</b> was performed using the Computerized Complex for UP. On average, the speed of UP of weld toe was about 0. 5 m/min. The crack propagation rate in <b>welded</b> <b>wheel</b> subjected to UP was significantly lower than the fatigue crack propagation rate in the wheel in as-welded condition. The comparison of the fatigue life, using the same crack length criterion, had shown that the UP treated <b>welded</b> <b>wheels</b> demonstrated three times longer fatigue life that the same automotive wheel in as-welded condition...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis research is to develop an adhesive bonding solution in order to remove the classic welding technology exploited nowadays in the automotive steel wheel system. The examined solution is an hybrid joint, based on adhesive boding combined {{with the presence of}} an interference fit. This hybrid joining technology consists in coupling two cylindrical components together by force-fitting one into the other after having placed an adhesive on the mating surfaces. This technique would allow the joining of dissimilar material to enable the design of hybrid lightweight wheels. Moreover, it would provide a better stress distribution in the joint area that could induce fatigue life improvement. The contributions of the adhesive and the interference on the performance of the final hybrid joint is still not completely clear. In particular, the effect of the adhesive nature and of its mechanical and adhesive responses on the performance of the hybrid joint is under concern in this research. A study of the phenomena acting at the interference level is conducted at the laboratory level before industrial case application. An experimental method is set up in order to test the adhesives in a press fit joint. Static and dynamic tests are carried out examining the behavior of different adhesives, including rigid epoxies and flexible polyurethanes, and fractographic analysis are then performed. The second part of the study is focused on the feasibility of the hybrid technology on the wheel system. Exploiting the outcomes of the laboratory analysis, bonded wheel prototypes are assembled and tested statically and dynamically, according to component validation in MW. From the laboratory scale analyses it is found that the adhesive type mainly affects the static resistance of the hybrid joint. In particular the curing technology affects the decoupling behavior and the rheology influences the quantity of adhesive that remains inside the joint despites the interference levels. On the other hand, the interference rules the stiffness of the assembly and strongly affects the fatigue behavior of the cylindrical joint. The study conducted on the wheel component confirms the laboratory scale outcomes. For what concern the feasibility study, the bonded wheel shows similar performances compared to the <b>welded</b> <b>wheel</b> without design modifications of the components. However, the joint geometry has to be redesigned to exploit all the advantages of the adhesive bondin...|$|R
40|$|Flash {{butt welding}} {{is a well}} {{established}} economical process for solid state butt welding. It consists indirect electrical heating of {{the ends of the}} work pieces to be welded and forging them together. While heating, a thermal distribution characterized by a steep temperature gradient is established along the axial length of the pieces. Flash butt welding is widely used for steel band <b>welding</b> m <b>wheel</b> industry. Major advantages are economical in operation, suitable for mass production and high in joint strength. Loadstar (pvt) Ltd has six flash butt machines in different production lines for rim and band manufacturing. The major problem is considerably high amount of scrap percentage due to welding cracks. This problem severely affects the lines which have severe forming or stretching operations in latter stages. For this investigation the line 05 was selected which has high scrap percentage. The main aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the flash butt welding cracks in rim manufacturing and to find out the main reasons for the defects. The analysis of flash butt welding cracks in nm manufacturing is done m five stages. In the first stage, attention is paid to literature survey, in which the present stage of the researches carried out in the industry regarding the flash butt welding is discussed. Only few literature sources are available although there are many wheel manufacturing companies- [...] in the world. Certainly there might be a lot of researches carried out under this topic in the history,' but due to high competitiveness among the companies the research outcomes might be kept as company secrets. In this project, the analysis of flash butt <b>welding</b> cracks in <b>wheel</b> manufacturing will be discussed in detail.

40|$|Wheel–rail {{interaction}} {{is one of}} the most important research topics in railway engineering. It involves track impact response, track vibration and track safety. Track structure failures caused by wheel–rail impact forces can lead to significant economic loss for track owners through damage to rails and to the sleepers beneath. Wheel–rail impact forces occur because of imperfections in the wheels or rails such as wheel flats, irregular wheel profiles, rail corrugations and differences in the heights of rails connected at a <b>welded</b> joint. A <b>wheel</b> flat can cause a large dynamic impact force as well as a forced vibration with a high frequency, which can cause damage to the track structure. In the present work, a three-dimensional (3 -D) finite element (FE) model for the impact analysis induced by the wheel flat is developed by use of the finite element analysis (FEA) software package ANSYS and validated by another validated simulation. The effect of wheel flats on impact forces is thoroughly investigated. It is found that the presence of a wheel flat will significantly increase the dynamic impact force on both rail and sleeper. The impact force will monotonically increase with the size of wheel flats. The relationships between the impact force and the wheel flat size are explored from this finite element analysis and they are important for track engineers to improve their understanding of the design and maintenance of the track system...|$|R
40|$|Short-wave {{irregularities}} in the wheel-rail interface {{are at the}} basis of track and vehicle damage and deterioration. On the short term, they result into high dynamic train-track interaction forces and a high energy input into the system that must be dissipated in the different system components or "levels", leading on its turn to progressive deterioration on the long term. Furthermore, the short-wave defects grow into longer defects in the track geometry, {{due to the fact}} that the train is a travelling multi-body mass-spring system. The lifetime of the track and its components can be extended by adjusting the "path" of the dissipated power spectrum through the system and adjusting component and system properties with respect to their hysteretic behaviour. Instead of life-time extension, such measures may also aim at an extension of maintenance intervals, which is important to optimise the availability of e. g. high-speed lines. The present study investigates two particular types of short defects in detail: rail <b>welds</b> and <b>wheel</b> flats. In longitudinal direction and on a global scale, the contact between a rolling wheel and a rail can be distinguished into continuous single-point contact and transient double-point contact. The contact type that occurs depends on the actual geometry of the wheel-rail interface in the running direction. The first contact type leads to a dynamic amplification of the static axle load, whereas the second leads to wheel-rail impact. Especially the latter contact type is detrimental to the rail system and should be prevented as much as possible or detected at an early stage. The introduction of rail welds instead of the traditionally bolted connections reduced the dynamic forces at rail joints globally with a factor three. However, welds remain potential damage initiators due to the local geometrical and metallurgical discontinuity. Investigations show an approximately linear relationship between the extreme value of the dynamic wheel-rail contact force at a weld, the maximum absolute rail inclination and the train speed. The geometry of rail welds is traditionally assessed with the principle of vertical tolerances. A new assessment method for rail welds is proposed, with norm values for the allowable inclination depending on the line section train speed. This method is based on a relatively strong correlation between discretised maximum rail geometry inclinations (first derivatives) and extreme dynamic wheel-rail contact forces, relative to the poor correlation between tolerances and extreme forces. The method aims at a reduction and uniformisation of dynamic contact forces at rail welds, in order to avoid deterioration. Wheel flats are commonly assessed on the basis of their length and/or depth, or automatically detected by wheel impact load detectors in the track. This study has shown that the minimum circumferential wheel tread curvature is the critical parameter that governs the dynamic wheel-rail interaction in the presence of wheel flats. It determines which contact type occurs for a given flat geometry: continuous single-point contact, in the subcritical speed regime, or transient double-point contact, in the transcritical speed regime. It furthermore determines the magnitude of the contact force in the subcritical regime. Both speed regimes are shown to exhibit essentially different features with respect to the dynamic wheel-rail interaction: the track stiffness governs the interaction for low train speeds and long flats, whereas for high speeds and/or short flats the inertial properties of the wheel and the rail govern the interaction. The force-speed relationship is non-linear in the first regime, whereas linearity is a good approximation in the second regime. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
