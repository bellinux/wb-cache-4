5|$|The {{general law}} {{of this land}} is in favour of the wager of battle, {{and it is our}} duty to {{pronounce}} the law as it is, and not as we may <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> to be.

We are delivering the law as it is, and not as we <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> to be, and therefore we must pronounce our judgment, that the battle must take place.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{kind and}} caring to others {{no matter what}} their circumstances, as {{depicted}} in the television series. In an early episode, Ariel helps an orphaned merboy who had fallen in with a bad crowd. In another episode, Ariel befriends a supposed bad luck creature and protects it from Ursula and other merfolk who <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> harm. Ariel appears as an adult in Return to the Sea and gives birth to a daughter named Melody, becoming the first, and currently, only, Disney princess to become a mother. Ariel is protective of her daughter, as Triton was of Ariel in the first film. After Morgana threatens Ariel and King Triton, Prince Eric and Ariel build a wall around the palace to protect Melody from Morgana and other terrors of the ocean. Although it protected her, it could not protect her curiosity. Ariel's Beginning depicts her personality {{as it was in the}} original film after Jodi Benson had advocated returning the character to her roots. Ariel is once again rebellious, and after her father decrees music to be banned in Atlantica she runs away with Sebastian and his band.|$|E

5|$|Radical Dreamers {{features}} three protagonists—Serge, Kid, and Magil—who {{seek out}} treasure as venturesome, reputable thieves. The young adult narrator, Serge, is a drifting musician who met Kid by chance {{three years ago}} in a remote town. Serge enjoys adventure with a carefree attitude. Kid, only sixteen years old, is a renowned professional thief with a reputation for boisterous behavior. Possessing a turbulent history, Kid dubiously fancies herself as a kind of Robin Hood. Magil is an enigmatic, handsome masked man skilled in magic who rarely speaks and can fade into shadow at will. Crowned by flowing, blue hair, Magil accompanied Kid well before Serge joined the group. They seek the Frozen Flame, a mythic artifact capable of granting any <b>wish.</b> <b>It</b> is hidden in Viper Manor—the home of a terrible and powerful aristocrat named Lynx, who gained control of the estate after usurping power from and killing the Acacia Dragoons, a familial unit of warriors.|$|E

25|$|Many of Kierkegaard's earlier {{writings}} from 1843 to 1846 {{were written}} pseudonymously. In the non-pseudonymous The Point of View of My Work as an Author, {{he explained that}} the pseudonymous works are written from perspectives which are not his own: while Kierkegaard himself was a religious author, the pseudonymous authors wrote from points of view that were aesthetic or speculative. One exception to this is Anti-Climacus, a pseudonymous author developed after the writing of The Point of View: Anti-Climacus is a religious author who writes from a Christian perspective so ideal that Kierkegaard did not <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> to be attributed to himself.|$|E

When he is distressed, she knows what kinds and degree of soothing he requires to comfort him – and she knows that sometimes a few words or a distraction will be all that is needed. On the other hand, the mother who responds inappropriately tries to socialize with the baby when he is hungry, play with him when he is tired, or feed him when he is trying to initiate social interaction.|$|E

25|$|Much of the period, {{from late}} 1840 to autumn 1842, Ruskin spent abroad with his parents, principally in Italy. His studies of Italian art were chiefly guided by George Richmond, {{to whom the}} Ruskins were {{introduced}} by Joseph Severn, a friend of Keats (whose son, Arthur Severn, married Ruskin's cousin, Joan). He was galvanised into writing a defence of J. M. W. Turner when he read an attack on several of Turner's pictures exhibited at the Royal Academy. It recalled an attack by critic, Rev John Eagles, in Blackwood's Magazine in 1836, which had prompted Ruskin to write a long essay. John James had sent the piece to Turner who did not <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> to be published. It finally appeared in 1903.|$|E
25|$|Nina Williams {{was born}} and raised in Ireland, as was her sister, Anna. From a young age, both were taught various forms of martial arts such as {{assassination}} martial arts, hapkido and koppojutsu. Both sisters admired their father, a former assassin Richard Williams, which caused a sibling rivalry between the two as they crave and compete for his attention. When Richard died, both sisters started to blame each other for the cause of his death. Although they tried to maintain their relationship following their father's last <b>wish,</b> <b>it</b> only made their rivalry strengthen even further. Nina's knowledge of the assassination martial arts help her quickly becoming an assassin and the 20-year-old Nina had later been hired during The King of Iron Fist Tournament to assassinate the head of Mishima Zaibatsu, Heihachi Mishima. However, she failed.|$|E

That's better than watching the country we're in being flattened by a storm. He also wrote:Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead. It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness for many of us. I never met the man but, on balance, I {{came to the conclusion that}} he was a force for good rather than ill. I think I came to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion twenty years ago, or maybe fifteen. So, I'm sorry he's dead, I <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> were otherwise.|$|E

500|$|Kierkegaard’s {{discourse}} {{has to do}} {{with the}} difference between wishing and willing in the development of a particular expectancy. [...] "As thought becomes more absorbed in the future, it loses its way in its restless attempt to force or entice an explanation from the riddle." [...] Expectancy always looks to the future and can hope, but regret, which is what Goethe did in his book The Sorrows of Young Werther, closes the door of hope and love becomes unhappy. Kierkegaard points to [...] "faith as the highest" [...] expectancy because faith is something that everyone has, or can have. He says: [...] "The person who <b>wishes</b> <b>it</b> for another person <b>wishes</b> <b>it</b> for himself; the person who <b>wishes</b> <b>it</b> for himself <b>wishes</b> <b>it</b> for every other human being, because that by which another person has faith is not that by which he is different from him but is that by which he is like him; that by which he possesses it is not that by which he is different from others but that by which he is altogether like all." ...|$|R
