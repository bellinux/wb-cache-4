40|$|Principal aim of {{this thesis}} is the design of new website {{development}} process model and the design and implementation of its automated support by information technologies instruments. Process design itself will be build on identified best practices of available methodics for <b>web</b> applications <b>development</b> and this process will also respect and apply SEO (Search Engine Optimization) principles Biggest contribution of this thesis is designed <b>web</b> application <b>development</b> process model {{which is based on}} <b>web</b> application <b>development</b> methodics best practices and also contains additional activities which have to be done but they aren't part of these methodics. Mapping of the optimization process and designed process activities and implementation of automated support for these activities via desktop application are next important contributions of this thesis. This thesis is divided into five main chapters (except introduction and conclusion). First chapter is focused on definition of application development basic concepts and mainly on analysis of <b>web</b> application <b>development</b> methodics. Second chapter takes up analysis outputs and it forms the basis of this thesis. Design and description of <b>web</b> <b>development</b> process model generate the content of this chapter. Third chapter deals with SEO problems, in the concrete, it deals with definition of SEO, presentation of optimization process and especially with presentation of optimization recommendations. Fourth and fifth chapters are focused on automated support for <b>web</b> <b>development</b> process model <b>with</b> emphasis on SEO. Within the scope of fourth chapter, process model activities which can be supported by application are identified and user requirements are defined for these activities.

40|$|Component based {{software}} development {{has become a}} very popular paradigm in many software engineering branches. In the early phase of Web 2. 0 appearance, it was also popular for <b>web</b> application <b>development.</b> From the analyzed papers, between this period and today, use of component based techniques for <b>web</b> application <b>development</b> was somewhat slowed down, however, the recent development indicates a comeback.

In this article we want to investigate {{the current state of}} <b>web</b> application <b>development</b> <b>with</b> component approach.

40|$|Research into Web cost {{estimation}} {{is relatively new}} where few studies have compared {{cost estimation}} modelling techniques for <b>Web</b> <b>development,</b> <b>with</b> an emphasis placed on techniques such as Case-based Reasoning (CBR), linear and stepwise regression. Although in a large subset of these studies CBR has given the best predictions, results {{were based on a}} simple type of CBR, where no adaptation rules were used to adjust the estimated effort obtained. In addition, when comparing the prediction accuracy of estimation models, analysis has been limited to a maximum of three training/validation sets, which according to recent studies, may lead to untrustworthy results. Since CBR is potentially easier to understand and apply (two important factors to the successful adoption of estimation methods within <b>Web</b> <b>development</b> Companies), it should be examined further. This paper has therefore two objectives: i) to further investigate the use of CBR for <b>Web</b> <b>development</b> effort prediction by comparing effort prediction accuracy of several CBR techniques; ii) to compare the effort prediction accuracy of the best CBR technique against stepwise and multiple linear regression, using twenty combinations of training/validation sets. Various measures of effort prediction accuracy were applied. One dataset was used in the estimation process. Stepwise and multiple linear regression showed the best prediction accuracy for the dataset employed. 1...|$|R
