Reflecting on {{this period of}} time in a December 2014 interview, Witherspoon attributed it to her separation from her first husband in October 2006 and their subsequent divorce, stating that she spent [...] "a few years just trying to feel better. You know, you can't really be very creative <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like your brain is scrambled eggs." [...] She claims that she [...] "wasn't making things I was passionate about. I was just kind of working, you know. And it was really clear that audiences weren't responding to anything I was putting out there." ...|$|E

If it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing were a little different, maybe it would be different. But it isn't different and that's the way life is." [...] He added that, [...] "I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably.

500|$|Herren {{described}} the album {{as an attempt}} to bridge hip hop instrumentals with vocal-orientated hip hop tracks, saying that the chopped and edited raps were [...] "another layer of music" [...] and that he was [...] "into creating a whole new mangled language [...] it's a form of communication without communicating, a new flow <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like you're listening to a standard hip hop track but there's something in it that's not right." [...] The cut-up vocals were also described by Herren as a tribute to Miami bass music and the group Mantronix. Herren said: [...] "Old school dirty south and booty shake shit, just the way stuff was edited back then, all the bass music and edit records... that's what inspired me. I wanted to make edit records, but bring all the shit that happened afterwards into it, hip hop from the early 90s through the present day." [...] The song [...] "Nuno" [...] features chopped-up vocals with only the phrase [...] "fuck words of wisdom" [...] intelligible; the title is a reference to the Portuguese musician Nuno Canavarro, whose 1988 album Plux Quba also features manipulated vocals including randomly-reassembled tapes of children singing. Herren used a sample from Canavarro's song [...] "Wask" [...] for [...] "Nuno".|$|E
500|$|The 1973–74 NBA {{season was}} to be West's last as a player. Now 36 years old, the veteran guard {{averaged}} 20.3points, 3.7rebounds and 6.6assists per game. In two newly introduced statistics, steals and blocks, he was credited with 2.6 steals and 0.7 blocks per game. Despite playing only 31 games due to a strained groin, West was still regarded as an elite guard, earning another callup into his final All-Star Game. Without Chamberlain, who had ended his NBA career, the Lakers won 47 games and lost in five games to the Milwaukee Bucks. After this loss, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages. West wanted to re-negotiate his contract and keep playing, however he said Cooke [...] "basically told my agent to go to hell. I felt I was deceived. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that you’re deceived you don’t {{want any part of}} the organization that deceived you. I could’ve played another very good year. Every athlete says that. But I could’ve, and I knew I could’ve. But I could never have played for the Lakers again, and I wasn’t going to play for anybody else." [...] At the time of his departure, West had scored more points than any Laker in NBA history.|$|E
500|$|Bosworth {{was cast}} as {{reporter}} Lois Lane in Bryan Singer's superhero film Superman Returns (2006). She starred {{along with her}} Beyond the Sea co-star Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as well as newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film". Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how you have an experience, a time in your life <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> you've come into your own? When you grow up a bit, and think, Now I get it? [...] That's how I feel. I feel a little bit more complete." [...] The movie grossed $52million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $391million worldwide.|$|E

500|$|The Telegraphs Nigel Farndale {{praised the}} film's {{balanced}} {{view of the}} director: [...] "ven though he was portrayed in this exquisite drama as a manipulative, vindictive martinet, the portrait was not unsympathetic." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon echoed this view, praising Jones's Hitchcock and writing that the actor [...] "managed to give [...] touches of humanity, too. There are moments <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> a real pang of sympathy for Hitchcock, although admittedly they don't last long". [...] "liding gracefully through it all (and with an impeccable American accent) Sienna Miller brings untouchable beauty and icy glamour, but also captures the extraordinary resilience Hedren must have had to withstand everything Hitchcock threw at her." [...] In The Telegraph, Clive James said [...] " [...] better choice [...] {{could not have been}} made than Sienna Miller, who is even lovelier than Hedren was...Toby Jones, quite believably looked stunned". John Doyle of Canada's The Globe and Mail was less impressed with the actors' performances. Of Miller (whom he described as [...] "good but not great") he wrote, [...] "She doesn't have the iciness that Hedren had in her youth and she struggles to convey Hedren's enormous strength of character as a woman unwilling to let Hitchcock have his way". Doyle was equally critical of Jones, describing him as someone who [...] "seems to be imitating Hitchcock rather than inhabiting the role".|$|E

The producer assured the actor: [...] "It'll be absolutely safe". The actor agreed, and when he walked onto the set the following day he observed [...] "three rows of flexiglass in front of everything and everyone is wearing hard hats.
