However, during the disappearance of Max Fenig, Deep Throat provided Mulder with false information in order to divert him, later explaining that he believed the public <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>not</b> ready to know some truths.|$|E
25|$|Thompson's lyrics {{expressed}} a rather dismal world view, {{and it has}} been suggested that the bleak subject matter of his songs helped to keep his recordings off the hit parade. A more likely explanation was given by ex-Island A man Richard Williams in the 2003 BBC TV documentary Solitary Life: Thompson <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>not</b> interested in fame and its trappings.|$|E

Changes in her band, also replacing her brother Roger as her manager, did not improve matters. The fact remained that the other female singers on MCA were selling millions of records, while Loveless, with a gold record for Honky Tonk Angel, sold less than half of that with her two follow-up albums.|$|E

He {{began his}} innings usually as one who, {{suffering}} from violent astigmatism, {{has not only}} mislaid his glasses, but had in addition a fearful headache. He made a pass or two after the ball had gone past him: he lunged fitfully and missed: he stabbed down just in time at the straight ones: he sliced the rising offside ball over the second slip: he snicked hazily past his leg stump. So, for {{about a quarter of}} an hour, it went on: or, to such an agonized onlooker as I, it seemed to go on. Then suddenly, he would catch a half volley or a long hop such a crack that the bowler, fearful of his own safety, lost all his aggressive intention, and, with it, any idea of length.|$|E
500|$|The pilot {{episode of}} Community {{received}} generally favorable reviews from critics. The aggregate review website Metacritic gives the show {{a score of}} 69 out of 100, based on 23 reviews. Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker called it [...] "One of the new season's best sitcoms", {{and gave it a}} grade B+. Heather Havrilesky, writing for Salon.com, agreed with this assessment, and commended the [...] "alarmingly smart writing". Alan Sepinwall at The Star-Ledger similarly called it [...] "the best, and funniest, new show of the season", and said he laughed just as much after seeing the pilot four times. Others were less impressed; Varietys Brian Lowry found the satire wanting, and did not much appreciate McHale's performance. The Miami Heralds Glenn Garvin found that, though particularly McHale was capable of generating [...] "sporadic laughter", the show <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>not</b> very amusing.|$|E

500|$|Morello and Cornell {{initially}} disagreed {{over the}} particulars of Cornell quitting the group, with Morello claiming that Cornell did not communicate directly with him about leaving, while Cornell countered: [...] "Tom and I did have communications {{about the fact that}} I was gonna go make a record, and that I was tired of what ended up seeming like political negotiations toward how we were gonna do Audioslave business and getting nowhere with it." [...] He also added that this process of [...] "doing Audioslave business" [...] led him to go solo. Cornell has said that the breakup was not about money, but that he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>not</b> getting along with the other members during their later years. Said Cornell, [...] "Getting along as people is one thing. Getting along as a group of people that can work together in a band situation...We weren't particularly getting along well, no. Bands work in a way where everyone at some point has to have a similar idea of how you do things...Three albums into it, it started to seem like our interests weren't as conjoined anymore." ...|$|E

On the TLC Tip (1992), TLC {{began working on}} the their second release called CrazySexyCool in late 1993 and continued through till September 1994. One of the album's tracks, [...] "Creep", was based on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins' own experience. She recalled it for Billboard: [...] "You're with a guy and he's not showing you attention, so another guy comes along and you're like, 'Hey, if you were where {{you were supposed to}} be, he couldn't be showing me attention right now!' I {{was in the middle of}} this drama, because the other guy was [...] friend, and my boyfriend <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>not</b> getting it together." [...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We thought that was a good relationship to talk about because a lot of people don't admit that's how they feel – that their man's playing on them and they want to be with him so they seek attention elsewhere, but they really want to be with their guy," [...] she added.|$|E
500|$|At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, MacFarlane {{announced}} that the episode would become available on a special DVD release, with series producer Kara Vallow confirming the release would be available on September 28, 2010, along with Seth and Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show. A month after the announcement, Kevin Reilly, President of Fox Entertainment, stated that the final decision not to air the episode was largely due to concerns about finances and advertisers: [...] "Of all the issues, [...] {{is the one that}} seems to be the most of a hot button. Particularly at that moment in time, the economy was really struggling and there were a lot of very tough conversations going on with clients." [...] Reilly said that [...] "the advertisers know what they’re getting" [...] with Family Guy, and he thought that the episode handled the subject fine, but [...] "this one felt like it could cause trouble, and it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>not</b> worth it." [...] Despite the concerns in the U.S. about the episode, it aired on June 20, 2010, on BBC Three in the UK, as a part of the season's regularly scheduled Sunday night run on the station. Although it was originally speculated that Adult Swim might air the episode, Fox stated that there were no plans to air it on their network. Several months before the episode debuted on television, the script was performed in a live table read at the Ricardo Montalbán Theatre in Hollywood, California on August 12, 2009. The special reading was attended by Academy of Television Arts and Sciences voters on the heels of the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. Family Guy was nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series, becoming the first animated program to be nominated in the category since The Flintstones in 1961. Commenting about the event, MacFarlane said, [...] "We did this to drum up Emmy votes, so we could lose by fewer votes." ...|$|E

2500|$|We {{were at the}} end of our {{recording}} {{contract with}} Century Media, and basically they didn't know if we were going to re-sign with them, so they gave us a very small budget for our last album to work with. That was about $20,000 which is a nothing deal to do a record.

2500|$|On {{the other}} side of the transaction, there were also some {{problems}}. Foremost of the problems was that the Cherokee Nation said to be represented by Attacullaculla, Oconistoto and [...] Savaninoko did not actually own all of the land it was selling. At very best, the Cherokee Nation ownership of the land between the Kentucky River and the Cumberland River was based on the claim of the old Chief Attacullaculla.

2500|$|In the 1970s {{several members}} of Enya's family formed Clannad, a Celtic band with Nicky Ryan as their manager, sound {{engineer}} and producer and his future wife Roma Ryan assisting with the tour management and administrative duties. In 1980, after her year at college, Enya decided not to study music at university and instead accepted Ryan's invitation to join the group {{with the aim of}} expanding their sound by incorporating keyboards and another backup vocalist. She toured across Europe and played an uncredited role on their sixth album, Crann Úll (1980), with a line-up of siblings Máire, Pól and Ciarán Brennan and twin uncles, Noel and Pádraig Duggan. Enya became an official and credited member by the time of their next album Fuaim (1981), which features a front cover photograph of her with the band. Nicky maintains it was never his intention to make Enya a permanent member, and realised she was [...] "fiercely independent ... intent on playing her own music. She <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>not</b> sure of how to go about it". This sparked discussions between the two on the idea of using Enya's voice to form a [...] "choir of one", a concept based on the [...] "wall of sound" [...] technique by Phil Spector that interested them both.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, The Offspring {{released}} the Baghdad 7". This EP was {{the turning point}} for the band; due to its success the band signed with Epitaph Records. Thom Wilson, who produced The Offspring's first two albums, {{had been trying to}} get the Offspring to switch to Epitaph, a label run by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. Gurewitz felt that The Offspring <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>not</b> quite pronounced enough for his label, but Baghdad convinced him to give the band a shot. Wilson and The Offspring entered the studio again and recorded Ignition. Released in 1992, Ignition exceeded all of the label's and band's expectations. Following the subsequent touring to support Ignition, The Offspring began writing new material for their third album in mid-1993. Recording sessions for Smash took place in January and February 1994 at Track Record in North Hollywood. On the recording process of the album, frontman Dexter Holland told Flux Magazine in 1994, [...] "When we recorded this album, our last one has sold maybe 15,000 copies, so the possibility of us getting played on the radio or anything like that was pretty much nonexistent. Especially because this kind of music is not generally considered acceptable by the mainstream - so, for something like this to happen, it really took us by surprise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the team's {{efforts to}} make The Settlers II {{as good as they}} {{possibly}} could, however, speaking in 2006, Häuser comments that, as with the original game, there were elements with which he was unhappy; [...] "things like the help system. There was none, to be honest. The player had to work really hard to get into the game, and there's lots of details in the game you have to learn the hard way. It would have been a great help to a new gamer if we had some put in." [...] He also agreed with many fans of the game that the shipping system didn't work very well, even after it was patched in the Gold Edition; [...] "it didn't work as we wanted it to work. I remember the ships did not transport the things you wanted to other islands, we couldn't solve this problem at the time. Because at this time, the development systems were much more difficult to use and we didn't have the ability to debug code as we do today. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>not</b> working as we wanted it to work." [...] When The Settlers III went into development in 1997, Blue Byte again sought feedback from fans, {{and one of the most}} requested aspects for the new game was that the shipping system from The Settlers II be reprogrammed.|$|E
