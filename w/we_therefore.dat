25|$|Truncation {{errors are}} {{committed}} when an iterative method is terminated or a mathematical procedure is approximated, and the approximate solution {{differs from the}} exact solution. Similarly, discretization induces a discretization error because {{the solution of the}} discrete problem does not coincide with the solution of the continuous problem. For instance, in the iteration in the sidebar to compute the solution of , after 10 or so iterations, we conclude that the root is roughly 1.99 (for example). <b>We</b> <b>therefore</b> have a truncation error of 0.01.|$|E

500|$|Francesco Algarotti's Essay on the Opera (1755) {{was a major}} {{influence}} {{in the development of}} Gluck's reformist ideology. Algarotti proposed a heavily simplified model of opera seria, with the drama pre-eminent, instead of the music or ballet or staging. The drama itself should [...] "delight the eyes and ears, to rouse up and to affect the hearts of an audience, without the risk of sinning against reason or common sense". Algarotti's ideas influenced both Gluck and his librettist, Calzabigi. Calzabigi was himself a prominent advocate of reform, and he stated: [...] "If Mr Gluck was the creator of dramatic music, he did not create it from nothing. I provided him with the material or the chaos, if you like. <b>We</b> <b>therefore</b> share the honour of that creation." ...|$|E

He is the finest practical satyrist that ever existed. ... He was so extravagantly natural, that [...] ashamed to laugh till tears coursed down their cheeks at Joe and his comicalities."

500|$|Although they {{finished}} with a [...]500 record, {{after the completion of}} the season, E. B. Beaumont was fired as Alabama's head coach. The 1894 edition of the university yearbook The Corolla stated of the Beaumont firing:"We were unfortunate in securing a coach. After keeping him for a short time, we found that his knowledge of the game was very limited. <b>We,</b> <b>therefore,</b> 'got rid of' him." [...] After Beaumont's departure, William G. Little continued the training of the team until Abbott was selected to serve as head coach for the 1893 season. Other notable players from the first Alabama team included William B. Bankhead who served as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1936 to 1940 and Bibb Graves who served as the 38th Governor of Alabama from 1927 to 1931 and again from 1935 to 1939.|$|E
