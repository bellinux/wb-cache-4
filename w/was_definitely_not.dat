25|$|The {{reinstatement}} of Pakubuwana II in Kartasura on 14 December 1742 {{marked the}} end of the Chinese war. It showed who was in control of the situation. Accordingly, Sunan Kuning surrendered in October 1743, followed by other rebel leaders. In the mid-18th century, Mataram lost much of their lands, by 1743 Mataram only consists of areas around Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Kedu and Bagelen. Cakraningrat IV <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> pleased with this situation and he began to make alliance with Surabaya, the descendants of Untung Surapati, and hired more Balinese mercenaries. He stopped paying tribute to VOC in 1744, and after a failed attempt to negotiate, the Dutch attacked Madura in 1745 and ousted Cakraningrat, who was banished to the Cape in 1746.|$|E
25|$|Shi Yi {{was known}} for leading a frugal and humble lifestyle. Unlike many other officials, he did not {{accumulate}} wealth for his family and never accepted financial aid from others. He was content with having only basic necessities. Sun Quan once went {{on a tour of}} Shi Yi's neighbourhood and saw a large mansion. When he asked who the owner of the mansion was, someone told him it was Shi Yi. However, Sun Quan said that it <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> Shi Yi, given his lifestyle. He was proven right. Shi Yi wore very simple clothing and had simple meals every day. He also enjoyed helping the needy so he often donated or gave away his personal savings to the poor. When Sun Quan heard about it, he visited Shi Yi's house and sampled the meals Shi Yi had every day. After the visit, he increased Shi Yi's salary, gave him more rewards and a larger plot of land. However, Shi Yi rejected these rewards and gifts and said that he would feel uneasy if he accepted them.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the winter}} the Carthaginians {{continued}} {{to build up}} their forces. They prepared a fleet in order to cut the supply routes and blockade fully the Roman army and were awaiting for mercenaries from Iberia and Liguria. The actual hostilities ceased for a time due {{to the efforts of}} Syphax to arbitrate for a reconciliation. Hasdrubal accepted the proposed terms, which stipulated that both Rome and Carthage should recall their armies respectively from Africa and Italy, but did not stop the aforementioned military preparations. Peace under such conditions <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> the purpose, with which Scipio negotiated with Syphax. At first he used the negotiations as a cover for trying to win over the Numidian to Rome. As these attempts proved to be of no avail, the Roman leader nevertheless continued to send envoys to the Numidian camp. Scipio aimed, firstly, to mislead the enemy that he was insecure and therefore anxious to conclude peace and, secondly, to reconnoitre the position and organization of the enemy. His envoys, who were carefully selected for the latter purpose, informed him that the both camps consisted primarily of huts built from wood, reed and other flammable material.|$|E

25|$|At the Tour of Britain, {{the final}} major event before the 2011 UCI Road World Championships, Cavendish {{made his first}} {{appearance}} at his 'home' race since 2007. It {{was part of his}} plan to be at peak form before worlds. He was immediately successful. He and leadout man Renshaw were so convincingly the best in the stage 1 sprint that the leadout man finished in second place right behind his sprinter, much like they had in the Champs-Élysées stage at the 2009 Tour de France. Their positions were reversed in the stage 5 sprint, as Renshaw took victory ahead of Cavendish. It was unclear whether Cavendish intentionally gifted the stage to his longtime leadout man, though Renshaw acknowledged afterward that Cavendish <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> giving a full effort. The news on the day for the tam was not all good, as Rasmussen was pulled from the event and had his contract terminated due to news that he had missed three doping controls. Rasmussen was later exonerated due to a procedural error {{on the part of the}} UCI. Undeterred, Cavendish closed out the Tour of Britain by winning the very short road race stage into London on its final day. Renshaw, again, took second place, perhaps proving himself the better of each other team's primary sprinter. In October, as the team's time together was winding down, Martin debuted his newly-won world championship rainbow jersey in the stage 1 time trial at the inaugural Tour of Beijing. None of the race's subsequent stages did anything to dislodge the German from the top of the overall standings, making him the first overall winner of the new event.|$|E

500|$|O'Reilly {{explained}} that Naomi's style was {{harder to get}} right and she worked with the producers, costume and make-up departments {{to find the right}} look.

What we've come up with is amazing. Some days I put my costume on for a scene and think, 'Oh Naomi, you're outrageous! I could never wear this! Oh well. Go get 'em girl!'" [...] O'Reilly thought some of Naomi's outfits complimented her [...] "quite sexual" [...] nature, especially the six-inch heels and small tops. O'Reilly admitted that she did not have too much in common with Naomi, but they could both be [...] "goofy and funny". She thought Naomi <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> as level-headed as she was in real life. She also said that she enjoyed playing a character who was different from herself. Executive producer Jason Herbison told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that he thought Naomi's type of character – a [...] "classic, troublemaking vixen, who underneath it all is just deeply insecure" [...] – had been missing from Neighbours for a few years.|$|E
500|$|From 1991 to 1994, {{alongside}} The Simpsons, Smith {{was one of}} {{the lead}} cast members in the sitcom Herman's Head as Louise. Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marlene on Dharma & Greg, and Penny in two episodes of Dead Like Me. Smith has also appeared in Phil of the Future and Teen Angel. Her one-scene role as pregnant checkout girl Nancy in 1991's City Slickers earned her [...] "more attention than all [...] previous roles combined", and taught her [...] "that it's far better to have small parts in big movies that everyone sees." [...] In 1997, she appeared as Lulu the palm reader in the independent film Just Write. Her other roles include parts in Barry Levinson's Toys and James L. Brooks' As Good as It Gets. Brooks, who is also executive producer of The Simpsons, had cast Smith in his 1994 film I'll Do Anything (in one of the film's musical numbers), but her part was cut. Aside from The Simpsons, Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story. She [...] "had a voice-over agent for about two years, and I used to go out [...] all the time, but it never really came to anything.

500|$|First season regular {{cast member}} Malcolm David Kelley {{returned}} in an uncredited cameo {{for a single}} scene as Michael's ten-year-old son Walt without dialogue and from a distance. Fifteen-year-old Kelley claimed that make-up was applied to him in an effort for him to look younger; however, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse clarified that visual effects supervisor Mitch Suskin had actually composited into the shot some footage of Kelley from production on the first season. Because Kelley was so obscured and his name did {{not appear in the}} cast list, television critics were convinced that Walt had been recast. Steve Heisler of Time Out stated that [...] "You gotta hand it to the Lost writers: For weeks, people have speculated about how they were going to treat Walt's inevitable pubescence. See, the show's set in 2004, and only a few months have passed since the plane crash. Yet … it's been years, and … Kelley has become a man. So what did they do? … They just didn't show him. Clever."

500|$|After Jinnah died, {{his sister}} Fatima {{asked the court}} to execute Jinnah's will under Shia Islamic law. This {{subsequently}} became the part of the argument in Pakistan about Jinnah's religious affiliation. Vali Nasr says Jinnah [...] "was an Ismaili by birth and a Twelver Shia by confession, though not a religiously observant man." [...] In a 1970 legal challenge, Hussain Ali Ganji Walji claimed Jinnah had converted to Sunni Islam. Witness Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada stated in court that Jinnah converted to Sunni Islam in 1901 when his sisters married Sunnis. In 1970, Liaquat Ali Khan and Fatima Jinnah's joint affidavit that Jinnah was Shia was rejected. But in 1976 the court rejected Walji's claim that Jinnah was Sunni; effectively accepting him as a Shia. In 1984 a high court bench reversed the 1976 verdict and maintained that [...] "the Quaid <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> a Shia", which suggested that Jinnah was Sunni. According to the journalist Khaled Ahmed, Jinnah publicly had a non-sectarian stance and [...] "was at pains to gather the Muslims of India under the banner of a general Muslim faith and not under a divisive sectarian identity." [...] Liaquat H. Merchant, Jinnah's grandnephew, writes that [...] "the Quaid was not a Shia; he was also not a Sunni, he was simply a Muslim". An eminent lawyer who practised in the Bombay High Court until 1940 testified that Jinnah used to pray as an orthodox Sunni.
