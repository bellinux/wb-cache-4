5|$|Armed {{hostilities}} {{during the}} Black Hawk War began at Stillman's Run, and the victory was unexpected for Black Hawk and his British Band. Black Hawk {{feared that the}} white militia and its allies would seek revenge through his total defeat. Leading his starving band, Black Hawk fled from Atkinson's pursuing army. The chase <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> as far as present day Madison, Wisconsin. It ended at the Battle of Bad Axe, where the militia and its allies massacred a weakened foe, by then made up of mostly women and children.|$|E
5|$|By 1761, the Maratha menace had diminished and by 1763, Haider Ali had {{captured}} the Keladi kingdom, defeated {{the rulers of}} Bilgi, Bednur and Gutti, invaded the Malabar {{in the south and}} conquered the Zamorin's capital Calicut with ease in 1766 and extended the Mysore kingdom up to Dharwad and Bellary in the north. Mysore was now a major political power in the subcontinent and Haider's meteoric rise from relative obscurity and his defiance formed one of the last remaining challenges to complete British hegemony over the Indian subcontinent – a challenge which <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> more than three decades to overcome.|$|E
5|$|Flight leader Lt. Charles C. Taylor had mistakenly {{believed}} that the small islands he passed over were the Florida Keys, so his flight was over the Gulf of Mexico and heading northeast <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> to Florida. It was determined that Taylor had passed over the Bahamas as scheduled, and he did in fact lead his flight to the northeast over the Atlantic. The report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position as indicated by radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching the mainland.|$|E

5|$|The family then {{initiated}} {{a long journey}} in exile that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> first to Mexico, then to Canada, where they went to pick up Arabella (the Árbenzs' oldest daughter), and then to Switzerland via the Netherlands and Paris. They hoped to obtain citizenship in Switzerland based on Árbenz's Swiss heritage. However, the former president {{did not wish to}} renounce his Guatemalan nationality, as he felt that such gesture would have marked the end of his political career. Árbenz and his family were the victims of a CIA-orchestrated and intense defamation campaign that lasted from 1954 to 1960. A close friend of Árbenz, Carlos Manuel Pellecer, {{turned out to be a}} spy working for the CIA.|$|E
5|$|While the {{district}} includes {{all of the}} cities and communities in its jurisdiction, some of these cities do not have stations on the BART system. This has caused tensions among property owners in cities like Livermore who pay BART taxes but must travel outside the city to receive BART service. In areas like Fremont, the majority of commuters do not commute in the direction that BART <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> (many Fremonters commute to San Jose, where there is currently no BART service). This would be alleviated with {{the completion of a}} BART-to-San Jose extension project and the opening of the Berryessa Station in San Jose.|$|E
5|$|Brumfield {{arrived by}} {{helicopter}} {{on the morning}} of 8 November, just as A Company was preparing to depart from its night location at 08:00. With contact now seeming unlikely to the Australians, Healy was instructed to move to a rendezvous from which the battalion would be extracted back to Bien Hoa the following day. A Company subsequently set out on a compass bearing which <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> across the northern edge of the Gang Toi plateau. By 10:30 the Australians moved out in single file but had not gone far before a lone Viet Cong scout was observed shadowing them; he was subsequently shot and killed by the rear section. Crossing a creek line the Australians uncovered a company-sized camp of dugouts and trenches, before being fired upon at 15:40 by a single Viet Cong soldier who then fled. A Company halted briefly, and at this time two Viet Cong approached their position, before being killed by 1 Platoon.|$|E

5|$|By {{the start}} of the Second World War in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries. By 1938 it was {{becoming}} almost impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them.</b> After the 1936–39 Arab revolt, the British were disinclined to accept any more Jews into Palestine for fear it would further destabilise the region. Nationalistic and xenophobic people in other countries pressured their governments not to accept waves of Jewish immigrants, especially poverty-stricken ones. The Madagascar Plan, a proposed mass deportation of European Jews to Madagascar, proved to be impossible to carry out. Starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people. Estimates of the death toll of Romani people in the Porajmos range from 150,000 to 1,500,000.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter was not {{the first}} person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was {{originally}} intended {{to be in charge of}} the bimonthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the TV series kept him from working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> on. Although the comic-book series was intended to expand on the TV series, there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production schedule between the comic and the series. In one instance, the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs. The comic-book series tied into the TV series, the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville-related webpages, with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes' production. The comic-book series ended in January 2005, with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut.|$|E
5|$|During {{his term}} as praetor in the Iberian Peninsula (modern Portugal and Spain), Pompey's {{contemporary}} Julius Caesar defeated two local tribes in battle. After his term as consul in 59 BC, {{he was appointed}} to a five-year term as the proconsular Governor of Cisalpine Gaul (part of current northern Italy), Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (part of the modern Balkans). Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar strove to find reason to invade Gaul (modern France and Belgium), which would give him the dramatic military success he sought. When two local tribes began to migrate on a route that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> near (not into) the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his Gallic Wars, fought between 58 BC and 49 BC.|$|E

5|$|In late 1918, Virginia was {{overhauled}} at the Boston Navy Yard, {{after which}} she was tasked with escorting convoys halfway across the Atlantic, to rendezvous points where other escorts <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> to France. Her first convoya troopship convoy with 12,176 soldiers aboardleft New York on 14 October. She escorted another convoy on 12 November, though Germany signed the Armistice that ended the fighting in Europe the day before. With the war over, Virginia was equipped to transport American soldiers back from France; the modifications included extra bunks and mess facilities. On 17 December, she steamed out of Norfolk on her first of five trips to Brest, France. This trip was made in company with her sister ship , and the two ships arrived in Brest on 30 December. They took on 2,043 soldiers before departing three days later. Her last voyage ended on 4 July 1919 in Boston, {{and in the course}} of the five trips, she carried 6,037 soldiers back to the United States.|$|E
5|$|In recent decades, {{substantial}} numbers of central European birds have taken to wintering in gardens in Great Britain, and, to a lesser extent, Ireland, where the blackcap was formerly just a summer visitor. Although the British climate is sub-optimal, compensatory factors include the ready availability of food, (particularly from bird tables), a shorter migration distance, and the avoidance of the Alps and the Sahara Desert. These wintering birds come from Germany, and isotope analysis (which enables the wintering location to be determined) showed that the German birds wintering in Britain tend to mate only among themselves, and do not usually interbreed with those wintering in the Mediterranean or western Africa. This is because the British migrants arrive back on the breeding grounds earlier than blackcaps wintering around the Mediterranean, and form pairs before the southern birds arrive. Mixed pairings are also selected against because the hybrid young would migrate in an intermediate direction, which <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> into the Bay of Biscay.|$|E
5|$|Irataba (Mohave: eecheeyara tav , {{also known}} as Yara tav, Yarate:va, Arateve; – 1874) was {{a leader of the}} Mohave Nation, known for his role as a {{mediator}} between his people and the United States. He was born near the Colorado River in present-day Arizona. Irataba was a renowned orator {{and one of the first}} Mohave to speak English, a skill he used to develop relations with the United States. Early records mention his large physical size and gentle demeanor. Irataba first encountered European Americans in 1851, when he assisted the Sitgreaves Expedition. In 1854, he met Amiel Whipple, then leading an expedition crossing the Colorado. Several Mohave aided the group, and Irataba agreed to escort them through the territory of the Paiute to the Old Spanish Trail, which <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> to southern California. He later helped and protected other expeditions, earning him a reputation among whites as the most important native leader in the region.|$|E

5|$|Joscelin {{tried to}} take back Edessa {{following}} Zengi's murder, but Nur ad-Din defeated him in November 1146. On 16 February 1147, the French crusaders met at Étampes to discuss their route. The Germans had already decided to travel overland through Hungary, as the sea route was politically impractical because Roger II of Sicily was an enemy of Conrad. Many of the French nobles distrusted the land route, which <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> through the Byzantine Empire, the reputation of which still suffered from the accounts of the First Crusaders. Nevertheless, {{it was decided to}} follow Conrad, and to set out on 15 June. Roger II was offended and refused to participate any longer. In France, Abbot Suger and Count William II of Nevers were elected as regents while the king would be on crusade. In Germany, further preaching was done by Adam of Ebrach, and Otto of Freising also took the cross. The Germans planned to set out at Easter, but did not leave until May.|$|E
5|$|Years later colonial trader Ludovick Grant, {{who lived}} in Great Tellico and briefly {{accompanied}} Cuming during his tour, described the latter's techniques. In each town, Cuming arranged a meeting with local Cherokee leaders. He arrived fully armed at the meeting at the town council house, in defiance of custom. There he made a prepared speech {{saying that he was}} a private citizen wishing only to see their country, and that if any Indians wished to return to England with him, he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them.</b> He asked them to join his party in a toast to the health of King George II, and to kneel in allegiance. He told his guides that he would have set fire to the townhouse and killed the assembled Indians if they refused.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 1914, Ruth {{arrived in}} Boston with Egan and Shore. Ruth later {{told the story}} of how that morning he had met Helen Woodford, who was the girl that would be his first wife. She was a 16-year-old {{waitress}} at Landers Coffee Shop, and Ruth related that she served him when he had breakfast there. Other stories, though, suggested that the meeting occurred on another day, and perhaps under other circumstances. Regardless of when he began to woo his first wife, he won his first game as a pitcher for the Red Sox that afternoon, 4–3, over the Cleveland Naps. His catcher was Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager. Shore was given a start by Carrigan the next day; he won that and his second start and thereafter was pitched regularly. Ruth lost his second start, and was thereafter little used. As a batter in his major-league debut, Ruth went 0-for-2 against left-hander Willie Mitchell, striking out in his first at bat, before being removed for a pinch hitter in the seventh inning. Ruth was not much noticed by the fans, as Bostonians watched the Red Sox's crosstown rivals, the Braves, begin a legendary comeback that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> from last place on the Fourth of July to the 1914 World Series championship.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived back}} in Cairo in late September 1829 where the expedition bought 10,000 francs worth of antiquities, a budget extended {{to them by}} minister Rochefoucauld. Arriving in Alexandria, they were notified that the French boat that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> back was delayed, {{and they had to}} stay here two months until the sixth of December. On their return to Alexandria, the Khedive Muhammad Ali Pasha, offered the two obelisks standing at the entrance of Luxor Temple to France in 1829, but only one was transported to Paris, where it now stands on the Place de la Concorde. Champollion and the Pasha spoke often and on the Pasha's request Champollion wrote an outline of the history of Egypt. Here, Champollion {{had no choice but to}} challenge the short Biblical chronology arguing that Egyptian civilization had its origins at least 6000 years before Islam. The two also spoke about social reforms, Champollion championing education of the lower classes – a point on which the two did not agree.|$|E
