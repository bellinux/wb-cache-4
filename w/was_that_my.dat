500|$|Malone {{credited}} Howarth's versatility {{with the}} reason he was cast as Todd. [...] During a February 1993 interview with Soap Opera Digest (SOD), Howarth stated he was surprised he won the part. [...] "I really don't know how I made it," [...] he said. He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned just like everybody else". He [...] "made it to callbacks, and [...] got the part". Howarth said, [...] "I was hired... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. All I knew <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. They called me in again and suddenly I had a last name 'Manning.' Then I get called to read another day." ...|$|E
500|$|His 1985 film Revolution about a fur trapper {{during the}} American Revolutionary War, was a {{commercial}} and critical failure, which Pacino blamed on a rushed production, {{resulting in a}} four-year hiatus from films. At this time Pacino returned to the stage. He mounted workshop productions of Crystal Clear, National Anthems and other plays; he appeared in Julius Caesar in 1988 in producer Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival. Pacino remarked on his hiatus from film: [...] "I remember back when everything was happening, '74, '75, doing The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui on stage and reading that the reason I'd {{gone back to the}} stage <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> movie career was waning! That's been the kind of ethos, the way in which theater's perceived, unfortunately." [...] Pacino returned to film in 1989's Sea of Love, when he portrayed a detective hunting a serial killer who finds victims through the singles column in a newspaper. The film earned solid reviews.|$|E
500|$|The raid {{did not go}} as planned. Standard {{procedure}} was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women {{to the bathroom to}} verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room {{in the back of the}} bar. Maria Ritter, then known as Steve to her family, recalled, [...] "My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!" [...] Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by [...] "feeling some of them up inappropriately" [...] while frisking them.|$|E

6000|$|... "The trouble <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{friends and}} {{relations}} {{seemed to think}} me dishonest. At least, they believed <b>that</b> <b>my</b> getting into disgrace was quite as bad." ...|$|R

2500|$|In several interviews, Cheung stated {{he had had}} {{a fairly}} unhappy childhood. [...] "I didn't have a happy childhood. Arguments, fights and we didn't live together; I was brought up by my granny." [...] "What I would say most {{affected}} me as a child, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> parents were not at home with me. As a young kid, one could not always understand why his parents weren't at home. This made me depressed sometimes." ...|$|E
2500|$|James D. Watson {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, on April 6, 1928, as the only son of Jean (Mitchell) and James D. Watson, a {{businessman}} descended mostly from colonial English immigrants to America. His mother's father, Lauchlin Mitchell, a tailor, was from Glasgow, Scotland, and her mother, Lizzie Gleason, was the child of Irish parents from Tipperary. Raised Catholic, he later described himself as [...] "an escapee from the Catholic religion." [...] Watson said, [...] "The luckiest {{thing that ever happened}} to me <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> father didn't believe in God." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} with SheWired.com, Michael K {{was asked to}} name {{the reason for the}} blog's success. He said, [...] "I don't know. I never promoted it. I never advertised. That was never my goal. I think it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> friends would read it and they'd send it to their friends. I used to post personal pictures and stuff because I saw it as both a personal blog and a blog about just things that I like. So that's when I decided I wasn't going to make it personal. I was just going to cover this and focus on that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Whethersoever it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> mind miscarrieth, bewraying simple {{language}} in such sort {{that the words}} do seem to come endlong and overthwart--" ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{no reason}} to insinuate what I did. <b>My</b> only excuse <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> nerves must <b>be</b> unstrung--which is no excuse at all.|$|R
2500|$|Mother Candace Chacona {{said she}} was [...] "flabbergasted" [...] by the allegations: [...] "My first thought <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{daughter}} has her computer open almost around the clock in her bedroom. Has she been spied on?" [...] Chuck Barsh, an insurance broker whose son is in high school, called the district's actions a [...] "gross invasion" [...] of student privacy, and supported the lawsuit, saying: [...] "These people were {{able to look at}} our kids in our house". [...] Mike Salmonson, father of an elementary school student, said the matter was [...] "part of … institutional arrogance—a lack of full disclosure and honesty" [...] on the part of district administrators.|$|E
2500|$|At a February 2014 {{listening}} {{session for}} the album, Schoolboy Q {{spoke on the}} album's opening track: [...] "When I first made [...] all I wanted to say <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> grandma showed me my first strap. That's all I wanted {{to put in the}} song. I just thought that was so gangsta. It was kind of weird, too, now that I really think about it. She used to take her bullets out of the gun and leave the clip in her room and let me play with her gun. I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.' Like, 'Your dickies is cut super perfect and they got the right amount of dirt on them. That shit is fly." ...|$|E
6000|$|Therefore it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{thoughts}} {{turned to}} flight, and stepping back a pace to check Hiram Griffin's advance, I whispered hurriedly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{just what}} I said before, ma'am," [...] {{answered}} the man, [...] "which <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> warrant must <b>be</b> obeyed. It is regular, ma'am, regular." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{the more}} I see of {{the fate of}} other women, the more thankful I <b>am</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{vocation}} has taken a formed and developed shape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{excuse for}} not rowing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> cousin rows so well," [...] said Ralph. [...] "She does {{everything}} well. She touches nothing that she doesn't adorn!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The dwarf, too," [...] said Christian--"Was it {{worthy of}} you to delude that poor {{creature}} with flattering visions--lull him asleep with drugs! <b>Was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> doing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{are quite}} wrong, my love, in your guess at my meaning. What I insinuated <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> Georgiana's little heart was growing {{conscious}} of a vacancy.' ...|$|E
60|$|Now, at {{this time}} it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> poor pagan companion, and fast bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh to his endless end.|$|E
5000|$|... "This is {{something}} essential to art: reception is never its goal. What counts for me <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> work provides material to reflect upon. Reflection is an activity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am afraid, papa,' said Lily, 'the truth <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{head has}} <b>been</b> {{so full of}} Woodstock {{for the last few}} days, that I could do nothing.' ...|$|R
60|$|Another {{thing in}} <b>my</b> favour <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> contemporaries steal too openly. Mr. Smith has {{inserted}} in Brambletye House whole pages from Defoe's Fire and Plague of London.|$|R
6000|$|Octavio (turning to Butler). <b>Was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> purpose, Butler, when we [...] parted? [...] O God of Justice! [...] To thee I lift my hand! I am {{not guilty}} [...] Of this foul deed.|$|E
60|$|Plain it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> friend felt uncomfortable; {{he shifted}} {{from one foot}} to another, and a cloud darkened his brow. But his blue eyes burned with a warm light as {{he put his hand on}} my shoulder.|$|E
60|$|When I came {{to myself}} my only regret <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> captor had not beaten out my brains. There {{in the grand}} square of Minsk lay half my troopers dead or wounded, with exultant crowds of Russians {{gathered}} round them.|$|E
60|$|RICHARD. Don't trouble. I'll {{give you}} credit for liking {{me a little}} better than you did. All I say <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> death will not break your heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I. Nor <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> idea of marriage. Tell {{your father}} {{that you wish}} to go with me, and then he will let us have the money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> report, father?" [...] said Mike, {{with a sort}} of sickly interest, much as a dog {{about to}} be washed might evince in his tub.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} been able to understand, Mark, how it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> father, when he gave all these {{instructions}} about me and these jewels and so on, did not at the same time tell uncle where to find them." ...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not know}} to this day how I came to deliver that blow as I did. Perhaps it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> temper was at its highest, and I put all my force into it. I was {{surprised}} at my own power.|$|E
6000|$|... "Something {{more than}} the {{gratitude}} which only says 'Thank you,'" [...] she added. [...] "Before I explain myself, however, I {{want to know what}} you have been doing, and how it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> inquiries failed to trace you after that terrible night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How much <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>my</b> boy?" [...] {{said the}} Major. [...] "Has anybody left you some money? I don't know <b>that</b> you <b>are</b> worth a {{shilling}} in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It {{sounds a}} drastic rule. The trouble <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{relatives}} and friends expect too much of me, and I suspect {{that some of them}} are pulling opposite ways.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't imagine," [...] she declared, [...] "why it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> sex has {{acquired}} the reputation for fidelity. I am sure we crave for experience {{much more than}} men." ...|$|R
