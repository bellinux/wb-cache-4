40|$|Abstract. Most {{measurements}} of ocean surface wave variations {{are made in}} the temporal domain, i. e wave height or slope as a function of time. By contrast, a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is capable of measuring waves in the twodimensional spatial domain at essentially a single instant. As a consequence, SAR imagery affords us a unique opportunity to examine some of the non-linear features of ocean surface waves. In this paper, we use spaceborne SAR imagery from the Shuttle Imaging Radar-B (SIR-B) mission to estimate <b>wave</b> <b>crest</b> <b>length</b> and groupiness. These features may contribute to the likelihood of encountering an especially devastating large wave. After providing a specific procedure for objectively computing these quantities, we find that the crest lengths are longer and groupiness more prevalent that one would expect based on linear wave theory...|$|E

40|$|Search of the Voyager {{images of}} Jupiter reveals {{a class of}} {{mesoscale}} waves occurring near the extrema of the zonal velocity profile between latitudes 30 deg S and 30 deg N. The average horizontal wavelength is 300 km, compared to an atmospheric scale height of 20 km; the standard deviation about the mean is only 20 percent. The alignment of most wave trains is nearly zonal, i. e., <b>wave</b> <b>crests</b> are north-south. A typical wave packet is 20 <b>wave</b> <b>crests</b> in <b>length</b> and 1300 km wide. Modeling shows that the waves propagate in a duct below the ammonia condensation level (the visible clouds). For selection of one dominant mode, the Richardson number in the duct must be of order unity; {{this is the first}} quantitative determination that has ever been made of the stability of Jupiter's atmosphere below its clouds. The duct is topped by a trapping layer, the ammonia clouds, where the Richardson number is less than 0. 25. Meridional trapping of the wave packets is due to the shear in the zonal wind. It is speculated that the period of the waves is diurnal and that they do not propagate poleward of latitudes + or - 30 deg because the Coriolis frequency exceeds the duct Brunt frequency. The waves might be excited by diurnal variations of moist convective activity in the ammonia clouds...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{data from the}} Southern Ocean Waves Experiment (SOWEX) and the Duck, North Carolina experiment (DNC) is used to investigate validity of the Hara-Belcher equilibrium spectrum for wind-waves under open ocean conditions. Wavenumber spectral calculations admit saturation spectra which when scaled by k×u 2 *g reveal that the spectra fall {{within the bounds of}} the Hara-Belcher model. These spectral calculations are also consistent with the Phillips model of the equilibrium spectrum of wind-waves leaving the discrimination between the two models as unclear. ^ As an initial step in the direction of understanding the nonlinear phenomenon of wave breaking, a steep wave statistic ΛT (k) is calculated from surface wave height data. Estimates of the steep wave statistic at different wave slope thresholds from the SOWEX Experiment and DNC experiment show that all seas have approximately the same total <b>length</b> of <b>crests</b> at low <b>wave</b> slope thresholds regardless of wind forcing. The steep wave statistic versus wave slope threshold has a normal distribution with a decay rate that is larger for the low wind cases than the high wind cases. Normalization of ΛT (k) by the cut of the saturation spectrum in the wind direction, namely B(k, 2 ̆ 6 thetas;w), did not successfully collapse the results. Thus the relationship of the wavenumber spectrum to the steep wave statistic is not one to one. <b>Crest</b> <b>length</b> statistics show that <b>waves</b> of small <b>crest</b> <b>length</b> and/or long wavelengths appear more often on the ocean surface while directionality studies show that majority of <b>wave</b> <b>crests</b> are in perpendicular to the wind.

40|$|Breaking waves play an {{important}} role in air-sea interaction : enhancing momentum flux from the atmosphere to the ocean, dissipating wave energy that is then available for turbulent mixing, injecting aerosols and sea spray into the atmosphere, and affecting air-sea gas transfer due to air entrainment. In this thesis observations are presented of the occurrence of breaking waves under conditions of strong winds (10 - 25 ms⁻¹) and fetch-limited seas (0 - 500 km) in the Gulf of Tehuantepec Experiment in 2004. An airborne nadir-looking video camera, along with a global positioning system (GPS) and inertial motion unit (IMU), provided digital videos of the breaking sea surface in an earth frame. In particular, we present observations of Lambda (c) dc, which is the distribution of breaking <b>wave</b> <b>crest</b> <b>lengths</b> per unit sea surface area, binned by breaking velocity increments dc. Methods of analyzing visible images of the sea surface to yield Lambda(c) are studied. The results from previous field observations of Lambda(c) give qualitatively different results : Melville and Matusov (2002) find an exponential form for Lambda(c), while Gemmrich et al. (2008) obtain a function that peaks at intermediate speeds and falls of for high and low speeds, and at higher speeds is up to an order of magnitude higher than Melville and Matusov (2002). Two independent processing techniques for determining Lambda(c) from video images are implemented, and it is shown that the results from both studies can qualitatively be obtained when the assumptions built into the processing of the previous studies are used. The effects of surface currents, long wave orbital velocity, and the relationship between the speed of the foam patch and the underlying intrinsic phase speed are addressed. The appropriateness and limitations of comparison of the first moment of Lambda(c) to the breaking rate are explored. The spectrally resolved Lambda(c) as well as bulk measurements of whitecap coverage and breaking rate are presented for a range of wind speeds and sea states. Observations are compared to Phillips' (1985) model of Lambda(c) in the equilibrium range of the wave spectrum. The observed Lambda(c) distributions are described well by the Rayleigh distribution for slow and intermediate speeds, yet fall above the Rayleigh distribution for the fastest breaking speeds. The dimensionless width of the Lambda(c) distribution increases weakly with dimensionless fetch, while the total length of breaking per unit sea surface area decreases with dimensionless fetch for intermediate to fully-developed seas. The integral and the first two moments of Lambda(c) show a strong correlation with the active whitecap coverage and active breaking rate. The active whitecap coverage falls in the range of previous observations, but with a stronger dependence on wind speed. The breaking rate plotted against the spectral peak steepness is in agreement with previous observations (Banner et al., 2000) ...|$|R

Parental care patterns were studied using radio telemetry. In 1996, I found no sexual differences in parental care behaviours and low attendance rates, suggesting a poor food year.

While this bill shape difference probably evolved through intra-sexual selection, it has ecological consequences because male auklets delivered larger prey items than females.

First, stereo imaging is used remotely measure waves interacting with three distinct ice types: brash, frazil, and pancake. Along-shore spatial frequency distributions show that pancake and frazil ices attenuate higher frequency waves faster than lower frequency waves, causing a decrease in mean frequency. In contrast, wave propagation through brash ice causes a rapid increase in dominant wave frequency, {{believed to be the}} result a non-linear energy transfer to higher frequencies caused by collisions between the brash ice particles. Total wave energy flux was observed to decrease exponentially in both pancake and frazil ice, whereas total energy flux remained constant in the brash ice due to thin layer thickness. Spatial energy flux distributions also reveal that wave reflection occurs at the boundary of each ice layer, with reflection strongest at the pancake/ice-free and frazil/brash interfaces and weakest at the brash/ice-free interface. These high resolution observations demonstrate the spatially variable nature of waves propagating through ice. Second, efficient flexible-baseline stereo imaging is developed to study boat wakes and Langmuir circulation over range of scale (up to 1000 m 2). Given the difficulty associated with obtaining ground control points over a water surface, determining the exterior camera orientation is generally {{the most difficult part of}} field calibration. The innovative calibration technique accomplishes this using a two step process where exterior orientation is first estimated using a total station and then refined using a series of geometric and epipolar constraints. Processing times are also reduced using phase-only correlation and parallel processing. The first experiment explores the wake patterns generated by boats moving at different speeds. Analysis includes maximum <b>wave</b> height, <b>crest</b> <b>length,</b> wake angle, and interaction with ambient waves. Results processed using the new technique measured a water surface displacement time series to within 1. 2 cm mean absolute error when compared with a wire wave gauge which is on the order of the camera resolution.
