This execution method, conceived in 1881 by a Buffalo, New York, dentist named Alfred P. Southwick, was developed throughout the 1880s as a [...] "humane alternative" [...] to hanging, and first used in 1890. This execution method has been used in the United States and, for a period of several decades, in the Philippines (its first use was in 1924, last in 1976).|$|E

2500|$|Execution by {{electrocution}} is {{an execution}} method which the person {{being put to}} death is strapped to a specially built <b>wooden</b> <b>chair</b> and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body. In 1881, Buffalo, New York dentist and inventor Alfred Southwick heard about an intoxicated man dying instantly after touch a live electric generator. Dr. Southwick concluded that electricity {{could be used as}} an alternative to hanging for executions. Southwick's dental work meant he was accustomed to performing procedures on subjects in chairs, and so he designed an [...] "electric chair". It took nine years of development and legislation before the first person was executed via the electric chair, William Kemmler in New York's Auburn Prison on August 6, 1890.|$|E

2500|$|Frequently, what {{is called}} [...] "wood collage art" [...] uses only natural wood - such as driftwood, or parts of found and {{unaltered}} logs, branches, sticks, or bark. This {{raises the question of}} whether such artwork is collage (in the original sense) at all (see Collage and modernism). This is because the early, paper collages were generally made from bits of text or pictures - things originally made by people, and functioning or signifying in some cultural context. The collage brings these still-recognizable [...] "signifiers" [...] (or fragments of signifiers) together, in a kind of semiotic collision. A truncated <b>wooden</b> <b>chair</b> or staircase newel used in a Nevelson work can also be considered a potential element of collage in the same sense: it had some original, culturally determined context. Unaltered, natural wood, such as one might find on a forest floor, arguably has no such context; therefore, the characteristic contextual disruptions associated with the collage idea, as it originated with Braque and Picasso, cannot really take place. (Driftwood is of course sometimes ambiguous: while a piece of driftwood may once have been a piece of worked wood - for example, part of a ship - it may be so weathered by salt and sea that its past functional identity is nearly or completely obscured.) ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the decade, Zbyszko became {{frustrated}} with his inability to shed his label as Bruno Sammartino's protégé. He challenged Sammartino to an exhibition match, claiming this was {{the only way he could}} step out of Sammartino's shadow. Sammartino eventually agreed to the match after Zbyszko threatened to retire if he was not granted the match. The trainer and pupil faced one another in Allentown on January 22, 1980, with Sammartino dominating the early stages of the match. After Sammartino threw him out of the ring, an irate Zbyszko seized a <b>wooden</b> <b>chair</b> and struck Sammartino, leaving him in a pool of blood in the middle of the ring and instantly turning Zbyszko into a reviled heel. So despised was Zbyszko by partisan Sammartino fans in the northeast that his car was repeatedly damaged and taxis in which he was travelling were overturned by fans. Zbyszko was struck with an iron pole following a match with Ivan Putski, and was stabbed in the buttock following a match with Pedro Morales in the Washington Avenue Armory in Albany, New York. After turning against Sammartino, Zbyszko was approached by the WWWF's [...] "Unholy Trio" [...] of managers (Fred Blassie, The Grand Wizard, and [...] "Captain" [...] Lou Albano), but he decided to continue wrestling without a manager. Sammartino and Zbyszko fought one another repeatedly in a lengthy feud that stretched throughout 1980. In the course of the feud, Zbyszko began referring to himself as [...] "The New Living Legend" [...] (a reference to Sammartino, who was often addressed as [...] "The Living Legend"). The feud culminated in a steel cage match at Showdown at Shea at Shea Stadium in Flushing, New York on August 9, 1980 that saw Sammartino defeat Zbyszko in front of an audience of 36,295.|$|E

2500|$|A {{makeshift}} {{gas chamber}} {{was set up}} at the butcher shop of the prison. At least one cat {{was used to test}} the lethal effectiveness of the chamber. Gee was to be strapped onto a chair in the chamber, which was eleven feet long, ten feet wide, and eight feet high. A small window next to the <b>wooden</b> <b>chair</b> allowed witnesses to look inside. Attendees included news reporters, public health officials, and representatives of the U.S. Army. Gee wept as he was placed on the chair until the captain of the guards told him to [...] "Brace up!" [...] At 9:40a.m. on February 8, 1924, the pump sprayed four pounds of hydrocyanic acid into the chamber. The weather was cold and humid. Because an electric heater failed, the chamber was 52 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the ideal 75 degrees, causing some of the acid to form a puddle on the floor. Gee appeared to lose consciousness in about five seconds, with his head continuing to nod up and down for six minutes. He was completely motionless after ten minutes. Some of the witnesses momentarily thought they smelled the odor of almond blossoms, a telltale sign of cyanide, leaking from the chamber. The warden had the witnesses cleared from the area. At about 10 a.m., a vent was opened and a fan was turned on to discharge the poison gas. The prison staff waited for the remaining puddle of hydrocyanic acid to evaporate before cleaning up the chamber. Gee's body was removed from the chamber at 12:20p.m. and taken to the prison hospital. A group of seven doctors pronounced him dead, but did not conduct an autopsy on the body out of concern that some remaining gas could be released. Gee was 29 years old when he died.|$|E
