5|$|Fighting <b>was</b> <b>heavy</b> and the {{two sides}} fought to capture and {{recapture}} P'ohang-dong and An'gang-ni, with the North Koreans seeking {{to break through the}} Kyongju corridor as a way to attack the UN base at Pusan. However, with large amounts of UN air and naval support, the US and South Korean ground forces were able to rout and force back the North Korean troops after two weeks of fighting.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Carey had {{suddenly}} cancelled a concert tour supporting her eleventh studio album, E=MC². There <b>was</b> <b>heavy</b> speculation {{in the media}} that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned the plans for a tour as a result. The singer had later admitted {{that she was pregnant}} during that time period, and had suffered a miscarriage, leading to the cancellation of the tour.|$|E
5|$|In the Cayman Islands, gusts to 51mph (82km/h) {{stirred up}} rough seas with 810ft (2.53m) waves, which caused some light erosion along {{southern}} and western shores. Rainfall {{over the region}} <b>was</b> <b>heavy</b> and widespread, although the greatest quantities fell over Grand Cayman; the Owen Roberts International Airport recorded 9.02in (229mm) over a two-day period. Overall damage to the islands was limited: The blustery rains flooded low-lying areas, caused roof leaks, and knocked out the power in eastern Grand Cayman.|$|E

5000|$|But, for example, {{the first}} {{syllable}} {{of the word}} [...] <b>is</b> <b>heavy</b> ("long by nature") because it contains a diphthong, regardless of the sounds coming after it. Likewise, the first syllable of the second line (the first of the word [...] ) <b>is</b> <b>heavy</b> ("long by nature") because it contains a long vowel, and it will <b>be</b> <b>heavy</b> no matter what sounds come after.|$|R
5|$|One {{alternative}} was the turbo-electric drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which then drove the propellers. This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which {{used it for}} all dreadnoughts from late 1915–1922. The advantages of this method were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages were that the machinery <b>was</b> <b>heavy</b> and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{north of}} Taegu on September 11 {{in the vicinity}} of Hills 660 and 314 <b>was</b> <b>heavy</b> and confused. For a time, the 1st Cavalry Division feared a breakthrough to the blocking position of the 3d Battalion, 7th Cavalry. The rifle companies of the division were now very low in strength. Johnson stated later that any company of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, that had 100 men during this period was his assault company for the day.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line <b>was</b> <b>heavy</b> with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E
40|$|Over the 4 calf crops, highgrade Simmental calves <b>were</b> <b>heavier</b> at birth, 50, 126 and 205 (weaning) days of age (41, 83, 166, 220 kg, respectively) than Belmont Red (33, 72, 141, 191 kg) and Hereford (36, 71, 138, 184 kg) calves. Belmont Red calves <b>were</b> {{significantly}} <b>heavier</b> than Hereford calves at 205 {{days but}} not at other ages, while Hereford calves <b>were</b> <b>heavier</b> than Belmont Red at birth. The advantage to highgrade Simmental calves was greatest during above average seasonal conditions and under these conditions Hereford calves were similar to Belmont Red calves. Conversely, under adverse seasonal conditions Belmont Red calves <b>were</b> <b>heavier</b> than Hereford calves. The 4 -year average May liveweight of highgrade Simmental cows (519 kg) <b>was</b> <b>heavier</b> than Belmont Red (481 kg) which <b>was</b> <b>heavier</b> than Hereford (465 kg). Highgrade Simmental breeders <b>were</b> always <b>heavier</b> than Hereford and Belmont Red. Production of weaner liveweight per breeder was 125, 132 and 155 kg for Hereford, highgrade Simmental and Belmont Red, respectively. These weights represented 27, 25 and 32 kg weaner production respectively per 100 kg breeder liveweight supported...|$|R
50|$|Precipitation <b>is</b> <b>heaviest</b> {{in autumn}} and early winter and lightest in spring. Snowfall {{is quite common}} between the months of December and March, snowing {{for a week or}} two, and it can <b>be</b> <b>heavy</b> once it snows.|$|R

5|$|Between January and March 1916, Townshend {{launched}} several {{attacks in}} an attempt to lift the siege. In sequence, the attacks took place at the Battle of Sheikh Sa'ad, the Battle of the Wadi, the Battle of Hanna, and the Battle of Dujaila Redoubt. These attempts to break through the encirclement did not succeed and the cost <b>was</b> <b>heavy</b> with both sides suffering high casualties. In February food, and hopes were running out for Townshend in Kut-al-Amara. Disease spread rapidly and could not be contained or cured and Townshend surrendered in April 1916. In December 1916, the 3rd and 7th Divisions arrived from the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Cayman Islands {{experienced}} high {{surf and}} heavy rains, though despite a power outage in Grand Cayman, no significant damage was reported. There, 2000people weathered the storm in temporary shelters. The hurricane's outer bands swept over Cuba between August 19 and August 21, bringing heavy rain and high seas, yet sparing the island from damaging winds. Rain from Hurricane Dean flooded several roads throughout Puerto Rico, and there <b>was</b> <b>heavy</b> surf along the island's coast, but no deaths or injuries were reported.|$|E
5|$|General von Toll {{initially}} {{planned to}} order his infantry {{to start the}} assault at 16:00, but Paskevich through his aides ordered him to postpone the attack until 16:45. Eventually around 5:00 von Kreutz's corps advanced towards Forts 21 and 22 in two columns. Russian horse artillery reached a position 200 paces from Fort 22 and started shelling the defenders at close range. Already shaken by the fire of the Grand Battery, the Poles abandoned the fort and retreated before the surprised Russian infantry approached. It was a rare example of artillery capturing a fortified position {{without the help of}} other forces. Meanwhile, the fighting for the nearby Fort 22 <b>was</b> <b>heavy.</b> In the end its garrison fell almost to the last man.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Inez {{struck the}} Dominican Republic near peak intensity. Along the Barahona Peninsula, more than 800homes were destroyed, and {{nationwide}} about 5,000people were left homeless. There <b>was</b> <b>heavy</b> {{damage to the}} country's cotton industry, {{as well as the}} coffee, sugar cane, and cocoa crops along the Barahona Peninsula. In the capital city of Santo Domingo, heavy rains flooded hundreds of homes along the Ozama River, forcing thousands to evacuate. High seas there damaged a portion of a seawall. Many rivers along the Barahona Peninsula were also flooded. Throughout the country, Inez killed about 100people, including 55 in Juancho, and left $12million in damage.|$|E
5|$|In a status-conscious society {{like that}} of the Romans, {{clothing}} and personal adornment gave immediate visual clues about the etiquette of interacting with the wearer. Wearing the correct clothing was supposed to reflect a society in good order. The toga was the distinctive national garment of the Roman male citizen, but it <b>was</b> <b>heavy</b> and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political business and religious rites, and for going to court. The clothing Romans wore ordinarily was dark or colourful, and the most common male attire seen daily throughout the provinces would have been tunics, cloaks, and in some regions trousers. The study of how Romans dressed in daily life is complicated by a lack of direct evidence, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles from the period are rare.|$|E
5|$|In the 85thminute, Scholes clipped {{the ball}} {{over the top of}} the Barcelona {{defensive}} line to Rooney, who chested the ball down for Tevez, only to be given offside. Scholes then found Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch <b>was</b> <b>heavy,</b> allowing Puyol to get back and put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just beyond the reach of Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but he put the ball high over the crossbar.|$|E

5|$|India {{followed}} the NZ tour with {{a trip to}} Australia. India lost the Test series 3–0 and the margin of defeat <b>was</b> <b>heavy</b> {{in each of these}} matches – 285 runs, 180 runs, innings and 141 runs. The highlight of the Test series came in the final Test when V. V. S. Laxman scored 167 at a run a ball in fading light at the Sydney Cricket Ground and came for much praise from the media. India's ODI series performance matched the Test series in failure as India managed to win just one match against Pakistan and Kapil had to come out in defense of his team.|$|E
5|$|It was {{to prove}} this revolutionary {{technology}} that Dreadnought was designed in January 1905, laid down in October 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12-inch guns, had an 11-inch armor belt, {{and was the first}} large ship powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centerline (one forward, two aft) and two on the wings, giving her at her launch twice the broadside of any other warship. She retained a number of 12-pound (3-inch, 76mm) quick-firing guns for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor <b>was</b> <b>heavy</b> enough for her to go head-to-head with any other ship in a gun battle, and conceivably win.|$|E
5|$|Metal armour was {{of limited}} {{use in the}} hot, wet {{tropical}} climate. It <b>was</b> <b>heavy</b> {{and had to be}} constantly cleaned to prevent rusting; in direct sunlight, metal armour became unbearably hot. Conquistadores often went without metal armour, or only donned it immediately prior to battle. They were quick to adopt quilted cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents, and commonly combined this {{with the use of a}} simple metal war hat. Shields were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry; generally this was a circular target shield, convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood. Rings secured it to the arm and hand.|$|E

5|$|Near its {{landfall}} location, Charley destroyed 290 of the 300houses in the village, while over 70,000homes in Havana {{were either}} damaged or destroyed. Numerous hotels reported damage, potentially impacting the important tourism {{industry in the}} country. Agricultural damage <b>was</b> <b>heavy,</b> with the hurricane damaging more than 3,000 agricultural institutions. Citrus officials estimated a loss of 15,000metric tons of grapefruit on the Isle of Youth, while strong winds ruined 66,000metric tons of citrus trees in the Havana area. Charley also destroyed around 57,000acres (230km²) of fruit trees in the Havana area. Approximately 95% of the sugar cane, bean, and banana crops were affected in Cuban territory. In all, Charley was directly responsible for four deaths in Cuba, and was responsible for $923million in property damage, primarily from agricultural losses.|$|E
5|$|Phan {{initially}} rallied {{support from}} his native village and set up his headquarters on Mount Vũ Quang, which overlooked the coastal French fortress at Hà Tĩnh. Phan's organisation became a model for future insurgents. For flexibility, he divided his operational zone into twelve districts. His forces upheld military discipline and wore uniforms. Phan initially used the local scholar-gentry as his military commanders. Their first notable attack targeted two nearby Catholic villages that had collaborated with French forces. Colonial troops arrived a few hours later, quickly overwhelming the rebels and forcing them to retreat to their home village, where the retribution <b>was</b> <b>heavy.</b> Phan managed to escape but his elder brother was captured by the same former viceroy of northern Vietnam who {{had been removed from}} office as a result of Phan's critical report. The disgraced official was now a French collaborator, serving as the governor of Nghệ An Province.|$|E
5|$|Quest left South Georgia on 18 January, heading {{south-east}} {{towards the}} South Sandwich Islands. There {{was a heavy}} swell, such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its gunwales below the waves, filling the waist with water. As they proceeded, Wild wrote that Quest rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, <b>was</b> <b>heavy</b> on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him to change his plan {{at the end of}} January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that brought them {{to the edge of the}} pack ice on 4 February.|$|E
