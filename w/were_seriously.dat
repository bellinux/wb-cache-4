5|$|On 22 October 1987, a fatal {{accident}} occurred {{when one of}} the old HkB 600units suffered a catastrophic failure of its braking system, and rolled down the Holmenkoll Line, finally tipping over at Midtstuen. One person was killed and four <b>were</b> <b>seriously</b> injured, leading to a safety inspection of the old teak cars used on the line; the HkB 600units were withdrawn from service, but were reintroduced after some refits.|$|E

5|$|Scotland {{played a}} major role in the British effort in the First World War. It {{especially}} provided manpower, ships, machinery, fish and money. With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent over half a million men to the war, of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 <b>were</b> <b>seriously</b> wounded. Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was Britain's commander on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Singh, Emmeline Pankhurst and a {{group of}} activists went to the House of Commons on 18 November 1910, hoping for a meeting with the Prime Minister.

5|$|During {{the liberation}} of Normandy, between 13,632 and 19,890 French civilians were killed, and more <b>were</b> <b>seriously</b> wounded. In {{addition}} to those who died during the campaign, 11,000 to 19,000 Normans are estimated to have been killed during pre-invasion bombing. A total of 70,000 French civilians were killed {{throughout the course of}} the war. Land mines and unexploded ordnance continued to inflict casualties upon the Norman population following the end of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In total, 1,650 Whites {{died in the}} Red terror, while around 10,000 Reds {{perished in}} the White terror, which {{eventually}} became political cleansing. The White victims have been recorded exactly, while in particular {{the number of the}} Red troopers executed immediately after the combats remains unclear. Together with the prison camp experiences of the Reds in summer 1918, the executions caused the deepest mental war wounds and scars among the Finns, regardless of their political allegiance. Some of those, who carried out the killings <b>were</b> <b>seriously</b> traumatized, a phenomenon that was later to become well-documented.|$|E
5|$|Lessons for Children is {{a series}} of four age-adapted reading primers written by the {{prominent}} 18th-century British poet and essayist Anna Laetitia Barbauld. Published in 1778 and 1779, the books initiated a revolution in children's literature in the Anglo-American world. For the first time, the needs of the child reader <b>were</b> <b>seriously</b> considered: the typographically simple texts progress in difficulty as the child learns. In perhaps the first demonstration of experiential pedagogy in Anglo-American children's literature, Barbauld's books use a conversational style, which depicts a mother and her son discussing the natural world. Based on the educational theories of John Locke, Barbauld's books emphasise learning through the senses.|$|E

5|$|Many {{cities and}} towns in Normandy were totally devastated by the {{fighting}} and bombings. By {{the end of the}} Battle of Caen there remained only 8,000 liveable quarters for a population of over 60,000. Of the 18 listed churches in Caen, four <b>were</b> <b>seriously</b> damaged and five were destroyed, along with 66 other listed monuments. In the Calvados department (location of the Normandy beachhead), 76,000 citizens were rendered homeless. Of Caen's 210 pre-war Jewish population, only one survived the war.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{people and}} al-Balawi {{were killed by}} the blast. Seven were CIA personnel: five officers, {{including}} the chief of the base, and two contractors. One was a Jordanian intelligence officer and another was the Afghan driver. Six other CIA personnel <b>were</b> <b>seriously</b> wounded in the attack, including the deputy chief of Kabul station. Some of those killed had already approached the bomber to search him, whereas others killed were standing some distance away. At least 13 intelligence officers were within 50 feet of al-Balawi when the bomb went off.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December, Carlson sent Companies C, D, and E east {{towards the}} Tenaru river while Companies A, B, and F headed west towards Mount Austen. Companies C, D, and E reached the lower Tenaru and entered {{friendly}} lines at Lunga Point without incident. Companies A, B, and F, however, encountered a Japanese patrol near {{the summit of}} Mount Austen. In a close-quarters fight in the jungle, 25Japanese were killed and four Marines <b>were</b> <b>seriously</b> wounded, one of whom died later.|$|E

Only seven properties in Clydebank were undamaged, {{in one of}} the worst bombing raids in Britain. The raids, involving 260 Luftwaffe bombers on the first night and 200 on the second, targeted the industry of Clydeside, but the Titan crane was undamaged.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} time of the March 1605 {{conclave}} listed up to twenty-one possible candidates considered by the cardinals, but the only ones that <b>were</b> <b>seriously</b> discussed during the conclave were Cesare Baronius and Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici. That conclave saw Spain veto Cesare Baronius after the first ballot. Medici, the candidate who was finally elected, was also vetoed by the cardinal representing Spain but this occurred after the election of Leo XI, and the cardinals did not view the veto as valid.|$|E

It also damaged the villages of La Aguada and Cardonal de Panilonco.

5|$|About 10:00, Kamimura's gunnery officer erroneously {{informed}} him that Izumo had expended three-quarters of her ammunition and he turned back after a five-minute rapid-fire barrage. He {{did not wish to}} leave the Tsushima Strait unguarded and thought that he could use his remaining ammunition on Rurik. By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho. They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk, but he did not receive the message. Shortly after the Japanese turned back, Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave-to to make repairs. None of the Japanese ships <b>were</b> <b>seriously</b> damaged; despite Izumo receiving over 20 hits, she only suffered 3 men killed and 16 wounded during the battle. She began repairs at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in mid-September.|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships of}} the class entered service {{in time to see}} action during the Third Italian War of Independence against the Austrian Navy in 1866. Persano, now the {{commander}} of the Italian fleet, adopted a cautious strategy and conducted only one major offensive operation, which was directed at the island of Lissa. There, the Austrian fleet under Wilhelm von Tegetthoff attacked the Italians. The four Regina Maria Pias all took part in the ensuing Battle of Lissa. Regina Maria Pia had been set on fire and badly burned in the battle, and minor fires were started by Austrian shells aboard San Martino and Castelfidardo, but neither <b>were</b> <b>seriously</b> damaged. Ancona emerged relatively unscathed, with only minor damage to her iron plates.|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships were}} officially laid down on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until March–April 1913. After a {{progress}} review on 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, the hull of Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent complete, with the others lagging considerably behind. The war caused more delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the ships were competing for scarce resources with other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, {{but it was clear}} that Russian industry {{would not be able to}} complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets <b>were</b> <b>seriously</b> delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E
