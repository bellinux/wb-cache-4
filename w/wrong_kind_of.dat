25|$|Later in 1968, after Deep Diver {{had been}} requisitioned by the United States Navy to help {{search for the}} lost {{submarine}} USS Scorpion, the Bureau of Ships determined that Deep Diver was unsafe for use at great depths or in extremely cold temperatures because of the substitution of the <b>wrong</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> steel, which became brittle in cold water, {{in some parts of}} the sub. Link proceeded to design a new lockout sub with a distinctive acrylic bubble as the forward pilot/observer compartment. In January 1971 the new sub was launched and commissioned to the Smithsonian Institution. It was named the Johnson Sea Link after its donors, Link and his friend John Seward Johnson I. Deep Diver was decommissioned and donated to the Smithsonian Institution. It was placed on display at the Marine Sciences Center in Fort Pierce, Florida.|$|E
25|$|Vysotsky {{suffered}} from alcoholism {{for most of}} his life. Sometime around 1977, he started using amphetamines and other prescription narcotics in an attempt to counteract the debilitating hangovers and eventually to rid himself of alcohol addiction. While these attempts were partially successful, he ended up trading alcoholism for a severe drug dependency that was fast spiralling out of control. He was reduced to begging some of his close friends in the medical profession for supplies of drugs, often using his acting skills to collapse in a medical office and imitate a seizure or some other condition requiring a painkiller injection. On 25 July 1979 (a year to the day before his death) he suffered a cardiac arrest and was clinically dead for several minutes during a concert tour of Soviet Uzbekistan, after injecting himself with a <b>wrong</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> painkiller he had previously obtained from a dentist's office.|$|E

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2011 English riots, many political elites, journalists and public commentators obscured the material, sociological and economic factors which contributed to the unrest and instead connected the riots to a problematic <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> 'wanting' – wanting the <b>wrong</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> things, in a manner and degree that was constructed as illegitimate and vulgar in a time of austerity – and thus constructing the riots as a problem of excessive greed, rampant materialism and social decay.

40|$|In this paper, I offer {{a reading}} of Juvenal’s “Satire VI” {{as an example of}} ancient Roman satirists’ use of inversion, one of many {{techniques}} meant to invite political criticism without attracting the <b>wrong</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> autocratic attention. I claim that Juvenal inverts the paradigmatic father-son[-wife] relationship with a wife-husband-child chain to suggestively critique Roman governmental authority. This examination includes the relationship between the autocracy and aristocracy in ancient Rome, the nuances of the Roman household in relation to patriarchal representation, Roman satire’s social function, aristocratic expectations of satire, and alternative forms of luxurious entertainment. Knowing that their writing would not create immediate change, satirists such as Juvenal convert an aristocratic audience’s stress into humor, and in doing so channel a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> “soft power” that aims to gently influence rather than directly attack. I conclude by restating that shying away from the search for meaning due to offensive metaphor (in this case, misogyny) is an academic mistake because it focuses on textual façade over underlying meaning. In fact, it is as these times of feeling offended that we should be more aggressive in our pursuit of meaning...|$|R
40|$|Marie Corelli’s The Sorrows of Satan (1895) {{presents}} a paradoxical test {{case for the}} practice of academic literary criticism. The best-selling work of fiction of the nineteenth century, the book was demeaned by Victorian critics and has been long ignored by criticism since. In spite of Corelli’s recent mini-revival, the formally self-conscious properties of this work deserve further examination: the text insistently foregrounds the act of literary criticism and demands that the reader’s attention is focussed on not only the content of the narrative but also the nature of the procedure of reading. Such a strategy allows Corelli’s romance to participate safely in the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> literary transgressions enacted in the work of her sincecanonized contemporaries such as Thomas Hardy and Oscar Wilde. The narrative mode warns against the production <b>of</b> the <b>wrong</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> readings of the narrative, inoculating its consumer against the corruption suffered by many of Sorrows’s characters – and by the readers <b>of</b> the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> contemporary fiction Corelli seeks to warn against. As a consequence, The 2 Sorrows of Satan, while exiled from the canon, shows itself to be surprisingly representative of the image of fin-de-siècle literary culture constructed by its afterlife. Like so many 1890 s fictions, it is a work of art about the work of art, and dramatizes such by now familiar late- Victorian tropes as: decadence, moral relativism, debates over literary taste, realism, post-Ibsen drama, the sexual double standard, the marriage market, the New Woman, motherhood, hysteria and female pathologies, degeneration anxiety, mesmerism. The Sorrows of Satan’s status as forgotten best-seller, a ‘great bad book’, asks difficult questions about the relationship between literary criticism and literary pleasure...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} done to a product {{development}} unit of a Finnish elevator technology com-pany and it was focused {{on one of the}} components of the whole elevator, the door sill as-sembly. The study had two goals, the main goal was to introduce and to further develop a test system created for testing door sill assemblies, and the secondary goal was to create a technical documentation about the door sill assembly for training purpose.

Excluding fire in large areas over extended time scales doesn’t work and never will. We need to be courageous about sharing examples from around the world where central governments have bumped up against the limits of their influence in containing fire. In Madagascar, for example, restrictions on burning were legislated nationally to protect timber and other resources in 1907 and 1913, little more than a decade after French colonization of the country (Kull 2002). In the face of a century of heavy sanctions against using fire, local people who depend upon fire for survival have developed a complex system of social resistance in which fire management is clandestine: fires are lit at night and burn unattended. Local communities protect fire practitioners’ identities, resisting government inquiry into who started a particular fire, and burning is done during periods when locals know that the government is unlikely to enforce sanctions (Kull 2002).|$|R
