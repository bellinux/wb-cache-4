25|$|While the spin-off's {{format is}} very similar to that of The Apprentice, it adopts a more gentle tone with the young candidates, in {{contrast}} to the approach given to older candidates on the main show.

500|$|Kenji Doya {{has argued}} that the cerebellum's {{function}} is best understood not in terms of the behaviors it affects, but the neural computations it performs; the cerebellum consists {{of a large number of}} more or less independent modules, all with the same geometrically regular internal structure, and therefore all, it is presumed, performing the same computation. If the input and output connections of a module are with motor areas (as many are), then the module <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> motor behavior; but, if the connections are with areas involved in non-motor cognition, the module will show other types of behavioral correlates. Thus the cerebellum has been implicated in the regulation of many differing functional traits such as affection. emotion and behavior. The cerebellum, Doya proposes, is best understood as predictive action selection based on [...] "internal models" [...] of the environment or a device for supervised learning, in contrast to the basal ganglia, which perform reinforcement learning, and the cerebral cortex, which performs unsupervised learning.|$|E

500|$|The {{two major}} ways {{thunderstorms}} move are via advection {{of the wind}} and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture. Many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the Earth's troposphere, the lowest [...] of the Earth's atmosphere. Weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth's surface than stronger thunderstorms, as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall. Organized, long-lived thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical wind shear vector. If the gust front, or leading edge of the outflow boundary, races ahead of the thunderstorm, its motion will accelerate in tandem. This is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation (HP) than with thunderstorms with low precipitation (LP). When thunderstorms merge, which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other, the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates the future motion of the merged cell. The stronger the mean wind, the less likely other processes <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> storm motion. On weather radar, storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan.|$|E
