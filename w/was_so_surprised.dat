Not knowing whether this was Davis and his group or the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, he approached cautiously. He soon identified the camp as Davis's. At first dawn, Pritchard charged the camp, which <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>surprised</b> and overwhelmed that it offered no resistance and yielded immediately.|$|E
5|$|A late {{invitation}} to join Team Canada's summer camp {{in preparation for}} the 2002 Winter Olympics helped Iginla emerge as a star player. He <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>surprised</b> by the invite he initially thought one of his Calgary Flames teammates was playing a prank on him. He scored two goals in the gold medal game, a 5–2 victory over the United States, as Canada won its first Olympic gold medal in 50years. With this win, Iginla became the first black man to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics. Iginla also represented Canada at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey as an alternate captain, playing on a line with Joe Sakic and Mario Lemieux. Canada won the gold medal.|$|E

On one leg of his trips {{as he was leaving}} Canada, {{on the way back to}} the States, and he traveled through several villages. As the train passed through the town of Belleville, Ontario, a four-year-old Mohawk boy, Jimmy Loft, was sitting on a fence as the train passed. `Abdu'l-Bahá took that moment to stand up and, facing the window, smile and wave. Loft <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>surprised</b> he toppled off the fence. In May 1948 he became one of the first native American Bahá'ís of Canada.|$|E

25|$|As {{leader of}} {{division}} Red 5 of VF-6, Vorse regularly flew CAP {{and had a}} number of memorable sorties during the month of August. In fact the very first day of combat, 7 August, he would launch three times: initially to run SCAP (air patrol for the transport screen) at 0642 hours, then CAP at 1015, and finally an attack flight sent up at around 1320 in which he ran headlong into an enemy bomber formation. Vorse's section was headed for Tulagi at the time and <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>surprised</b> to see the three-plane section of Val dive bombers from 5th Air Attack Force's 2nd Air Group that they almost flew past them. Only Vorse acted quickly enough to chase the Vals into their diving run, snapping at the heels of the trailing plane and ultimately flaming it before it could unleash its payload.|$|E

The American group Boyce Avenue covered [...] "Grenade" [...] and included it in their sixth EP, [...] Acoustic Sessions, Vol. 1, released on December 6, 2010. Gavin Mikhail included {{his version of the}} song and it's instrumental in his album, Grenade. On November 15, 2011, a cover by Trackstarz charted at number 56 on the UK Singles Chart. American rapper Lil Wayne published the first official remix of the song on February 12, 2011. The remix is identical to the song, except for the 16-bar introduction verse that Wayne provides.

2500|$|Tutu {{has been}} more {{supportive}} in recent years of non-celibate gay Christian clergy, praising Gene Robinson and even writing the foreword for his autobiography, In the Eye of the Storm (2008). He said of Robinson: [...] "For someone {{in the eye of}} the storm buffeting our beloved Anglican Communion, Gene Robinson is so serene; he is not a wild-eyed belligerent campaigner. I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>surprised</b> at his generosity toward those who have denigrated him and worse. Gene Robinson is a wonderful human being, and I am proud to belong to the same church as he." [...] He also wrote to the Revd Grayde Parsons praising the Presbyterian Church's decision to allow non-celibate male and female clergy.|$|E

2500|$|One picture bride {{summarizes}} {{the feelings of}} many of the brides subsequent to meeting their husbands, she writes [...] "I came to Hawaii and <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>surprised</b> and very disappointed, because my husband sent his twenty-five-year-old handsome-looking picture...He came to the pier, but I see he's really old, old-looking. He was forty-five years more old than I am. My heart stuck." [...] On average, the grooms were ten to fifteen years older than their brides. The age of their husbands were not the only shock for the women, they were also taken aback by their living conditions. Many women expected to live in houses like ones in the photos the men sent them, but instead found plantation quarters that were crude, isolated, and racially segregated. One of the reasons that the grooms and go-betweens were not altogether truthful with the future brides was because they believed that the women would not come if they knew the reality of the man and his conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Weston {{was born}} in Alpena, Michigan to Frank and Jane Weston [...] He was raised in Sault Ste. Marie, and was a star player on Sault Ste. Marie High School's 1913 state {{championship}} football team. The Sault Ste. Marie “Blue Devils” were a football powerhouse with Weston. In a 1972 interview with his home town newspaper, Weston recalled the 1913 championship team: “We were an awful bunch of roughnecks – there was no football team in the state tougher than we were that year. We blasted all of them and loved doing it.” Weston was asked about a 1913 newspaper report {{that he had been}} tackled by an irate woman during a 24-7 win over Alpena. He recalled the incident:”The game was played there, and the fans hated us. We were too rough to suit them. I was running around the left end toward the Alpena side of the field. There was nobody near me as I ran the end, and all of a sudden, this woman dives from the sideline and drops me for no gain. Well, I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>surprised</b> I couldn’t get up at first.” ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Bianca is in {{a romance}} with {{newcomer}} Lena Kundera. She declares {{her commitment to}} Lena, and Maggie is left feeling rejected. Maggie's next romance is with character Jonathan Lavery, a relationship brought on by her hurt feelings, as well as feeling second best to Bianca's other best friend, Babe Carey (Maggie's cousin once removed). Maggie and Jonathan's romance was new territory for Hendrickson, as her character's sexual activity increased:Because I play a sexually confused character, I have not {{had to do a}} lot of sex scenes (giggles). Maggie lost her virginity to Henry in her dorm room, and it was PC, pretty chaste. Well, not with Jonathan! When we did our first big love scene, I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>surprised</b> about how prudish and shy I became! It's like I became 16 again. I had to drop the blanket that was covering me, and in the middle of my kiss with Jeff Branson, Jonathan], I started cracking up. He was like, 'What did I do, what did I do?' And I was like, 'Nothing! It wasn't you! I'm a 25-year-old professional woman. What is wrong with me?' I couldn't believe myself!' Everyone else does these scenes all the time, they're basically naked and it's no big deal, and I'm like, 'I need everyone to leave the set!' I'm a prude! ...|$|E

2500|$|After a good {{season for}} Kent in County cricket in 1984, Cowdrey was {{selected}} for England's 1984-85 tour of India, led by his friend David Gower, ostensibly taking Ian Botham's place after Botham had opted out of the tour. In the First Test in Bombay he was fielding at short leg when Gower asked him to bowl. Although he forgot {{to take off his}} shin pads he bowled Kapil Dev with his fourth ball, the 19th England bowler to take a wicket in his first over. His father was listening to Test Match Special in his car and <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>surprised</b> that he drove the wrong way down a one-way street. Following the tour, where he had scored 96 runs and taken four wickets Cowdrey was not selected by England until 1988, and the infamous [...] "summer of four captains". In that year Cowdrey, who had taken Kent {{to the top of the}} Championship table, was given the job to lead the Test side in the fourth Test of a five match series against the West Indies. The West Indies by that point were 2-0 up, claiming a convincing innings and 156 run victory in the previous test. [...] "We believe Cowdrey's style of leadership is what is now required", claimed England's chairman of selectors Peter May, who was also Cowdrey's godfather, amid charges of favouritism. England lost heavily by ten wickets, and his chance to prove his detractors wrong in the final Test never came, as he was injured after the one appearance and never chosen to captain or play for England again.|$|E
