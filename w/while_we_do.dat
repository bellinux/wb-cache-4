5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not {{to take into account}} an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant. <b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not have government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group was}} founded December 8, 1987, {{when a couple}} of friends at the University of Virginia joined {{together}} and said, [...] "Hey, let's sing other people's songs without instruments, and wear robes <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] The group's history has taken them all around the world and allowed them to record several studio albums in what they refer to on their album inserts as [...] "Hullabasound".|$|E
2500|$|A {{statement}} from Agudas Chasidi Chabad said: [...] "With regard to some recent statements and declarations by {{individuals and groups}} concerning the matter of Moshiach and the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, of sainted memory, {{let it be known}} that the views expressed in these notices are in no way a reflection of the movement's position. <b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not intend to preclude expressions of individual opinion, they are, in fact, misleading and a grave offense to the dignity and expressed desires of the Rebbe.|$|E

2500|$|Following the Champions Trophy, in October 2009 Wright {{was called}} up to England's Test squad {{for the first time}} for the winter tour of South Africa. His {{inclusion}} was to fill the all-rounder's spot vacated by Andrew Flintoff's retirement after the 2009 Ashes. Geoff Miller, England's chairman of selectors, said [...] "The retirement of Andrew Flintoff has created a vacancy for an all-rounder in the squad and <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not see Luke Wright as a like for like replacement for Andrew, we are excited by the way in which his all-round game continues to develop and believe he can make an impact at Test level". Wright was expected to play in the first Test, however England chose to go with 6 batsmen and chose Ian Bell in a match that ended as a draw.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{must all}} die first," [...] {{answered}} the youth, a generous color mounting to his temples; [...] "Mabel and Arrowhead's wife may {{lie down in}} the canoes, <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> our duty, like men, on our feet." ...|$|E
30|$|<b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not {{directly}} compare our technique with reconstruction techniques applied for complete ACL tears, the outcomes validated {{the results of}} previous studies noting that ACL augmentation could restore nearly normal anterior translation laxity of a partially ACL-deficient knee [7 – 9, 15, 35 – 37].|$|R
5000|$|... "It was a {{beautiful}} little work of Marc's," [...] wrote Norman Lloyd. [...] "In the booth at CBS <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it sat Orson Welles, John Houseman and Kurt Weill.

60|$|We stood amazed, and <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> so, Ki {{turned to}} Merapi and spoke. His face was terrible {{with fear and}} fury, and his eyes shone like lamps. Although he did but whisper, I who was nearest to them heard all that was said, which the others could not do.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You'll {{have time}} to get your wits {{together}} <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> our piece. We are old stagers and calm as clocks,' answered Demi, with a nod towards Alice, ready in her pretty dress and all her properties at hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "We quite {{appreciate}} that," [...] Crawshay admitted. [...] "The captain, I believe, is {{not asking}} you to break it.

"Well, master, if you {{are bent}} upon this enterprise, you will not find me backward; and indeed, I am so sick of this six months of idleness, and of seeing others marching to Wales to fight, <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> nothing here; that, by Saint Bride, were you {{to ask me to}} go into Glendower's stronghold, and pluck him by the beard, I would willingly go with you." ...|$|E
30|$|<b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{not compare}} the {{collective}} story to stories {{written by a}} single person for quality, we note that the final collective story {{was a combination of}} five descriptions from five people, even though several people had submitted multiple descriptions.

40|$|This year we participated at 4 Question Answering tasks at CLEF: the Italian {{monolingual}} (I), Italian-English (I/E), Bulgarian monolingual (B), and Bulgarian-English (B/E) bilingual task. <b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{not change}} the approach in the Italian task (I), we experimented with several new approaches based on linguistic structures and statistics in the B, I/E, and B/E tasks...|$|R
30|$|Neisius and Clayton {{also studied}} high-yield {{investment}} programs [13]. Notably, they estimated {{that a majority}} of HYIP websites used templates licensed from a company called ‘Goldcoders’. <b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> observe some Goldcoder templates in our own datasets, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not find them occurring at the same frequency. Furthermore, our clustering method tended to link HYIP websites more by the rendered text on the page rather than the website file structure.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] Edgar said; [...] "we and you worship the same God. We call him God, {{and you call}} him Allah; {{but it is the}} same. Your Prophet {{acknowledges}} Moses and Christ to be prophets. The only difference between us is that you believe that Mohammed was also a prophet, and the greatest of all, <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not acknowledge that, but in other respects there is no great difference between us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} arrived in that ship which came in today," [...] the latter said, {{as soon as}} they had left the room. [...] "You are in luck indeed to have {{obtained}} a pageship at the grand master's.

Still, good luck may befall us yet, for if the grand master dies, Sir Peter is sure to be chosen to succeed him. Then, you see, we too shall be pages of the grand master." ...|$|E
30|$|Using Goldstein {{diagnostic}} criteria, Typpo [10] {{reported a}} prevalence of MODS at PICU entry of 18.6  %; we noted a prevalence of 37.3  %. This difference might {{be attributable to}} different case-mix: Typpo and colleagues excluded patients younger than 1  month of age, <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not; moreover, they excluded all patients from all hospitals where more than 10  % missing values for MODS variables were missing.|$|R
30|$|Additionally, the {{principles}} and benchmarks were readily adaptable to the interview guide we used in a focus group early in the vetting process. <b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not employ other qualitative methods such as key informant interviews, {{we believe that the}} benchmarks document could also be used to generate questions and probes necessary for such an interview guide were it to be used by others.|$|R
5000|$|Our {{relationship}} with the taqwacore thing has been fairly unsteady. <b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> participate {{in a lot of}} the media surrounding it, we didn't start out as a [...] "taqwacore" [...] band, because the project was already underway before I even had any idea that such a thing existed. We were hesitant to use the term, and reluctantly accepted it later on, only to be disillusioned again. Marwan from Al-Thawra ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well,” said Earle, with {{a glance}} at the vicar, who had come in and heard the news, “it is a little {{difficult}} to make clear. Still, you see, my dear, that men who do not answer to the roll after a battle now and then turn up again. A blunder may {{have been made in the}} confusion, <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not after all know anything very much to the credit of Mr. Appleby. I would suggest that your mother ask lawyer Craythorne to meet him. Men are apt to believe what they wish to now and then.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have long}} since ceased to trouble about the {{economics}} of human society. Ours are not economic but psychological difficulties. There is enough for everyone, and only a fool can be found to deny it. But our methods of getting and making are still ruled by legal and social traditions from the time before we had tapped these new sources of power, before {{there was more than}} enough for everyone, and when a bare supply was only secured by jealous possession and unremitting toil. We have no longer to secure enough by a stern insistence. We have come to a plenty. The problem now is to make that plenty go round, and keep it enough <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Two masks {{began to}} search the {{passengers}} under the combined focus of the bull's-eyes, the shining gun-barrels, and a running but still carefully prepared commentary from the spokesman. [...] "It is to be regretted that business men, instead of intrusting their property to {{the custody of the}} regularly constituted express agent, still continue to secrete it on their persons; a custom that, without enhancing its security, is not only an injustice to the express company, but a great detriment to dispatch. We also wish to point out that <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not as a rule interfere with the possession of articles of ordinary personal use or adornment, such as simple jewelry or watches, we reserve our right to restrict by confiscation the vulgarity and unmanliness of diamonds and enormous fob chains." ...|$|E
5|$|<b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{not always}} {{see eye to}} eye on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the {{existence}} and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.|$|R
30|$|<b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{not produce}} a winning {{logarithmic}} loss score for the Kaggle Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015) [19], {{we were able to}} achieve a top score of 0.047999572 when using a 64 -bit minhashing configuration with Strand. We used several techniques including model ensembling, pruning, and prediction adjustments based on the confidence scores produced by Strand to achieve our best score. These results are discussed in detail in the following sections.|$|R
30|$|We {{randomised}} {{the sequence}} of journals. <b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not grant respondents the opportunity to withhold their assessment {{with regard to their}} familiarity with a journal, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> offer the option “Can’t say” with respect to the quality of each journal. Moreover, before we even asked about participants’ familiarity with specific journals, we asked whether they read English journals at all. Twenty participants replied that they did not read English journals, which reduced the scope of journals presented to them in the survey to the four German journals.|$|R
6000|$|From Glatz, after {{viewing the}} works, {{drilling}} the guard a little, {{not to speak}} of dining, and despatching the Nobilities, his Majesty takes the road again; turns now abruptly westward, across the Hills at their lowest point; into Bohemia, which is close at hand. Lewin, Nachod, these are the Bohemian villages, with their remnant of Czechs; not a prosperous population to look upon: but it is the Kaiser's own Kingdom: [...] "King of Bohemia" [...] one of his Titles ever since Sigismund SUPER-GRAMMATICAM'S time. And here now, at the meeting of the waters (Elbe one of them, a brawling mountain-stream) is Jaromierz, respectable little Town, with an Imperial Officiality in it,--where the Official Gentlemen meet us all in gala, [...] "Thrice welcome to this Kingdom, your Majesty!"--and signify that they are to wait upon us henceforth, <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> the Kaiser's Kingdom of Bohemia that honor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} father. [...] "There is some mystery about the {{floating}} of clouds. I don't fully understand it. Clouds are formed of small globules or little balls of water; and water, I should think, whatever {{the size of}} the little drops might be, would be heavier than air. And yet they seem to float. If they are large, like rain drops, they fall quickly to the ground. If they are small, like mist, they fall slowly. That I should expect. If they are finer still, like vapor or fog, I should think that they would fall still more slowly; but still I should suppose that they would descend. But they do not appear to descend; they seem to float, nearly at rest; though perhaps all the clouds we see, may be slowly descending all the time, <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not perceive it." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{wholesale}} {{robbery and}} murder which was thus related {{by the old}} Norse viking appeared quite a natural and proper state {{of things in the}} eyes of all save two of those assembled in the hall, and the saga was consequently concluded amid resounding applause. It is to be presumed that, never having seen or heard of any other course of life, and having always been taught that such doings were quite in accordance with the laws of the land, the consciences of the Northmen did not trouble them. At all events, <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not for a moment pretend to justify their doings, we think it right to point out that there must necessarily have been a wide difference between their spirits and feelings, and the spirits and feelings of modern pirates, who know that they are deliberately setting at defiance the laws of both God and man.|$|E
30|$|It is also {{important}} to determine the potential that these lands hold for selling carbon credits, which potentially provide a much needed income stream to local pastoralists. <b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not have the appropriate data to address this question, we took the first steps by quantifying how much carbon is stored on a continuously grazed system. More research would be required to determine the impact of grazing on storage and the viability of carbon markets to provide reliable income.|$|R
