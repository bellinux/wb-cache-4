40|$|O objetivo desta pesquisa foi avaliar a corrosão de parafusos auto-rosqueáveis fixados à madeira tratada com soluções preservativas preparadas com creosoto vegetal, em condições de campo. Obteve-se o creosoto vegetal bruto por meio da destilação à temperatura de 110 - 255 ºC do alcatrão vegetal. Uma fração dos destilados foi lavada com solução a 9 % de bicarbonato de sódio, obtendo-se o creosoto vegetal purificado. Ambas as frações foram enriquecidas com 3 % de naftenato de cobre; 3 % de naftenato de zinco; 3 % naftenato de cobalto; 2 % de TBTO; 2 % de tribromofenato de tubutil-estanho; 2 % de pentaclorofenol; ou 0, 4 % de trióxido de arsênico. Foram preparadas 16 soluções, sendo 14 enriquecidas, além do creosoto vegetal bruto e do creosoto vegetal purificado. Estacas confeccionadas com madeira de alburno de Eucalyptus grandis foram tratadas pelo processo de célula- cheia (processo Bethell). Após o tratamento, parafusos auto-rosquéaveis de ferro zincado foram fixados às estacas. O ensaio foi instalado em três localidades da Zona da Mata de Minas Gerais (Viçosa, Ponte Nova e Leopoldina). A corrosividade das soluções de creosoto vegetal foi comparada à causada pelo creosoto mineral. As soluções preparadas com creosoto vegetal purificado foram menos corrosivas que suas similares preparadas com creosoto vegetal bruto, assemelhando-se ao creosoto mineral.

In the present study, the {{significance}} of the compounding of these crude drug powders was examined in castor oil-induced diarrhea model in rats. Oral administration of small <b>wood</b> <b>creosote</b> pill (P 4 Rx 5) exerted anti-diarrheal action for up to 3 hours and intestinal peristaltic motility-suppressive action, which was assessed by charcoal meal test. These suppressive actions were not noted in the groups of the rats receiving <b>wood</b> <b>creosote</b> alone at a dose level (11 mg/kg) that is contained in P 4 Rx 5. From these findings, it was revealed that crude drugs compounded were responsible for the anti-diarrheal and intestinal peristaltic motility-suppressive actions of P 4 Rx 5. Pharmacological actions were examined for variant pills (without one of the crude drug powders), revealing that Citri Unshiu Pericarpium was responsible for retention of the anti-diarrheal effects and the suppression of castor oilinduced intestinal peristaltic motility by P 4 Rx 5.

40|$|Background. Acute {{diarrhea}} (AD) is {{an important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} among both children and adults. An ideal antidiarrheal treatment should be safe, effective, compatible with Oral Rehydration Solution, and inexpensive. Herbal medicines, if effective, should fit these criteria as well or better than standard treatment. ^ Objective. The objective {{of the present study was}} to assess the effectiveness of plant preparations in patients with AD in reports of randomized and non-randomized controlled trials. ^ Aims. The aims of the present study were to identify effective antidiarrheal herbs and to identify potential antidiarrheal herbs for future studies of efficacy through well designed clinical trials in human populations. ^ Methods. Nineteen published studies of herbal management of AD were examined to identify effective plant preparations. Ten plant preparations including Berberine (Berberis aristata), tormentil root (Potentialla tormentilla), baohauhau (from the baobaosan plant), carob (Ceratonia siliqua), pectin (Malus domestica), <b>wood</b> <b>creosote</b> (Creosote bush), guava (Psidium guajava L.), belladonna (Atropa belladonna), white bean (Phaseolis vulgaris), and wheat (Triticum aestivum) were identified. ^ Results. Qualitative data analysis of nineteen clinical trials indicated berberine’s potentially valuable antisecretory effects against diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. Tormentil root showed significant efficacy against rotavirus-induced diarrhea; carob exhibited antidiarrheal properties not only by acting to detoxify and constipate but by providing a rich source of calories; guava and belladonna are antispasmodics and have been shown to relieve the symptoms of AD. Finally, white bean and wheat yielded favorable clinical and dietary outcomes in children with diarrhea. ^ Conclusion. The present study is the first to review the evidence for use of herbal compounds for treatment of AD. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate their efficacy and safety. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in two sites: one at an electricity storage facility belonging to the Swaziland Electricity Board (SEB) and the other at a facility that belongs to its treated pole supplier, the Thonkwane <b>wood</b> <b>creosote</b> treatment plant. The drainage system of these sites leads to surface waters in rivers. This is a cause of concern since creosote contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are listed as priority pollutants by the US Environmental Protection Agency. They have toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects and as a result they pose a threat to human life and the environment. No previous studies have been done on PAHs in Swaziland. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of the SEB storage facility and the creosote treatment plant by investigating the extent of PAHs in surrounding environments (soil, sediments and surface waters). Preliminary studies were undertaken on the storage facility and the creosote treatment plant. No PAHs were detected from the pole storage facility; therefore the creosote wood treatment facility was selected as the ideal site at which to conduct the research. Soil samples were collected from depths 15 cm and 60 cm at points around the creosote plant, including effluent discharge points. The samples were extracted by solid-phase micro extraction (SPME) and analysed by GC/MS. The GC/MS, incorporating a solid phase micro extraction step, provided detection limits ranging from 0. 12 μg/g to 20. 08 μg/g. The pollution patterns in the study site were assessed using cluster analysis and principal component analysis. Most of the 16 US EPA-listed priority pollutants were detected from the creosote wood treatment facility. PAHs such as anthracene, fluorene, naphthalene and fluoranthene were dominant in all the sampling sites. The compounds occurred in very high concentrations (0. 64, 0. 46, 0. 27 and 0. 26 mg/kg respectively). These compounds are found in pure creosote as determined in the sample taken from the Thonkwane creosote tank site. The highest concentration of PAHs was observed in the soil samples taken next to the road site. The concentrations of the identified PAHs were above the acceptable minimal level allowed in soil by the US EPA and Swaziland Environment Authority (SEA). The levels of the PAHs are also above the recommended US EPA limit in soil, which is 0. 1 mg/kg. The results indicated that significant soil pollution was taking place in some of the sampling sites. The top layer (0, 15 cm) contained many PAHs at high levels whilst the 60 cm layer had a lower number of PAHs which were also in low concentrations. This provided an indication that there is no downward movement of PAHs from the surface layer to underground layers. The potential exists for contamination of surface waters when there is runoff from the project area. This is a cause of concern, since both the creosote treatment plant and areas outside the facility are contaminated. Therefore, the site has to be cleaned up, preferably by using a phytoremediation technique. Environmental SciencesM. Sc. (Environmental Science...|$|E

25|$|Even though {{creosote}} is pressurized {{into the}} wood, {{the release of}} the chemical can be seen from many different events. During the lifetime of the marine piling, weathering occurs from tides and water flow which slowly opens the oily outer coating and exposes the smaller internal pores to more water flow. Frequent weathering occurs daily, but more severe weather, such as hurricanes, can cause damage or losening of the wooden pilings. Many pilings are either broken into pieces from debris, or are completely washed away during these storms. When the pilings are washed away, they come to settle {{on the bottom of the}} body of water where they reside, and then they secrete chemicals into the water slowly over a long period of time. This long term secretion is not normally noticed because the piling is submerged beneath the surface hidden from sight. The creosote is mostly insoluble in water, but the lower molecular weight compounds will become soluble the longer the broken wood is exposed to the water. In this case, some of the chemicals now become water-soluble and further leach into the aquatic sediment while the rest of the insoluble chemicals remain together in a tar-like substance. Another source of damage comes from insects such as Shipworms and Limnoria. Though creosote is used as a pesticide preservative, studies have shown that Limnoria is resistant to wood preservative pesticides and can cause small holes in the <b>wood</b> which <b>creosote</b> can then be secreted from.|$|R

The results obtained from the TGA tests found that the decomposition temperature {{of each of the}} preservatives for the heating rate at 5 ℃/min was lower than that at 40 ℃/min. Regardless of different heating rate, the char (wt %) of the CCA- 3 was more than that of the ACQ- 1, and the amount of char for the Creosote was lower than that for either of the water-based preservatives. The IR response of all preservatives in the TGA-IR tests showed that at a heating rate of 5 ℃/min, the absorbance of Creosote and ACQ- 1 was higher than that of CCA- 3. This indicated that the concentration of evolved species of CCA- 3 was less than that of Creosote and ACQ- 1. However, at a heating rate of 40 ℃/min, the absorbance of CCA- 3 and ACQ- 1 was higher than that of Creosote. Considering the decomposition step (thermal time or temperature) at different heating rates in the TGA tests and the IR response from the TGA-IR analysis, the results obtained showed that at the slow-heating regime, the concentrations of CO_ 2 produced by Creosote and ACQ- 1 were higher than that of CCA- 3, but at the fast-heating regime, the concentration of CO_ 2 for ACQ- 1 was higher than that of Creosote and CCA- 3. The EDX analysis of all preservatives showed that the main element of the char for Creosote was C (82. 75 %) after combustion. The char of CCA- 3 had an amount of Cr (34. 99 %) that was obviously more than that of As (11. 89 %) and Cu (16. 69 %) due to Cr being a stable element during combustion. The char of ACQ- 1 left a high amount of inorganic metal elements, such as Cu (50. 14 %). These results, when compared to the chemical ingredients of all preservatives, enabled us to point out the kinds of evolved species for referencing the thermo-decomposition processes of the preservatives.
