5|$|McCarthy's {{hearings}} are often incorrectly conflated with the hearings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). HUAC {{is best known}} for the investigation of Alger Hiss and for its investigation of the Hollywood film industry, which led to the blacklisting of hundreds of actors, writers, and directors. HUAC <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>House</b> committee, and as such had no formal connection with McCarthy, who served in the Senate, although the existence of the House Un-American Activities Committee thrived in part as a result of McCarthy's activities. HUAC was active for 37 years (1938-1975).|$|E
5|$|Ralph {{was the son}} of Seffrid d'Escures and {{his first}} wife Rascendis, and a half brother of Seffrid I, Bishop of Chichester from 1125 to 1145. The surname of de Turbine, by which he is {{sometimes}} known in older scholarship, is only attested in the fourteenth century and possibly resulted from confusion with William de Corbeil, Ralph's successor at Canterbury. Ralph studied at the school at the Abbey of Bec before entering the abbey of St Martin at Séez in 1079. St. Martin <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> founded by the Montgomery and Bellême families, and was still under their lordship. He became abbot of the house in 1091, and his election was attended by Anselm, abbot of Bec.|$|E
5|$|Watts-Russell {{suggested}} {{it would be}} enjoyable for the Breeders record at a studio in Scotland called the Palladium. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> that included a recording studio on the first floor, as well as bedrooms upstairs. The band members sometimes recorded wearing their pajamas, and more than once went to a local pub without changing into regular clothes. The studio was booked for two weeks, but the album itself only took several days to record; during the remaining time, the Breeders recorded a John Peel session, and a television crew filmed a video of the band.|$|E

5|$|The site <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> of {{rest for}} the monks of St Augustine's Abbey, which became Bristol Cathedral. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was granted to Sir George Norton who built an Elizabethan mansion. One of his {{descendants}} gave sanctuary to Charles II during his escape to France in 1651. The original house was demolished and rebuilt in the Regency period by Philip John Miles {{and became the}} seat of the Miles baronets. The mansion housed a collection of over a hundred paintings representing many Old Masters. In 1917 it was sold to Dr Harold Nelson Burden, for use as a hospital for the mentally challenged which continued until the 1980s. The estate now offers office accommodation, conference and meeting rooms, and the house has a licence as a venue for civil wedding services.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Andrianampoinimerina, Nanjakana {{enclosed}} five houses that served as residences for his children. The house called Nanjakana ("place of royalty") was built by Andriambelomasina and renovated by Andrianampoinimerina, who moved it into the compound and lived in it before succeeding to the throne. He renovated it for use by his son, Radama I, who slept here during visits to Ambohimanga after succeeding his father as King of Madagascar. According to oral history, a large stone near the Nanjakana house {{was used as a}} seat by Andriambelomasina and Andrianampoinimerina when reflecting on governance decisions. Andrianampoinimerina added a two-story house called Manambitana ("favored by fate") that was the largest of all the traditional houses at Ambohimanga. The king's children slept on the upper floor during visits to the royal city, while the ground floor housed such royal property as palanquins and storage chests. This house was destroyed in the 1861 fire and was reconstructed under Rasoherina, who used it as a residence. After removing the historic Manandraimanjaka house from the Mahandrihono compound, Andrianampoinimerina built a new house with the same name in the Nanjakana compound. This was likewise destroyed in the 1861 fire, and was later rebuilt by Ranavalona II. Also destroyed in the fire <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> called Fohiloha ("short") that Ranavalona I had relocated from the royal compound in Antananarivo to the Nanjakana compound at Ambohimanga in 1845; Fohiloha was later rebuilt by Rasoherina. Other buildings that Ranavalona I moved from the rova at Antananarivo to the Nanjakana compound at Ambohimanga included Kelisoa ("beautiful little one") and Manantsara.|$|E

That house was demolished in 1932 {{to make way for a}} housing development.|$|E
25|$|Black Ladies Priory <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> of Benedictine nuns, {{located about}} 4km west of Brewood in Staffordshire, on the {{northern}} edge of the hamlet of Kiddemore Green. Founded in the mid-12th century, it was a small, often struggling, house.

Much of this is incorporated in the present Black Ladies, a large, Grade II*-listed, private residence.|$|E
25|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in 1929, {{building}} in the area slowed, but in 1934, as the FHA made credit more available, construction again resumed, and another growth spurt in the neighborhood occurred in the late 1930s and early 1940s. By the 1950s, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> on nearly every lot in the neighborhood. In the later part of the century, as the population in Detroit declined, Rosedale Park has remained a desirable neighborhood due to its high grade housing stock, charming setting and active neighborhood association.|$|E

25|$|The {{proximity}} to Sahand, a {{mountain in the}} south of the city, {{has been a source of}} inspiration for contemporary revolutionaries and poets alike. The power of this inspiring source, however, goes to much earlier times. Tabriz <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> for numerous Iranian writers, poets, and illumination movements. In old times the city notables, supported poets and writers by organizing periodical meetings. Within its long history it was a residence for many well known Iranian writers and poets. The list can start from the old time Rumi, Qatran, Khaqani to recent years Samad Behrangi, Gholam-Hossein Sa'edi, Parvin E'tesami. The prominent Iranian Azeri poet Mohammad-Hossein Shahriar was born in Tabriz. The culture, social values, language and the music is a mixture of what exists in rest of Iran.|$|E
25|$|In 1856 Bishop Hale, an {{independently}} wealthy clergyman, purchased five allotments on St George's Terrace {{in order}} to build a residence for himself and his family. Bishop Hale favoured this location because of the large grounds and natural spring that flowed all year round, and that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> and stables. The land was purchased from Edward Hamersley and Alfred Hillman Senior (Assistant Surveyor General). In 1858, Bishop Hale arranged for the construction of his residence by ticket-of-leave men. In December that year, Bishop Hale and his family travelled to England, not returning until April 1860. Bishop’s House was completed, at Bishop Hale's personal expense, for a cost £2,486, whilst the family was away overseas. The existing house on the site was utilised as a kitchen, and the stables as laundry and kitchen outhouses.|$|E

25|$|Eliezer Schein (whose {{name was}} {{originally}} rendered in Romanian as Lazăr Șain or Shain) {{was born in}} the city of Ploiești to impoverished Jewish-Romanian residents. His father, Moisi, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> painter and amateur artist, who, by the time his son was sixteen, had left to work in the United States. Eliezer studied with private tutors from the age of 5, and was admitted into regular school at the age of 10, when he entered second grade. Moisi Schein died shortly after returning to Romania, leaving Eliezer the sole provider for his mother and six siblings. He was however able to pass his Baccalaureate, with a thesis on writer and theorist Ion Heliade Rădulescu: Ioan Eliad Rădulescu ca grămătic și filolog ("Ioan Eliad Rădulescu as a Grammarian and Philologist").|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, Sutton Coldfield {{continued}} to grow. The {{areas on the}} fringes of the district remained rural up until the end of World War I. As witnessed nationally, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> construction boom in areas such as Boldmere, Walmley, Erdington and Four Oaks. Again, the population increased rapidly. During World War II, Sutton Park and areas of Walmley were used as prisoner-of-war camps, housing German and Italian prisoners. After the war, Sutton witnessed a major redevelopment. The Borough Council commissioned Max Lock and Partners to draw up plans for the redevelopment of the town centre in 1960, with a preliminary report being delivered in May 1961 and a detailed report in 1962. The Parade in the town centre was almost completely demolished {{for the construction of a}} large new shopping centre named Gracechurch. In addition, shopping centres in Wylde Green and Mere Green were constructed causing considerable objection as many local landmarks were lost to the developers.|$|E
25|$|Hans Jonatan {{was born}} a slave on the {{plantation}} at Constitution Hill {{on the island of}} St Croix in the Caribbean, which had become a Danish colony in 1733 when purchased by the Danish West India Company from France. His paternity is uncertain, but Pálsson argues in his biography that his father was a white Dane, Hans Gram, who was the secretary of his owners for three years; his mother was Emilia Regina, a black 'house slave' who is first recorded in 1773 at the St Croix plantation of La Reine, where she was presumably born. In 1788, Emilia had a daughter, Anna Maria, this time by a black man, Andreas, who at the time <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> slave too; but their fates are not recorded. The details of the West African ancestry of Hans's mother are not known, though it may be revealed by ongoing genetic research.|$|E
