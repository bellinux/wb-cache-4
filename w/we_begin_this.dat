He also said the aircraft [...] "will be designed and developed using proven technologies, an approach that should {{make it possible to}} deliver this capability on schedule and in quantity. It is important that <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>this</b> project now to ensure that a new bomber can be ready before the current aging fleet goes out of service. The follow on bomber represents a key component of a joint portfolio of conventional deep-strike capabilities—an area that should be a high priority for future defense investment given the anti-access challenges our military faces." [...] In July 2011, Joint Chief Vice Chairman James Cartwright called for a large UAV instead of a manned aircraft, including for the nuclear mission. Retired Air Force colonel and Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments analyst Mark Gunzinger has called for an optionally manned bomber, stating that purely unmanned bombers would be at a disadvantage without direct human pilot awareness and vulnerable to communication disruption.|$|E

This Article provides one major explanation for this riddle by identifying and demonstrating a phenomenon that we label as “tax cannibalization. ” We argue that flawed state-level tax policies derive in part from perverse incentives inadvertently created by the federal government...|$|R
