5|$|The bridge {{ceiling was}} redesigned, with Michelson taking {{structural}} inspiration from a jet engine fan. Minor built a central bubble for the ceiling {{to give the}} bridge a human touch. Ostensibly, the bubble functioned {{as a piece of}} sophisticated equipment designed to inform the captain of the ship's attitude. Most of the bridge consoles, designed by Lee Cole, remained from the scrapped television series. Cole remained on the motion picture production and was responsible for much of the visual artwork created. To inform actors and series writers, Lee prepared a USS Enterprise Flight Manual as a continuity guide to control functions. It was necessary for all the main cast to be familiar with control sequences at their stations as each panel was activated by touch via heat-sensitive plates. The <b>wattage</b> of the light bulbs beneath the plastic console buttons was reduced from 25watts to 6watts after the generated heat began melting the controls. The seats were covered in girdle material, used because of its stretching capacity and ability to be easily dyed. For the science station, two consoles were rigged for hydraulic operation so that they could be rolled into the walls when not in use, but the system was disconnected when the crew discovered {{it would be easier to}} move them by hand.|$|E

25|$|The use of full cutoff {{fixtures}} {{can allow}} for lower <b>wattage</b> lamps {{to be used}} in the fixtures, producing the same or sometimes a better effect, due to being more carefully controlled. In every lighting system, some sky glow also results from light reflected from the ground. This reflection can be reduced, however, by being careful to use only the lowest <b>wattage</b> necessary for the lamp, and setting spacing between lights appropriately. Assuring luminaire setback is greater than 90° from highly reflective surfaces also diminishes reflectance.|$|E

5000|$|Metal halide lights {{have also}} been used for retrofitting. Virtually all {{fixtures}} that are converted to metal halide have previously been lit with high-pressure sodium (HPS). Examples of retrofitted fixtures for metal halide use include the Thomas & Betts Model 25 and Model 327, as well as full-cutoff versions of GE's M400. MH lamps suffer color shift as they age though this has been improving. Actual life expectancy is about 10,000 to 12,000 hours on average. There {{has also been a}} noted issue with the lamps [...] "exploding/shattering" [...] during a failure. Metal Halide light bulbs also tend to dim and/or flicker {{at the end of their}} life cycles, and on occasion, cycle. Sometimes, they emit a pinkish glow at or near the end of their life cycle which in this case, the bulb just burns out. High cost and low life hours has kept them from becoming popular municipal lighting sources even though they have a much improved CRI around 85. Therefore, the use of metal halide is limited mainly to city and high end street lighting. They are available in clear or coated bulbs. Probe start MH lights (which are less efficient and are also soon to be banned, unlike Mercury Vapor lamps) come in <b>wattages</b> of 50, 70, 100, 175, 250, 400, and 1000 watt sizes, while pulse start MH lights come in sizes of 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 320, 350, 400, 450, 750, and 1,000 watt sizes. The <b>wattages</b> of pulse start metal halide lamps are similar to HPS lamp <b>wattages.</b>|$|R

25|$|VHO {{fluorescent}} lamps run at higher power levels, usually {{about three times}} the standard <b>wattage</b> for a given bulb length.

25|$|Three-way {{light bulbs}} have two {{filaments}} and three conducting contacts in their bases. The filaments {{share a common}} ground, and can be lit separately or together.

25|$|The use of full cutoff {{lighting}} fixtures, {{as much as}} possible, is {{advocated by}} most campaigners for the reduction of light pollution.

25|$|The reflector, {{made out}} of vapourised {{aluminum}} deposited in an extremely thin layer on a metal, glass or plastic substrate, can become dirty, oxidised, or burnt, and lose its specularity.

Reflectors thus degraded, if they cannot be cleaned, must be replaced.|$|E
25|$|Lighting is {{controlled}} by several methods. Photoelectric eyes measure the amount of sun coming into the space and increase or decrease the fluorescent lighting to balance the light levels in the office. Occupancy/motion sensors turn lights on and off in conference spaces and the lights are programmed to turn off automatically at night and on weekends. These strategies reduce the <b>wattage</b> per square foot to 35% below the baseline of one watt per square foot.|$|E

40|$|The {{mid-deck}} lockers of the STS and {{the requirements}} for operating an experiment in this region are described. The design of the surface tension induced convection and the free surface phenomenon experiments use a two locker volume with an experiment unique structure as a housing. A manual mode is developed for the Surface Tension Induced Convection experiment. The fluid is maintained in an accumulator pre-flight. To begin the experiment, a pressurized gas drives the fluid into the experiment container. The fluid is an inert silicone oil and the container material is selected to be comparable. A wound wire heater, located axisymmetrically above the fluid can deliver three <b>wattages</b> to {{a spot on the}} fluid surface. These <b>wattages</b> vary from 1 - 15 watts. Fluid flow is observed through the motion of particles in the fluid. A 5 mw He/Ne laser illuminates the container. Scattered light is recorded by a 35 mm camera. The free surface phenomena experiment consists of a trapezoidal cell which is filled from the bottom. The fluid is photographed at high speed using a 35 mm camera which incorporated the entire cell length in the field of view. The assembly can incorporate four cells in one flight.

25|$|Tests {{have shown}} that {{radiation}} exposure from CFLs is negligible at 150 centimeter distance from the source. At closer distances, comparisons show that CFLs emit less UVA (long wavelength) radiation than incandescent light bulbs. They do, however, emit higher levels of UVB (short wavelength) radiation. UVA can penetrate deep into the skin while sufficient levels of UVB can burn superficial layers. Closed (double-envelope) CFLs are shielded and emit a lower total UV radiation compared to incandescent or halogen bulbs of a similar <b>wattage.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{federal law}} exempts {{low-speed}} electric bicycles from Dept. of Transportation and NHTSA motor vehicle regulations, {{and they are}} regulated under federal law {{in the same manner}} as ordinary bicycles. The Consumer Product Safety Act defines the term low speed electric bicycle as a two- or three-wheeled vehicle with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts (1 horsepower), whose maximum speed on a paved level surface, when powered solely by such a motor while ridden by an operator who weighs 170 pounds, is less than 20mph (15 U.S.C. 2085(b)). At the present time, neither the DOT nor the NHTSA restrict the assembly of e-bikes for use on public roads, although commercially manufactured e-bikes capable of speeds greater than 20mph are considered motor vehicles and thus subject to DOT and NHTSA safety requirements. Consequently, the laws of the individual state and/or local jurisdiction govern the type, motor <b>wattage,</b> and speed capability of e-bikes used on public roadways (see Electric bicycle laws). As long as the bicycle is capable of pedal propulsion, most U.S. states currently do not distinguish between designs that may be self-propelled by the electric motor versus pedal assist designs in which the electric motor assists pedal propulsion by the rider.|$|E
50|$|New street {{lighting}} technologies, such as LED or induction lights, emit a white light that provides {{high levels of}} scotopic lumens allowing street lights with lower <b>wattages</b> and lower photopic lumens to replace existing street lights.

The sale of the most inefficient bulbs was phased out. The first types to go were non-clear (frosted) bulbs, which were taken off the market in September 2009.
