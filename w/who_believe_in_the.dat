5|$|Our quarrel is {{not with}} these men, but with those who give them their chance.

Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study {{as much as in}} any other; and therefore we feel that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.|$|E

This New Life will live by itself eternally, even if there is no one to live it.|$|E

25|$|The social constructionist {{perspective}} (see social constructionism for {{a general}} definition) on adolescent sexuality examines how power, culture, meaning and gender interact to affect the sexualities of adolescents. This perspective is closely tied to feminist and queer theory. Those <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> social constructionist perspective state that the current meanings most people in our society tie to female and male sexuality are actually a social construction to keep heterosexual and privileged people in power.|$|E

25|$|Those <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{inspiration}} of scripture teach {{that it is}} infallible (or inerrant), that is, free from error in the truths it expresses by its character as the word of God. However, the scope of what this encompasses is disputed, as the term includes 'faith and practice' positions, with some denominations holding that the historical or scientific details, which may be irrelevant to matters of faith and Christian practice, may contain errors. Other scholars take stronger views, but for a few verses these positions require more exegetical work, leading to dispute (compare the serious debate over the related issue of perspicuity, attracting biblical and philosophical discussion).|$|E

25|$|Non-constituency Member of Parliament Sylvia Lim {{has stated}} {{that it is the}} Workers' Party's {{position}} that the NMP scheme cannot be improved as it goes against the most fundamental democratic ideals of fair representation and elections. Despite such calls to do away entirely with the NMP system, there are also those <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scheme and have raised points for its improvement. NMP Viswa Sadasivan has expressed the view that the scheme serves a function and purpose in the current socio-political climate, though it should not be viewed as a permanent solution for Singapore. The scheme could evolve into a selection–election hybrid, or the selection process itself could become more transparent with clearer criteria on which candidates and selected NMPs alike could be assessed.|$|E
25|$|A common {{aspect of}} {{recovery}} {{is said to}} be the presence of others <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> person's potential to recover, and who stand by them. While mental health professionals can offer a particular limited kind of relationship and help foster hope, relationships with friends, family and the community are said to often be of wider and longer-term importance. Others who have experienced similar difficulties, who may be on a journey of recovery, can be of particular importance. Those who share the same values and outlooks more generally (not just in the area of mental health) may also be particularly important. It is said that one-way relationships based on being helped can actually be devaluing, and that reciprocal relationships and mutual support networks can be of more value to self-esteem and recovery.|$|E
25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.|$|E

25|$|Appointments {{of judges}} and Judicial Commissioners (JCs) of the Supreme Court {{are made by}} the President, when, in his discretion, he concurs with the Prime Minister's advice on the matter. The Prime Minister thus {{possesses}} the {{primary power of appointment}} of judges of the Supreme Court. Although the Prime Minister must consult the Chief Justice when advising the President to appoint judges and JCs, and the President is empowered to veto judicial appointments, these are relatively small roles played in the final say as to who should be appointed to the judiciary. Thus, it is said that the judiciary may not be an effective check against the abuse of executive power since the executive is likely to appoint judges <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same fundamental policies. This militates against the separation of powers. On the other hand, in a small jurisdiction like Singapore, the executive and judicial roles are inevitably intertwined as there will be very few potential appointees to the Supreme Court who have never been involved with the executive government.|$|E
500|$|Although anti-Catholicism {{had been}} a {{consistent}} platform of the Klan, before leaving the organization, Evans renounced his anti-Catholicism and pronounced a [...] "new era of religious tolerance". In 1939, he said that [...] "in no other time in history has there been more need for all people <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same Father and same Son to stand together." [...] That year, Evans also publicly {{expressed an interest in}} learning aspects of Judaism to better understand the Old Testament. Chester L. Quarles, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Mississippi, argues that Evans repudiated anti-Catholicism owing to his desire to fight unions and communism and his fear of having too many enemies at one time.|$|E

[...] Borah's comment regretting {{that he could not}} have talked to Hitler has been repeatedly cited as evidence of naiveté in those <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> power of pure diplomacy. Conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer has referred to the statement in at least three of his columns, making an analogy to negotiating with China in 1989, with North Korea in 1994 and with Iran in 2006, and it was cited disparagingly in a 2006 speech by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.|$|E

500|$|Many {{philosophers}} consider {{experience to}} be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside, subjectively. [...] But if consciousness is subjective and not visible from the outside, why do {{the vast majority of}} people believe that other people are conscious, but rocks and trees are not? [...] This is called the problem of other minds. [...] It is particularly acute for people <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possibility of philosophical zombies, that is, people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness. Related issues have also been studied extensively by Greg Littmann of the University of Illinois. and Colin Allen a professor at Indiana University regarding the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in androids.|$|E
500|$|A major {{critique}} {{came during}} the 19th century from James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879), who maintained that different rotation between {{the inner and outer}} parts of a ring could not allow condensation of material. Astronomer Sir David Brewster also rejected Laplace, writing in 1876 that [...] "those <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nebular Theory consider it as certain that our Earth derived its solid matter and its atmosphere from a ring thrown from the Solar atmosphere, which afterwards contracted into a solid terraqueous sphere, from which the Moon was thrown off by the same process". He argued that under such view, [...] "the Moon must necessarily have carried off water and air from the watery and aerial parts of the Earth and must have an atmosphere". Brewster claimed that Sir Isaac Newton's religious beliefs had previously considered nebular ideas as tending to atheism, and quoted him as saying that [...] "the growth of new systems out of old ones, without the mediation of a Divine power, seemed to him apparently absurd".|$|E
500|$|Birds {{have been}} seen as spirit {{messengers}} of the gods. In Norse mythology, Hugin and Munin were ravens who whispered news into the ears of the god Odin. In the Etruscan and Roman religions of ancient Italy, priests were involved in augury, interpreting the words of birds while the [...] "auspex" [...] watched their activities to foretell events. In the Inca and Tiwanaku empires of South America, birds are depicted transgressing the boundaries between the earthly and underground spiritual realms. Indigenous peoples of the central Andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds. The mythical chullumpi bird is said to mark the existence of a portal between such worlds, and to transform itself into a llama. Among the Parsees of India and Iran, and among practitioners of Vajrayana Buddhism <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transmigration of souls in Sikkim, Mongolia, Bhutan and Nepal, sky burial has been practised for centuries. In this ritual, corpses are left exposed for griffon vultures to pick clean. The practice is declining, not least because of the loss of most of the vulture population across South Asia to accidental poisoning by the anti-inflammatory veterinary drug diclofenac.|$|E
