Therefore, it is appropriate to describe these techniques in detail as a reference for future workers so that the techniques can be used in future work with little additional effort or so that the results reported from this program can be compared better with future results from other work.

50|$|In the Kraft Process, high {{alkalinity}} {{and temperature}} converts the esters and carboxylic acids in rosin into soluble sodium soaps of lignin, rosin, and fatty acids. The spent cooking <b>liquor</b> is called <b>weak</b> black <b>liquor</b> {{and is about}} 15% dry content. The black liquor is concentrated in a multiple effect evaporator and after the first stage the black liquor is about 20 - 30%. At this stage it is called intermediate liquor. Normally the soaps start to float in the storage tank for the <b>weak</b> or intermediate <b>liquors</b> and are skimmed off and collected. A good soap skimming operation reduces the soap content of the black liquor down to 0.2 - 0.4% w/w of the dry residue. The collected soap is called raw rosin soap or rosinate. The raw rosin soap is then allowed to settle or is centrifuged to release {{as much as possible}} of the entrained black liquor. The soap goes then to the acidulator where it is heated and acidified with sulfuric acid to produce crude tall oil (CTO).|$|R

40|$|The vapour-liquid {{partition}} of various VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) {{in a number}} of industrial black liquors was investigated. The information can be used to determine the distribution of VOC in different condensate and gas streams in a kraft mill. Batchwise evaporation of <b>weak</b> black <b>liquors</b> was performed on a lab scale. The evaporation was carried out at atmospheric pressure up to over 90 % dry solids content. During evaporation, condensate samples were collected and analysed with respect to 15 compounds, total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and pH. The study resulted in concentration profiles of various VOC in the vapour (condensate) during evaporation. An increase in concentrations of total reduced sulphur compounds (TRS), ammonia, methanol and guaiacol at high dry solids content indicated a chemical degradation of the liquor. The condensates with the lowest TOC and COD levels were obtained for a dry solid content of 30 - 40 wt-% regardless of the original dry solids content in the black liquor...|$|R
40|$|In {{the pulp}} and paper industry, the {{evaporation}} of black liquor {{is an important step}} to recover heat and chemicals. Due to a substantial amount of sodium carbonate and sodium sulfate in the black liquor, evaporators typically have to address the scaling of these water-soluble salts at concentrations above approximately 50 % dry solids content. To maintain their operation, the evaporators are cleaned regularly using condensate or <b>weak</b> black <b>liquor.</b> In this paper, a model for evaporator cleaning was developed based on a dissolution model established via experimental measurements. Two new correlations for black liquor were also developed from experimental measurements: the solubility limit of sodium scales in black liquor and the density of black liquor containing additional dissolved salts. The simulations indicate high dissolution rates, meaning that the limiting step for the cleaning is the feed of free water with the wash liquid. The simulation results were insensitive to the distribution of scales, the mass transfer coefficient, and the temperature. However, the results were sensitive to the solubility limit and natural salt content for wash liquors above 30 % dry solids content...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work {{different}} energy reduction schemes (ERSs), {{used to reduce}} the consumption of steam for a multiple effect evaporator (MEE) system, are developed. These ERSs are condensate-, feed- and product- flashing and vapor bleeding. Further, a new scheme is proposed where condensate of vapor chest of an effect is used to preheat the liquor, which is entering into that effect using a counter current heat exchanger. This work also presents a comparative study between existing ERSs and selects the best ERS amongst these based on steam consumption as well as number of units involved. Further, in the present paper a simple graphical approach named “Modified Temperature Path (MTP) ” is developed {{for the analysis of}} different feed flow sequences of a MEE system to screen best possible feed flow sequence. To study the effect of different ERSs on steam consumption and MTP analysis an example of septuple effect flat falling film evaporator (SEFFFE) system, employed for concentrating <b>weak</b> black <b>liquor</b> in an Indian Kraft Paper Mill, is considered.

5000|$|Common {{wood chips}} used in pulp {{production}} are 12 - 25 mm long and 2 - 10 mm thick. The chips normally first enter the presteaming {{where they are}} wetted and preheated with steam. Cavities inside fresh wood chips are partly filled with liquid and partly with air. The steam treatment causes the air to expand and about 25% of the air to be expelled from the chips. The {{next step is to}} saturate the chips with black and white liquor. Air remaining in chips at the beginning of liquor impregnation is trapped within the chips. The impregnation can be done before or after the chips enters the digester and is normally done below [...] The cooking liquors consist of a mixture of white liquor, water in chips, condensed steam and <b>weak</b> black <b>liquor.</b> In the impregnation, cooking liquor penetrates into the capillary structure of the chips and low temperature chemical reactions with the wood begin. A good impregnation is important to get a homogeneous cook and low rejects. About 40-60% of all alkali consumption in the continuous process occurs in the impregnation zone.|$|R
5000|$|Scrubbers which {{utilized}} {{water were}} {{designed in the}} 25 years after {{the foundation of the}} industry. It was discovered that the removal of ammonia from the gas depended upon {{the way in which the}} gas to be purified was contacted by water. This was found to be best performed by the Tower Scrubber. This scrubber consisted of a tall cylindrical vessel, which contained trays or bricks which were supported on grids. The water, or <b>weak</b> gas <b>liquor,</b> trickled over these trays, thereby keeping the exposed surfaces thoroughly wetted. The gas to be purified was run through the tower to be contacted with the liquid. In 1846 George Lowe patented a device with revolving perforated pipes for supplying water or purifying liquor. At a later date, the Rotary Washer Scrubber was introduced by Paddon, who used it at Brighton about 1870. This prototype machine was followed by others of improved construction notably by Kirkham, Hulett, and Chandler, who introduced the well-known Standard Washer Scrubber, Holmes, of Huddersfield, and others. The Tower Scrubber and the Rotary Washer Scrubber made it possible to completely remove ammonia from the gas.|$|R

40|$|A CompactCooking™ G 2 (Valmet) digesting system {{represents}} a challenging process stage to be optimized {{in the context}} of a kraft pulp mill. Its highly non-linear behavior due to liquor recycling and heat integration poses a barrier to traditional trial-and-error optimization conducted by physical lab-scale simulation. Hence, this thesis aims to design a solution based on numerical simulation and mathematical optimization, whose results can be directly applied on industrial-scale as computed optimal set-points for the supervisory control. Based on published, first-principles, pulp digester models, a customized dynamic model was developed in Matlab/Simulink to simulate a complete CompactCooking™ G 2 stage. The process model is founded on Purdue wood reaction kinetics and Härkönen chips bed compaction models, and it seamlessly takes into account process characteristics mentioned above. The non-linear model was validated by comparison against historical data of an industrial unit (200 h), and then employed in the design of a steady-state optimizer for this process stage by means of linear programming. Simulation results showed very good agreement in terms of <b>liquors</b> residual alkali, <b>weak</b> black <b>liquor</b> solids, and blowline kappa, despite high uncertainty on disturbances data and model simplifications. However, simulated kappa showed higher sensitivity to temperature fluctuations than the plant signal, likely indicating the need for more detail when modelling heat transfer phenomena. As to the optimization goal, a base case scenario (plant steady-state) was identified from industrial data to attempt process economics optimization. The results showed a potential for increasing profit or reducing variable costs in at least 2 USD/ADt, which for a modern pulp mill {{represents a}}nnual benefits between 1 – 2 million USD depending on production rate and mill availability. Further, the simulation model showed remarkable results when used in a novel process analysis technique, called here simulated contribution, letting to explain the variability of blowline kappa in terms of multiple-time-scale process dynamics. In conclusion, a model-based optimization method has been successfully designed for the CompactCooking™ G 2 system, and potential economic benefits should encourage industrial testing and further work to develop a real-time optimizer software technology...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work a {{mathematical}} model based on set of nonlinear equations has been developed for synthesis of multiple effect evaporator (MEE) systems. As evaporator house {{is one of the}} most energy intensive units of pulp and paper industries, different configurations are considered in the model to reduce the energy consumption. These are condensate, feed and product flashing, vapor bleeding, steam splitting, etc. Along with these the present model also accounts the complexities of real MEE system such as variable physical properties, boiling point rise. Along with complexities discussed above, the present model also accounts the fouling resistance. For this purpose a linear correlation is developed to predict fouling resistance based on velocity as well as temperature difference. The fouling resistance observed by this correlation is within the limit shown in the literature (Muller-Steinhagen and Branch, 1997). It reduces overall heat transfer coefficient by 11. 5 % on average. For the present study two MEE systems of typical Indian pulp and paper industries are considered. First MEE system selected for modeling and simulation is seven effect evaporator system located in north India which is being operated in a nearby Indian Kraft Paper Mill for concentrating <b>weak</b> black <b>liquor</b> using plate falling film evaporators. This system employs steam splitting in first two effects, feed and product flashing along with primary and secondary condensate flashing to generate auxiliary vapor, which are then used in vapor bodies of appropriate effects to improve overall steam economy of the system. The second system used for present study is located in south India. It is ten effect evaporator system used for concentrating black liquor and being operated in mixed flow sequence. In this system feed and steam splitting as well as vapor bleeding is employed. For seven effect evaporator system total fourteen models are developed. Initially, a simplest model without any variation is derived based on mass and energy balance. Further, it is improved by incorporating different configurations such as variation in physical properties, BPR, steam splitting, feed, product and condensate flashing and vapor bleeding. These models are developed with and without fouling resistance. The governing equations of these models are nonlinear in nature. Further, it is observed that for these models the number of equations as well as the number of variables are equal and hence unique solution exist for all cases. The set of nonlinear algebraic equations are solved using software called ‘system of non linear equations’. However, in the present work to incorporate the complex interactions of variables during solution of model an iterative procedure is used. For seven effect evaporator system total 14 models are proposed to visualize that how individual configuration is affecting the steam economy of the MEE system. The comparison shows that maximum steam economy is observed for the model where flashing as well as vapor bleeding are used. In comparison to the simplest system the improvement in steam economy through best model is found as 27. 3 %. The modified seven effect evaporator system, obtained using best model, requires four shell and tube heat exchangers and five pumps. This modification has total capital investment as Rs 29. 3 lakh. However, saving in steam consumption is found as Rs 21. 8 lakh/year thus, total payback period for the modified seven effect evaporator system is 1. 3 years. For ten effect evaporator system improvement in steam economy is observed by 12. 8 % in comparison to existing system. It incorporates three preheaters which use bled vapor from the system. Based on the comparison with published model as well as industrial data it is found that the present model can be effectively applied to simulate the real MEE system and improve the steam economy of MEE system by 15 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} and recycling of the spent chemicals from the kraft pulping process are economically and environmentally essential {{in an integrated}} kraft pulp and paper mill. The recovery process can be optimised by firing high-solids black liquor in the recovery boiler. Unfortunately, due to a corresponding increase in the liquor viscosity, in many mills, black liquor is fired at reduced solids concentration to avoid possible rheological problems. Online measurement, monitoring {{and control of the}} liquor viscosity are deemed essential for the recovery boiler optimization. However, in most mills, including those in New Zealand, black liquor viscosity is not routinely measured. Four batches of black liquors having solids concentrations ranging between 47 % and 70 % and different residual alkali (RA) contents were obtained from Carter Holt Harvey Pulp and Paper (CHHP&P), Kinleith mill, New Zealand. <b>Weak</b> black <b>liquor</b> samples were obtained by diluting the concentrated samples with deionised water. The viscosities of the samples at solids concentrations ranging from 0 to 70 % were measured using open-cup rotational viscometers at temperatures ranging from 0 to 115 oC and shear rates between 10 and 2000 s- 1. The effect of post-pulping process, liquor heat treatment (LHT) on the liquors’ viscosities was investigated in an autoclave at a temperature >= 180 oC for at least 15 mins. The samples exhibit both Newtonian and non-Newtonian behaviours depending on temperature and solids concentration; the onsets of these behaviours are liquor-dependent. In conformity with the literature data, at high solids concentrations (> 50 %) and low temperatures, they exhibit shear-thinning behaviour with or without thixotropy but the shear-thinning/thixotropic characteristics disappear at high temperatures (>= 80 oC). Generally, when the apparent viscosities of the liquors are 50 %, viscosity decreases with increasing RA content of the liquor. This shows that the RA content of black liquor can be manipulated to control the viscosity of high-solids black liquors. The LHT process had negligible effect on the low-solids liquor viscosity but led to a significant and permanent reduction of the high-solids liquor viscosity by a factor of at least 6. Therefore, the incorporation of a LHT process into an existing kraft recovery process can help to obtain the benefits of high-solids liquor firing without a concern for the attending rheological problems. A variety of the existing and proposed viscosity models using the traditional regression modelling tools and an artificial neural network (ANN) paradigm were obtained under different constraints. Hitherto, the existing models rely on the traditional regression tools and they were mostly applicable to limited ranges of process conditions. On the one hand, composition-dependent models were obtained as a direct function of solids concentration and temperature, or solids concentration, temperature and shear rate; the relationships between these variables and the liquor viscosity are straight forward. The ANN-based models developed in this work were found to be superior to the traditional models in terms of accuracy, generalization capability and their applicability {{to a wide range of}} process conditions. If the parameters of the resulting ANN models can be successfully correlated with the liquor composition, the models would be suitable for online application. Unfortunately, black liquor viscosity depends on its composition in a complex manner; the direct correlation of its model parameters with the liquor composition is not yet a straight forward issue. On the other hand, for the first time in the Australasia, the limitations of the composition-dependent models were addressed using centrifugal pump performance parameters, which are easy to measure online. A variety of centrifugal pump-based models were developed based on the estimated data obtained via the Hydraulic Institute viscosity correction method. This is opposed to the traditional approaches, which depend largely on actual experimental data that could be difficult and expensive to obtain. The resulting age-independent centrifugal pump-based model was implemented online as a black liquor viscosity soft sensor at the number 5 recovery boiler at the CHHP&P, Kinleith mill, New Zealand where its performance was evaluated. The results confirm its ability to effectively account for variations in the liquor composition. Furthermore, it was able to give robust viscosity estimates in the presence of the changing pump’s operating point. Therefore, it is concluded that this study opens a new and an effective way for kraft black liquor viscosity sensor development...|$|R
