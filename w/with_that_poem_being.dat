[...] Unlike many other chronicles of the First Crusade, Albert did not rely on the Gesta Francorum, but used his own independent interviews; he may also have had access to the Chanson d'Antioche, as his work shares textual similarities <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>poem.</b> The first edition of the history was published at Helmstedt in 1584, and a good edition is in the Recueil des historiens des croisades, tome iv (Paris, 1841-1887).

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} my {{object is}} twofold: to examine {{where and how}} Rilke used the motif of the window, and also to discover the meaning this had for him. To this end, I propose to briefly review the chronology of the major window- poems and the broad background to them in Chapter I. This will in itself reveal just how significant the motif is and where it occurs. The following chapters will be given over to detailed analyses of those poems most significant to the second object of my investigation. Therefore, Chapter II will deal entirely with the earliest of these, "Die Fensterrose", Chapter III with the cycle Les Fenêtres, and Chapter IV <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>poem</b> which 'sums up' what Rilke wrote on the window, "LÄNGST, von uns Wohnenden fort,…”. Finally, a conclusion will not only summarize my findings, but also indicate the development to the final vision of the window. es. Definition of the “Intentional Community...|$|R

Rather than dwelling on this loneliness, Shange focusses {{on the theme of}} self-care as a woman and as a poet. It is clear from these <b>poems</b> <b>that</b> <b>being</b> a woman and being a poet in a patriarchal society is not easy, but Shange relies on herself and her creativity for survival. This self-care takes different forms, from talking to herself to writing poetry, but she insists that black women in particular take care of themselves, and claims that this is both a personal and political struggle.|$|R

I work like a Trojan at times. I have done six songs in ten days, but that is rather beyond my average rate. I probably write from twelve to fifteen songs a year, but I do not work constantly. Sometimes for a month I will not touch pen to paper, and then I will {{make up for lost}} time by working almost continuously for the next month. It is hard to say just how I write. I will read a little poem, perhaps, and then the melody comes, and, do you know, that particular melody is always thereafter connected <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>poem.</b> I might put the poem aside and not look at it again for a dozen years, but when I did, that same melody would leap into my mind at once.Vannah preferred the serious love ballad to any other style of song, but she was versatile and has written various melodies. Of her music, more was sold in her day than that of any other woman composer in the US or of any man composer, excepting Reginald De Koven.|$|R
