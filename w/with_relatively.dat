5|$|Abrahams Creek is a {{perennial}} stream <b>with</b> <b>relatively</b> poor water quality. However, {{it is not}} considered to be impaired. Its pH ranges from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline and has a daily sediment load of nearly 14 million pounds (31 million kilograms) per day. The main rock formations in the watershed include the Catskill Formation, the Llewellyn Formation, the Pottsville Group, the Mauch Chunk Formation, and the Pocono Formation. The main soils include the Chenango-Pope-Holly soil, the Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil, the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil, and the Volusia-Mardin-Lordstown soil.|$|E
5|$|All {{but two of}} the {{handcart}} companies {{successfully completed}} the rugged journey, <b>with</b> <b>relatively</b> few problems and only a few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, had serious problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope with deep snow and storms {{for the remainder of the}} journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies in, but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.|$|E

5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, <b>with</b> <b>relatively</b> little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
5|$|Although {{capable of}} {{generating}} a high volume of fire, autocannon {{are limited by}} the amount of ammunition that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed <b>with</b> <b>relatively</b> slow rates of fire, to extend the amount of time they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels—Gatling guns—can have rates of fire of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the GSh-6-30K, which has a rate of fire of over 6,000rounds per minute.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the main}} reasons that experts cite for causing {{negative}} effects from yoga are beginners' competitiveness and instructors' lack of qualification. As the demand for yoga classes grows, many people get certified to become yoga instructors, often <b>with</b> <b>relatively</b> little training. Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries. In turn, a beginning yoga student can overestimate the abilities of their body and strive to do advanced poses before their body is flexible or strong enough to perform them.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Thomas {{suffered}} {{his first}} reversal of fortune: before his departure for Abydos, {{he had sent}} an army under his adoptive son Constantius against the Armeniacs. Constantius was ambushed by strategos Olbianos and killed, although the army was able to withdraw <b>with</b> <b>relatively</b> few casualties. Constantius's severed head was sent to Michael, who dispatched it to Thomas at Abydos. Thomas was undaunted by this relatively minor setback, and crossed over into Europe some time in late October or early November. There, Constantius was soon replaced as co-emperor by another obscure individual, a former monk whom Thomas also adopted and named Anastasius.|$|E
5|$|Before the Suez Canal {{was opened}} in 1869, the Indonesian {{archipelago}} was reached via the Sunda Strait from Africa. From the Suez Canal, {{the route to}} Indonesia is shorter via the Malacca Strait. Due to its natural harbour <b>with</b> <b>relatively</b> deep and well sheltered water, the Dutch East Indies government decided to open Sabang as a quay. In 1883, Sabang quay was opened for ships to dock by the Atjeh Associate. At first, the harbour {{was intended as a}} coal station for the Dutch navy, but later also served merchant vessels and for the transfer of export goods from northern Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of the {{environment}} of European warfare, which generally took place in open fields <b>with</b> <b>relatively</b> easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E

5|$|Despite the polls, Douglas was {{confident}} that the Democratic registration edge would lead her to victory, {{so much so that}} she offered a Roosevelt staffer a job in her senatorial office. On election day, November 7, 1950, Nixon defeated Douglas by 59percent to 41. Of California's 58counties, Douglas won only five, all in Northern California and <b>with</b> <b>relatively</b> small populations; Nixon won every urban area. Although Warren defeated Roosevelt by an even larger margin, Nixon won by the greatest number of votes of any 1950 Senate candidate. Douglas, in her concession speech, declined to congratulate Nixon. Marcantonio was also defeated in his New York district.|$|E
5|$|For a phylum <b>with</b> <b>relatively</b> few species, ctenophores have a {{wide range}} of body plans. Coastal species need to be tough enough to {{withstand}} waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that {{it is very difficult to}} capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E

The Bridgewater is a fissile dark silty shale <b>with</b> <b>relatively</b> rare fossils. A thin concretionary zone lies above, then the Solsville grades from a gray calcareous shale, to sandy siltstones and fine sandstones at the top, with the gray shale of the Pecksport shale and siltsone overlying it.|$|E
