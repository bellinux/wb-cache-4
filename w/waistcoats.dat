25|$|<b>Waistcoats</b> were high-waisted, and {{squared off}} at the bottom, but came in a broad variety of styles. They were often double-breasted, with wide lapels and stand collars. Around 1805 large lapels that {{overlapped}} those of the jacket began {{to fall out of}} fashion, as did the 18th century tradition of wearing the coat unbuttoned, and gradually <b>waistcoats</b> became less visible. Shortly before this time <b>waistcoats</b> were commonly vertically striped but by 1810 plain white <b>waistcoats</b> were increasingly fashionable, as did horizontally striped <b>waistcoats.</b> High-collared <b>waistcoats</b> were fashionable until 1815, then collars were gradually lowered as the shawl collar came into use toward the end of this period.|$|E
25|$|Woolen <b>waistcoats</b> {{were worn}} over the corset {{and under the}} gown for warmth, as were {{petticoats}} quilted with wool batting.|$|E
25|$|Shirts of linen or cotton {{featured}} high upstanding or turnover collars, and neckties grew {{wider and}} were {{tied in a}} bow or looped into a loose knot and fastened with a stickpin. Heavy padded and fitted frock coats (in French redingotes), now usually single-breasted and knee length, were worn for business occasions, over <b>waistcoats</b> or vests with lapels and notched collars. <b>Waistcoats</b> were generally cut straight across the front and had lapels.|$|E

50|$|All male advocates wear a white stiff wing collar with bands (two {{strips of}} linen about 5"/13 cm by 1"/25 mm hanging {{down the front}} of the neck). They also wear either a dark {{double-breasted}} suit (or with <b>waistcoat</b> if single-breasted) or a black coat and <b>waistcoat</b> and black or grey morning dress striped trousers. The black coat and <b>waistcoat</b> can be combined into a single garment, which is simply a <b>waistcoat</b> with sleeves, known as a bar jacket or court <b>waistcoat.</b> Female advocates also wear a dark suit, but often wear bands attached to a collarette rather than a wing collar.|$|R
25|$|By the 1880s the {{majority}} of the working class, even shepherds adopted jackets and <b>waistcoats</b> in fustian and corduroy with corduroy trousers, giving up their smock frocks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Waistcoats</b> (called vests in American English) {{were almost}} always worn with suits {{prior to the}} 1940s. Due to {{rationing}} during World War II, their prevalence declined, but their popularity has gone {{in and out of}} fashion from the 1970s onwards. A pocket watch on a chain, one end of which is inserted through a middle buttonhole, is often worn with a waistcoat; otherwise, since World War I when they came to prominence of military necessity, men have worn wristwatches, which may be worn with any suit except the full evening dress (white tie). Although many examples of <b>waistcoats</b> worn with a double-breasted jacket can be found from the 1920s to the 1940s, that would be unusual today (one point of a double-breasted jacket being, it may be supposed, to eliminate the waistcoat). Traditionally, the bottom button of a waistcoat is left undone; like the vents in the rear of a jacket, this helps the body bend when sitting. Some <b>waistcoats</b> can have lapels, others do not.|$|E

25|$|In modern usage, a short kurta is {{referred}} to as the kurti. However, traditionally, the kurti refers to <b>waistcoats,</b> jackets and blouses which sit above the waist without side slits, and are believed to have descended from the tunic of the Shunga period (2nd century B.C.). Kurtis are typically much shorter than the traditional garments and made with lighter materials, like those used in sewing kameez.|$|E

25|$|Panniers or side-hoops {{remained}} an essential of court fashion but disappeared everywhere else {{in favor of}} a few petticoats. Free-hanging pockets were tied around the waist and were accessed through pocket slits in the side-seams of the gown or petticoat. Woolen or quilted <b>waistcoats</b> were worn over the stays or corset and under the gown for warmth, as were petticoats quilted with wool batting, especially in the cold climates of Northern Europe and America.|$|E
25|$|Working-class {{people in}} 18th century England and the United States often {{wore the same}} {{garments}} as fashionable people: shirts, <b>waistcoats,</b> coats and breeches for men, and shifts, petticoats, and dresses or jackets for women. However, they owned fewer clothes, which were made of cheaper and sturdier fabrics. Working-class men also wore short jackets, and some (especially sailors) wore trousers rather than breeches. Smock-frocks were a regional style for men, especially shepherds. Country women wore short hooded cloaks, most often red. Both sexes wore handkerchiefs or neckerchiefs.|$|E

The team adhere to what is largely believed to be the original dress of clogs, blue <b>waistcoats</b> and trousers with ribbons down the side. The final tradition, that of blackened faces, is only adopted during the New Year performances.|$|E
25|$|Blue {{gradually}} {{returned to}} court fashion in the 17th century, {{as part of}} a palette of peacock-bright colours shown off in extremely elaborate costumes. The modern blue business suit has its roots in England {{in the middle of the}} 17th century. Following the London plague of 1665 and the London fire of 1666, King Charles II of England ordered that his courtiers wear simple coats, <b>waistcoats</b> and breeches, and the palette of colours became blue, grey, white and buff. Widely imitated, this style of men's fashion became almost a uniform of the London merchant class and the English country gentleman.|$|E
25|$|Ladakh {{is famous}} for its unique Indo-Tibetan culture. Chanting in Sanskrit and Tibetan {{language}} forms an integral part of Ladakh's Buddhist lifestyle. Annual masked dance festivals, weaving and archery {{are an important part of}} traditional life in Ladakh. Ladakhi food has much in common with Tibetan food, the most prominent foods being thukpa, noodle soup; and tsampa, known in Ladakhi as Ngampe, roasted barley flour. Typical garb includes gonchas of velvet, elaborately embroidered <b>waistcoats</b> and boots, and gonads or hats. People adorned with gold and silver ornaments and turquoise headgears throng the streets during Ladakhi festivals.|$|E

25|$|In mid-June 1816, all {{nighttime}} processions {{were banned}} except that of Corpus Christi. In 1819, the Bishop was persuaded to transfer {{authority to the}} vicar-general, while in 1820 friars were secularised. On August 4, 1820, all clergy were forced to swear allegiance to the state, and their clerical immunities were withdrawn. The four monasteries in the country were nationalised in 1824, with one later demolished and another becoming a parish church. The remaining two became an artillery park and barracks, while three convents also became barracks. He abolished the Inquisition, re-purposed confessional boxes as sentry posts, and had the hangings made into lancers' red <b>waistcoats.</b>|$|E
25|$|No {{standard}} issue uniforms {{for anyone}} {{on board a}} vessel were issued prior to 1748 in the British royal Navy. Clothing was somewhat standardized by 1623 when it was made possible for sailors to purchase clothing at fixed prices from the Navy Commissioners. The selection was not extensive; items included: Monmouth capps, Red Caps, Yarne Stockings, Irish Stockings, Blew Shirts, White Shirts, Cotton <b>Waistcoats,</b> Cotton Drawers, Neats Leather Shoes, Blew Neck Clothes, Canvas Suites, Ruggs of one breadth, and Blew Suites. Until 1664, sailors that were pressed into the Navy were not given any clothing, forced to use what clothes they had on their backs until accumulating several months of pay when they could then buy clothing.|$|E
