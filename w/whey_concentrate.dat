40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrates</b> on {{physical}} and rheological properties of yogurt were studied. Five commercial <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrates</b> (340 g kg− 1 protein nominal) {{were used to}} fortify milk to 45 g protein kg− 1. Fermentation was performed with two different starters (ropy and non-ropy). Resulting yogurts were compared with a control yogurt enriched with skim milk powder. The water-holding capacity of the yogurt fortified with skim milk powder was 500 g kg− 1 and ranged from 600 to 638 g kg− 1 when fortified with <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrates.</b> Significant rheological differences have been noticed between the yogurts fortified with different <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrates,</b> independent of the starter used.

Permeate flux declined {{more rapidly}} for milk microfil-trate during concentration, but similar flux profiles were observed on both wheys during diafiltration. Protein contents in concentrates from milk microfiltrate and cheese wheys were respectively 95 and 74 % on a dry matter basis, while their fat contents were respectively 0. 2 and 15 %. Protein solubility of the milk microfiltrate isolate was over 95 % between pH 3 and 8, while protein solubility of cheese <b>whey</b> <b>concentrate</b> varied between 75 and 90 % {{over the same}} pH range. J 3 -Lactoglobulin in cheese <b>whey</b> <b>concentrate</b> showed ex 1 ensive structural alteration {{as evidenced by the}} low proportion of SH groups in native position. J 3 -Lactoglobulin structural alteration was less severe in protein isolated from milk microfiltrate, but still significant. Milk microfiltrate protein isolate showed better gelling properties than cheese whey protein concentrate. Cheese whey protein concentrate did not foam at ail, while stiff and stable foams were produced from milk microfiltrate protein isolate. Gelation and foaming were very sensitive to the ionic environment and were controlled by a balance between the pH and the calcium concentration. Reduction of calcium content in milk microfiltrate protein isolate, using saline solution during diafiltration, had only slight effects of protein functional properties...|$|E
30|$|The dairy {{industry}} has {{a considerable amount}} of by-products such as buttermilk, whey, and their derivatives. Whey is a liquid by-product of cheese production, rich in lactose (75 % of dry matter) and containing other organic water-soluble components (12 - 14 % protein). Whey has a high BOD value and its disposal can be problematic especially for countries depending on dairy economy. Only 50 % of the cheese whey produced annually is recycled into useful products such as food ingredients and animal feed and the rest is regarded as a waste. (Daniel et al. 1998 a) reported the high yields of sophorolipids production with <b>whey</b> <b>concentrate</b> and rapeseed oil as substrate. However in this study the organisms did not utilize lactose. In another study (Daniel et al. 1998 b) demonstrated the production of high concentrations of sophorolipids (about 422 g/l) in a two stage cultivation process. In the first stage, deproteinized <b>whey</b> <b>concentrate</b> rich in lactose was used for the cultivation of Cryptococcus curvatus ATCC 20509. In the second stage, biomass obtained from first stage was homogenized under high pressure and autoclaved to generate a crude cell extract consisting of single cell oil which was used as substrate for growth of C. bombicola ATCC 22214 for sophorolipid production. (Daverey and Pakshirajan 2010 b) also reported the production of sophorolipids by the yeast Candida bombicola on medium containing mixed hydrophilic substrate (deproteinized whey and glucose), yeast extract and oleic acid. They could achieve a yield up to 34 g/l under experimental conditions in optimized medium formulation.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of spray}} drying for {{dehydration}} of acid whey is generally {{limited by the}} appearance of uncontrolled thickening and solidifying of the whey mass during the lactose crystallization step.

To understand this phenomenon, we simulated the thickening of concentrated acid whey on a laboratory scale by measuring the flow resistance changes as a function of time and whey composition. The thickening process was characterized by an amplitude of torque and a lag time (induction time). Thickening of lactic acid <b>whey</b> <b>concentrate</b> occurred regardless of the presence of whey proteins or lactose crystals.

40|$|Gelatinisation and {{retrogradation}} of starch-whey mixtures {{were studied}} in water (pH 7) using the Rapid Visco-Analyser (RVA). The starch:whey ratios ranged from 0 : 100 - 100 : 0. Wheat starch, and <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrate</b> (about 80 % solids basis) and isolate (about 96 % solids basis) were used. Mixtures with whey isolates were generally more viscous {{than those with}} <b>whey</b> <b>concentrates,</b> and this was attributed to fewer non-protein milk components in the former. <b>Whey</b> protein <b>concentrates</b> and isolates reduced the peak, trough and final viscosities of the mixtures, but the breakdown and setback ratios of the mixtures were increased. The gelatinisation temperature increased with whey substitutions indicating that whey protein delayed starch gelatinisation. The temperature of fastest viscosity development decreased {{as the amount of}} whey was increased. Whey protein isolate generally exercised a lesser effect than the concentrate. At between 40 - 50 % whey substitutions, the dominant phase changed from starch to protein irrespective of the source of the whey protein. An additive law poorly defined selected RVA parameters. Both macromolecules interacted to define the viscosity of the mixture, and an exponential model predicted the viscosity better than the additive law. The results obtained in this study are discussed to assist the understanding of extrusion processing of starch-whey systems as models for whey-fortified snack and ready-to-eat foods.

40|$|Whey is a {{by-product}} of cheese manufacture, containing a mixture of proteins of commercial value, each having unique attributes for nutritional, biological and food ingredient applications. A tremendous amount of whey, normally treated as a waste product, is produced worldwide each year. This work describes the cation-exchange adsorption {{of the two major}} whey proteins, alpha-lactalbumin (ALA) and beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) with the purpose of optimising a process for isolating them from whey. Adsorption of pure BLG and ALA was studied onto SP Sepharose FF using 0. 1 M acetate buffer. Batch experiments were carried out at various pH values for ALA and BLG, and the relevant Langmuir isotherm parameters, dissociation constant, Kd, and maximum binding capacity, qm, were determined. The optimum pH for separation was chosen to be pH 3. 7. At pH 3. 7, both Kd and qm pertaining to ALA were found to have higher numerical values than those of BLG, implying different characteristics of adsorption of the two proteins on this adsorbent. The Kd for the former protein was almost four times larger than the latter, while qm was 1. 3 times higher. Packed-bed column adsorption was performed using a 1 -ml column at pH 3. 7, flow rate 1 ml/min and initial concentration of 3 mg/ml for BLG and 1. 5 mg/ml for ALA both in 0. 1 M sodium acetate buffer. The t 1 / 2 for the resulting ALA breakthrough was 75 % longer than its BLG counterpart. The above results suggest the possibility of the occurrence of competitive adsorption between the proteins when adsorbed simultaneously. In traditional batch uptake experiments, the kinetic rate constants of ALA and BLG in both the single- and two-component systems were determined using the simple kinetic model. The values so obtained implied that BLG was adsorbed faster than ALA. In the confocal laser scanning microscopy experiments, the different behaviour of ALA and BLG in the single-component system with regard to their penetration within the adsorbent beads suggested that the two proteins have different transport mechanisms governing their adsorption. The two-component system results showed that ALA was able to displace BLG in spite of the lower affinity of the former protein to the adsorbent. The packed-bed adsorption and elution of a mixture of ALA and BLG were then investigated under the above conditions but using a 5 -ml column. BLG breakthrough occurred first, and its concentration in the outlet exceeded its feed value by 1. 6 fold before declining to the feed value, followed by the breakthrough of ALA. ALA displaced and eluted all the BLG from the column in a pure form. Pure ALA could then be eluted with good recovery. The single- and two-component breakthrough curves for ALA and BLG were simulated by the simple kinetic model using the isotherm parameters, but the overshoot phenomenon could only be predicted after correcting these parameters. The evidence of the competitive nature of adsorption observed in binary mixtures was used to develop a facile separation procedure for the two proteins from aqueous solutions of <b>whey</b> <b>concentrate</b> powders. A novel consecutive two-stage separation process was developed to separate ALA and BLG from <b>whey</b> <b>concentrate</b> mixtures. Almost all the BLG in the feed was recovered, with 78 % being recovered at 95 % purity and a further 20 % at 86 % purity. In addition, 67 % of ALA was recovered, 48 % at 54 % purity and 19 % at 60 % purity. The correction factors employed for the pure binary mixture were used to simulate the breakthrough curves of the two proteins in experiments conducted with <b>whey</b> <b>concentrate</b> in each of the two stages of the novel separation process, and there was agreement between the experimental and theoretical results.

Of great interest was the observation that all beneficial effects of cysteine supplementation were duplicated by the consumption of a cysteine-rich protein.

The effect of colostrum on the activity of the complement system in neonatal calves was also studied. It was possible to increase substantially complement and opsonization activities of serum by feeding colostral <b>whey</b> <b>concentrate</b> to neonatal calves. A colostral immune preparation (IP) containing specific antibodies against Helicobacter felis prevented but did not eradicate an experimental Helicobacter felis infection in mice. However, the IP combined with amoxicillin lowered the level of inflammation and colonization more than amoxicillin alone. The specific anti-cariogenic antibodies of IP remained active and functional when added to UHT milk or fermented with LGG and stored for an extended time. Further, the combination of IP and LGG prevented the adherence of Streptococcus mutans effectively. Lactobacillus plantarum MLBPL 1 isolated from sauerkraut showed anti-Helicobacter activity mainly associated with cell wall, from where it can be extracted into the culture supernatant. Colostral preparations, and acidifying microbes (L. plantarum MLBPL 1 and LGG) reduced the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori on human gastric adenocarcinoma cells. They also reduced the IL- 8 production of the infected cells. IL- 8 secretion is a primary response to Helicobacter pylori infection.
