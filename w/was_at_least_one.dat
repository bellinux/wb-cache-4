5|$|The {{dogs have}} blue, liver or sandy colouration, {{all three of}} which may have tan points. Bedlingtons carry {{what is known as}} the greying gene, a {{dominant}} trait carried on the G locus. This gene causes puppies born with black or dark brown fur to lighten to grey or liver with age. The fur of the Bedlington creates a shape on the top of the dog's head known as a topknot. Although most modern breed standards call for the dog's topknot to be lighter than its body, when the breed was first being formed there <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> prominent breeder, Mr. Pickett, who believed that the topknot should be darker, not lighter.|$|E
5|$|An Itanium-based {{computer}} {{first appeared}} {{on the list of}} the TOP500 supercomputers in November 2001. The best position ever achieved by an Itanium2 based system in the list was #2 (while now all systems have dropped off the list), achieved in June 2004, when Thunder (LLNL) entered the list with an Rmax of 19.94 Teraflops. In November 2004, Columbia entered the list at #2 with 51.8 Teraflops, and there <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> Itanium-based computer in the top 10 from then until June 2007. The peak number of Itanium-based machines on the list occurred in the November 2004 list, at 84 systems (16.8%); by June 2012, this had dropped to one system (0.2%), and no Itanium system remained on the list in November 2012.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only were}} the {{advisers}} in danger from the enemy, {{but also from the}} men they commanded or advised. On 20 July 1919, like a number of other advisers subsequently, Brown was murdered by his men when they mutinied and went over to the Bolsheviks. While Brown was the only Australian to be killed, there <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> other major mutiny among the White forces during this period, and several other Australians had narrow escapes. With these incidents becoming increasingly common, and with the ineffectiveness of such a small force in influencing the outcome of the civil war, in March 1919 {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the force. As all faith had been lost in the reliability of locally raised units, this could only be safely completed with the provision of a covering force, and until this could be raised the NREF was condemned to endure the harsh Russian winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{layout of}} Ambohimanga's three {{compounds}} and the structures within them followed a traditional design {{established by the}} earliest Merina highland settlers by the 15th century. According to custom, a rova could only be established by an andriana (noble). Its foundation was built to raise the rova higher than the surrounding buildings outside its walls. Contained within the rova <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> lapa (royal palace or residence) {{as well as the}} fasana (tomb) of {{one or more of the}} site's founders and family members. It also enclosed a kianja (courtyard) marked by a vatomasina (sacred stone) that elevated the sovereign above the people for the delivery of kabary (royal speeches or decrees). The sovereign's lodgings typically stood in the northern part of the rova, while the spouse or spouses lived in the southern part.|$|E
5|$|The rova's {{earliest}} defining features had crystallised {{among the}} Merina as residences for local rulers at least 100 {{years before the}} emergence of the united Kingdom of Imerina under Andriamanelo. According to custom, a rova's foundation was always elevated relative to the surrounding village. The compound also always featured a kianja (central courtyard) marked by a vatomasina (tall sacred stone) where the sovereign would stand to deliver kabary (royal speeches or decrees). Contained within the rova <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> lapa (royal palace or residence) as well as the fasana (tomb) of {{one or more of the}} site's founders. The sovereign's lodgings typically stood in the northern part of the rova, while the spouse or spouses lived in the southern part. It was not until the dawn of the 19th century that a perimeter wall of sharpened wooden stakes would constitute another defining feature of rova construction.|$|E

5|$|Abuses {{of power}} over the villagers by Abir had been {{reported}} by missionaries almost since they began operations in the Congo but the first real public disclosure came in 1901 {{with the publication of}} a report, written by an ex-agent, in several Belgian newspapers. The Free State began an investigation into Abir's abuses during which an inquiry established at Bongandanga heard evidence from missionaries in the concession. As a result, Abir took action against the missionaries, stopping the carriage of their mail on company steamers, stopping the missionaries' boats and confiscating any mail that they carried. Abir also forbid missionaries from buying food from villagers, forcing them to buy from Abir's own stores. In 1904 Roger Casement issued the Casement Report which condemned the Abir system; this resulted in the Free State launching another investigation later that year. Although evidence of unlawful killings made by Abir was uncovered the investigation had no powers of arrest and could only submit a report to the Free State authorities. This lack of action resulted in deteriorating relations between Abir and the missionaries and there <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> attempted shooting of a missionary. Evidence for Abir's abuses also came from the governor of the French Congo, to the north-west, who claimed that prior to 1903 30,000 people had been driven from the Free State to the French Congo by Abir's actions.|$|E

25|$|Government {{soldiers}} {{blocked the}} streets to the prison.

25|$|Friction arose between de Gaulle and Pétain over Le Soldat, {{a history}} of the French soldier which he had ghost-written and for which he wanted greater writing credit.

25|$|Reported deaths reached 22 in ten {{states by}} July 21, {{the end of}} the first stage of this heat wave. Reports of deaths trailed off over the {{week-end}} of July 21–23, though high temperatures persisted and power outages remained in a number of areas including New York, Missouri, and Illinois. In St. Louis, half the city was without power due to severe thunderstorms, prompting requests for volunteer nurses to help cope with the situation. Though temperatures were somewhat cooler, there still <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> further reported heat death in Missouri.|$|E
25|$|The high-wheeler {{lives on}} in the gear inch units used by cyclists in English-speaking {{countries}} to describe gear ratios. These are calculated by multiplying the wheel diameter in inches {{by the number of}} teeth on the front chain-wheel and dividing by the teeth on the rear sprocket. The result is the equivalent diameter of a penny-farthing wheel. A 60-inch gear, the largest practicable size for a high-wheeler, is nowadays a middle gear of a utility bicycle, while top gears on many exceed 100inches. There <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> 64-inch Columbia made in the mid-1880s, but 60 was the largest in regular production.|$|E

Toronto police reported over 30 incidents of vandalism as of October 6.

25|$|The {{chassis built}} by TVR were all {{provided}} to customer specification, and therefore no {{two of them}} left the factory {{in exactly the same}} configuration. The extra exposure created by using the Sports Saloon in competition led to potential customers inquiring about the availability of other body styles. TVR sold kits with Microplas Mistal bodies, and at least two different styles from Rochdale Motor Panels & Engineering Ltd. The engines fitted were typically the Ford 1172cc sidevalve or Austin A40 1200cc OHV. There <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> instance of a car being fitted with the 1489cc BMC B-Series engine (as fitted to the MGA), and one chassis was built to accommodate a customer's 2½-litre Lea-Francis engine.|$|E
25|$|Efficacy {{and risks}} of {{catheter}} ablation of AF are areas of active debate. A worldwide {{survey of the}} outcomes of 8745 ablation procedures demonstrated a 52% success rate (ranging from 14.5% to 76.5% among centers), with an additional 23.9% of patients becoming asymptomatic with addition of an antiarrhythmic medication. In 27.3% of patients, more than one procedure was required to attain these results. There <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> major complication in 6% of patients. Death {{has been found to}} occur in 1 in 1000 people who undergo this procedure. A thorough discussion of results of catheter ablation was published in 2007; it notes that results are widely variable, due in part to differences in technique, follow-up, definitions of success, use of antiarrhythmic therapy, and in experience and technical proficiency.|$|E
