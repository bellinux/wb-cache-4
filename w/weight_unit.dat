2500|$|In 118 BCE, the ban liang coins were {{replaced}} by another type, the [...] "wu zhu" [...] type, that was inscribed [...] "wu zhu", or five zhu (another <b>weight</b> <b>unit).</b> These were minted until 621 CE, shortly after {{the establishment of the}} Tang Dynasty.

The monetary systems of China were now standardized, based on the Qin model, and knife and spade coins were replaced with ban liang coins.

40|$|SUMMARY: Knowledge of the <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of Municipal Solid-Waste (MSW) is {{required}} for many engineering analyses. However, <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> {{continues to be a}} significant source of uncertainty in these analyses due to a variety of factors, including the heterogeneous nature of solid waste, a paucity of data, and the lack of systematic analysis of the available data. Analysis of available in-situ and laboratory data on the <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of MSW, described herein, indicates both the existence of a “characteristic <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> profile ” for MSW and the need for site-specific <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> data to develop an accurate <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> profile for a particular landfill.

An increase in the total binder content increased both <b>unit</b> <b>weights.</b> This behavior might be attributed to the high absorption rate of aggregates (above 13  %) that slowed the evaporation rate of water from the mixture.
