According to Amennakht, Paneb ordered his stone workers not only to steal stone from the worksite of Seti II, but to use this stone to build columns for his personal tomb. In one case, he not only ordered his workers to make a plaited bed, but made their wives weave clothing for him. In addition, he stole several <b>work</b> <b>tools,</b> breaking one (Recto 2.13). Some tools were apparently of great value, as the workers searched for an entire month for a tool he stole before he snuck it back onto the worksite.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{long-term}} {{risk factor}} from firefighting is exposure {{to high levels}} of sound, which can cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus. [...] NIHL is caused by exposure to sound levels at or above 85dBA according to NIOSH and at or above 90dBA according to OSHA. dBA represents A-weighted decibels. dBA is used for measuring sound levels relating to occupational sound exposure since it attempts to mimic the sensitivity of the human ear to different frequencies of sound. OSHA uses a 5-dBA exchange rate, which means that for every 5dBA increase in sound from 90dBA, the acceptable exposure time before a risk of permanent hearing loss occurs decreases by half (starting with 8 hours acceptable exposure time at 90dBA). NIOSH uses a 3-dBA exchange rate starting at 8 hours acceptable exposure time at 85dBA. [...] The time of exposure required to potentially cause damage depends on the level of sound exposed to..The most common causes of excessive sound exposure are sirens, transportation to and from fires, fire alarms, and <b>work</b> <b>tools.</b> Traveling in an emergency vehicle has shown to expose a person to between 103 and 114dBA of sound. According to OSHA, exposure at this level is acceptable for between 17 and 78 minutes and according to NIOSH is acceptable for between 35 seconds and 7.5 minutes [...] over a 24-hour day before permanent hearing loss can occur. This time period considers that no other high level sound exposure occurs in that 24-hour time frame. Sirens often output about 120dBA, which according to OSHA, 7.5 minutes of exposure is needed and according to NIOSH, 9 seconds of exposure is neededin a 24-hour time period before permanent hearing loss can occur. In addition to high sound levels, another risk factor for hearing disorders is the co-exposure to chemicals that are ototoxic. [...] The average day of work for a firefighter can often be under the sound exposure limit for both OSHA and NIOSH. The average day of sound exposure as a firefighter is often under the limit, but firefighters can be exposed to impulse noise, which has a very low acceptable time exposure before permanent hearing damage can occur due to the high intensity and short duration.|$|E

The material used for investigation were hot <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> steels X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 and 55 NiCrMoV 7 alloyed with TiC or TaC using high power diode laser.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{processing}} of thick cold <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> steel coating using high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spraying process. A full factorial experimental design was established to identify the influencing process parameters on the formation of dense coating with low oxidation. Microstructural analysis of the coating was carried out using optical, SEM and XRD techniques. Cold <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> steel coatings with a thickness up to 2 mm were developed on bond coated low carbon steel substrates for wear resistance evaluation. A pin on disc test was performed to examine the wear resistance of thick cold <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> steel coatings on different types and sizes of abrasive papers. The wear results were compared with the wear resistance of a standard high speed steel pin. The abrasive wear resistance of cold <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> steel coated pins {{was found to be}} superior against soft and fine abrasive papers than the standard high speed steel. Besides, the performance of the coated pins against hard and coarser abrasive papers was found to be similar to standard high speed steel. The study showed the potential of HVOF spraying on the development of thick cold <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> steel coatings for wear resistance applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

Boriding temperature range of 1123 – 1223 K was performed with different boriding time up to 6 hr, afterwards, near-surface {{properties of the}} borided tool steels AISI D 2 and H 13 were characterized. Boride layer thicknesses were measured using an optical microscope with an image analyzer program. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to identify the boride coating layer.

Design/methodology/approach: The surfaces’ topography and the structure of the PVD coatings were observed on the scanning electron microscopy.

Tests of the coatings’ adhesion to the substrate material were made using the scratch test. Findings: The duplex and nanostructure coatings demonstrate high hardness and very good adhesion. The critical load LC 2 (coating delamination) lies within the range 80 - 85 N, depending on the coating type. It was found out that the duplex TiN/(Ti,Al) N coating show the best adhesion to the substrate material.
