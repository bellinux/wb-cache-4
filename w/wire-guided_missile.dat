5|$|The Battle of Wanat {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the bloodiest Taliban attacks of the war and one of several attacks on remote outposts. In contrast to previous roadside bombings and haphazard attacks and ambushes, this attack was well-coordinated with fighters from many insurgent groups with an effort that was disciplined and sustained which was able to precisely target key equipment such as a <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missile</b> launcher.|$|E
25|$|During the {{prototype}} evaluation, the Army changed the AAH primary antitank weapon from the proven TOW <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missile</b> {{to the new}} Hellfire laser-guided missile, with over twice the effective range. This was risky because Hellfire had not even been flown at the time, with the initial development contract with Rockwell International signed in October 1976.|$|E
500|$|All of the Croatian defences were [...] {{away from}} the Old Town, except for Fort Imperial about [...] to the north. The {{fortress}} was attacked at 5:50amminutes after the bombardment of the Old Town began. The attack was executed by the 3rd Battalion of the JNA 472nd Motorized Brigade, advancing simultaneously from two directions. The primary attack consisted of a company-sized force, and the secondary of a platoon of infantrymenboth supported by T-55 tanks and artillery. By 8am, the infantry reached Fort Imperial, forcing the defending force to retreat into the fortification and request help. MarinoviÄ‡ ordered HV artillery to fire directly onto the fortress and dispatched a special police unit to reinforce the Fort Imperial garrison. By 2pm, the JNA called off the attack. That day, Sveti Vlahothe first vessel commissioned by the Armed Boats Squadron Dubrovnik and named after {{the patron saint of}} the city Saint Blaisewas sunk by a <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missile.</b>|$|E

5000|$|These {{guidance}} systems usually {{need the}} use of radars and a radio or wired link between the control point and the missile; in other words, the trajectory is controlled with the information transmitted via radio or wire (see <b>Wire-guided</b> <b>missile).</b> These systems include: ...|$|E
50|$|Mountain {{guns are}} largely outdated, their role being filled by mortars, {{multiple}} rocket launchers, recoilless rifles and <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missiles.</b> Most modern artillery is manufactured from light-weight materials {{and can be}} transported fully assembled by helicopters.|$|R
50|$|Very few support {{guns are}} still in service with {{infantry}} units; their roles have been largely replaced by rocket-propelled grenades and other grenade launchers, light anti-tank weapons, and mortars. Heavier <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missiles</b> are used to engage point targets such as structures.|$|R

50|$|According to the {{official}} armed forces spokesman, the operation has been launched based on an estimation {{of the situation and}} fresh information about many hideouts and targets. The operation came days after the Sinai Province militant group released a video documenting its attacks on the Egyptian military in Sinai, including footage of a <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missile</b> strike that destroyed a naval vessel.|$|E

50|$|Guided {{anti-tank}} {{missiles were}} first {{used in a}} helicopter-borne role by the French in the late 1950s, when they mounted SS.11 <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missiles</b> on Alouette II helicopters. While, initially, there were many teething problems, the possibilities were clear, such as providing the ability to attack the more lightly armored top of the tank.|$|R

50|$|Firepower {{consisted}} of the innovative combination of the 73 mm 2A28 Grom gun and a launcher for the 9M14 Malyutka (AT-3A Sagger A) anti-tank <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missile</b> (ATGM). The gun was intended to engage enemy armored vehicles and firing points at a range of up to 700 m, while the missile launcher {{was intended to be}} used against targets that were 500 m to 3000 m away.|$|E

50|$|After the war, HEAT rounds {{became almost}} {{universal}} {{as the primary}} anti-tank weapon. Variants of varying effectiveness were produced for almost all weapons from infantry weapons like rifle grenades and the M203 grenade launcher, to larger dedicated anti-tank systems like the Carl Gustav recoilless rifle. When combined with the <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missile,</b> infantry weapons were able to operate at long-ranges also. Anti-tank missiles altered the nature of tank warfare throughout the 1960s and into the 80s, and remain effective.|$|E
50|$|The Polyphem was a {{proposed}} light-weight fibre-optic <b>wire-guided</b> surface-to-surface <b>missile</b> {{with a range}} of 60 km.|$|R
50|$|For a time, it {{appeared}} that the tank was a dead end. A small team of infantry with a few missiles in a well-concealed position could take on a number {{of the largest and most}} expensive tanks. In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Soviet first-generation <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missiles</b> employed by the Egyptian forces inflicted heavy casualties on Israeli tank units, causing a major crisis of confidence for tank designers.|$|R
50|$|The TOW missile in {{its current}} {{variations}} is not a fire-and-forget weapon, and like most second generation <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missiles</b> has Semi-Automatic Command Line of Sight guidance. This means that the guidance system is directly linked to the platform, and requires that the target be kept in the shooter's line of sight until the missile impacts. A fire-and-forget TOW variant (TOW-FF) was under development, but was cancelled by the Army in 2002.|$|R
50|$|Later {{modifications}} {{included the}} ability to carry the Nord SS.11 <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missile,</b> with the fitting of the Aimers sight in the left cockpit roof and the installation of large inflatable emergency floats in sponsons {{on either side of}} the cabin to prevent capsizing of the top-heavy aircraft in the event of ditching. The SS.11 had limited range to target small surface targets such as patrol boats or shore positions and this was later replaced by the AS.12, which effectively had double the range.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} {{possible}} to carry a bomb load of 500 kg (1,100 lb), consisting of one SD or SC 500 half-tonne bomb, one Bombentorpedo BT 200 bomb, five SD-series fragmentaion bombs, SC-series general purpose bombs, or a Rb 20/30 reconnaissance camera. The weapons load would be carried in the equipment space {{in the bottom of}} the fuselage and thus partially protrude about halfway from the fuselage, possibly allowing for other armament packages such as the Ruhrstahl X-4 <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missile.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missile</b> is {{a missile}} that {{is guided by}} signals sent to it via thin wires {{connected}} between the missile and its guidance mechanism, which is located somewhere near the launch site. As the missile flies, the wires are reeled out behind it command guidance. This guidance system is most commonly used in anti-tank missiles, where its ability {{to be used in}} areas of limited line-of-sight make it useful, while the range limit imposed by the length of the wire is not a serious concern.|$|E

5|$|In 2001 RIRA members {{travelled}} to Slovakia {{to procure}} arms, and {{were caught in}} a sting operation by the British security agency MI5. The men attempted to purchase five tonnes of plastic explosives, 2,000 detonators, 500 handguns, 200 rocket-propelled-grenades, and also <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missiles</b> and sniper rifles. Three men from County Louth were arrested and extradited to the UK and subsequently imprisoned for 30 years each after pleading guilty to conspiring to cause explosions and other charges.|$|R
50|$|The HJ-8 series can be {{considered}} the Chinese equivalent of the American BGM-71 TOW and Franco-German MILAN / Euromissile HOT anti-tank missiles. HJ-8 is a tube-launched, optically tracked and <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missile</b> system armed with a HEAT anti-tank warhead. The HJ-8 is a combination many experts believe of three Western antitank missile systems obtained from nations in the Middle East and Asia that were then examined and reverse engineered and modified: the tripod from the US BGM-71 TOW; the tracker-control unit from the French/German MILAN; and the missile from the UK Swingfire.|$|E
50|$|Command {{guidance}} {{is a type}} {{of missile}} guidance in which a ground station or aircraft relay signals to a guided missile via radio control (or, in a <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missile,</b> through a wire connecting the missile to the launcher) and tell the missile where to steer in order to intercept its target. Additionally, it is possible to send a command to the missile to detonate, even if the missile itself has a fuze or fuzes. (It may be possible to detonate the missile and destroy or damage the target, even though the missile was not actually going to strike the target, due to the blast radius of the warhead).|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missile,</b> or Anti-Tank Guided Weapon (ATGW) systems came into use in the late 1950s and 1960s that could defeat any known tank at ranges beyond that of the guns of the accompanying infantry. The United Kingdom, France, and other NATO countries {{were among the first}} to develop such weapons (e.g., the Malkara missile by the UK and Australia in 1958). The Soviet Union, and now Russia, put extensive development into these weapons; the first man-portable model to enter service was the AT-3 in 1961. The United States was one of the last, coming up with the BGM-71 TOW in 1970.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{outfitted}} with British weaponry, Qatar shifted {{much of its}} procurement to France during the 1980s in response to French efforts to develop closer relations. The tank battalion was equipped with French-built AMX-30 main battle tanks, before later being replaced by German Leopard 2A7's. Other armored vehicles include French AMX-10P APCs and the French VAB, adopted as the standard wheeled combat vehicle. The artillery unit has a few French 155mm self-propelled howitzers. The principal antitank weapons are French Milan and HOT <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, 1950s and 1960s {{generation}} {{tanks were}} badly beaten by <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missiles,</b> {{and it was}} realized that dramatically improved armor protection was needed. The {{decision was made to}} allow the tank to increase its weight to the next classification, Military Loading Class 60 (tonnes), and a new design effort was started, with the spaced armour replaced with a much denser perforated armour assemblage. The new design would go on to augment and after the Cold War sometimes replace the Leopard in many countries' armies.|$|R
50|$|The {{modified}} MD 500 helicopters {{were finally}} revealed by North Korea and {{seen by the}} USA and European countries during North Korea's Victory Parade held on the 27th of July in 2013 in Pyongyang, to commemorate the 60th anniversary {{of the end of}} the Korean War in 1953. Images and analyses done regarding North Korea's MD 500 helicopters show that they have been modified significantly to serve as light attack helicopters, such as modification work on the helicopters for them to be mounted with Soviet-designed AT-3 Sagger anti-tank <b>wire-guided</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R
