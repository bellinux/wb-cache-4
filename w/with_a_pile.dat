25|$|A {{variation}} on the log cabin starts with two pieces of fuel wood <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of tinder between them, and small kindling laid {{over the tops of}} the logs, above the tinder. The tinder is lit, and the kindling is allowed to catch fire. When it is burning briskly, it is broken and pushed down into the consumed tinder, and the larger kindling is placed {{over the top of the}} logs. When that is burning well, it is also pushed down. Eventually, a pile of kindling burns between two pieces of fuel wood, and soon the logs catch fire from it.|$|E
25|$|Since {{its initial}} discovery, {{the wreck of}} Titanic has been {{revisited}} on numerous occasions by explorers, scientists, filmmakers, tourists and salvagers, who have recovered thousands of items from the debris field for conservation and public display. The ship's condition has deteriorated significantly over the years, particularly from accidental damage by submersibles but mostly because of an accelerating {{rate of growth of}} iron-eating bacteria on the hull. It has been estimated that within the next 50 years the hull and structure of Titanic will eventually collapse entirely, leaving only the more durable interior fittings of the ship intermingled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of rust on the sea floor.|$|E
500|$|During {{the era of}} log floating, logjams {{sometimes}} {{occurred when}} logs struck an obstacle. Log rafts floating down the West Branch had to pass through chutes in canal dams. The rafts were commonly [...] wide—narrow enough {{to pass through the}} chutes—and [...] to [...] long. In 1874, a large raft got wedged in the chute of the Dunnstown Dam and caused a jam that blocked the channel from bank to bank <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of logs [...] high. The jam eventually trapped another 200log rafts, and 2canal boats, The Mammoth of Newport and The Sarah Dunbar.|$|E

500|$|Visual effects {{supervisor}} Jay Worth found {{inspiration for}} the ash storyline from holding his grandmother-in-law's hands while at her funeral. He noted during production, [...] "The Ash Man definitely had {{its own set of}} challenges, because we wanted to utilize a lot of real elements, and because we didn't have the time to do all the simulation and particle work needed to make it look real. The thing that sold The Ash Man more than anything was the aftermath shot: This half-disintegrated body <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of ash for the head on the ground. It ended up being a layering, compositing, tweaking challenge beyond belief. I got to shoot the elements myself and had more control over them." ...|$|E
500|$|Negative reviews {{included}} Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{who gave}} the film one-and-a-half stars out of four saying: [...] "The movie deserves more stars for its bottom-line craft, but all the craft in the world can't redeem its story." [...] Bob Mondello of NPR said the film was [...] "A sadistic, unmotivated home-invasion flick." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that [...] "No one is getting at anything in The Strangers, except the cheapest, ugliest kind of sadistic titillation." [...] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News compared the film to 2007's Vacancy - a comparison which [...] "does [...] "Strangers" [...] no favors. Vacancy director Nimród Antal gave us a pair of heroes who fought like hell to survive, becoming closer and stronger in the effort. Bertino's undeveloped protagonists are colossally stupid and frustratingly passive." [...] Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post panned the film, calling it [...] "a fraud from start to finish." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, said the film [...] "uses cinema to ends that are objectionable and vile," [...] but admitted that [...] "it does it well, with more than usual skill." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe said of the director, [...] "Bertino has the pretensions of an artist and the indelicacy of a hack. He tries to get under our skin <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> driver." [...] Stephen Whitty of The Newark Star-Ledger opined of the film, [...] "Unfolding with an almost startling lack of self-awareness, young filmmaker Bryan Bertino's debut is such a careful, straight-faced knockoff of '70s exploitation films that it plays like a parody." ...|$|E

2500|$|In modern times, {{when there}} is no paschal lamb, some Ashkenazi Jews have adopted the {{practice}} of emulating Hillel's example by making a sandwich of matzo and maror (the [...] "bitter herbs": either lettuce, endive, or horseradish). The maror, if lettuce or endive, is dipped in the meal's traditional charoset (a finely chopped sweet mixture of fruits and nuts, typically apples, walnuts, red wine, cinnamon, and honey) just before the sandwich is made. [...] In Ashkenazi families where grated horseradish is used for the maror instead of lettuce or endive, the maror cannot be dipped in the charoset, so it is the custom to spread the bottom piece of matzah with horseradish maror, cover it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of charoset, and top it with another piece of matzah to make a hot-sweet sandwich.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{reported}} within Caesar's {{accounts of}} the Gallic wars, the Suebi posed another threat in 55 BC. The Germanic Ubii, who had worked out an alliance with Caesar, were complaining of being harassed by the Suebi, and the Tencteri and Usipetes, already forced from their homes, tried to cross the Rhine and enter Gaul by force. Caesar bridged the Rhine, the first known to do so, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> bridge, which though considered a marvel, was dismantled after only eighteen days. The Suebi abandoned their towns closest to the Romans, retreated to the forest and assembled an army.
