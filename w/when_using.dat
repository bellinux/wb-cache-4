Some words have spatial definitions <b>when</b> <b>used</b> as one part of speech, but non-spatial definitions (by our criteria) <b>when</b> <b>used</b> as another.

5|$|Before {{each game}} and single-player Conquest, players choose between Sports and Action camera views. Action view is a {{trailing}} third-person shot similar to {{looking over the}} player-character's shoulder, while Sports view is a spectator perspective similar that of a televised basketball game. Enclosed arenas are inaccessible <b>when</b> <b>using</b> Sports view. The camera view cannot be changed once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports view will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action view camera swings wildly and can be pulled back slightly in the menus.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist has platform-specific features, {{including}} voice {{integration with}} Xbox 360's Kinect peripheral which allows players to distract enemies before attacking. A player {{can also use}} the Kinect sensor to control the protagonist with their body instead of the Xbox 360 controller. In the Wii U version, the Gamepad controller's touchscreen is an interface, accessing gadgets and other features from the protagonist's arm-mounted computer (OPSAT), and incorporating screen and motion controls to highlight enemies with thermal vision <b>when</b> <b>using</b> Killing in Motion. The Wii U version was not shipped with the game's cooperative mode.|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} few decades, these paper targets have been {{gradually}} replaced by electronic target systems, immediately displaying the results on monitors. <b>When</b> <b>using</b> these systems, actual scoring lines are not printed, but {{the location of the}} impact hole (which can be determined acoustically) is automatically converted into corresponding scores by a computer. ISSF rules now require the use of these systems in top-level competitions. They are generally used in other international competitions as well, and in some countries they are even common in national competitions.|$|E
5|$|Exposure {{to light}} is {{detrimental}} to the stability of aqueous solutions of psilocybin, and will cause it to rapidly oxidize—an important consideration <b>when</b> <b>using</b> it as an analytical standard. Osamu Shirota and colleagues reported a method for the large-scale synthesis of psilocybin without chromatographic purification in 2003. Starting with 4-hydroxyindole, they generated psilocybin from psilocin in 85% yield, a marked improvement over yields reported from previous syntheses. Purified psilocybin is a white, needle-like crystalline powder with a melting point between , and a slightly ammonia-like taste.|$|E
5|$|If a chest tube {{is already}} in place, various agents may be instilled through the tube to achieve {{chemical}} pleurodesis, such as talc, tetracycline, minocycline or doxycycline. Results of chemical pleurodesis tend to be worse than <b>when</b> <b>using</b> surgical approaches, but talc pleurodesis {{has been found to}} have few negative long-term consequences in younger people.|$|E

The bottom touchscreen displays the radar. <b>When</b> <b>using</b> the default control scheme, movement is controlled using the D-pad, and aiming is controlled by dragging the stylus along the touchscreen.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the features in common with HDMI (such as HDCP encrypted uncompressed high-definition video and eight-channel surround sound), MHL also adds the provision of power charging for the mobile device while in use, and also enables the TV remote to control it.

Dive computers, unlike decompression tables, measure depth and time at short intervals during the dive and calculate the exact decompression indicated by the decompression model, which for a multilevel profile will be less than for the square profile with the same maximum depth and duration.|$|E
