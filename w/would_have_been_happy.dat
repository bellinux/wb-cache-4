5|$|The {{debate about}} whether Tyrannosaurus was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger {{is as old as}} the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus’ close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus’ teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have agreed that it was a predator, although like modern large predators it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> to scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
25|$|When {{questioned}} over {{why she did}} not step up to do Renaissance's pitches, Claire {{answered that}} she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> to have done so at the start, but felt she was set up as a scapegoat after Kevin was initially dead set on doing so, but asked her {{later on in the}} task to take over. Sir Alan doubted any pitch of hers could have been worse than Kevin's, after noting that the theme had doomed the team, but advised her to step up if a similar situation arose again.|$|E
25|$|The Bengals {{were also}} a team on the rebound. During the strike-shortened 1987 season, quarterback Boomer Esiason and head coach Sam Wyche had openly feuded, and the team {{finished}} with a miserable 4–11 record. A lot of Bengals fans <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> to see them both leave the team, but they worked out their differences in the offseason, and Esiason ended up having the best season of his career en route to Super Bowl XXIII. During the regular season, he threw for 3,572 yards and 28 touchdowns with only 14 interceptions, while also rushing for 248 {{yards and a touchdown}} on 43 carries. Esiason's performance made him the top-rated quarterback in the league with a 97.4 passer rating and earned him the NFL Most Valuable Player Award.|$|E

[...] She also claimed that the season finale was a let-down, but Jenny <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> that even in death she was the center of attention and meddling in her friends lives.|$|E
500|$|Simpson in his {{adolescence}} {{was described}} as fearsome in descent by fellow Scala Wheelers club member George Shaw, who explained that if Simpson dropped behind on a climb, {{he would come back}} on the descent. Simpson's risk-taking on descents was evident throughout his career, crashing in four out of the seven Tours de France he competed in. Track rider Norman Sheil recalled: [...] "When racing on a banked velodrome, Simpson would sometimes ride up the advertising boards {{at the top of the}} bankings, Wall of Death-style, to please the crowds." [...] Simpson's death was attributed to his unwillingness to admit defeat ascending Mont Ventoux. He described a near-death experience during a race in 1964, the Trofeo Baracchi two-man time trial, to Vin Denson, who recalled: [...] "He said he felt peace of mind and wasn't afraid to die. He said he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> dying." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{admired her}} {{performance}} in Hard Candy, Reitman cast Ellen Page {{in the lead}} role, saying that when he read the screenplay {{for the first time}} he pictured her as Juno. He visited her on the set of a film on which she was working to offer her the role. He also handed the script to J.K. Simmons, who had featured in his previous film, Thank You for Smoking, not telling him that he intended Simmons to play Mac. Simmons says that, after reading the script, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> to play even the high school teacher who has no speaking lines. Other cast members Reitman had [...] "in mind right from the start" [...] were Olivia Thirlbywho had originally unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Junoand Michael Cera. He took them with Page and Simmons to a Panavision stage in California and shot 45 pages of the script on 35 mm film against a black backdrop. He presented this footage to Fox Searchlight as the initial cast. Reitman highlighted the importance of doing a screen test instead of individual auditions, saying: [...] "This is a movie that’s all about relationships and the idea of auditioning people outside of each other, one-on-one with the casting director, didn’t make sense." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite this boisterous public image, Cipollini could {{often be}} quite humble {{regarding}} his fellow cyclists. After breaking Alfredo Binda's record for Giro stage wins he remarked he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> [...] "just to polish [...] shoes." [...] Reacting to the 2004 death of Marco Pantani, Cipollini said, [...] "I am devastated. It's a tragedy of enormous proportions {{for everyone involved}} in cycling. I'm lost for words." ...|$|E

Walker and Stevens had time to score half-centuries, and Geraint Jones had some useful batting practice in getting to 36 not out, {{but there was never}} much prospect of a result once the follow-on was saved. Kent captain David Fulton said, [...] "If there had been any realistic chance of a result we <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> to go for it.

Both Hinn and Bonnke offered full access to their events to the documentary crew, and the documentary team followed seven cases of [...] "miracle healings" [...] from Hinn's crusade over the next year. The film's director, Antony Thomas, told CNN's Kyra Phillips {{that they did not}} find any cases where people were actually healed by Hinn. Thomas said in a New York Times interview that [...] "If I had seen miracles , I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> to trumpet it... but in retrospect, I think they do more damage to Christianity than the most committed atheist." ...|$|E

The issue was whether they wanted a PAP man as president to check on a PAP government, or whether it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better to <b>have</b> a neutral independent like Chua. That's why they voted against me because I had the PAP government support. I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happier</b> without the PAP's open support.|$|R

2500|$|Dmitry Konstantinovich was entranced {{with his}} new position, one of which demanded that he {{traveled}} across Russia and Europe, selecting the finest horses. Acting on his advice, the Imperial Stud purchased Galtee More, who had won the Derby in Great Britain, for an astronomical 200,000 rubles; {{as soon as he}} arrived in Russia, the thoroughbred was put to stud at Tsarskoye Selo. [...] Dmitry Konstantinovich held the post until 1905, when he was replaced with Major-General Alexei Zdnovich. On 10 January 1904, Dmitry Konstantinovich relinquished command of the Horse Guard grenadiers Regiment. Although he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> to remain in his post, his eyesight was failing rapidly, in detriment to his military career. Reluctantly he recognized that by remaining he was depriving another, more capable man of advancement. On leaving active service, the grand duke generously gave his dacha at Krasnoye Selo to the Horse Guards Regiment, to be used as an officer’s club.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Nightingale" [...] made Jenny Lind {{known as}} The Swedish Nightingale well before she became an {{international}} superstar and wealthy philanthropist in Europe and the United States. Strangely enough, the nightingale story became a reality for Jenny Lind in 1848–1849, when {{she fell in}} love with the Polish composer Fryderyk Chopin (1810–1849). His letters reveal that he felt [...] "better" [...] when she sang for him, and Jenny Lind arranged a concert in London to raise funds for a tuberculosis hospital. With the knowledge of Queen Victoria, Jenny Lind attempted unsuccessfully to marry Chopin in Paris in May 1849. Soon after, she had to flee the cholera epidemic, but returned to Paris shortly before he died of tuberculosis on 17 October 1849. Jenny Lind devoted the rest of her life to enshrining Chopin's legacy. Lind never recovered. She wrote to Andersen on 23 November 1871 from Florence: [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> to die for this my first and last, deepest, purest love." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Tears of the Prophets" [...] was {{the final}} episode of Deep Space Nine to feature actress Terry Farrell. Her {{contract}} on the show was set to expire after the sixth season and she elected not to sign a new contract for a further season. The day after her final scene was shot, she tested for the sitcom Becker. She later said that she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> with a recurring role during the seventh series of Deep Space Nine as {{she was tired of}} the long hours required of her in a main cast role. The writers felt that due to the ongoing Dominion War in the series, that there was no alternative other than to kill off the character. Farrell said of the exit of her character, [...] "I don't feel cheated out of the character {{in the same way as}} I would have if the show had been cancelled, because I've gotten the opportunity to play her. And besides, it's Jadzia that's dying. Dax is living." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{legal status}} of one Baptist chapel was often {{slightly}} different from another since they {{had grown up in}} many ways. At one time George Lisle's chapel was his personal responsibility, and he was imprisoned for an outstanding debt on its construction. The more appropriate scheme of ownership was through some form of trust deed. Whilst Oughton supported the congregation's right to appoint trustees at one Chapel where this issue arose, the wish of his own congregation to do likewise at the East Queen Street Chapel became a cause of controversy since it had a different constitution. Oughton also faced a problem because all its trustees but one had died before dutifully appointing others, and so it became inquorate. Just as he had exposed wrongdoing by the magistrates, and been prepared to suffer imprisonment for a time, he would not be party to illegal ownership arrangements at his chapel whatever the price. A number of his congregation <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> with this however, and put pressure on the remaining trustee to exceed his legal authority. [...] Oughton's firm moral standards upset them; he again had to pay the price of unpopularity, just as when he had upset sections of the white population earlier.|$|E
2500|$|Abandoning {{his office}} job, {{he decided to}} instead take up both writing and {{illustrating}} his own comics. He had already produced a couple of strips for several alternative fanzines and magazines, such as Anon E. Mouse for the local paper Anon, and St. Pancras Panda, a parody of Paddington Bear, for the Oxford-based Back Street Bugle. His first paid work was for a few drawings that were printed in NME music magazine, and not long after he succeeded in getting a series about a private detective known as Roscoe Moscow published using the pseudonym of Curt Vile (a pun on the name of composer Kurt Weill) in the weekly music magazine Sounds, earning £35 a week. Alongside this, he and Phyllis, with their newborn daughter Leah, began claiming unemployment benefit to supplement this income. Not long after this, in 1979 he also began publishing a new comic strip known as Maxwell the Magic Cat in the Northants Post, under the pseudonym of Jill de Ray (a pun on the Medieval child-murderer Gilles de Rais, something he {{found to be a}} [...] "sardonic joke"). Earning a further £10 a week from this, he decided to sign off of social security, and would continue writing Maxwell the Magic Cat until 1986. Moore has stated that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> to continue Maxwell's adventures almost indefinitely, but ended the strip after the newspaper ran a negative editorial on the place of homosexuals in the community. Meanwhile, Moore decided to focus more fully on writing comics rather than both writing and drawing them, stating that [...] "After I'd been doing [...] for a couple of years, I realised that I {{would never be able to}} draw well enough and/or quickly enough to actually make any kind of decent living as an artist." ...|$|E
