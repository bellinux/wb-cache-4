5|$|In another vision Scully lies on a {{table and}} is visited by her {{deceased}} father. Mulder, sitting with Melissa in the hospital cafeteria, is asked by a woman for change for the cigarette machine. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> that a pack of Morleys is already there and leaves, Mulder opens it and finds the Cigarette Smoking Man's address inside. Mulder bursts into the Cigarette Smoking Man's home and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know why Scully was taken instead of him. The Cigarette Smoking Man claims he likes the both of them, which is why she was returned; he reveals that he told Skinner it was Mulder who shot {{the man in the}} parking lot, although he didn't believe this to be true, incidentally revealing himself as unaware of who did shoot the man, namely X. He tells Mulder that he'll never know the truth if he kills him, and Mulder decides not to.|$|E
5|$|Lisa imagines she and all {{the other}} Springfield Elementary {{students}} are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if {{it is going to be}} smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.|$|E

After he saves a Unicorn descendant named Trill from a free fall, he frequently visits her {{in the home of}} Professor Sazzan, the man who adopted her. When Mori discovers that Sazzan is only interested in his telekinetic powers, he runs away with Trill. Mori kisses Trill, but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> she loves him and Sazzan equally he overheats and burns Mia's aviary. Mia sends Mori to Mars; Trill's repressed feelings are released, and she expresses her hatred for Sazzan and his experiments. When Sazzan tries to assault Trill she breaks a vase on his head and runs to an airlock, where she falls to her death in front of Mori, who is aboard a ship leaving for Mars.|$|E

Worried that Trina's ex-husband Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet) will be angry with them, they enlist Leon and Zsa Zsa's help to replace the tree. However, as they dig up the tree, they discover the body of Owen Turner (Lee Ross) buried beneath it. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> it is all she can see when she closes her eyes. She attends Lucas's Bible class and questions him about false prophets and a passage that states that anyone who questions a priest should be put to death, causing Lucas to make an excuse to leave because he cannot answer her. Grace asks Mercy {{to write a letter}} of apology to Lucas, but Mercy throws it away. Mercy and Fatboy play rounders but smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window, which Fatboy repairs. Mercy asks Dot if she can attend her church. When Zsa Zsa is left homeless, she asks to move in with Mercy and her grandmother.|$|E

They visit Michael's boxing club where he tells Michael {{that he should have}} told him Tommy is his grandson. Michael, however, gives Eddie money and tells him to take his family far away. Eddie asks what it will take for him to get over what happened, and later tells Michael's girlfriend Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) that he does not {{remember}} why they fell out. Roxy and Eddie bond and Michael is annoyed. Michael repeatedly tells Eddie to stay away from him, Tommy and Roxy but Kat tells him he can stay {{for as long as he}} wants. Michael tells Roxy that Eddie murdered his mother, Maggie. Eddie confirms this but says he was not there when she died but left Michael with her (he was then 6 years old), knowing he shouldn't. She died of an overdose and Michael blames him. He later helps Carol fix a blocked sink at the café and she invites him for tea after he bonds further with Liam. Liam skips school and Eddie helps him with a hobby. Carol is annoyed that Liam did not go to school but thanks Eddie for spending time with Liam by kissing him. Eddie's son, Tyler (Tony Discipline), arrives in Walford and makes Eddie miss meeting Michael to try to make amends. Michael refuses to accept Eddie's apology.|$|E

Upon discovering that Val had knitted a beanie {{for everyone in the}} warehouse, an embarrassed Darryl passes the gloves off to warehouse worker Nate (Mark Proksch), who is moved by the gift.

Two mobsters, [...] "Sluggsy" [...] Morant and Sol [...] "Horror" [...] Horowitz, both of whom work for Sanguinetti, arrive and say they are there to look over the motel for insurance purposes. The two have been hired by Sanguinetti to burn down the motel so that Sanguinetti can make a profit on the insurance. The blame for the fire would fall on Viv, who was to perish in the incident. The mobsters are cruel to Viv and, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> she does not want to dance with them, they attack her, holding her down and starting to remove her top.

500|$|After Gordon {{performs}} a satire {{of the government}} on his show, his home is raided and Evey is captured. She is imprisoned and tortured for information about V, with her only solace being a note written by actress Valerie Page, a former prisoner who was tortured and killed for her lesbianism. Evey is told she will be executed unless she reveals V's location. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> she would rather die, she is inexplicably released, and then finds herself in V's home. It turns out that V {{was the one who}} had [...] "captured" [...] her at Gordon's home, and staged her imprisonment and torture to free her from her fears. The note was real, passed from Valerie to V when he was imprisoned. He also informs her that Deitrich had been executed when the Quran was found in his home. While Evey initially hates V for what he did to her, she realises she has become a stronger person. She leaves him, promising to return before November 5.|$|E
500|$|A few critics {{disagree}} with the speculation over Giraud's and Byron's relationship. The early 20th-century biographer Ethel Mayne points out both the frequency of such relationships in Byron's life and their inherent ambiguity <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "His stay was also marked by one of those ambiguous friendships with a youth infinitely below him in rank which have already been seen to recur in his life... The patron {{was supposed to be}} learning Italian from this made a pretext for giving him, on their parting at Malta in 1811... a considerable sum of money". Elizabeth Longford, in her 1976 biography, disagrees with the claims that there was a physical relationship between the two and argues, [...] "Byron's especial favourite among the 'ragazzi' was Nicolo Giraud. He had first taken up with Nicolo while Hobhouse was away in Euboea the year before, but {{there is no evidence that}} his feelings for Nicolo were anything but romantic and protective." [...] Jerome Christensen followed this view in 1993 and adds, [...] "we know little more than what Byron tells us".|$|E

500|$|To {{prepare for}} the project, de Campi read over 4000 pages of Archie comic books She drew {{inspiration}} for the story from the 1940s era of the series, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> Archie Andrews' girlfriends Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge had [...] "more edge". Her scripts were subject to notes and tweaks from Archie Comics and Fox, but de Campi described both licensors as [...] "extremely mellow, pleasant and easy to work with". Fox's primary concern was why the Predator, {{who is known for}} choosing challenging prey, would be interested in teenagers, but a suitable explanation was included in the story. She expected some of the notes, such as being told, [...] "Alex, you can't make jokes about child predation in an Archie book". Other times, she was surprised when she did not receive notes, such as her use of emojis for the Predator's speech. She was pleased when she got to add depth to Dilton Doiley, a character she feels is often overlooked in regular Archie comics. The choice of whether Archie Andrews would survive the series or not was changed several times during scripting, and a final decision was not made until the last draft of the script.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Hunk grows {{tired of}} Vince's self-centered attitude. When Peggy shows up {{unexpectedly}} at another of Vince's parties, Vince {{is happy to}} see her at first but becomes upset <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> the purpose of her visit is to talk about business. Mr. Shores then approaches Vince with an offer from Geneva Records to purchase Laurel Records and sign him to a rich contract. Peggy refuses to sell, but Vince announces that he will close the deal since he owns a controlling interest, which deeply devastates Peggy. Enraged by Vince's attitude—and his treatment of Peggy—Hunk provokes Vince to fight, who refuses to fight back. [...] Hunk delivers several hard blows with the last one striking Vince in the throat, endangering his voice and therefore his singing ability. Vince is then rushed to a hospital, where he forgives Hunk and realizes he loves Peggy and she loves him. After being released from the hospital, Vince's doctor informs him that his vocal cords are fully recovered, but Vince is worried that his voice might have been affected. To test it, he sings [...] "Young and Beautiful" [...] to Peggy, which reassures him that his fears are unfounded.|$|E
500|$|A video compilation, titled Madonna, was {{released}} by Warner Music Video and Sire Records in November 1984 to promote the album. The singer's first video compilation, it contained three music videos from the album—"Burning Up", [...] "Borderline" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star"—as well as the then current single [...] "Like a Virgin". The music video for [...] "Lucky Star" [...] was a special extended dance mix, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> [...] "ooh yeah" [...] it is echoed three times and her image is repeated three times. [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] omits the scene where the lion's tongue moves {{in time with the}} beat of the music. These videos were later released on the 1990 greatest hits compilation The Immaculate Collection with these edits changed. The video was promoted at the Cabaret Metro club in Chicago, on February 9, 1985. Dubbed as 'The Virgin Party', the event drew a crowd of around 1,200 and promoted Madonna's LPs, cassettes, CDs and the videocassette. Attendees were encouraged to wear white, and for $5 admission fees, were able to view the Madonna videocassette and the premiere of the music video of her then upcoming single [...] "Material Girl". The event was organised as a drive to promote music videos, which at that point did not have a large market.|$|E

500|$|Scott Matthewman, {{writing for}} The Stage, gave a mixed {{review of the}} episode. He thought that [...] "pretty much the only {{surprise}} {{in the way the}} humans who made up the Ood Corporation were presented came as PR girl Solana (Ayesha Dharker) escaped with the Doctor and Donna, only to betray their position by calling for the guards," [...] and [...] "the revelation that Ryder (Adrian Rawlins) has been working to infiltrate the Corporation is thrown away... as quickly as it is revealed." [...] However, he thought Donna was becoming [...] "fast... one of the strongest and most well-rounded companions in the series’ history", and [...] "there were some nice interpretations of the Ood’s natural development". Caitlin Moran of The Times thought the episode was [...] "really really good... – one that will have you staring at your screen and asking, once again, 'How can something so good be happening so early on a Saturday night, in my own front room?'". She enjoyed the scene where the Doctor and Donna talk about slaves in contemporary culture, saying that Tate [...] "really, really isn’t that bad <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> [...] ". Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode five stars out of five. Rawson-Jones opened his review by saying [...] "Doctor Who can occasionally transcend the properties of a mere family television show to reach out and give viewers a poignant, beautiful epiphany and greater sense of the world they inhabit," [...] citing Donna's reaction on seeing the uncultivated Ood as the moving part of the episode.|$|E

Brian is traumatized for no reason after finding out about Ida and, when he hears Quagmire come inside the house, he tries to hide under Peter and Lois' bed, but Quagmire finds him easily, because Brian's feet were sticking out from under the bed, and brutally beats him, thus threatening to blow his head off if he goes near Quagmire's house.
