40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the effects of different ratios of waste lubricant sludge to fumed silica and mixing time on characteristics of high temperature grease produced from waste lubricant sludge and silicone oil. The ratios used were 100 : 0, 90 : 10, 80 : 20, 70 : 30, 60 : 40, 50 : 50 and 40 : 60. In terms of mixing time, it was varied at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h. In this experiment, the grease was prepared by using heating and mixing technique. The grease produced was analysed according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and National Lubricating Grease Institute (NLGI) standard via penetration test, dropping point test, copper corrosion test, Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) and Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). FTIR analysis was carried out to study the functional groups present in the grease. AAS analysis was also carried out to determine the concentration of a specific metal element in the grease. The {{results show that the}} grease produced with a minimum ratio of fumed silica to sludge (10 : 90) was high temperature grease with a dropping point of 272. 5 °C. Further analysis show that the grease produced is high temperature grease with a <b>worked</b> <b>penetration</b> of 270 - 290 which makes the grease fall into NLGI number of two. It also has a low tendency to corrode copper and very little metal element was present in the grease.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{disposal}} problem of Spent Bleaching Earth (SBE) from oil palm industry {{has become a}} serious environmental issue. Therefore, attempt was made in this research to utilize the SBE as raw material {{in the production of}} high temperature grease. The scope of this research includes preparation of calcium fluoride as thermal resistance additives, grease preparation and analysis on the grease produced. The parameters studied for grease preparation are effect of different ratio of SBE and fumed silica as thickener and effect of mixing time. The ratios of SBE used in grease formulation were varied from 100 wt. % to 60 wt. % of thickener weight. The best ratio chosen from grease formulation is based on the dropping point test before it was further used for second parameter. As a second parameter, the mixing time of grease preparation was varied at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hours. The grease produced was analyzed for dropping point, <b>worked</b> <b>penetration,</b> copper corrosion, organic content using FTIR and metal content using AAS. The results obtained were compared to the National Lubricating Grease Institute (NLGI) Guide to classify the grease. Results indicate that the best ratio for grease formulation is 90 % of SBE and 10 % of fumed silica. Therefore, the usage of fumed silica which is very expensive can be reduced. Results also shows that the consistency of grease decreased as the mixing time increased. With refer to NLGI standard, the consistency of all grease at mixing time 1 to 5 hour is in the range of 2 to 4 grade number and can be classified as high temperature grease since its dropping point is higher than 260 oC. As a conclusion, the findings from this research has the high potential to help in solving the environmental problem on SBE disposal which is in line with the government campaign to reduce waste in daily life and indirectly can reduce the production cost with this SBE based grease...|$|E

For this purpose, rheology, selective protein solubility, SDS-PAGE, and microstructural examination were carried out. The low gel-forming capacity of giant squid mantle coincided with the predominance of hydrophobic interactions at high temperature (< 60 °C), mainly involving MHC and paramyosin. The absence of setting coincides with a relatively high incidence of hydrogen bonding at 35 °C. Soy isolate protein and casein showed a great tendency to aggregate by means of hydrophobic interactions when heated.

Microstructure was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The influence of fat content on the modulus of rigidity (G) only became evident as gel structures began to form, giving higher G values for meat batters the higher the fat content of the sample. As the temperature was raised in the product (between 40 and 70 ° C), penetration stress and elasticity increased.

40|$|Introduction: Some {{forces and}} impacts that occur during {{transporting}} and handling {{can reduce the}} apricot quality. Bruise damage is {{a major cause of}} fruit quality loss. Bruises occur under dynamic and static loading when stress induced in the fruit exceeds the failure stress of the fruit tissue. Needless to say that physical and mechanical properties of fruits in the design and optimization of systems related to production, processing and packaging of the products are important. Harvesting, transport, packaging and transportation of fruits and vegetables, result in their bruising which can cause loss of marketability of the fruit by consumers. The term of ‘absorbed energy’ could be used to express the quantity of damage done on the fruit and the high the absorbed energy, the higher the damage on the fruit. The object of this research was due to the importance of apricot fruit and lack of information about the mechanical behavior. Materials and Methods: In this study, apricot fruit variety “Ziaolmolki” was examined to determine some physical and mechanical properties. In order avoid any damage, the fruits were carefully harvested from trees and gathered in plastic boxes in a row, to prevent damage to the apricots. For determination of mechanical properties and levels of impact energy used test axial machine and pendulum device, respectively. Dependent variables (acoustics stiffness, radius of curvature, color characteristic a* and b*, Brix percentage, <b>penetration</b> force, <b>penetration</b> <b>work</b> and <b>penetration</b> deformation) and independent variables (impact energy in three levels, temperature and color in 2 levels each) were selected and analyzed by block designs with factorial structure. In the experimental design, the fruits were stored in two temperature levels, 3 oC and 25 oC. Two areas of any fruit (red and yellow areas) were subjected to 3 impact energy levels. For each of the 8 levels, 8 fruit samples were selected. Overall, 96 fruits 8 (number of fruit per level) × 3 (impact energy level) × 2 (both red and yellow) × 2 (at 25 oC and 3 oC) was selected. In this study, using a factorial experiment in a completely randomized design, the effect of different factors (impact energy in 3 levels, temperature in 2 levels 3 oC and 25 °C and color in 2 levels red and yellow) on acoustic stiffness, radius of curvature, color characteristic a* and b*, precent Brix, <b>penetration</b> force, <b>penetration</b> <b>work</b> and <b>penetration</b> deformation in apricot under the quasi-static forces were studied. In order to conduct this experiment, the universal testing machine of biological materials was used. After the determination of mechanical properties of the products, the SAS statistical program (1. 9) was applied to analyze and normalize the resulted data. Factorial test also was used {{to determine the effects of}} independent variables on the dependent variables. Data analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SAS version 19. 0).

40|$|Conference paper (selected oral communication) Dermal {{delivery}} of catechins {{may be an}} effective approach for protection of skin against inflammation, aging and cancer caused by exposure to radiation and environmental toxicants. Catechins are flavonoid-type polyphenols showing capacity to attenuate UV-induced skin injury, carcinogenesis and melanoma metastasis, but the prevalence of beneficial effects depends on compound concentration.

By combining these results with expected dose-effect relationships of the compounds, bioactivity profiles were calculated for relevant skin regions. Since the concentration dependences of catechin capacities to protect dermal fibroblasts and to inhibit melanoma cells (data aggregated from published literature) follow different types of dose-effect curves, bioactivity profiles in the skin can be different, even for the same delivery conditions. This method allows to estimate the delivery conditions (time and concentrations) required to achieve the desired biological/pharmacological activities at critical skin strata, namely, viable epidermis and dermis where metastatic melanoma cells and susceptible fibroblasts localize.

40|$|Sulphated polysaccharides (kappa- and iota-carrageenan) {{and sodium}} {{alginate}} added to blue whiting mince {{were subjected to}} three different pressure/heat treatments {{in order to determine}} the functionality of each one in mince gel. The effect of the gelling treatment was largely dependent on the hydrocolloid used. In general, gelation at atmospheric pressure induced gels that were more adhesive, harder (except in the case of iota-carrageenan) and yellower, and less cohesive. Lower pressure conditions (200 MPa, 10 °C, 10 min) produced more cohesive gels with higher breaking deformation and lower elasticity; these gels also had the highest values of <b>work</b> of <b>penetration</b> (especially those containing iota-carrageenan). Higher pressure conditions (375 MPa, 37 °C, 20 min) induced gels with the lowest hardness; all other characteristics were similar in some cases to pressurized gels at lower gelling conditions and in others to heat-induced gels. The carrageenans (iota or kappa) appeared to form a reticular structure in the heat-induced gels, which was not observed with alginate. In the pressurized gels, iota-carrageenan was in globular form, indicating that it had not gelled; kappa-carrageenan, on the other hand, formed small, fine reticular structures. Alginate formed a fine, dense network in the higher treatment conditions, but this was not observed in the lower treatment conditions. From a technological standpoint, the composite system offers new potential, due not only to the added hydrocolloid but also to the treatment applied. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
