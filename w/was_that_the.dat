5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained {{that he did not want}} the character to be that young.|$|E
5|$|A {{commission}} {{appointed by}} King Edward I in 1278 {{reported that there}} were at that time 94 privately owned gibbets and gallows in use in Yorkshire, including one owned by the Archbishop of York. What was unusual about Halifax <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> custom lingered on there for so long after it had been abandoned elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} number of broadside ironclads {{was built in the}} 1860s, principally in Britain and France, but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States. The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ship could engage more than one adversary at a time, and the rigging did not impede the field of fire.|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} {{problems are}} present in coal mining in China: one <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> capacity in maintaining safety in mining is relatively low; <b>the</b> second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> technology and equipment, technical management, and the technical innovation level are not at a high level; <b>the</b> third <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> waste of resources is relatively serious; <b>the</b> fourth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> added-value and technological-content of products are relatively low; <b>the</b> fifth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> centralization of business is relatively low.|$|R
50|$|For 7 {{year olds}} (Key Stage 1) <b>the</b> general {{expectation}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority of pupils will attain Level 2 in each individual subject. For 11-year-olds (Key Stage 2) <b>the</b> expectation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority of pupils will attain Level 4 in each individual subject. For 14-year-olds (Key Stage3) <b>the</b> general expectation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority of pupils will attain Level 5 in each individual subject.|$|R
50|$|Another {{possibility}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{government might}} decide to increase its own spending - say, by building more highways. <b>The</b> idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> additional government spending creates jobs and lowers the unemployment rate.|$|R
5|$|According to Susan Brownmiller, mass rape {{during wartime}} {{is not a}} new phenomenon. She argues that what was unique to the Bangladesh Liberation War <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{international}} community, for the first time, recognised that systematic rape {{could be used as a}} weapon to terrorise the people.|$|E
5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the timber {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> citizens of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much like that of a timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E
5|$|After an {{erroneous}} scouting {{report of}} approaching Mexican troops, Baker burned San Felipe de Austin {{to the ground}} on March 30. When Baker claimed Houston had given him an order to do so, Houston denied it. Houston's account <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> residents burned their own property {{to keep it out}} of the hands of the Mexican army. San Felipe de Austin's residents did as those before them in escaping the Mexican army, and fled to the east.|$|E
40|$|A {{generalized}} gradient projection filter algorithm for inequality constrained optimization is presented. It {{has three}} merits. <b>The</b> first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> amount of computation is lower, since the gradient matrix only {{needs to be}} computed one time at each iterate. <b>The</b> second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> paper uses the filter technique instead of any penalty function for constrained programming. <b>The</b> third <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> algorithm <b>is</b> of global convergence and locally superlinear convergence under some mild conditions...|$|R
30|$|A {{consequence}} of (6) for A = X <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relation ĥ X/Z_ρ _j→ X/Z_ρ _j defined by ĥ([x]) = [h(x)] is a function. A {{consequence of}} (7) for A = X, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> function ĥ {{has a unique}} fixed point.|$|R
3000|$|This section {{discusses}} {{two different}} scenarios for the normal {{operations of the}} HSNs.

5|$|All work {{to put the}} I-185 into {{production}} was cancelled afterwards, even with the M-82 engine, as they were all required for the La-5 fighter. Another reason cited <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> La-5 used the fuselage of the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3 which was already in production in three plants and would involve less disruption of the production lines. Another factor may have been that the La-5 required less duralumin to build, something in short supply at the time.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> radar system was extremely complex and expensive and could not be built in large numbers, the second <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with ten}} other former senior officers, Manstein was called on in 1955 by the Amt Blank to {{formulate}} {{plans for the}} re-founding of the German army. On 20 June 1953, {{he spoke to the}} Bundestag, giving his analysis of strategic power considerations and the country's defence and spoke about whether the country should have a professional army or a conscripted army. His opinion <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> length of service for Bundeswehr conscripts should be at least 18 months, preferably 24 months. His idea to form a reserve force was later implemented.|$|E
30|$|However, VCO 2 -based {{calorimetry}} has two methodological challenges. <b>The</b> first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> method {{requires a}} choice of RQ to be made, and <b>the</b> second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of the estimation is affected by instant variability in measurements of MV and VCO 2.|$|R
50|$|A police lineup is {{a method}} for an {{eyewitness}} to identify a perpetrator by viewing a series of photos, or a live group of suspects. One possible outcome of a lineup <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can correctly identify the criminal. Another outcome <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can correctly state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>is</b> not in the lineup. A third option <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can fail to recognize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> culprit <b>is</b> present. Lastly, the eyewitness can incorrectly select another suspect. The ideal result is to correctly identify the offender, and the worst outcome is to mistakenly identify an innocent.|$|R
50|$|Equivalent {{conditions}} <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> line bundle KX <b>is</b> big, or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> d-canonical map <b>is</b> generically injective (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> a birational map to its image) for d sufficiently large.|$|R
5|$|Also on November 28, 2006, a 14-disc DVD box set titled Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition was released, {{containing}} Superman, Superman II, , Superman III, Superman IV, Superman Returns, and , {{among other}} releases. All {{contents of the}} set were housed within a tin case. The set was valued at US$99.92, and received extremely positive reviews when first released. However, after only {{a day on the}} market, Warner Bros. announced that there were two errors discovered within the set. The first <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 2.0 audio track on Superman, was instead the 5.1 audio track already on the disc. The second <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Superman III disc was not the 2006 deluxe edition as advertised, but the 2001 release instead. The set was soon recalled, and Warner Bros. offered a toll-free number to replace the faulty discs for people who had already purchased the set. Due to popular demand, a corrected set was released and Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition returned to store shelves on May 29, 2007.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} suggestion <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> comets {{were all}} fragments {{of an earlier}} Sun-grazing comet. This idea was first proposed in 1880, and its plausibility was amply demonstrated when the Great Comet of 1882 broke up into several fragments after its perihelion passage. In 1888, Heinrich Kreutz published a paper showing that the comets of 1843 (C/1843 D1, the Great March Comet), 1880 (C/1880 C1, the Great Southern Comet), and 1882 (C/1882 R1, Great September Comet) were probably fragments of a giant comet that had broken up several orbits before. The comet of 1680 proved to be unrelated to this family of comets.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} component to the Holocaust in Lithuania <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> occupying Nazi German administration fanned antisemitism by blaming the Soviet regime's recent annexation of Lithuania, a year earlier, on the Jewish community. Another significant factor was the large {{extent to which}} the Nazis' design drew upon the physical organization, preparation and execution of their orders by local Lithuanian auxiliaries of the Nazi occupation regime.|$|E
30|$|The {{advantage}} of DS theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> evidence can <b>be</b> associated with multiple possible events, for example, sets of events. One {{of the most}} important features of DS theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> model <b>is</b> designed to cope with varying levels of precision regarding the information.|$|R
40|$|It <b>is</b> {{demonstrated}} <b>that</b> (tangential) discontinuities in {{the magnetic}} field direction can support MHD surface waves. The surface waves {{are similar to the}} usual Alfven wave, but there are seven important differences. <b>The</b> first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> surface waves exhibit a low-frequency cutoff; <b>the</b> second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> velocity and magnetic field fluctuations are elliptically, and sometimes circularly, polarized. It <b>is</b> noted <b>that</b> they may account for the solar wind helicity spectrum. <b>The</b> third difference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> surface waves <b>are</b> compressive, although there are special cases where they are noncompressive. <b>The</b> fourth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wave vector k, the local normals to the surfaces of constant phase, and the magnetic minimum variance direction do not all coincide. <b>The</b> fifth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> a tendency for the minimum variance direction to align itself with the mean magnetic field direction. <b>The</b> sixth difference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> waves can <b>be</b> intrinsically nonplanar, and <b>the</b> seventh <b>is</b> <b>that</b> equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energies is not obeyed locally. These properties of the surface waves are interpreted to mean that surface waves may be common in the solar wind...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{complication}} of AC circuits <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resistance and conductance can be frequency-dependent. One reason, mentioned above is the skin effect (and the related proximity effect). Another reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resistivity itself {{may depend on}} frequency (see Drude model, deep-level traps, resonant frequency, Kramers–Kronig relations, etc.) ...|$|R
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E
5|$|Another {{argument}} presented {{during the}} Saxbe nomination hearings <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> constitutional framers wrote the Ineligibility Clause to prevent Congress from enacting laws to benefit {{one of its}} own members. Any Saxbe fix is such a law and should be disallowed based on this fact alone.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training {{was accomplished by}} reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training slides and nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E
40|$|It <b>was</b> {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> p-mode power <b>is</b> substantially suppressed in magnetic regions. One {{possible explanation}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> upper turning point, the acoustic cut-off {{point of the}} solar p-modes is lowered {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field. A related possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> attenuation length scale in the evanescent region is reduced {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field. It <b>is</b> likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> observations sample a different position in the evanescent tails of the eigenfunctions in magnetic regions because of different temperature structures in these regions. A model is used to quantify the first of these effects...|$|R
40|$|Reasons for {{prescribing}} antibiotics by official names <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> doctor <b>is</b> {{more likely}} to understand what he <b>is</b> prescribing, <b>that</b> it enables <b>the</b> literature to be internationally understood, and <b>that</b> non-branded products <b>are</b> less costly. The only reason to <b>the</b> contrary <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original brands of some oral antibiotics are better absorbed than others...|$|R
5|$|Another theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name {{derives from}} Kalighat.|$|R
5|$|Another common rumor at {{the time}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tablet would have an Apple A6 processor.|$|E
5|$|Another oddity <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{outbreak}} {{was widespread}} {{in the summer and}} autumn (in the Northern Hemisphere); influenza is usually worse in winter.|$|E
5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E
3000|$|Because {{the goal}} {{of this paper is to}} update these estimates, it is useful to {{consider}} <b>the</b> key issues <b>that</b> have <b>been</b> raised regarding the methods and the data on which they rely. There are four key criticisms. <b>The</b> first criticism <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> estimates of disemployment effects obtained in the longitudinal studies are simply too large to be plausible. <b>The</b> second criticism <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> evidence of stronger effects of business assistance living wage laws cannot be reconciled with the fact (which <b>is</b> asserted) <b>that</b> business assistance provisions cover almost no workers. <b>The</b> third criticism <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> CPS data used in the longitudinal analyses do not provide large enough samples to detect effects of living wage laws.

30|$|One {{reason of}} these {{increases}} might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> impact of FTO substrate samples {{on the environment}} is reduced, in which the process was in a nitrogen-filled glovebox while the reported process was in the air. The second reason might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resistivity of the ITO substrate increases after annealing treatment at high temperature while the resistivity of the FTO substrate does not. For ITO, the oxygen hole as carrier reduction causes the decrease of conductivity after annealing. The third reason might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> light transmittance of the FTO substrate was a little higher than <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> ITO substrate.|$|R
30|$|Case one <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first touch <b>was</b> truly {{intended}} and {{the second}} touch was unintended.
