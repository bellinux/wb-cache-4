25|$|On 24 July 1773, Porto Alegre {{became the}} capital city of the province, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of Manuel Sepúlveda, who used the fictitious name or {{pseudonym}} José Marcelino de Figueiredo, to hide their identity, officially started. In 1824, immigrants {{from all over the world}} started arriving, especially German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Jewish, and Lebanese. This mosaic of diversity in appearance, ethnic origin, religions and languages is what makes Porto Alegre, nowadays with nearly 1.5 million inhabitants, a cosmopolitan and multicultural city. The city is an example of diversity and plurality.|$|E

25|$|The {{depopulation}} of Paneas {{after the}} Muslim conquest was rapid, as its traditional markets disappeared. Only 14 of the 173 Byzantine {{sites in the}} area show signs of habitation from this period. The Hellenised city thus fell into a precipitous decline. At the council of al-Jabiyah, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of the new territory of the Umar Caliphate was established, Paneas remained the principal city of the district of al-Djawlan (the Djawlan) in the jund (military Province) of Dimashq (Damascus), due to its strategic military importance {{on the border with}} Jund al-Urdunn, which comprised the Galilee and territories east and north of it.|$|E

The Grant test lists three factors the courts must consider: (1) {{the seriousness of the}} Charter-infringing conduct (focusing on a review of how society would view the actions of the state), (2) the impact of the breach on the Charter-protected interests of the accused (focusing on a review of how the state's actions affected the accused), and (3) society's interests in the adjudication of the case on its merits (focusing on a review of the importance and reliability of the evidence).|$|E

500|$|A similar {{dispute with}} Britain {{arose in the}} Pacific, over the rights of Canadians to hunt seals in waters off the Pribilof Islands, a part of Alaska. [...] While only Americans {{had the right to}} take seals on the islands, the right to hunt in the waters around them was less well-defined, and Americans {{believed}} foreign sealers were depleting the herd too quickly by hunting off-shore. [...] Bayard and Cleveland believed the waters around the islands to be exclusively American, but when Cleveland ordered the seizure of Canadian ships there, Bayard tried to convince him to search for a diplomatic solution instead. [...] The situation remained unresolved <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> left office in 1889, and remained so until the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{a campus}} apiary was first {{conceived}} {{for the sole purpose}} of pollinating the campus orchard. However, by the time the facilities had been built, President Kenyon L. Butterfield and his administration had seen and realized a much greater purpose and potential in it than was previously considered. Around this time beekeeping was considered a new business venture which had otherwise been thought of as a hobby or side business of farmers for many decades prior. [...] Just as much of the pioneer work in beekeeping originated in New England, Massachusetts was one of the first states to create a [...] "State Inspector of Apiaries." [...] The man who first led UMass’s beekeeping program, a Dr. Burton N. Gates, was also the first to fill this position. As the apiary’s first professor, he was originally hired part-time to give a series of lectures as a guest speaker during the spring semester of 1906. This would continue until 1910 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> hired him as a permanent faculty member, and concurrently built the new apicultural laboratory, equipped with all modern amenities of its time. They saw the opportunity they had, to further research on the diseases and ecology of the honey bee, something that up to that point had never been pursued so thoroughly by a public organization of higher education.|$|E
