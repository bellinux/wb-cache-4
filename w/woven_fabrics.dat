The collection has numerous examples of various types of textiles designed by William Morris, including, embroidery, <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics,</b> tapestries (Including 'The Forest' tapestry of 1887), rugs and carpets, as well as pattern books and paper designs. The art deco period is covered by rugs and fabrics designed by Marion Dorn. From the same period there is a rug designed by Serge Chermayeff.|$|E
25|$|The {{urbanisation}} {{and development}} of Whitefield largely coincided with the Industrial Revolution. The name Whitefield is thought to derive from the medieval bleachfields used by Flemish settlers to whiten their <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics,</b> or else from the wheat crop once cultivated in the district. The construction of a major roads routed through the village facilitated Whitefield's expansion into a mill town during the mid-19th century. Whitefield was created a local government district in 1866, and was governed by a local board of health until 1894, when {{the area of the}} local board became an urban district.|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{ballistic}} performance of sandwich panel consisting of Kevlar 129 <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> and hexagonal aluminium honeycomb (HAH). The enhancement of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> in HAH sandwich panel further strengthens the sandwich panel especially in ballistic tests. Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> showed extensive pull out (rupture of yarns) when less than 6 layers of fabric impacted by ballistic projectile at a velocity of 293 m/s. Sandwich panel consisting of 6 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> incorporated with aluminium honeycomb showed no pull out when impacted by a ballistic projectile at a velocity of 312. 5 m/s. However, when sandwich panel arrangement {{was in the}} following order: 1 layer of HAH, 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric,</b> 1 layer of HAH, 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> and a final layer of HAH, Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> pull out was observed when impacted by a ballistic projectile at a velocity of 277. 8 m/s. This indicated that the ballistic projectile was impacting on 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> (followed by another 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric)</b> at a time instead of 6 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> based on {{the arrangement of the}} sandwich panel. The overall sandwich panels for both arrangements had the same amount of materials but one failed the ballistic test and the other passed. One possible reason behind the improved ballistic test is that the areal density of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> is the highest when the layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> are assembled together. Therefore, it is crucial to have ballistic projectile entrapped within the Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> layers before prioritising the arrangement of sandwich panel...|$|R
40|$|Two fabric {{composite}} {{models are}} presented for the on-axes elastic analysis of two-dimensional orthogonal plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> lamina. These are two-dimensional models {{taking into account}} the actual strand cross-section geometry, possible gap between two adjacent strands and undulation and continuity of strands along both warp and fill directions. The shape functions considered to define the geometry of the <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> lamina compare well with the photomicrographs of actual <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> lamina cross-sections. There is a good correlation between the predicted results and the experimental values. Certain modifications are suggested to the simple models available in the literature so that these models {{can also be used to}} predict the elastic properties of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> laminae under specific conditions. Some design studies have been carried out for graphite/epoxy <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> laminae. Effects of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> geometrical parameters on the elastic properties of the laminae have been investigated...|$|R

Yarn continuity along both warp and fill directions {{and the actual}} yarn cross-sectional geometry and fabric geometry are considered in the analysis. Off-axis elastic properties are determined by coordinate transformation. Comparison is made between the off-axis elastic properties of plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> laminates and cross-ply laminates. It is found that the elastic properties of the plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> laminates are superior as compared to those of equivalent cross-ply laminates over a large range of off-axis angles...|$|R
25|$|The {{hand loom}} with the witch {{is typical of}} many {{that were used in}} the mills by cloth {{designers}} to develop new fabric designs and patterns. They are still used in the textile departments of universities and colleges for training students in weaving and the designing of fabrics. The shafts are lifted by a witch, an early form of dobby, with weights underneath to pull the shafts down, and can work up to 50 shafts to produce very complicated patterns. The weft is put in by hand using the flying shuttle method invented in 1733 by John Kay, and up to four colours can be woven in the weft using Robert Kay's (son of John Kay) 1760 invention of the multiple shuttle box. On this simple-to-operate loom the designer is able to explore the application of new design ideas before beginning production trials on a wider loom. Many of the designs for <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> made today were developed and created long ago on similar narrow-width pattern looms.|$|E
25|$|Like weaving, {{knitting}} is {{a technique}} for producing a two-dimensional fabric made from a one-dimensional yarn or thread. In weaving, threads are always straight, running parallel either lengthwise (warp threads) or crosswise (weft threads). By contrast, the yarn in knitted fabrics follows a meandering path (a course), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically {{above and below the}} mean path of the yarn. These meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motions, such as socks and hosiery. For comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the bias), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from stretchable material such as spandex. Knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further. Extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc. can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches. Thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the knitted fabric more bulk and less drape than a woven fabric.|$|E

40|$|Two-dimensional <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> {{composite}} {{models were}} {{developed for the}} elastic analysis of WF composites in Part I of this paper. The effect of undulation of yarn and fabric thickness on the elastic properties of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> lamina was studied. The study was extended to <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> laminates {{and the effect of}} laminate configuration on the elastic properties was analyzed in Part II. In the present paper, the effect of pp between two adjacent yams on the elastic properties of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> lamina and the effect of laminate configuration for different number of layers on the elastic properties of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> laminates for different material systems are studied. An optimum gap between adjacent yams gives higher Young's moduli, and it depends upon the fabric structure and material system. A basic building block is found which gives higher elastic properties than with any other configuration with the same number of layers. Such a basic building block can then be used for making thicker laminates. The comparison of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> laminates with UD cross-ply laminates indicated that, in general, the material system with lower degree of orthotropy is desirable for <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> composites...|$|R
5000|$|The bias {{grain of}} a piece of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric,</b> usually {{referred}} to simply as [...] "the bias", is at 45 degrees to its warp and weft threads. Every piece of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> has two biases, perpendicular to each other.

40|$|The {{stiffness}} and strength {{behavior of the}} <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> composite materials mainly depend on {{the properties of the}} fiber and matrix materials. A technique was developed to design and analyze <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> composites based on the micro-level properties of the fiber and matrix materials. The technique is based on the bilateral relationships among the fiber/matrix materials, the unidirectional composite (strand), the <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> layer and the laminated composite structure as in the given order. Simplified and efficient analytical models were developed for the relationship between any subsequent levels of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> composite materials. The technique is used to predict the structural level {{stiffness and}} strength in terms of material and the geometric configuration of the <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> and lamination. Progressive damage or failure can also be simulated at the fiber and matrix level by using this technique...|$|R
2500|$|The {{topology}} of a {{knitted fabric}} is relatively complex. [...] Unlike <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics,</b> where strands usually run straight horizontally and vertically, yarn {{that has been}} knitted follows a looped path along its row, as with the red strand in the diagram at left, in which the loops of one row have all been pulled through the loops of the row below it.|$|E
2500|$|Pre-Columbian {{textiles}} and wickerwork of the Zenú are almost completely lost, but the tools they used for production these items, such as needles and spindles made of bone, shells, and ceramics, did survive.

[...] Women were portrayed with long woven skirts {{with a variety of}} patterns.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{there is}} no single {{straight}} line of yarn anywhere in the pattern, a knitted piece of fabric can stretch in all directions. [...] This elasticity is all but unavailable in <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> which only stretch along the bias. Many modern stretchy garments, even as they rely on elastic synthetic materials for some stretch, also achieve at least some of their stretch through knitted patterns.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} model is presented for the compressive behaviour of plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> composites under on-axis uniaxial loading. Analysis {{is based on}} curved beams on elastic foundation approach. The contributions of all the three structural elements within the plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> composite, namely longitudinal strand, transverse strand and pure matrix region have been considered. During compressive loading, the load sharing between structural elements is worked out and the stress state throughout the composite is determined. Effect of failed structural elements is taken into account for further calculations. Compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and failure strain data has been generated for different fabric geometries for both plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> E-glass/epoxy and T 300 carbon/epoxy composites. Experiments {{have been carried out}} on typical plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> E-glass/epoxy composites for validation.

A laminate configuration with optimum shifts gives higher elastic properties compared to the other configurations. A comparison between in-plane elastic moduli of the unidirectionally laminated symmetric cross-ply laminates and plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> laminates is made.

These show that <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> were common in Cucuteni-Trypillia society. Finds of ceramic weights with drilled holes suggest that these were manufactured with a warp-weighted loom. It has also been suggested that these weights, especially [...] "disposable" [...] examples made from poor quality clay and inadequately fired, were used to weigh down fishing nets.

2500|$|Cotton {{is used to}} make {{a number}} of textile products. These include terrycloth for highly {{absorbent}} bath towels and robes; denim for blue jeans; cambric, popularly used in the manufacture of blue work shirts (from which we get the term [...] "blue-collar"); and corduroy, seersucker, and cotton twill. Socks, underwear, and most T-shirts are made from cotton. Bed sheets often are made from cotton. Cotton also is used to make yarn used in crochet and knitting. Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process. While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including rayon and synthetic fibers such as polyester. It can either be used in knitted or <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics,</b> as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans.
