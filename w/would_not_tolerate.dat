5|$|Between 1025 and 1028, the Fatimids {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with Salih's Jarrahid/Tayyi allies, allowing them to maintain their foothold in interior Palestine, while Anushtakin was recalled to Cairo. In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and its inhabitants. Moreover, the Fatimids <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> independent rule in Palestine, which they viewed {{as a threat to}} the Caliphate's survival.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 1936, Edward invited British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to Buckingham Palace and {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} marry Wallis Simpson when she became free to remarry. Baldwin informed him that his subjects would deem the marriage morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce was opposed by the Church of England, and the people <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> Simpson as queen. As king, Edward was the titular head of the Church of England, and the clergy expected him to support the Church's teachings.|$|E
5|$|When World War I broke out, the United States {{maintained}} {{a policy of}} isolationism, avoiding conflict while trying to negotiate peace between the warring nations. However, when a German U-boat sank the British liner Lusitania in 1915, with 128 Americans aboard, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied and Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. He repeatedly warned that the U.S. <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth and her {{advisers}} {{perceived the}} threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> the more radical Puritans though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms. As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} then {{defined a}} limit (the so-called Red Line), along the 15th parallel, extending from Mao to Abéché, {{and warned that}} they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> any incursion south of this line by Libyan or GUNT forces. Both the Libyans and the French remained on {{their side of the}} line, with France showing itself unwilling to help Habré retake the north, while the Libyans avoided starting a conflict with France by attacking the line. This led to a de facto division of the country, with Libya maintaining control of all the territory north of the Red Line.|$|E

25|$|Several hundred {{thousand}} women served in combat roles, especially in anti-aircraft units. The U.S. {{decided not to}} use women in combat because public opinion <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> it.

25|$|On 7 February 2012, Berlin Police arrested alleged {{members of}} Syrian {{intelligence}} {{on suspicion of}} monitoring Syrian opposition members living in Germany.

25|$|Although France said it <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> Libya's {{military}} presence at Faya-Largeau on August 25, Mitterrand {{was unwilling to}} openly confront Libya and return northern Chad to Habré. This inaction gave {{the impression that the}} French were willing to concede control of Northern Chad to Gaddafi. The Libyans, too, avoided crossing the Red Line, thereby avoiding engagement with the French troops.|$|E

25|$|The UDP chose {{substance}} over {{style in}} a realist campaign. Their commercials and statements attacked {{what they saw}} as latent corruption in the PUP's governing of the country. In February a broadside of scandals rocked the retiring administration, in sectors as varied as transport and education, and the UDP pushed every single one as an indication of the things the UDP <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> if elected.|$|E
25|$|There were {{at least}} six monasteries and more than 40 churches within the Nochiya Region. The Nochiyaye were best known for their {{adherence}} to the Nestorian faith; because of this, religious customs such as Lent and prayer were strictly observed.

25|$|During Señorans administration, many Argentine {{women began}} {{participating}} {{in what was}} then a male-only field. The Secretariat began appreciating certain advantages of the female sex, especially when operations required the exploitation of human weaknesses. However, in 1966, Señorans restructured the Secretariat, expelling 900 employees (of about 1,200 total), including all of the female intelligence operatives contracted at the time. It has been noted that Señorans had a phobia of females, and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> women working in administrative positions.|$|E

The Catholic element, in turn, saw in the National-Liberals as its worst enemy and formed the Center Party.|$|E

King Faisal <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> his criticism and had him removed from his position. But his teachings had already radicalized some of his students. One of them was Juhayman al-Otaybi.|$|E

When he discovered, in the spring of 1969, that Joplin was injecting drugs anyway, he did not confront her. Instead, in June 1969 he took out a life insurance policy guaranteeing him $200,000 in the event she died in an accident. His yearly premium was $3,500.|$|E
25|$|On 27 February, Drake {{called for}} a council of war {{to decide what to}} do with the city.

It was agreed that with a fever spreading rapidly and the ransom now completed it was decided to abandon the city as soon as the ransom was collected.|$|E
