5|$|Lieber {{began his}} {{professional}} {{career with the}} A short season Eugene Emeralds of the Northwest League. In five starts with the Emeralds, he had a 30 record, a 1.16 ERA, 23 strikeouts, 2 <b>walks,</b> <b>and</b> 26 hits allowed in 31 innings pitched. He also appeared in seven games (six starts) for the Baseball City Royals of the A-Advanced Florida State League, posting a 33 record, a 4.65 ERA, 19 strikeouts, eight <b>walks,</b> <b>and</b> 45 hits allowed in 31 innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|Became {{the first}} player in history with more times on base (376) than {{official}} at-bats (373) in 2004. This {{was due to the}} record number of walks, which count as a time on base but not an at-bat. He had 135 hits, 232 <b>walks,</b> <b>and</b> 9 hit-by-pitches for the 376 number.|$|E
60|$|He <b>walked</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked.</b> Every {{few minutes}} Johnny Chuck saw {{something}} farther on {{that looked like}} a patch of nice fresh clover. And every time when he reached it Johnny Chuck found that he had made a mistake. So Johnny Chuck <b>walked</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He <b>walked</b> their <b>walk</b> <b>and</b> talked their talk. (He <b>walked</b> <b>and</b> talked as they did.) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> he <b>walked,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>walked,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>walked,</b> till he {{had gone}} a great way, and there he met a giant.|$|R
5|$|For the season, Killebrew set career highs in RBIs, runs, <b>walks</b> <b>and</b> on-base percentage, tied {{his career}} high with 49 home runs, and even {{registered}} eight of his 19 career stolen bases, {{en route to}} winning his only Most Valuable Player Award. He led the AL in home runs, RBIs, on-base percentage, <b>walks,</b> <b>and</b> intentional <b>walks</b> <b>and</b> knocked in the winning run 20 times while playing in all 162 games. As of 2011, Killebrew's home run, RBI, and walk totals from 1969 remain team records, and his 145 walks are tied for the 20th highest single season total in MLB history and 7th highest for a right-handed batter. In the 1969 American League Championship Series, the Baltimore Orioles used their pitching staff, {{the best in the}} league, to defeat Minnesota and win the series three games to none. Baltimore avoided Killebrew by walking him six times in the three games to avoid pitching to him, which was as many times as they walked the rest of the Twins team.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} three visitor centers, where guided nature <b>walks</b> <b>and</b> general {{information}} are available, {{along with two}} additional information points. Each campground offers campfire talks {{during the summer months}} as well as guided tours. The parks have many picnic areas, which are all easily accessed by vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the figures}} are generic {{representations}} of human forms in various <b>walks</b> <b>and</b> stages of life, Taft included himself, {{with one of his}} assistants following him, along {{the west side of the}} sculpture. He is portrayed wearing a smock, with his head bowed and hands clasped behind his back. His daughters served as models for some of the figures.|$|E
6000|$|So he <b>walked,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>walked,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>walked,</b> {{until he}} met the giant, and he asked, 'Have two young men, making for yonder mountain, passed this way?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> he <b>walked,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>walked,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>walked,</b> till {{he met the}} giant, {{and asked}} him if he had seen a young man {{travelling}} towards the mountain.|$|R
60|$|So she <b>walked,</b> <b>and</b> she <b>walked,</b> <b>and</b> she <b>walked</b> {{till she}} came to the giant, and prayed him to tell her if he had seen three young men pass that way seeking the distant mountain.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2007 season, Beckett {{adjusted}} to throwing more breaking pitches and fewer fastballs. At the same time, he learned to locate his pitches rather than simply get strikes by power. He reduced his <b>walks</b> <b>and</b> home runs allowed by nearly half, contributing to his success in 2007. Beckett became one of six Red Sox pitchers in history to win their first seven starts. George Winter and Mickey Harris both won their first seven starts in a season, and Babe Ruth, Dave Ferriss and Roger Moret all won their first eight starts in a season. After a strong first half, posting a 12–2 record with a 3.44 ERA, he was selected to the American League team in the 2007 MLB All-Star Game. Beckett earned the victory in the game after pitching two innings, giving up only one hit, and striking out two. Beckett became the first pitcher to win 20 games in a season since 2005, finishing the season with a record of 20–7, a 3.27 ERA, 194 strikeouts, a 1.14 WHIP, and only 40 <b>walks</b> <b>and</b> 17 home runs allowed.|$|E
5|$|During Hershiser's streak he posted 59 IP, 0 runs, 31 hits, 38 strikeouts, 10 <b>walks,</b> <b>and</b> 3 extra-base hits, while Drysdale had posted 58 IP, 0 runs, 28 hits, 45 strikeouts, 10 <b>walks,</b> <b>and</b> 3 extra-base hits. Drysdale {{maintained}} {{the record for}} consecutive shutouts (6) because Hershiser did not pitch beyond the first 10 innings of his September 28 start because it lasted 16 innings. Hershiser's record was overshadowed because the 1988 Summer Olympics {{and the start of}} the 1988 National Football League season occurred at the same time. Los Angeles had two NFL teams at the time (Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Raiders). Additionally, baseball fans were more concerned with pennant races. Furthermore, four of the final five games in the streak were played in the Pacific Time Zone, limiting the games' visibility {{to the rest of the}} country. Controversially, KTTV did not broadcast either the September 26 game in which the Dodgers clinched the NL West or the September 28 game in which Hershiser set the record. Instead, it showed Friday the 13th and The Funhouse on September 26 and 28, respectively. The record-setting game drew an attendance of 22,596.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, Strasburg {{accumulated}} an NL-best 34 strikeouts and second-best 1.13 ERA. He totaled 6 <b>walks</b> <b>and</b> did {{not give}} up a home run. Consequently, he was named NL Pitcher of the Month. On May 20, Strasburg went 2-for-2 as a hitter {{in a game against}} the Baltimore Orioles and hit his first career home run, a solo shot off of Wei-Yin Chen.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the current}} study we bring out the impact of various social, economic, environmental, and {{transportation}} system characteristics on <b>walk</b> <b>and</b> cycle mode choice, when they are used as a main mode. The environmental factors include density and land use. The impact is determined using a logistic regression model, developed from the house hold survey data of Bangalore city, collected for the year 2009. The results showed a reduced likeliness to <b>walk</b> <b>and</b> cycle, {{with an increase in}} travel time using <b>walk</b> <b>and</b> cycle, and individual age. Individuals owning at least a private motor vehicle had less probability of using <b>walk</b> <b>and</b> cycle compared with individuals not owning any private motor vehicle. Females had a positive attitude towards walking than male. Mixed Land-use and increased density had a positive impact on <b>walk</b> <b>and</b> cycle mode use when compared with their reference group...|$|R

5|$|Lieber {{remained}} in the bullpen to begin the 1996 season. In his first 34 games, he posted a 4.21 ERA. In July, {{he returned to the}} starting rotation following the release of Zane Smith. As a starter, Lieber posted a 72 record with a 3.91 ERA, emerging as the Pirates' ace {{by the end of the}} year. In 51 games (15 starts) in 1996, Lieber posted a 95 record, a 3.99 ERA, 94 strikeouts, 28 <b>walks,</b> <b>and</b> 156 hits allowed in 142 innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{completion}} in 1940, the Canning Dam {{has contributed to}} a wide range of environmental and ecological problems in surrounding regions, problems include more common algal blooms, habitat loss and sedimentation. Despite these issues, Canning Dam and the adjacent parks and forests provide a variety of recreational activities for the public such as bushwalking, historic <b>walks</b> <b>and</b> picnic facilities.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2006 season, Bautista was again in the Royals' {{starting}} rotation, but after a poor start (interrupted by a disabled list stint from April 14 to May 8) in which he went 0–2 with an ERA of 5.66, 22 strikeouts, and 17 walks in 35 innings pitched, the Royals sent him to the Triple-A Omaha Royals of the Pacific Coast League. There he continued to struggle, posting a 25 record, a 7.36 ERA, 28 strikeouts, 32 <b>walks,</b> <b>and</b> 44 innings pitched in 10 starts. On August 1, the Royals traded him along with Jeremy Affeldt to the Colorado Rockies for Ryan Shealy and Scott Dohmann.|$|E

5|$|Hacker {{made his}} major league debut on September 22, {{allowing}} two runs in an inning in a 10–4 {{loss to the}} Cincinnati Reds. He pitched a scoreless inning in a 6–0 loss to the Chicago Cubs in his next game on September 29. In his {{final game of the}} year on October 4, he pitched a scoreless inning in a 6–0 loss to Cincinnati. Hacker had no record, a 6.00 ERA, one strikeout, two <b>walks,</b> <b>and</b> three innings pitched in his three games with the Pirates. He was outrighted (sent to the minors and removed from the 40-man roster) on November 6, and he became a minor league free agent on November 9.|$|E

It was a dreadful thing to think of his sister's {{possible}} early departure from this world; but, after all, life is life, reality is reality, and business is business. He was Marietta's only legal heir.|$|R

5|$|In 1958, Lemon was {{the oldest}} Indian on the roster at age 37. Lemon pitched 3.1 innings over the span of two games before he {{was put on the}} Indians' {{disabled}} list and sent to the Triple-A San Diego Padres. There he continued physical conditioning and mentored the pitching staff of the Indians' top farm club. He appeared in 12 games with the Padres, going 2–5, with a 4.34 ERA, 22 <b>walks,</b> <b>and</b> 19 strikeouts. He returned to pitch for the Indians on May 25 in a relief role, but he appeared in only nine games that season. He earned just one decision that year, a loss, which brought his career pitching record to 207–128. The club put him on waivers in July.|$|E

Hacker missed the entire 2006 season after undergoing right shoulder surgery.|$|E
5|$|In February 1909, Potter went to Hill Top, where, kept indoors by the inclement weather, {{she worked}} {{diligently}} on the illustrations for The Flopsy Bunnies. Various gardens became the backgrounds for Peter Rabbit (Camfield Place, Lakefield, Lingholm, Tenby in South Wales, Bedwell Lodge, and Gwaeynynog), and Fawe Park in Keswick became the background for Benjamin Bunny, but the background for The Flopsy Bunnies was a semi-formal garden of archways, <b>walks,</b> <b>and</b> flowerbeds in Wales at Denbigh at the estate called Gwaeynynog. Gwaeynynog {{was the home}} of the Burtons, Potter's uncle and aunt, and, while on holiday in 1909, Potter sketched their walled garden, and, once at home, decided to move Peter and Benjamin and their families to Wales for another Peter Rabbit sequel. A number of her preliminary sketches still survive.|$|E
