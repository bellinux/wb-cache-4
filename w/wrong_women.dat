Bosch-Domènecha and colleagues (2014) further found not only did men outscore women on the CRT, but that greater exposure to prenatal androgens (via a lower 2D:4D ratio) is significantly correlated with a higher score on the cognitive reflection test regardless of sex. Several other studies have replicated these results and have found that men typically score higher than women on the CRT.|$|E

50|$|Costard is a comic {{figure in}} the play Love's Labour's Lost by William Shakespeare. A country bumpkin, he is arrested in the first scene for flouting the king's {{proclamation}} that all men of the court avoid the company of women for three years. While in custody, {{the men of the}} court use him to further their own romantic endeavors. By sending love notes to the <b>wrong</b> <b>women</b> and blurting out secrets (including that of an unplanned pregnancy), Costard makes fools of the royal court. Along with Moth the page and Jaquenetta, a country wench, Costard pokes fun at the upper-class. While mocking a pedantic schoolmaster, Costard uses the word honorificabilitudinitatibus, the longest word by far from any of Shakespeare's works.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the film}} Ganesha is {{depicted}} as a householder (...) with wives, sons, and a sister(Mansa:a goddess,known as mansa mata {tample at haridwaarand many places, } [...] As is common in North India his wives are depicted as Riddhi and Siddhi. His sons are depicted as Shubha and Labha. The boys are unhappy because they, unlike Ganesha, have no sister. But Ganesha is ambivalent about having another child. The boys and the women plead with Ganesha, and the sage Nārada convinces him that having a daughter would be good. Ganesha assents and from Riddhi and Siddhi emerges a flame that engenders Santoshī Mā. There is dispute over this, between various scholars, whether it is myth or not. Saying it as totally myth will also be totally <b>wrong.</b> <b>Women</b> in North India are a huge follower of Santoshi Maa and her main temple is situated in Lal Sagar, near Mandore, which is about 10 kilometres away from Jodhpur city.|$|E

Mitchener is shocked by the orderly's {{derogatory}} comments about the Prime Minister, but the orderly tells him that he wouldn't be in the army if it weren't for conscription, and now that he is, he trusts sergeants more than generals. Mitchener orders the orderly to arrest himself for insubordination. Mrs Banger and Lady Corinthia enter. They declare that the men have failed to defeat the suffragettes. New tactics are needed. Mrs Banger says that the suffragettes have got it all <b>wrong.</b> <b>Women</b> don't want to vote, they want to join the army. In fact most great leaders, including Bismarck and Napoleon, were women in disguise. Lady Corinthia, in contrast, believes that women should control men by using feminine glamour and charm. Giving votes to women will ensure that the ugly and dowdy ones will be as powerful as charming beauties such as herself, which is outrageous.|$|E

5000|$|We {{can imagine}} no {{recommendation}} {{for using the}} government to manipulate fertility {{that does not have}} dangers. But this highlights the problem: The United States already has policies that inadvertently social-engineer who has babies, and it is encouraging the <b>wrong</b> <b>women.</b> [...] "If the United States did as much to encourage high-IQ women to have babies as it now does to encourage low-IQ women, it would rightly be described as engaging in aggressive manipulation of fertility." [...] The technically precise description of America's fertility policy is that it subsidizes births among poor women, who are also disproportionately {{at the low end of}} the intelligence distribution. We urge generally that these policies, represented by the extensive network of cash and services for low-income women who have babies, be ended. The government should stop subsidizing births to anyone rich or poor. The other generic recommendation, as close to harmless as any government program we can imagine, is to make it easy for women to make good on their prior decision not to get pregnant by making available birth control mechanisms that are increasingly flexible, foolproof, inexpensive, and safe.|$|E
40|$|Financial Planning is {{required}} for all men and women, irrespective of their age, educational background, income level, socio-cultural affiliation and family status. However, financial planning is considered mandatory for women, while {{it is important for}} men. Women outlive men by 2 to 3 years in India. As per the 2011 census estimate, life expectancy at birth for men in India is 66 years against 68 years for women. On the average, women earn only 76 % of the amount earned by their male counterparts in the same profession. While men earn money uninterruptedly throughout their working life, women often need to take break, especially when they have children. Motherhood often interrupts their career. Many women leave their employment during early stage of their career for child birth / child care. Some of them return to work, while others do not. Those who come back to work often face the compulsion of starting their career all over again. As a result, their superannuation benefits (PF, Gratuity, Pension etc.) remain lower. Women tend to be more conservative investors than men, which often means their portfolios do not grow as quickly when they are young – a time when they should be investing aggressively. Women are more intimidated about financial issues than men. Because of low level of interest in money matters and fear of going <b>wrong,</b> <b>women</b> often allow men (father / brother / husband) to take financial decision on their behalf, but it has been observed that in nine out of ten cases they require to take suc...|$|E

40|$|This essay {{attempts}} to define Mary Wollstonecraft’s Mary: A Fiction and Maria or The <b>Wrongs</b> of <b>Woman</b> as early feminist propaganda from its historical perspective.

The conclusion reached is that Wollstonecraft had a political and feminist aim when writing her novels as there are many similarities between Mary: A Fiction and Maria or The <b>Wrongs</b> of <b>Woman</b> and her political text A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Thus, it is possible to regard Mary: A Fiction and Maria or The <b>Wrongs</b> of <b>Woman</b> as early feminist propaganda...|$|R

500|$|At {{the end of}} the Rights of Woman Wollstonecraft {{promised her}} readers a second part to the work. Rather than giving them another {{philosophical}} treatise, however, she offered them a novel tinged with autobiography, appropriately titled The <b>Wrongs</b> of <b>Woman.</b> In her [...] "Preface", she writes that the novel should be considered the story of [...] "woman" [...] and not the story of an [...] "individual". Wollstonecraft attempts to detail, as the scholar Anne K. Mellor has phrased it, [...] "the <b>wrongs</b> done to <b>women</b> and the <b>wrongs</b> done by women" [...] (emphasis Mellor's). The <b>wrongs</b> done to <b>women</b> include stifling and sexually repressed marriages, which Wollstonecraft describes using the language of slavery, while the <b>wrongs</b> done by <b>women</b> include a false sense of self-worth generated through the language of sensibility. Unlike Wollstonecraft's first novel, [...] (1788), The <b>Wrongs</b> of <b>Woman</b> offers solutions to these problems, namely an empowering female sexuality, a purpose-filled maternal role, and the possibility of a feminism that crosses class boundaries.|$|R
