Responses with very short interresponse times were not under stimulus control and there was some evidence of inhibitory control of short interresponse times. Interresponse-times-per-opportunity functions, plotted as a function of stimulus wavelength, showed that stimulus <b>wavelength</b> <b>controlled</b> the temporal distribution of responses, rather than the overall rate of response.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a high density {{wavelength division multiplexing}} (WDM) optical access network for broadband access networks. In the network, a wavelength is pre-assigned to each subscriber. Arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) are used at a central office and a remote node for wavelength multi/demultiplexers. We introduce a method to tune the wavelengths of transmitters in both the central office and the subscriber premises {{to the center of}} each assigned transmission spectrum of an access network. Using this method, we confirm experimentally the controllability of the wavelengths on four laser diodes in the access network which was composed of two subscribers. The 1 × 40 AWGs with 0. 8 nm spacing were used. The experimental results indicate the controllability of the wavelengths of transmitters within the deviation of ± 0. 25 nm {{from the center of the}} transmission spectrum of two AWGs. The wavelengths are controlled during the environmental temperature of the AWG in the remote node varies within the range of ± 20 ℃. The temperature range of ± 20 ℃ is not enough for practical use. So as to minimize the temperature change of AWG, we propose a WDM access network which utilizes an athermal AWG in the remote node. The perfect temperature compensation of the athermal AWG is not necessarily required because the <b>wavelength</b> <b>control</b> system already exists. This results in the cost reduction of the athermal AWG. We study the <b>wavelength</b> <b>control</b> using cost-effective one-board-computer instead of the measurement server...|$|E
