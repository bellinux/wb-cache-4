40|$|The {{decision-making}} literature contains considerable {{information about}} how humans approach tasks involving uncertainty using heuristics. Although there is some {{reason to believe that}} <b>weather</b> <b>forecasters</b> are not identical in all respects to the typical subjects used in judgment and decision-making studies, there also is evidence that <b>weather</b> <b>forecasters</b> are not so different that the existing understanding of human cognition as it relates to making decisions is entirely inapplicable to <b>weather</b> <b>forecasters.</b> Accordingly, some aspects of cognition and decision making are reviewed and considered in terms of how they apply to human <b>weather</b> <b>forecasters,</b> including biases introduced by heuristics. Considerable insight into human forecasting could be gained by applying available studies of the cognitive psychology of decision making. What few studies exist that have used <b>weather</b> <b>forecasters</b> as subjects suggest that further work might well be productive in terms of helping to guide the improvement of weather forecasts by humans. It is concluded that a multidisciplinary approach, involving disciplines outside of meteorology, needs to be developed and supported {{if there is to be}} a future role for humans in forecasting the weather. 1...|$|R

25|$|In 1963, WISH-TV {{became the}} first {{television}} station in the market to provide extensive live coverage of a major local news event, when it covered the deadly explosion at the Fairgrounds Coliseum. WISH-TV's newscasts were the highest-rated in the Indianapolis market from the mid-1980s until WTHR overtook it for the #1 position in 2002. The station's ratings success was largely attributed to the longevity of most of its news staff, {{some of whom have}} been at the station for over 20 years. Mike Ahern was the station's main weeknight news anchor as well as the de facto face of its newsroom for more than 30 years (the longest tenure of anyone in Indianapolis television history); he joined channel 8 as a reporter in 1967 and was promoted to lead anchor in 1974, where he remained until his retirement from the anchor chair on December 1, 2004 (Ahern later hosted sister station WNDY's now-cancelled interview program One on One). Debby Knox joined Ahern as co-anchor on the weeknight newscasts in 1980 and remained with the station until she retired on November 26, 2013. Stan Wood served as the station's main <b>weather</b> <b>forecaster</b> from the 1960s until 1991, while Patty Spitler served as anchor of the noon newscast and entertainment reporter from 1982 to 2004.

2500|$|Task Review: Renaissance {{created a}} brand [...] "I ♥ my tissues" [...] that {{included}} a smart aesthetic design for their tissue box, with Claire providing a professional presentation to the executives. However, while Michael and Raef directed their TV advert well and even hired <b>weather</b> <b>forecaster</b> Siân Lloyd to appear, it was found to run for too long, and led {{to most of the}} material showing the product itself being removed in order while it was being brought down to the required length. Meanwhile, Alpha created a brand called [...] "Atishu!", but both their tissue box design and advert were deemed relatively poor, with Lee being ill-prepared for the team's presentation. Despite these issues, their brand name was praised, with their advert and campaign being deemed as attention-grabbing and giving a clear message about the product, effectively earning them victory.|$|E
