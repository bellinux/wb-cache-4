Although approached to join BBC Films some years before, only in 2007 did she feel it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> [...] "concentrate more exclusively on film". She immediately began overseeing editing work on The Other Boleyn Girl, which was already in post-production. She also began developing The Damned United, a film based on David Peace's novel that fictionalised the 44 days Brian Clough managed Leeds United F.C. in 1974. The film was adapted by Peter Morgan, executive produced by Andy Harries, and starred Michael Sheen as Clough. On why she continues to work with the same people on her projects, Langan said, [...] "The reason I return to working with the same people is that you have invested time, energy and thought and care into these relationships and that can pay dividends—The Queen is an example of those relationships paying dividends".|$|E

500|$|With no {{heir to the}} throne, Satyavati asked Bhishma {{to marry}} the widows of Vichitravirya (following the {{practice}} of niyoga in its narrower sense, as a levirate marriage) and rule as king. Bhishma refused, reminding Satyavati of the promise he made to her father and his vow of bachelorhood. He suggests [...] that a Brahmin could be hired to father children on the widows, thus preserving the dynasty. Revealing to Bhishma the tale of her encounter with Parashara, Satyavati well knew that this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> call her son Vyasa to aid her. Satyavati coaxed Vyasa to have niyoga with his brother's widows, saying: [...] "from affection for thy brother Vichitravirya, for the perpetuation of our dynasty, {{for the sake of}} this Bhishma's request and my command, for kindness to all creatures, {{for the protection of the}} people and from the liberality of thy heart, O sinless one, it behooveth thee to do what I say." [...] After convincing Vyasa, Satyavati managed ( [...] with great difficulty) to obtain the consent of her [...] "virtuous" [...] daughters-in-law. In the Mahabharata, Vyasa agreed immediately to the niyoga. In the Devi Bhagavata Purana version, Vyasa initially refused Satyavati's proposal. He argued that Vichitravirya's wives were like his daughters; having niyoga with them was a heinous sin, through which no good could come. As a master of [...] "realpolitik", the hungry-for-grandsons Satyavati asserted that to preserve the dynasty, wrong directives by elders should be followed if they are going to reduce the sorrow of a mother. Vyasa finally agreed to that [...] "disgusting task", but suggested that offspring of perversity cannot be a source of joy.|$|E

On his arrival at Getares, Pero de Montada {{informed}} the king that he had intercepted several ships carrying food to the city, and that the galleys of Portugal and Genoa had engaged eighty Moorish galleys in combat, captured twenty-six of them and forced the others to take refuge in African ports. According to the Castilian knights, this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> encircle the city, since it should have limited supplies.
