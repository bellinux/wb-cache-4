5|$|In 2005, Strickland {{garnered}} positive critical {{comment for}} the romantic comedy Fever Pitch, and in 2007, {{she was a}} cast regular in the television show The Wedding Bells and subsequently {{was added to the}} cast of Private Practice. Strickland has spoken against the emphasis placed on beauty in the Los Angeles acting community, in <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> her Southern U.S. background has helped to distinguish herself from other blonde-haired actors. She has spoken of an affinity for her strong female characters and a desire to avoid sexualizing or sensationalizing her self-presentation as a woman. She also has worked closely with the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) after participating in a storyline in which her Private Practice character Charlotte King was raped.|$|E

25|$|Zsa Zsa {{also appears}} in extra content on the {{official}} EastEnders: E20 website. The first is a video of her writing a text message to her mother, in <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> goodbye and that she is sick of trying to mend their relationship. However, she saves the message without sending it. Another video shows Leon filming Zsa Zsa as they mess around with their camera phones, ending with a kiss. Zsa Zsa also makes a cameo appearance in series 2 of EastEnders: E20. In the first episode, she insults Naz Mehmet (Emaa Hussen), who insults her back, before stealing some of Fatboy's money and running away.|$|E
25|$|The , dark-blue, extra-long twin {{mattress}} used in {{the performance}} art piece is of the kind Columbia places in its dorms, {{similar to the one}} on which she alleges she was raped. Sulkowicz spent the summer of 2014 creating the rules of engagement: Written on the walls of her studio in the university's Watson Hall, these state that she must carry the mattress whenever she is on university property; that it must remain on campus even when Sulkowicz is not there; and that she is not allowed to ask for help in carrying it, but if help is offered she may accept it. In September that year she began carrying it on campus, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> is a physically painful experience.|$|E
25|$|On December 21, 2015, Cosby sued supermodel Beverly Johnson for defamation, {{claiming}} {{that she told}} a false story in a Vanity Fair article. This {{was the first time}} Cosby had sued a woman who has claimed assault without being sued himself first. Cosby's lawsuit accuses Johnson of lying about the incident in <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> Cosby spiked a cup of cappuccino with an unknown drug. Realizing what was happening, Johnson said she screamed and cursed at him several times before Cosby dragged her out and hailed a cab for her. (No sexual contact by Cosby was alleged in Johnson's version of the event.) Allegedly, she also repeated the story in subsequent interviews and in her memoirs, released on August 25, 2015.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, at home, Michael's {{parents are}} {{concerned}} about their son's behavior, but Corey passes it off as nothing despite also being worried about him.

However, Pooh tries to reason with her.|$|R
6000|$|She was too childish to have learnt this as {{a matter}} of good breeding, but she might have learnt it of a certain parable, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> could <b>say</b> from {{beginning}} to end, that she should [...] "sit not down in the highest room." ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{began to}} regain {{strength}} and the doctors pronounced me fit to leave the sick-room, she began to display signs of uneasiness, and often looked at me in a singular kind of way, as though there were something <b>which</b> <b>she</b> would <b>say</b> to me.|$|R
25|$|Magda and Ruggero {{have been}} living {{together}} on the French Riviera for some months. They talk about their first meeting and happiness together, living quietly by the sea. Ruggero tells Magda that he has written to his mother to ask for money to pay their growing debts and for her consent to his marriage to Magda. Ruggero imagines their happy married life and the child they may have (Aria: Dimmi che vuoi seguirmi). Magda is deeply touched, but also uneasy: she knows that her past life as a courtesan would make her unacceptable to Ruggero's family, and possibly to Ruggero if he knew who she really was. As Ruggero leaves to post his letter she meditates on her dilemma, torn between her desire to tell Ruggero everything, her wish not to hurt him and her fear of losing his love. Prunier and Lisette arrive. Lisette has had a brief and disastrous career as a music-hall singer: her performance in Nice the previous evening was a catastrophe. She and Prunier bicker with each other while waiting for Magda. When Magda appears, Lisette begs for her job back, and Magda consents. Prunier expresses surprise that Magda can be happy away from Paris, and delivers a message to Magda from Rambaldo: he is happy to take her back on any terms. Magda refuses to listen. Prunier takes his leave of Lisette (first arranging a rendezvous with her for that evening) and Lisette resumes her duties as Magda's maid. Ruggero returns with a letter from his mother, in <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> that if Ruggero's fiancée has all the virtues he has described to her, {{he will have a}} blissful marriage. She looks forward to welcoming the couple to her home and sends Magda a kiss. Magda is unable to keep her secret any longer. She tells Ruggero about her past and declares that she can never be his wife – she would cause his parents too much grief. Ruggero implores Magda not to abandon him (Ma come puoi lasciarmi), but Magda is adamant that they cannot remain together, and that Ruggero must return home. Like a swallow, she flies back to Rambaldo and her old life, leaving Ruggero behind, devastated.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} made using {{hand-drawn}} traditional animation, with pencil on paper, and then scanned and digitally coloured, with {{about half of}} the animation by Kove, and the rest divided between animators in Montreal and Norway. Kove's style is simplistic, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> is less a specific style choice than [...] "quite simply [...] the only one I know how to do." [...] The backgrounds were painted by Montreal artist Anne Ashton.|$|E
500|$|Glover {{was born}} on 8 February 1983 in St Helens, Merseyside, England. [...] She had a troubled childhood. She grew up partly in St Helens with her father's family, partly in Great Yarmouth with her mother's, and partly in foster care, <b>which,</b> <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> led to her being bullied and made her a very shy and quiet child. She changed homes and schools many times. At age 15, she was {{released}} from foster care, and got her own apartment.|$|E
6000|$|The {{women were}} very indignant,--all except Miss Furnival, {{who did not}} say much, but endeavoured to {{palliate}} the crimes of Lady Mason in that <b>which</b> <b>she</b> did <b>say.</b> [...] "I {{do not know that}} she is more to blame than any other lady who marries a gentleman thirty years older than herself." ...|$|R

500|$|Marge's raspy {{voice is}} only {{slightly}} different from Kavner's, who has a [...] "honeyed gravel voice" [...] <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> is due to [...] "a bump on [...] vocal cords." [...] While Marge is her most famous character, Kavner's favorite characters to voice are Patty and Selma because [...] "they're really funny and sad at the same time." [...] In The Simpsons Movie, some scenes, such as Marge's video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving Kavner exhausted.|$|E
500|$|The Vršac {{triptych}} {{comes across}} as a large-scale contemporary genre painting to the untrained eye. Drawing parallels with Jovanović's earlier Orientalist works, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> provide [...] "responses and commentaries", Filipovitch-Robinson notes that the triptych is far from a simple vignette of everyday life. In describing it as a [...] "type of history painting", she argues that it was intended as more than a mere documentary piece. Jovanović's decision to use the triptych format would have been highly unusual otherwise.|$|E
500|$|Elaine Jill Bickerstaff {{was born}} and raised in Barnet, Hertfordshire, where her father worked as an estate agent and her mother was a milliner. Her mother had been a singer in her youth, and her father was an amateur drummer. Paige stands at just under 5feet (1.5m) tall, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> has caused her to lose out on leading roles. Her {{original}} ambition was to become a professional tennis player, at which point her headmistress pointed out to her [...] "they'd never see you over the net", but Paige continued to play tennis and has referred to the sport as one of her passions.|$|E
50|$|She {{made her}} film {{debut in the}} 2014 romantic comedy Na Maloom Afraad {{opposite}} Fahad Mustafa, Mohsin Abbas Haider and Javed Sheikh.

500|$|Ferreira later began {{maintaining}} a Myspace profile where she uploaded demo versions of self-written tracks. Shortly before her 15th birthday, {{she wrote a}} letter to producers Bloodshy & Avant requesting that they offer a recording contract to her, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> happened [...] "kind of right off the bat" [...] after they came across her profile. In 2009, she was signed to Parlophone, and began finalizing the debut studio album that she says was first begun when she was 14 years old. In 2010, she ventured into the film and modelling industries after starring in the independent film Putty Hill and appearing in the magazines Dazed and Interview.|$|E
500|$|Angelou chose [...] "Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie" [...] as the volume's title {{because of}} her {{interest}} in unconscious innocence, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> is [...] "even lovelier than trying to remain innocent." [...] The title is a reference to her belief that [...] "we as individuals... are still so innocent that we think if we asked our murderer just before he puts the final wrench upon the throat, 'Would you please give me a cool drink of water?' and he would do so'". [...] Angelou has said that if she [...] "didn't believe that, [...] wouldn't {{get up in the}} morning".|$|E
500|$|As an infant, Stone had baby colic {{and cried}} frequently; she {{consequently}} developed nodules and calluses on her vocal cords {{while she was}} a child. Stone has described herself as having been [...] "loud" [...] and [...] "bossy" [...] while growing up. She was educated at Sequoya Elementary School and attended Cocopah Middle School for the sixth grade. Although {{she did not like}} school, she has stated that her controlling nature meant that [...] "I made sure I got all As". Stone suffered panic attacks as a child, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> caused a decline in her social skills. She underwent therapy but states that it was her participation in local theater plays that helped cure the attacks.|$|E
500|$|Leicester was buried, {{as he had}} requested, in the Beauchamp Chapel of the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick—in {{the same}} chapel as Richard Beauchamp, his ancestor, and the [...] "noble Impe", his little son.

5000|$|Drawing on Buck's {{abortion}} stance, the Independent {{also points}} out that [...] "The suspect in this case had claimed that the victim had at one point a year or so before this event become pregnant with his child and had an abortion, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> denies, <b>saying</b> <b>she</b> miscarried. The suspect’s claim, though, is in the police report, and Buck refers to it as a reason she may be motivated to file charges where he thinks none are warranted." ...|$|R

500|$|According to McKinley biographer Margaret Leech, McKinley's {{apparent}} recovery [...] "was {{merely the}} resistance of his strong body to the gangrene that was creeping along the bullet's track through the stomach, the pancreas, and one kidney". [...] Another X-ray machine was sent from New Jersey by its inventor, Thomas Edison. [...] It was not used on the President; sources vary on why this was—Leech stated that the machine, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> was procured by Cortelyou and accompanied by a trained operator, was not used on orders of the doctors in charge of McKinley's case. [...] Miller recounts that doctors attempted to test it on a man of about McKinley's size, but {{it proved to be}} missing a crucial part, much to Edison's embarrassment.|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{has said}} that her teenage years were unhappy. Her home life was {{complicated}} by her mother's illness and a strained relationship with her father, with whom she is not on speaking terms. Rowling later said that she based the character of Hermione Granger on herself when she was eleven. Steve Eddy, her first secondary school English teacher, remembers her as [...] "not exceptional" [...] but [...] "one {{of a group of}} girls who were bright, and quite good at English". Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth, owned a turquoise Ford Anglia <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> inspired a flying version that appeared in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. At this time, she listened to the Smiths and the Clash. Rowling took A-levels in English, French and German, achieving two As and a B and was Head Girl.|$|E
500|$|Ari Graynor plays Caroline, Norah's best friend. Graynor {{auditioned for}} {{the roles of}} both Norah and Caroline, and was chosen to play Caroline, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> rescued her from [...] "one of those horrible actor black holes of really {{thinking}} that I'd probably never work again". Graynor related to both characters, saying that [...] "I've had many nights as Caroline. And I've had many nights as Norah, taking care of Caroline." [...] Sollett claimed that [...] "everything she did in the movie was her own invention", calling her improvisation [...] "brilliant". She improvised an entire scene taking place at the Port Authority Bus Station in which Caroline talks to a stranger and which {{was not part of}} the script. When Caroline vomits, Graynor held a mixture of ginger ale and ginger cookie in her mouth which she spat into a toilet and a bag.|$|E
60|$|As usual {{she seemed}} to reserve {{something}} <b>which</b> <b>she</b> did not <b>say,</b> and Terence was conscious that they disagreed, and, without saying it aloud, were arguing against each other. But she was too hurried and pre-occupied to talk.|$|R

50|$|A drunken spat over a bell Yumiko {{had given}} Ikuo {{just before he}} died causes Yumiko and Tamio to discuss their strong {{emotions}} for their lost loves. Shortly after, Yumiko follows a funeral procession and lingers at the crematorium, until Tamio arrives by car to pick her up, at <b>which</b> point <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> just {{wants to know why}} Ikuo killed himself. Tamio suggests that, like the will o' the wisps his father used to see, perhaps something just drew him away from life.|$|R
