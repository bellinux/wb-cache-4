5|$|The koala is {{classified}} with <b>wombats</b> (family Vombatidae) and several extinct families (including marsupial tapirs, marsupial lions and giant <b>wombats)</b> in the suborder Vombatiformes within the order Diprotodontia. The Vombatiformes are a sister group to a clade that includes macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) and possums. The ancestors of vombatiforms were likely arboreal, and the koala's lineage was possibly {{the first to}} branch off around 40 million years ago during the Eocene.|$|E
5|$|The dentary superficially {{resembles that}} of various other {{mammalian}} groups with enlarged incisors, such as rodents, lagomorphs, hyraxes, <b>wombats,</b> the aye-aye, and the extinct apatemyids, tillodonts, and taeniodontsall of which are known only from the Cenozoic, less than 66 million years ago. Krause and colleagues could not exclude the possibility that TNM02067 represents an early member of such a group or an otherwise unknown major group of mammals. However, only two groups of Mesozoic mammals resemble TNM02067: gondwanatheres; and multituberculates in the superfamilies Djadochtatherioidea and Taeniolabidoidea. Djadochtatherioids and taeniolabidoids occur in the late Cretaceous through Paleogene of the northern continents (Laurasia), and gondwanatheres, an enigmatic group of uncertain evolutionary affinities, are known from the late Cretaceous through Paleogene of Gondwana, with forms such as Gondwanatherium, Sudamerica (both from Argentina), Lavanify (Madagascar), and Bharattherium (India).|$|E
25|$|<b>Wombats</b> {{have been}} {{considered}} as agricultural pests by landholders. Their digging can destroy crops and can {{increase the risk of}} livestock breaking their legs by falling though their burrow systems. Competition between livestock, rabbits, and <b>wombats</b> can lead to overgrazing. Overgrazing and the spread of invasive weeds in some areas has led to the flora being dominated by annual grass and weed species, from which <b>wombats</b> cannot get enough of their metabolic needs, resulting in reports of emaciation and mass starvation. The competition from introduced rabbits threatens the survival of <b>wombats.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} hairy-nosed <b>wombat</b> shares its genus {{with one}} other extant species, the southern hairy-nosed <b>wombat,</b> while the common <b>wombat</b> {{is in the}} genus Vombatus. Both Lasiorhinus species differ morphologically from the common <b>wombat</b> by their silkier fur, broader hairy noses, and longer ears.|$|R

25|$|Southern hairy-nosed <b>wombats</b> use vocalisations and scents for {{communication}}. While most {{communication between}} <b>wombats</b> occurs through olfaction and scent-marking, {{as they do}} not often encounter each other directly, they emit rough, coughing noises when they pass each other, and emit a more strident call for alarm.|$|E
25|$|Southern hairy-nosed <b>wombats</b> range though Western Australia, {{southern}} South Australia, and south-western New South Wales. They live in semiarid to arid grasslands and woodlands.|$|E
25|$|Herbivorous {{marsupials}} {{are classified}} in the order Diprotodontia, and further into the suborders Vombatiformes and Phalangerida. The Vombatiformes include the koala and the three species of wombat. One of Australia's best-known marsupials, the koala is an arboreal species that feeds on the leaves of various species of eucalyptus. <b>Wombats,</b> on the other hand, live {{on the ground and}} feed on grasses, sedges and roots. <b>Wombats</b> use their rodent-like front teeth and powerful claws to dig extensive burrow systems; they are mainly crepuscular and nocturnal.|$|E

25|$|The Australian High Country is {{populated}} by unique {{flora and fauna}} including <b>wombats,</b> wallabies, echidnas, and the Snow Gum. The Alpine regions are subject to environmental protection, which has limited the scope of commercial development of skiiable terrain, however Australia has extensive cross country skiing terrain.|$|E
25|$|Echidnas do not {{tolerate}} extreme temperatures; they use caves and rock crevices to shelter from harsh weather conditions. Echidnas {{are found in}} forests and woodlands, hiding under vegetation, roots or piles of debris. They sometimes use the burrows of animals such as rabbits and <b>wombats.</b> Individual echidnas have large, mutually overlapping territories.|$|E

25|$|The mother {{develops}} {{a kind of}} yolk sack in her womb that delivers nutrients to the embryo.

25|$|The {{national}} park protects {{part of the}} northern end of the Australian Alps with its spectacular granite mountains. Its habitat ranges from grassy plains over snow gum forests to alpine meadows. The fauna is also varied: eastern grey kangaroos, wallabies, <b>wombats,</b> magpies, rosellas and ravens are commonly seen. The water catchment area of the park supplies approximately 85% of Canberra's water.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) is one {{of three}} extant species of <b>wombats.</b> It is found in scattered areas of semiarid scrub and mallee from the eastern Nullarbor Plain to the New South Wales border area.

25|$|Southern hairy-nosed <b>wombats,</b> {{along with}} other wombat species, select native {{perennial}} grasses and sedges, but do consume introduced pasture species, forbs, and the leaves of woody shrubs if their favoured food is not available. Much of the southern hairy-nosed wombat's diet is Stipa nitida, which grows around its warren complex and is trimmed as it grazes. This creates an area with a higher density of new green shoots, a sign of delayed growth of individual grass. The teeth of the wombat are more effective in grinding food into small particles than the western grey kangaroo. Its digestive tract has a tiny caecum and a colon divided into parts. The anterior part is relatively small and serves as the site for fermentation, while the posterior part is larger and is where water is reabsorbed. The wombat conserves water by recycling more urea to the colon rather than releasing it as urine. <b>Wombats</b> release less than other herbivorous mammals. As such, the southern hairy-nosed wombat produces very dry faeces, with water contents as low as 40%.|$|E

25|$|The harsh {{environment}} in which the southern hairy-nosed wombat lives is further reflected in its energetics. In captivity, their standard metabolic rate was found to be 130 kl/kg^0.75 per day, which is very low compared to most placental animals and other marsupials. They also have the lowest thyroid hormone levels among mammals. The food <b>wombats</b> eat provides more than enough energy. As long as enough food is available, the forage consumed by the wombat can support it during late lactation. It is more effective than a donkey at maintaining its weight on low-quality food.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} hairy-nosed <b>wombat</b> {{is adapted}} to digging; it has a stocky and robust build, flattened claws, and five digits. It is also plantigrade. The body length ranges from 772 to 934 mm with a body mass ranging from 19 to 32 kg. Its short tail is hidden by its fur. The pelage is silky and is typically greyish or tan in colour. The <b>wombat</b> grooms itself with its second and third toes, which are fused together, except at the tips. The head is robust and flattened and the ears are pointed. The snout resembles that of a pig.

40|$|A {{significant}} portion of the evolution of Linked Data datasets lies in updating the links to other datasets. An important challenge when aiming to update these links automatically under the open-world assumption is the fact that usually only positive examples for the links exist. We address this challenge by presenting and evaluating <b>Wombat,</b> a novel approach for the discovery of links between knowledge bases that relies exclusively on positive examples. <b>Wombat</b> is based on generalisation via an upward refinement operator to traverse the space of link specification. We study the theoretical characteristics of <b>Wombat</b> and evaluate it on 8 different benchmark datasets. Our evaluation suggests that <b>Wombat</b> outperforms state-of-the-art supervised approaches while relying on less information. Moreover, our evaluation suggests that <b>Wombat’s</b> pruning algorithm allows it to scale well even on large datasets...|$|R
