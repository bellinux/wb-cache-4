5000|$|New [...] "Area of Recruitment" [...] {{gameplay}} mechanic. In Rome, {{there was}} virtually no restriction on the units a faction could train {{in a given}} province: for example, Carthage could train exactly the same units in their capital city of Carthage as they could in their distant colonies in Spain. The exceptions were that Roman First Cohorts could only <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in Rome; Spartan hoplites could only <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in Sparta or Syracuse; and elephant and camel units could only <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in provinces that have those animals as resources. In RTR, the units that can <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in a province depend {{in large part on}} the province itself. Gallic infantry, for instance, can only <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in Gaul, but can <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> there by any faction which controls it. Still, all factions do have their own typical units that can <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in any of their territories once the appropriate buildings have been constructed.|$|R
