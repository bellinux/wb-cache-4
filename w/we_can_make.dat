He called for stakeholders in the health sector to collaborate enable the ministry achieve Buhari's health agenda. According to The Nation, Adewole said for the apex policy on health to be achieved, {{we need to work}} together and working together means <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a huge difference. We have been described as a generation that enjoyed better health when we were young than now and our aim is to bring back the health care system we enjoyed when we were young.|$|E

But <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> machines to do this work. We should then innovate in those areas where we don't yet {{know how to make}} the machine to do the work. Production should be one of collective learning and permanent innovation.|$|E

The band relocated to Nashville in 2001 and released three EPs including: For All the Drifters (2001), <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Make</b> Mistakes EP (2003), and Drifter EP (2004). The group disbanded in 2004 and Paper Route was formed two years later.|$|E

In a paradoxical way, Schumann's superficial characterization of the G minor Symphony can help us to see Mozart's daemon more steadily. In all of Mozart's supreme expressions of suffering and terror, there is something shockingly voluptuous.|$|E
25|$|Harmonic {{functions}} {{that arise in}} physics are determined by their singularities and boundary conditions (such as Dirichlet boundary conditions or Neumann boundary conditions). On regions without boundaries, adding the real or imaginary part of any entire function will produce a harmonic function with the same singularity, so {{in this case the}} harmonic function is not determined by its singularities; however, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> the solution unique in physical situations by requiring that the solution goes to 0 as you go to infinity. In this case, uniqueness follows by Liouville's theorem.|$|E

25|$|Zoroaster {{emphasized}} {{the freedom of}} the individual to choose right or wrong and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This personal choice to accept aša, or arta (the divine order), and shun druj (ignorance and chaos) is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zarathustra, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy or doing good works) we increase this divine force aša or arta in the world and in ourselves, celebrate the divine order, and we come a step closer on the everlasting road to being one with the Creator. Thus, we are not the slaves or servants of Ahura Mazda, but <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a personal choice to be his co-workers, thereby refreshing the world and ourselves.|$|E

500|$|A second crisis arose on 30 July 1832. A {{constitutional}} amendment effecting greater reforms was voted on and approved in the Chamber of Deputies, but still faced major {{opposition in the}} Senate. Diogo Antônio Feijó and Aureliano Coutinho, both Moderates, planned a coup d'état. Feijó would assume dictatorial powers and immediately enact the {{constitutional amendment}}, thus bypassing the Senate entirely. Honório Hermeto called on his fellow deputies to uphold the Constitution: [...] "We need not hurt the legal order and [...] principles: <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> fair laws ... and in the respected Constitution we have safe and legal ways of giving the nation what it wants... let us not violate it , as it is our only safeguard." [...] He rallied the deputies to his view, and in defeating the unconstitutional proposal, the coup attempt was crushed.|$|E
500|$|It {{has also}} been argued that the {{methodology}} used by modern Egyptologists to translate ancient records is unreliable and unstable, and therefore produces flawed and nonsensical translations. Thus, the modern translations of the Joseph Smith Papyri as produced by Egyptologists {{are not to be}} trusted. This line of thinking was used by Nibley in his 1975 book, The Message of the Joseph Smith Papyri. He wrote: [...] "To the often asked question, 'Have the Joseph Smith Papyri been translated?' The answer is an emphatic no! What, then, is the foregoing? A mechanical transcription, no more [...] What we have is a transmission rather than a translation of the text [...] Though as correct and literal as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it, the translation in the preceding chapter is not a translation.

Just as Rosa struggles to find her place as a white in the anti-apartheid liberation movement, so did Gordimer. In an interview in 1980, she said that [...] "when we have got beyond the apartheid situation—there's a tremendous problem for whites, unless whites are allowed in by blacks, and unless <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> out a case for our being accepted and we can forge a common culture together, whites are going to be marginal".|$|E
