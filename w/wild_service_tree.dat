5|$|The south part of {{the woods}} {{is an area of}} former pasture {{woodland}} with old pollards, mainly oak and some small-leaved lime. To the north, the area comprises ancient woodland of old coppice with standards and contains a rich variety of trees. Rare trees include Bristol whitebeam (Sorbus bristoliensis) and <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>tree</b> (Sorbus torminalis). There are multiple species of Sorbus within the woods with at least nine native and four imported species, {{making it one of the}} most important sites in Britain for this tree. Birds which live in the woods include the raven (Corvus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). Many butterflies and moths can be seen in summer including the white-letter hairstreak (Satyrium w-album).|$|E
500|$|To {{the north}} of the river bank {{northwest}} of Langport are the Aller and Beer Woods and Aller Hill biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Aller and Beer Woods is a Somerset Wildlife Trust reserve. It consists of large blocks of semi-natural ancient woodland along the west-facing slope of Aller Hill, overlooking King's Sedgemoor. The reserve is about [...] and the underlying geology of most of it is Lias limestone. Prior to the 20thcentury it appears to have been managed for centuries as traditional coppice woodland, and it provides an outstanding example of ancient escarpment woodland. The woodland is a variant of the calcareous ash/wych elm stand-type, with pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) the dominant canopy trees throughout, and with scattered concentrations of wych elm (Ulmus glabra). Ancient woodland indicators include small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata), and <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>tree</b> (Sorbus torminalis), both of which are locally common. Plants of particular interest include bird's nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis), greater butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha) and the very rare Red Data Book species purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum). Aller Hill contains three species of plant which are nationally rare and a further three which are of restricted distribution in Somerset. The central area contains a sward dominated by sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) in combination with yellow oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) and quaking-grass (Briza media). Salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor) forms a major component of the sward with the two nationally rare species rough marsh-mallow (Althaea hirsuta) and nit-grass (Gastridium ventricosum), also present.|$|E
50|$|The main {{trees in}} this wood are ash and field maple, {{but there are}} also several <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>trees.</b> Spring flowers include bluebells, wood anemones and yellow archangels, and there are birds such as fieldfares and nightingales.|$|R
50|$|These are diverse mature woods, {{described}} by Natural England as of national {{importance for the}} comparisons which can be made between them. There are several <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>trees,</b> and the ground flora is rich and typical of ancient woodland.|$|R
50|$|Pedunculate oak is {{the main}} canopy tree, {{together}} with sessile oak, hornbeam and wild cherry. It also contains an unusually large population of <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>trees,</b> while the undergrowth is dominated by bramble and ivy, with many bluebells. Breeding birds include tawny owl, nuthatch and treecreeper.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>tree</b> favours deep fertile soils, but can {{tolerate}} {{a wide range}} of soil conditions, from chalky, superficial, dry soils to temporarily waterlogged soils. It can adapt to a variety of climatic conditions, but occurs most often in lowlands. <b>Wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>tree</b> is a light-demanding species, often out-competed by other hardwood species.|$|E
50|$|Predominantly an oak, {{hornbeam}} and holly wood, Highgate Wood is {{also home}} to more than 50 other tree and shrub species which have self-seeded there. The <b>Wild</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Tree,</b> a rare deciduous tree with brown berries, can be found in Highgate Wood. Presence of the <b>Wild</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Tree</b> is commonly taken as an indicator of ancient woodland.|$|E
50|$|It did {{not exist}} before the last Ice Age, {{probably}} arising from a hybrid between the <b>Wild</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Tree</b> and another Whitebeam.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{an ancient}} {{semi-natural}} wood on acid soil. It is of two types, both unusual habitats, pedunculate oak/hornbeam and sessile oak/hornbeam. <b>Wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>trees</b> and elders {{are found in the}} shrub layer, and a pond has a raised sphagnum bog. Twenty species of butterfly have been recorded.|$|R
50|$|The area {{within and}} around the fort is now {{completely}} wooded, although in Iron Age times {{it would have been}} cleared of trees to enable a better field of view, and for agriculture. This has been suggested by evidence of <b>Wild</b> <b>Service</b> <b>trees,</b> which are an indicator of regrown forest.|$|R
50|$|The {{steep hill}} is wooded with open {{grassland}} at the top. The site has many ancient trees, {{but the main}} ones are hybrid black-poplar and London plane, the result of former landscaping. There are also <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>trees</b> and midland hawthorns. The ground flora includes bluebells, heath grass and compact rush.|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} lane {{at the old}} {{raised beach}} has an unusual planting in the hedgerow of several common whitebeam x <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>tree</b> hybrids.|$|E
5000|$|Chequers {{from the}} <b>Wild</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Tree</b> or [...] "Chequer(s) Tree", {{the fruit of}} which was used to flavour beer before the {{introduction}} of hops.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} ancient {{woodland}}, and woodland flower species, while trees include the <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>tree.</b> Plant species include welted thistle, hairy violet, pepper saxifrage and adders tongue fern.|$|E
50|$|This wood is ash {{and maple}} on heavy clay soils, {{with much of}} it being ancient and having diverse flora and fauna as a result. Another area, which was {{probably}} cultivated until around 1350, has medieval ridge and furrow. It {{has a number of}} <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>trees,</b> which are uncommon and an indicator of ancient woodland.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{an ancient}} woodland, {{dominated}} by pedunculate oak, hornbeam and ash. A shrub layer includes hawthorns, field maples and <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>trees,</b> and among the ground flora are bluebells and wood anemones. Breeding birds include tawny owls, nuthatches, tree creepers and stock doves. A small stream flows through the wood to join Pymme's Brook, {{which is also a}} Site of Importance for Nature Conservation, in the neighbouring Oak Hill Park.|$|R
5|$|The Frome valley {{supports}} {{a range of}} wildlife and plants, passing through or near {{to a number of}} nature reserves and parks, including Goose Green fields, Chill Wood, Cleeve Valley, Oldbury Court park and Eastville Park. Notable species include grey wagtails, <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>trees,</b> dippers and several species of bats. One of the last British populations of the endangered native white-clawed crayfish in the Bristol area was found in the river, but became extinct in 2008.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{this site}} is ancient woodland, with some old {{secondary}} woodland. Trees include sweet chestnut, aspen and the <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>tree.</b> There {{are a number}} of dells and ponds.|$|E
5000|$|The tree is {{of hybrid}} origin, between Sorbus torminalis (<b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>tree)</b> {{and a member}} of the Sorbus aria (whitebeam) group, but it {{exhibits}} apomixis and breeds true from seed.|$|E
50|$|The main {{species of}} trees in the woods include English oak, sessile oak, hornbeam, beech, silver birch, <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>tree,</b> aspen, rowan, field maple, crack willow, wild cherry, hazel and holly.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} many old and over-mature trees, and {{extensive}} dead wood {{which provides a}} habitat for invertebrates, including the nationally rare jewel beetle Agrilus pannonicus. This type of canopy is uncommon nationally and very scarce in Greater London. The main trees are sessile oak and beech, with a few pedunculate oaks and <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>trees.</b> The shrub layer is dominated by holly and rowan. Next to Ken Wood is a small valley which has soft-rush, six sphagnum species and water horsetail.|$|R
50|$|Southwick Wood is now {{a nature}} reserve managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. It has an area of 56 acre. Many {{suckering}} elms were lost to Dutch elm disease in the late 1960s, and {{have been replaced by}} Wild Cherry. Other trees include Ash, Oak and Field Maple, together with <b>Wild</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Trees</b> no longer producing viable seed, which is an indicator of antiquity of woodland. Greater Butterfly Orchid has been recorded here in the past.|$|R
50|$|The {{park was}} part of the grounds of an {{eighteenth-century}} mansion called Warren House. In 1937 it was acquired by Middlesex County Council and Harrow Urban District Council as public open space. It was later owned by the Greater London Council and transferred to the London Borough of Harrow in 1976. The presence of <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>trees</b> and mature hornbeam shows that part of it is ancient woodland. The main plants in grassland areas are common bent and Yorkshire fog, with tufted hair grass in damp areas.|$|R
50|$|Trees {{include the}} {{uncommon}} <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>tree,</b> and breeding birds include spotted flycatcher, lesser whitethroat, reed bunting and skylark. Featherstone Hill is a partly wooded {{hill in the}} south west of the site.|$|E
50|$|Other native {{tree species}} include Caspian Locust (Gleditsia caspica), Velvet Maple (Acer velutinum), Cappadocian Maple (Acer cappadocicum), European Ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Wych Elm (Ulmus glabra), Wild Cherry (Prunus avium), <b>Wild</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Tree</b> (Sorbus torminalis) and lime tree (Tilia platyphyllos).|$|E
50|$|Sorbus {{subgenus}} Torminaria (genus Torminalis), with rather maple-like lobed {{leaves with}} pointed lobes; fruit carpels not fused; just one species, Sorbus torminalis (<b>Wild</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Tree).</b> Distribution: temperate Europe, {{south to the}} mountains of North Africa and east to the Caucasus ranges.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{woodland}} on clay, {{and although}} most {{of it has been}} coppiced at different times, it has a varied structure, and rich variety of flora and invertebrates. These factors, together with the presence of <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>trees,</b> show that the woods are ancient. The main tree is oak, with and understorey which includes wych elm, crab apple and guelder rose. Flowers include primroses and bluebells, and in wetter areas there are ragged robin and marsh bedstraw. The woods have the largest British breeding colony of the nationally rare black hairstreak butterfly.|$|R
5000|$|Scratchwood is {{a remnant}} of the once great Middlesex Forest, and has the largest area of ancient {{woodland}} which survives in Barnet. Parts of it may {{go back to the}} woods which grew up {{after the end of the}} last ice age, the Younger Dryas, 11,500 years ago. The ancient woodland consists mainly of sessile oak and hornbeam, with some <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>trees,</b> while secondary woodland areas are mainly birch, hawthorns and sycamore. In the view of the London Ecology Unit, [...] "Scratchwood is the Borough's best woodland in terms of floral diversity, especially of ancient woodland indicator species". The herb rich grassland and the pond have a number of rare plants. Breeding birds include nuthatch, lesser whitethroat and cuckoo.|$|R
50|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the land}} cleared was usually common land but after {{assarting}} the space became privately used. The process took several forms. Usually {{it was done}} by one farmer who hacked out a clearing from the woodland, leaving a hedged field. However, sometimes groups of individuals or even entire villages did the work {{and the results were}} divided into strips and shared among tenant farmers. Monastic communities, particularly the Cistercians, sometimes assarted, as well as local lords. The cleared land often leaves behind an assart hedge, which often contains a high number of woodland trees such as small leafed lime or <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> and contains <b>trees</b> that rarely colonise planted hedges, such as hazel. Examples are in Dorset, where there is a difference in the hedges in the west and the east of the county, at Hatfield Broadoak in Essex where the modern hedges still follow the boundaries of an ancient forest, and at Shelley in Suffolk where there is an unusually long hedge made up of coppiced lime trees that is the remnant of a nineteenth-century woodland clearance.|$|R
50|$|It {{is mainly}} {{semi-natural}} woodland, and some areas {{date back to}} the last Ice Age, the Younger Dryas, 11,500 years ago. The range of habitats make it an important ecological site. Plants include bluebells, anemones and violets and the rare <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
50|$|Brampton Wood hosts three {{examples}} of <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>tree.</b> The berries of this tree — known as 'chequers' were once widely used to flavour beer in Great Britain (before hops). A limited edition beer 'Chequered Past' {{was produced by}} The Son of Sid Brewery in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Sorbus torminalis {{with common}} names <b>wild</b> <b>service</b> <b>tree,</b> chequers, and checker tree, is {{a species of}} Sorbus native to Europe from England and Wales east to Denmark and Poland, south to {{northwest}} Africa, and southeast to southwest Asia from Asia Minor to the Caucasus and Alborz mountains.|$|E
5000|$|He {{also does}} not prune fruit trees much nor does he cut the lower {{branches}} on fruit trees (as this can hurt the tree -due to the lignification {{not being able to}} complete before frost {{and the fact that the}} unpruned fruit trees survives snow loads that will break pruned trees.-. He also says that leaving the branches on protects the tree against browsing by animals. He does however makes a point of using deep-rooted pioneer plants such as lupins, sweet clover, lucerne and broom. These crops are said to aerate the soil and make sure no water is left standing near the tree. No use is made of wire meshes as protection against voles, since he states they are not efficient in preventing damage from voles using this technique anyway. He makes no use of contemporary fruit tree cultivars, but only uses (very strong/hardy) old, local (heirloom) cultivars. In addition to (old cultivars of) regular fruit trees, he also plants much fruit tree species that are specific to use in phytotherapy or which can only function as animal feed (i.e. crab apple, wild pear, wild cherry, blackthorn, rowan, <b>wild</b> <b>service,</b> <b>service</b> <b>tree,</b> cornelian cherry, snowy mespilus, ...). Similar to mainstream permaculture, he makes no use of chemical fertiliser or pesticides, at all. It should be noted that due to the altitude he's at, his trees bear fruit later, meaning he can sell it after most (sealevel) farmers sold their produce. Due to this (and the fact that he produces heirloom fruit varieties, and not regular varieties), he is often able to get a better price for it. In some cases, customers (like distilleries) are even willing to pick the fruit themselves, eliminating the labour expense for him.|$|R
40|$|<b>Service</b> <b>tree</b> (Sorbus domestica L.) {{is almost}} unknown in Denmark, {{but may be}} {{interesting}} in a future warmer climate. The paper includes {{an introduction to the}} species' ecology, diseases, cultivation and products. <b>Service</b> <b>tree</b> has a number of good properties, but can be difficult to establish. It is recommended only to plant <b>service</b> <b>tree</b> on a small scale, until effective means against stem cankers have been identified. On the suitability of <b>service</b> <b>tree</b> for silviculture in Denmark: <b>Service</b> <b>tree</b> is drought tolerant and thrives well in a climate that is slightly warmer than at present in Denmark. However, <b>service</b> <b>tree</b> can be somewhat difficult to establish and young trees are prone to stem cankers that may potentially kill the tree. In 2002 we planted some <b>service</b> <b>trees</b> of unknown origin in northern Denmark. They were planted in different types of already established, mixed forest stands. The area had previously been stocked with an apple orchard. The rate of survival was high although none of the trees were sprayed with sulphur or copper. Now, all the <b>service</b> <b>trees</b> suffer more or less from stem cankers and most of them do not thrive well. In 2013 we raised some seedlings of Modra origin (Figure 1). Almost all seeds germinated, and the seedlings grew 34 ‐ 92 cm tall in the first growing season (average height = 57 cm). We consequently consider it easy to produce nursery plants. So far, our experience is insufficient to judge the long‐term prospects for <b>service</b> <b>tree</b> as a forest crop tree in Denmark. However, old and large trees in good growth and without diseases testify that <b>service</b> <b>tree</b> can thrive and remain healthy. In a coming article we will present an overview of some of the trees that we know. In our opinion, the fruits and the spectacularly beautiful autumn foliage are sufficient reasons for planting some <b>service</b> <b>trees</b> in the forest. We recommend small‐scale plantings until effective means against stem cankers have been identified...|$|R
