40|$|AbstractSupercapacitor {{consists}} of two carbon electrodes and <b>wooden</b> <b>sheet</b> as a separator. Three types of carbon electrodes were prepared; carbon black (CB), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and composites of MWNTs and CB (MWNTs-CB). Electrode pastes were coated {{on both sides of}} <b>wooden</b> <b>sheet.</b> The thickness of <b>wooden</b> <b>sheet</b> was varies from 1 mm to 5 mm. The morphology of CB, MWNTs and MWNTs-CB were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The supercapacitor performance was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge techniques. Among carbon electrode materials, MWNTs-CB shows the highest specific capacitance. The high specific capacitance of MWNTs-CB {{may be due to the}} high surface area of MWNTs incorporated with CB acting as spacer for MWNTs agglomeration protection and electrolyte- electrode accessibility improvement. Moreover, <b>wooden</b> <b>sheet</b> with a thickness of 2 mm shows the highest specific capacitance...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{energy and}} power {{are the one}} of the basic necessities {{regarding}} this modern world. As the demand of energy is increasing day by day, so the ultimate solution to deal with these sorts of problems is just to implement the renewable sources of energy. But these renewable energy sources must have to be adopted in practical manner by keeping an eye on all aspects regarding the research work. So then these techniques should be applied {{in order to get the}} desired output. The objective of this work is power generation through footsteps as a source of renewable energy that we can obtained while walking on to the certain arrangements like footpaths, stairs, plate forms and these systems can be install elsewhere specially in the dense populated areas. The basic working principle of ‘footstep power generation system ’ is based on the crank shaft and gear arrangement and fly wheel. So in order to implement this foot step power generation system we adjust the wooden plates above and below the sensors and moveable springs, when we walk on the mat than automatically force is applied and as a result magnet fixed under the top <b>wooden</b> <b>sheet</b> and moves into the cavity. As this cavity is fixed at bottom <b>wooden</b> <b>sheet</b> of mat so between the moveable springs adjusted between the top and bottom sheets.

40|$|A {{series of}} studies were {{conducted}} in Barkhan area of Balochistan to determine the efficiency of various engineering structures (division, diversion and check dams) on the "Rod Kohi" runoff farming. Low cost engineering structures (<b>wooden</b> <b>sheet,</b> loose stone, barbed wire, 15 " pipe nacca) were constructed, the cost ranged from Rs. 1500 to 4000 per structure. Rod Kohi farming provides livelihood {{for the majority of}} the farmers in the area. Wheat and mix sorghum-mung are the crops generally grown in the area. Traditional practices were done in the target area for the utilization of runoff water involving dividing and diverting the runoff water with local shrubs, sticks and plant residues etc. These engineering structures constructed in this study improved the overall efficiency of the runoff farming system and conflict free environment among farmers by efficient water distribution and diversion. A reduction from 7 to 2 % in gradient control of the earthen channels and maximum of 25 % increase in wheat yield were recorded...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} rupture {{mechanics}} and condition of woods and <b>wooden</b> <b>sheet</b> materials, stress distributions in these materials must be examined. However, for the complicated shape of specimens and load condition, it is practically difficult to bring light on detailed stress distributions in various specimens experimentally. Though the Moiré method and the photo-elastic method for these stress analysis are used experimentally, clear fringes {{to be able}} to analyze are difficult to be obtained. In order to solve such problems, the mathematical and physical approximate methods must be used. Recently, the electronic computers make these numerical methods possible. The former reminds us of the finite difference method and the latter, of the finite element method. The author attempted to solve these problems approximately by means of the finite element method. The computer programs were designed {{to be able to}} vary the subdivision sizes by merely changing the data cards and a few parts of a main program, so that the influence of the subdivision sizes on the accuracy of the approximation could be discussed easily (an example of the flow chart and of the program in FORTRAN is shown in Fig. 4 and Appendix, respectively). Hereby, the influence of the variation of the subdivision sizes on the convergence into the exact solution was clarified (Figs. 9 and 10). It was ascertained that the satisfactory solutions are obtained, using this numerical analysis. Moreover, an example of the experimental results was compared with the results computed with the elastic constants of hardboard (Fig. 11). In this result, the satisfactory agreements were recognized. In this paper, the applications of the finite element method to the partial compression problems, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, of isotropic plates in the elastic area were attempted, and a few examples of the numerical computation were given (Figs. 5 ～ 8). If assuming woods and plywoods as the rectangular orthotropic materials approximately, it will be suspected that the numerical analysis for these orthotropic materials and the elastic-plastic analysis can be solved approximately by the above method. 木材および木質材料の破壊の機構,条件を研究する際には,供試体内の応力分布を知ることが必要不可欠となる. しかし,供試体の複雑な形状,荷重条件等の繁雑なものは実験的に究明することが難かしく,詳細な応力分布が得られにくい. この種の応力解析として実験的にはモアレ法・光弾性法等があるが,弾性領域では解析しうる程鮮明な縞が得られていない. そこで,筆者は有限要素法の導入と電算機の利用により,これを近似的に解くことを試みた. プログラミングに際しては,三角形要素分割の粗さの違いをデータカードの交換と若干のメインプログラムの変更のみによつて容易に行なえるよう工夫し,三角形要素分割粗さによる近似精度への影響の検討を容易にした. これにより,分割様式の相異による解への収束性を明らかにするとともに,この数値解析法を用いて,問題の設定を適正に行なえば十分に精度のよい解が得られることを確めた. また,有限要素解と実験値との比較を行なつた結果,問題の設定の不充分さはあるが,比較的よく一致することを確認した. なお,本報では等方性弾性体の数値解析法として,有限要素法の適用について説明し,かつ若干の数値計算例を示したが,今後つぎのようなことが望まれる. すなわち,木材や合板等の木質材料は近似的には直交異方性材料とみなされているが,この種の材料の異方性としての解析および弾性域を越えた木材等の特有の性質の現われる領域すなわち弾塑性解析あるいは塑性解析が望まれる. 筆者も,この種の解析法について究明を進めているが,実験的には格子法,モアレ法,光弾性法とともに次報以後で報告する予定である...|$|E

They traditionally carve household objects, figures and masks. Since the 1950s years the socalled Modern Makonde Art has been developed. An essential step was the turning to abstract figures, mostly spirits (Shetani) that play a special role. Makonde are also part of the important contemporary artists of Africa today. An outstanding position is taken by George Lilanga.|$|R

40|$|Prediction of {{the thermal}} fire {{resistance}} of building materials using a microcomputer based {{finite element analysis}} program is further reported in this paper. The thermal behaviour of three samples of commonly used materials including aluminium, hardwood and cement mortar were studied with one side exposed to an electric furnace. A small electric furnace was built with the transient variation of the furnace air temperature following the standard fire curve of British Standard BS 476. Thermocouples were put inside the materials for monitoring the increase in temperature. Computer simulations with the finite element package was performed to study the temperature change inside the materials when they were exposed to fire. Results were compared with the experimental measurement on the transient temperature. Sensitivity analysis on the effect of element size was performed to check the results. Good agreement was found in the case of aluminium, but not so good in the cases of the other two building materials where other changes occurred at the same time - moisture evaporation from the cement mortar, and burning of the material of hardwood. Lastly, demonstrations in using the technique to study the thermal fire resistance of steel <b>sheet,</b> <b>wooden</b> doors and concrete beams were reported.
