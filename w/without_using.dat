5|$|Another {{breakthrough}} came in 1931, {{when the}} American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza {{and several other}} viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. In 1949, John Franklin Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick Robbins grew polio virus in cultured human embryo cells, the first virus to be grown <b>without</b> <b>using</b> solid animal tissue or eggs. This work enabled Jonas Salk to make an effective polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Another non-animal {{research}} method is in silico or computer simulation and mathematical modeling {{which seeks to}} investigate and ultimately predict toxicity and drug affects in humans <b>without</b> <b>using</b> animals. This is done by investigating test compounds on a molecular level using recent advances in technological capabilities with {{the ultimate goal of}} creating treatments unique to each patient.|$|E

5|$|Because viruses use vital {{metabolic}} pathways within host {{cells to}} replicate, they {{are difficult to}} eliminate <b>without</b> <b>using</b> drugs that cause toxic effects to host cells in general. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases are vaccinations to provide immunity to infection, and antiviral drugs that selectively interfere with viral replication.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{only a few}} sharks are {{dangerous}} to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four {{have been involved in}} a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, tiger, and bull sharks. These sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack and kill people. Despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed <b>without</b> <b>using</b> a protective cage.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} season of Millionaire in the United States, the show crowned its first million-dollar winner. On November 19, 1999, John Carpenter won the show's top prize <b>without</b> <b>using</b> any lifelines, save for a phone call on the final {{question}} to tell his father {{he was going to}} win the million dollars. After Carpenter answered the final question, which concerned Richard Nixon's appearance on Laugh-In in 1968, host Regis Philbin proclaimed Carpenter the show's (and worldwide format's) first top prize winner.|$|E

Dr. Lanyon tries to help Jekyll re-create the formula, but {{they are unable to}} find an ingredient. Jekyll asks Lanyon to bring Agnes to him, but Jekyll turns into Hyde before Lanyon returns. Utterson and Newcome arrive to arrest Hyde; knowing he can no longer transform back into Jekyll, Hyde commits suicide by taking poison.|$|E
5|$|Later Myst titles {{improved}} on {{the integration}} of live action sequences in the prerendered environments of the games. s developers filmed all the scenes using standard definition cameras, which producer Dan Irish would look back on as a mistake; <b>without</b> <b>using</b> high definition video cameras, the video did not look crisp at high resolutions. For the next game, , Ubisoft allowed players to move the game camera and interact with the video while it is playing {{through the use of}} the ALIVE game engine.|$|E
5|$|Much of the system's core, {{including}} the LWKT subsystem, the IPI messaging subsystem {{and the new}} kernel memory allocator, are lockless, meaning that they work <b>without</b> <b>using</b> mutexes, with each process operating on a single CPU. Critical sections are used to protect against local interrupts, individually for each CPU, guaranteeing that a thread currently being executed will not be preempted.|$|E

5|$|On the November 19, 1999, {{episode of}} Millionaire, Carpenter {{proceeded}} {{to advance to}} the million-dollar question <b>without</b> <b>using</b> any lifelines. He then used his Phone-A-Friend to call his father not for help, but rather to tell him he was going to win the game. Carpenter answered the question correctly and became the show's first millionaire. His win gave him national recognition and led to multiple talk show appearances, as well as reappearances on Millionaire itself.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2007, BL-80 was {{the only}} {{connection}} {{to the city of}} Wendover from Utah. However, a new partial diamond interchange, which allows traffic from I-80 to exit going westbound and for traffic to enter I-80 eastbound, at Aria Boulevard was constructed. The Aria Boulevard interchange was first planned in 2005, and was completed <b>without</b> <b>using</b> any federal funding.|$|E
5|$|The Octopus {{system was}} quickly adopted by other Creative Star joint venture partners, and KMB {{reported}} that by 2000, most bus journeys were completed using an Octopus card, with few coins used.

5|$|According to Peter Freuchen, {{the scene}} in which the wolf attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with {{a rock and a}} pistol beneath his fur jacket, spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a camera with a {{telephoto}} lens followed at a distance. The wolf attack was filmed from far away, with the rifleman ready to shoot the wolf in case Mala was unable to kill it. As shown in film, Mala was able to kill the wolf <b>without</b> <b>using</b> his pistol or relying on the rifleman, and was not injured in the attack.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, {{developments}} in chemotherapy offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors {{had not told}} Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a folic acid derivative; {{he may have been}} the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, <b>without</b> <b>using</b> his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.|$|E
5|$|Bismarck {{left the}} Kiel Fjord {{on the morning}} of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, Bismarck reached Gotenhafen (now Gdynia) the next day. Here Bismarck {{conducted}} a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk Bay). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a number of tests for the crew, which they passed easily. During high speed trials, Bismarck reached a top speed of , exceeding the design speed. However, one weakness quickly became apparent: <b>without</b> <b>using</b> the rudders but only the screws, Bismarck was almost impossible to steer.|$|E

5|$|Bristol Bridge, {{the only}} way of {{crossing}} the river <b>without</b> <b>using</b> a ferry, was rebuilt between 1764 and 1768. The earlier medieval bridge was too narrow and congested to cope with the amount of traffic that needed to use it. A toll was charged to pay for the works, and when, in 1793, the toll was extended for a further period of time the Bristol Bridge Riot ensued. Eleven people were killed and 45 injured, {{making it one of the}} worst riots of the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|During 1942, Allied {{officials}} debated on {{the appropriate}} grand strategy to pursue. All agreed that defeating Germany {{was the primary}} objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself {{would be subject to}} a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour <b>without</b> <b>using</b> large-scale armies. Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge {{stemmed from}} the idea of {{creating}} a horde of creatures and the ability to care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. The choice was to be made by the player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was designed so that {{it would be possible to}} complete the game <b>without</b> <b>using</b> violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E
