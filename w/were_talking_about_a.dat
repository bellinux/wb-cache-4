What I complain of is a vague popular philosophy which supposes itself to be scientific when it is really nothing but a sort of new religion and an uncommonly nasty one. When people talked about the fall of man they knew they <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> mystery, a thing they didn't understand. Now that they talk about the survival of the fittest they think they do understand it, whereas they have not merely no notion, they have an elaborately false notion of what the words mean. The Darwinian movement has made no difference to mankind, except that, instead of talking unphilosophically about philosophy, they now talk unscientifically about science." ...|$|E
60|$|And so on, by the hour, the man's tongue would go. He could NOT forget any thing. It {{was simply}} impossible.

His {{was not simply a}} pilot's memory; its grasp was universal. If he <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> trifling letter he had received seven years before, he was pretty sure to deliver you the entire screed from memory. And then without observing that he was departing from the true line of his talk, he was more than likely to hurl in a long-drawn parenthetical biography of the writer of that letter; and you were lucky indeed if he did not take up that writer's relatives, one by one, and give you their biographies, too.|$|E

When he tries to tell the others, the children call him a liar and a horrible person. Unable to wait, Kikitchi enters the book he has taken home. As he does, however, a tornado of paper engulfs Celebria, and causes the Tamagotchi caught in the tornado to become two-dimensional. Mametchi's family sees the news report on TV, and Chamametchi and Mametchi instantly think of Kikitchi. The family then heads to Mame Laboratories to discuss the problem with other scientists.|$|E

5000|$|Bousman and Zdunich began {{developing}} {{the concept of}} the movie while the two <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> possible sequel for Repo! The Genetic Opera. The two eventually came up with The Devil's Carnival after not developing a sequel for Repo! [...] "for multiple reasons". Filming for Devil's Carnival wrapped in mid January 2012 and went into post production, with Noise Creep reporting that Slipknot's Shawn Crahan would be participating in his first acting role. A film trailer featuring singer Emilie Autumn was released in late December 2011. The Hollywood Reporter quotes Bousman as saying that the movie is [...] "more accessible than Repo but also a lot darker than Repo" [...] and that The Devil's Carnival will be receiving a multi-city road tour starting in April 2012 and a 12 song album.|$|E
5000|$|Drew was {{originally}} contracted to guest {{star in a}} multi-episodes story arc where her character would be eventually fired from the series after two episodes. She explained: [...] "I came on to the show and I was told from day one that I was {{only going to be}} there for two episodes. I did not expect anything beyond that. The morning my firing episode aired, my agent got a call that they <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> contract and I was just completely floored." [...] However she was promoted to a series regular on June 9, 2010 for the seventh season of the show. Rhimes said in the wake of the news: [...] "Kepner has really been folded into the group" [...] of Grey's Anatomy adding [...] "It'll depend on what the studio and the network decide to do with those actors, but I fully advocate to have characters". Drew received the call for her promotion the morning after the sixth episode of season six was telecast on October 29, 2009. She described the call as a [...] "totally happy surprise".|$|E
5000|$|Rajinikanth was {{a friend}} of Mani Ratnam's brother G. Venkateswaran, and they <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> film together. Ratnam had met him twice because he had {{expressed}} interest in working with him, although Ratnam did not have anything for him then. He needed a film that would have scope for Rajinikanth's stardom but yet remain Ratnam's film. He wanted something right for both himself and Rajinikanth. He wanted something that Rajinikanth could not say no to and something that Ratnam really wanted to do. And then the concept came up, of the story of Karna from the Indian epic Mahabharata, who Ratnam considers [...] "one of the best characters in the Mahabharata". Ratnam wanted to present a realistic Rajinikanth, which he saw in Mullum Malarum minus all his style elements. Rajinikanth recalled that he had tough time while shooting for the film as [...] "Ratnam was from a different school of film making and asked me to feel emotions even when taking part in a fight scene". Thalapathi remains the only collaboration between Mani Ratnam and Rajinikanth.|$|E

Grande has referred to [...] "Right There" [...] as [...] "sort of a sequel" [...] to her first top-ten single [...] "The Way" [...] due to the songs similarities in melody and composition. The singer spoke of the mutual interest she and rapper Big Sean felt in wanting to collaborate but mentioned that it took some time for them to find the right song.

5000|$|The six Roman {{cardinals}} had {{the majority}} of the eleven votes, but they would never agree on one of their own number on either side as Pope. At the same time, together they could block the election of any of the non-Roman cardinals. But the non-Romans, as it happened, had no cause or personality to rally around. Finally, in early July 1294, during a meeting of the cardinals in Perugia, Cardinal Boccamati and Cardinal Latino Malabranca Orsini made casual mention of some visions they had heard about. Cardinal Caetani asked whether they <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> vision received by Brother Peter, the hermit of Mount Murrone near Sulmone (who had received approval for his little religious group from Pope Gregory X at the Council of Lyons). Latino Orsini replied in the affirmative, and Brother Peter became the subject of discussion. Suddenly and unanimously, on Monday 5 July 1294, the Cardinals elected Peter da Murrone pope. Matteo Rosso Orsini was one of the eleven cardinals who signed their names to the Electoral Decree. [...] Celestine V was crowned in L'Aquila on 29 August 1294, by the prior Diaconum, Cardinal Matteo Rosso Orsini.|$|E

In spite of the close call, the body on the trunk is not discovered. When they arrive at the hospital, Miguel and Elisa are told to wait and provide further information. They are told that the woman they were transporting in the car was already dead. Miguel becomes nervous, {{but it turns out that}} it was not his wife in the trunk, but the injured woman from the accident they <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> <b>A</b> strange bond starts growing between Elisa and Miguel. She seems willing to co-operate with her abductor. Miguel is attractive and charms her with his personality.
