500|$|..... {{although}} we didn't deliberately {{set out to}} be a 'bunch of bastards' <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> on to the field, I'd much prefer any team I captained to be described like that than as 'a nice bunch of blokes on the field.' As captain of Australia my philosophy was simple: between 11.00am and 6.00pm {{there was no time to}} be a nice guy. I believed that on the field players should concentrate on giving their best to the team, to themselves and to winning; in other words, playing hard and fairly within the rules. To my mind, doing all that left no time for being a nice guy.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{praised the}} film's fictionalization of history, writing in his review, [...] "The film doesn't {{pretend to be}} about the civil-rights workers themselves. It's almost as if Mr. Parker and Mr. Gerolmo {{respected}} the victims, their ideals and their fate too much to reinvent them through the use of fiction." [...] In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert surmised, [...] "We knew the outcome of this case <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> into the theater. What we may have forgotten, or never known, is exactly what kinds of currents were in the air in 1964." [...] On the syndicated television program Siskel and Ebert and the Movies, Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating. Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune, praised Hackman and Dafoe's [...] "subtle" [...] performances but felt that McDormand was [...] "most effective as the film's moral conscience".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] was filmed from April 7 to April 9, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Hype Williams. It officially premiered on Vevo on April 30, 2010. On working with Williams {{and the new}} looks she developed in the video, Aguilera stated, [...] "...someone with {{that much of a}} catalog under his belt and success as a video maker, he's like a legend. So again entering into the collaborating factor, I didn't know what to expect ... and he's probably thinking the same about me. And <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> away from working with each other, it was just a love connection. I wanted to maintain and keep consistent with the look of the album packaging and book, and I really wanted to keep all that in line, and so he really paid attention, and I think it's really iconic and classic. We totally made magic together on a creative level, it was absolutely amazing. He really got in and listened to where my music was at".|$|E

2500|$|The {{elevators}} in {{that particular}} building were operated by young girls, and I made special arrangements with one in advance. She agreed to cooperate and {{thought it would be}} fun. I went with the gentleman to the elevator. He wasn't afraid of walking into an elevator, but when it started to move it became an unbearable experience. So I chose an unbusy time and I had him walk {{in and out of the}} elevator, back in and out. Then at a point <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> in, I told the girl to close the door and said, [...] "Let's go up." ...|$|E

Data that exceed pre-defined or user-defined thresholds are also candidates.

6000|$|Do <b>we</b> ever think, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> those busy, bustling streets, all {{alive with}} Christmas shoppers, and {{mingle with the}} rushing tides that throng and jostle through the stores, that unseen spirits may be hastening to and fro along those same ways bearing Christ's Christmas gifts to men-- gifts whose value no earthly gold or gems can represent? ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{saw this}} quite clearly, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> and talked {{together}} I seemed always trying for animation in her and never finding it. I would state my ideas. [...] "I know," [...] she would say, [...] "I know." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{the same}} with us, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> through the streets--Matteo and I and the Moratini--they hissed and groaned at us. And a week before they would have licked our boots and kissed the ground we trod on! ...|$|E
6000|$|Shadows are but privations of the light; [...] Yet, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk,</b> {{they shoot}} before the sight; [...] With us approach, retire, arise, and fall; [...] Nothing themselves, and yet expressing all.

"It 's not {{especially}} useful," [...] she answered; [...] "but I {{like to know}} the names of plants as I do those of my acquaintances. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> in the woods at home--which we do so much--it seems as unnatural not to know what to call the flowers as it would be to see some one in the town with whom we were not on speaking terms." ...|$|R
40|$|In short, {{this thesis}} {{presents}} walking as absent thinking. It constructs one situation via deconstruction {{of scores of}} spectacles. To stage this thought as a dialogue: What do <b>we</b> do <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk?</b> <b>We</b> seem to be thinking. If I would be, in subsequent conversation, asked about the scientific merit of this thesis, I would reply - at once politely, providing pointers for orientation, and provocatively, raising a deliberate red flag to incite attention - that it successfully demonstrates the applicability of Benjamin's ideas of messianic communism and turning art into philosophy and, against Plato's intentions, the unity of Plato's philosophy...|$|R
