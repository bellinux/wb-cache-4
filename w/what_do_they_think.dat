Then the stifling silence settles down over the City of Dreadful Night. The kites on the Minar sleep again, snoring more loudly, the hot breeze comes up in puffs and lazy eddies, and the Moon slides down towards the horizon.

6000|$|Of {{the true}} coming to Christ, the four lepers were a famous semblance, of whom you read, (2 Kings 7:3), &c. The famine {{in those days}} was sore in the land, there was no bread for the people; and as for that {{sustenance}} that was, which was asses' flesh and doves' dung, that was only in Samaria, and of these the lepers had no share, for they were thrust without the city. Well, now they sat in the gate of the city, and hunger was, as I may say, making his last meal of them; and being, therefore, half dead already, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> of doing? Why, first they display the dismal colours of death before each other's faces, and then resolve what to do, saying, [...] "If we say we will enter into the city, then famine is in the city, and we shall die there: if we sit still here, we die also. Now, therefore, come, let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; if they kill us, we shall but die." [...] Here, now, was necessity at work, and this necessity drove them to go thither for life, whither else they would never have gone for it. Thus it is with them that in truth come to Jesus Christ. Death is before them, they see it and feel it; he is feeding upon them, and will eat them quite up, if they come not to Jesus Christ; and therefore they come, even of necessity, being forced thereto by that sense they have of their being utterly and everlastingly undone, if they find not safety in him. These are they that will come. Indeed, these are they that are invited to come. [...] "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" [...] (Matt 11:28).|$|E

5000|$|Purdue Crew Women's Team was {{established}} in 1979. An article written in Purdue's Exponent titled Women shove off on new challenge describes {{the beginning of the}} Women's program. [...] "When they first showed up we thought they were there to be coxswains, but they wanted to row." [...] That was the comment made by Kevin Sauer, president of the Purdue Crew Club, when asked about the reaction when four women showed up at the crew club callout last fall. [...] "They sort of laughed at us at first," [...] said Jan Pahl, one of the four. Because of their size the women couldn't row next to the men, but they still wanted to handle the oars. With the help of Jack Young from the alumni association, the women's crew was created. Now {{as a part of the}} Purdue Crew Club, they are practicing daily on the Wabash. The initial 50 at the callout have been trimmed to 25 women who practice regularly under the coaching of Chris Polhemus, John North and Kevin Sauer from the men's varsity team. There is one drawback to the practices, though. Because of limited funding - $3000 a year for men and women combined - both teams must share boats. The men's club practices in the afternoon, making use of all the equipment at that time. So every morning, at 6:30, the women's team starts practice. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> about while pulling the 12-foot-one-inch long oars? [...] "Going back to bed," [...] said one woman. [...] "Making the dock on the last run," [...] said another. According to the women, falling in the water is the most unpleasant aspect of rowing. For the past month, morning temperatures have been in the low 40's or high 30's. When pushing off from the dock in the capsizable one-or-two-individual shells, they have learned to be careful. Once on the river, the early rise and hard work seem worth it all. [...] "It's so pretty once you get out there," [...] remarks Kathy Brady. The women's feeling of self-satisfaction is also a compensating factor. [...] "It feels so good at the end of practice when you head for the dock and know that you've done it," [...] one member said.Public reaction has been one of surprise. A myth exists that the exercises, weight lifting, running and of course rowing, would turn the women into muscular hulks. On the contrary, the exercises are designed to tone the muscles much like a swimmer's long muscles. None of the women have confirmed the myth by turning into amazons.The newly-formed team hasn't yet participated in any intercollegiate meets, but starting next spring the women will compete everywhere the men's crew does. For the present they are concentrating on achieving form. Varsity crew member and women's Coach Sauer said, [...] "One thing the girls have in their favor is that they have good balance and coordination in the boats." [...] Such qualities can make the difference between winning and losing. Eventually the women's crew may become a [...] "separate but equal" [...] counterpart to the men's. The reason is that the women don't think the coaches should have to come to practice at 6:30 in the morning in addition to practicing with the men's team in the afternoon. The main impetus for sharing facilities with the men is financial. A used shell costs $3,000, the same amount the men and women's crew together are budgeted each year. As a supplementary measure, the women's team has had a bake sale. In an effort to raise more funds, the crew club is sponsoring a dance this weekend. But the women cannot operate on an independent basis immediately. The two teams co-exist in harmony. The women are in no way pampered as they were warned in the beginning. Their efforts are the proof of their success this season. Harvey Gerry, Staff Writer; As printed in the Purdue Exponent Thursday, November 11, 1974 ...|$|E
