5000|$|Michael {{has stated}} that before {{becoming}} a Christian, he played in band with his friends performing covers of bands such as Burzum, Darkthrone, Acheron, Beherit, and Havohej. In 1995, Michael converted to Christianity at a summer camp. His original band drifted apart, and in 1996 he formed a new band, Paradox, {{with his father and}} brother. The name [...] "Paradox" [...] was chosen because of the paradox of a Christian band playing very dark music. That year, the band released a demo entitled The Outcasts. UK-based Cross Rhythms Magazine later reviewed the demo and rated it six out of ten squares. Grey [...] "The Invocator" [...] later joined in 1998 as vocalist. According to Michael, Grey was not a Christian, but was a friend of his before his conversion and was comfortable with the goals of the band. A second demo, Through Pain There Is Joy, followed in 2000, which Cross Rhythms rated seven out of ten squares, and stated that the band was the [...] "London's only dark metal band <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> doing it for Christ." [...] After this demo, the band line-up underwent a transition, with Michael [...] "John Tarantula" [...] re-forming Paradox with members Jasen [...] "White Stick" [...] on drums, Jeff [...] "Death Warrior" [...] on bass, Sam [...] "Yellow Terror" [...] on guitar, and Grey on vocals. In 2000, a new member, Rose [...] "Dark Faery", joined part-time as a keyboardist. The band started recording at a professional studio, but then announced in 2002 that they would dissolve with the release of their final two songs on Overcome or Burn Forever in Hell/Arachnid Terror Sampler. This was a split release combining an EP, Overcome or Burn Forever in Hell, by Paradox, and a sampler album, Arachnid Terror Sampler, featuring fourteen other artists including Frosthardr, Frost Like Ashes, Kekal, Pantokrator, Sanctifica, Soul Embraced, and Tortured Conscience. Following the breakup of the band, Michael announced the formation of the projects Bloodshed and Slimegem.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Various {{organizations}} {{have made a}} commitment to migrate their systems to a new client/server architecture. Due to it's diverse nature, many problems have arisen inherent to the way the system works. For instance, the use of different tools and platforms to accomplish various tasks is required. Getting these tools to work well together in disparate situations is a key issue. How can a company determine which tools, platforms, and systems changes are desired? One {{way to do this is}} to communicate; share the information concerning the problems one encounters with others who find themselves in the same boat. Therefore, a survey was distributed focusing within six facets of client/server application development: performance, capacity, scalability, portability, connectivity, and functionality. The objective: to discover various common links and/or connections that contribute to successful client/server application development The result: information was gathered from the people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> right now producing it. The four page survey was disseminated to over 500 information systems professionals throughout the domestic United States. Participants were selected by the respondent's title(manager or director of MIS or Systems & Programming), the corporation's listed systems, and were obtained from the Spring 1995 Computing IS Managers Guide. The design of the survey was critical in obtaining specific, relevant information. Utilizing the inverted funnel sequencing style, the task of getting a given respondent to open up was accomplished. The respondent contributed the answers as opposed to the survey suggesting them. 15 % of the surveys (74 of 500) were returned; 40 of which the respondent indicated no background in client/server and 34 of which were completed in full. Through analysis of these surveys, I have gained a greater appreciation for exactly how diverse client/server really is. I was able to discover some common threads in each area.

40|$|As we {{emerge from}} a deep and long recession, the debate must shift again to how New Zealand can lift its {{productivity}} growth rate. New Zealand has already done much work in getting the economic environment right for business growth. The reforms of the 1980 s and early 1990 s removed many of the structural barriers to the efficient allocation of resources across the economy. Even so, New Zealand’s growth rate has been disappointing. Growth {{in the last decade}} has exceeded the average of the OECD. But it has lagged that of Australia. Furthermore, growth has come off the back of working more hours, not more output per hour. This way of growing the economy has its limits. There is no single explanation for New Zealand’s disappointing growth performance, but reasons identified in an earlier NZIER public good research paper were: (1) geographical distance and small scale – although there is conflicting data on the true role and relevance of the former as an issue; (2) relatively low capital per worker – possibly linked to the shallow domestic capital market and low savings out of income, and so a hefty current account deficit, which raise the cost of capital; (3) low export growth – seemingly due to the dominance of the primary sector where expansion is much constrained by available land. The problem definition is still being debated, and a consensus on the best way to address the issues is further away. However, one argument that seems to be readily accepted by most {{is that there is a}} need to get our export sector humming by producing and selling more goods and services to our key offshore markets. Lifting export revenue comes about through higher volumes or higher prices, or a combination of both. So we either need to boost productivity and lift volumes, or create price premia. This can be done by “moving up the value chain” and focusing our efforts on selling differentiated products, rather than sticking with the tried and tested, homogenous commodity exports for which we are famous. Reciting these platitudes is easy. Making it happen is much more difficult. There are some encouraging and oft-cited examples of dynamic New Zealand firms <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> selling innovative goods and services to overseas markets. But effecting policy changes to incentivise some degree of structural change is a challenge. Economic Growth, New Zealand, Productivity Structure, Leontief and Ghosh...|$|E
