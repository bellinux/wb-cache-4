500|$|Del Toro, a {{self-described}} pacifist, avoided {{what he termed}} [...] "car commercial aesthetics" [...] or [...] "army recruitment video aesthetics", and gave the characters Western ranks including [...] "marshal" [...] and [...] "ranger" [...] rather than military ranks such as [...] "captain", [...] "major" [...] or [...] "general". The director stated: [...] "I avoided making any kind of message that says war is good. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> firepower in the world." [...] Del Toro wanted to break from the mass death and destruction featured in contemporary blockbuster films, and {{made a point of}} showing the streets and buildings being evacuated before Kaiju attacks, ensuring that the destruction depicted is [...] "completely remorseless".

500|$|While light {{comedy and}} satire might have {{established}} Yiddish theater as a commercially successful medium, it was Goldfaden's higher aspirations for it that eventually earned him recognition as [...] "the Yiddish Shakespeare." [...] As a man broadly read in several languages, he was {{acutely aware that}} there was no Eastern European Jewish tradition of dramatic literature – that his audience was used to seeking just [...] "a good glass of Odobeşti and a song." [...] Years later, he would paraphrase the typical Yiddish theatergoer of the time as saying to him: [...] "We don't go to the theater to make our head swim with sad things. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> troubles at home... We go to the theater to cheer ourselves up. We pay up a coin and hope to be distracted, we want to laugh from the heart." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the more}} notable events {{occurred}} on Midway when the pilot of a VNAF Cessna O-1 dropped {{a note on the}} deck of the carrier. The note read [...] "Can you move these helicopter to the other side, I can land on your runway, I can fly 1 hour more, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> time to move. Please rescue me. Major Buang, Wife and 5 child." [...] Midways CO, Captain L.C. Chambers ordered the flight deck crew to clear the landing area; in the process an estimated US$10 million worth of UH-1 Huey helicopters were pushed overboard into the South China Sea. Once the deck was clear Major Buang approached the deck, bounced once and then touched down and taxied to a halt with room to spare. Major Buang became the first VNAF fixed-wing pilot to ever land on a carrier. A second Cessna O-1 was also recovered by the USS Midway that afternoon.|$|E
500|$|Manuel Pellegrini, {{the manager}} of Manchester City, said before the game that winning the Shield [...] "would be the ideal start to the campaign." [...] He was {{conscious}} of his team's poor start to the previous season and wanted them to do better, particularly away from home. Pellegrini {{did not see the}} game against Arsenal as a [...] "friendly", and expected his opponents to provide a good test for Manchester City in the Shield match and thereafter in the league season. He was satisfied overall with the club's transfer activity during the summer, in particular praising goalkeeper Willy Caballero. When asked about Wenger's comments about Manchester City, he retorted: [...] "As a manager <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> problems with our own teams to be talking about other teams." [...] Pellegrini expressed his belief that Lampard's transfer was not done by underhand tactics – [...] "we didn’t spend any money in bringing him from New York City to Manchester City," [...] and added the player was not offered a contract to remain at Chelsea.|$|E

500|$|An own goal {{scored by}} Touré meant Fredrik Ljungberg's opener against Aston Villa was {{cancelled}} {{out and the}} match ended in a draw, albeit helping Arsenal back to first position on goal difference. Leading up to the potential championship decider against Manchester United on 16 April 2003, Wenger was adamant his team were mentally ready to retain the title: [...] "We {{want to be a}} team who makes history. That's what's really driving us on. We are not worrying about United too much. We are just concentrating on expressing our togetherness, our mental strength and our qualities. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> players who can win this game." [...] Having conceded a first half goal scored by Ruud van Nistelrooy, Arsenal overturned Manchester United's lead before Ryan Giggs equalised for the away team. The match ended 2–2; Campbell was sent off for elbowing Ole Gunnar Solskjær and was banned the rest of the season, whereas Vieira limped off with an injury. Although the result helped Manchester United move back top, they had played one game more than Arsenal. Arsenal won their next match at Middlesbrough, but squandered a two-goal lead away to Bolton Wanderers in the last ten minutes. The result, [...] "a big blow" [...] for Arsenal's title hopes, meant the championship was now in Manchester United's favour.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes {{the maximum}} {{likelihood}} estimate {{lies on the}} boundary of the set of possible parameters, or (if the boundary is not, strictly speaking, allowed) the likelihood gets larger and larger as the parameter approaches the boundary.

In this arrangement the ROCOR [...] "will now join the Moscow Patriarchate as a self-governed branch, similar to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. It will retain its autonomy in terms of pastoral, educational, administrative, economic, property and secular issues."
