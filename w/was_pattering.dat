60|$|Pan awakened {{during the}} latter part of the night. Rain <b>was</b> <b>pattering</b> on the tent. The wind moaned. He thought of Blake, not clad for bad weather and in unfit {{condition}} for a long ride, facing the storm. Even then a vague doubt penetrated his drowsy mind.|$|E
60|$|Sometime in {{the night}} I awoke. A fine rain <b>was</b> <b>pattering</b> on the tent. It grew stronger. After a while I went to sleep again. Upon {{awakening}} I found that the storm had struck with a vengeance. It was dull gray daylight, foggy, cold, windy, with rain and snow.|$|E
6000|$|... "9. I {{found myself}} in a room, {{standing}} before a long window. The only object of furniture or of ornament that I saw (or that I can now remember having seen) was a little statue placed near me. The window opened on a lawn and flower-garden; and the rain <b>was</b> <b>pattering</b> heavily against the glass.|$|E

60|$|Neale {{was about}} to ride his frantic horse {{straight}} into the work-train. Desperately he hauled the horse up and leaped off. Larry was down, waiting, and his mount went plunging away.

60|$|The rain <b>was</b> <b>pattering</b> on the roof, and as I dressed I had a {{disturbing}} {{vision of the}} long cold ride which lay before me. I hoped the case was not so bad as mother thought. With limbs still numb and weak I stumbled {{down the stairs to}} the sitting room where a faint light shone.|$|E
60|$|When Pen and Warrington arrived, the Captain (he {{had been}} in an Irish militia {{regiment}} once, and the title remained with him) was sitting on his bed in a torn dressing-gown, with a desk on his knees, at which he was scribbling as fast as his rapid pen could write. Slip after slip of paper fell off the desk wet on to the ground. A picture of his children was hung up over his bed, and the youngest of them <b>was</b> <b>pattering</b> about the room.|$|E
60|$|Torn by anxiety for my friend, I dragged {{myself into}} the nearest cabin, and a man was {{fighting}} there in the half-light at the port. The huge figure I knew to be my friend Cowan's, and when he drew back to load I seized his arm, shouting Ray's name. Although the lead <b>was</b> <b>pattering</b> {{on the other side}} of the logs, Cowan lifted me to the port. And there, stretched on the ground behind a stump, within twenty feet of the walls, was James. Even as I looked the puffs of dust at his side showed that the savages knew his refuge. I saw him level and fire, and then Bill Cowan set me down and began to ram in a charge with tremendous energy.|$|E

60|$|Dobbin {{had been}} in the coffee-room for an hour or more. He had tried all the papers, but could not read them. He had looked at the clock many scores of times; and at the street, where the rain <b>was</b> <b>pattering</b> down, and the people as they clinked by in pattens, left long {{reflections}} on the shining stone: he tattooed at the table: he bit his nails most completely, and nearly to the quick (he was accustomed to ornament his great big hands in this way): he balanced the tea-spoon dexterously on the milk jug: upset it, &c., &c.; and in fact showed those signs of disquietude, and practised those desperate attempts at amusement, which men are accustomed to employ when very anxious, and expectant, and perturbed in mind.|$|E
60|$|Well, I had the dragoons {{behind me}} and the hussars in front. Never since Moscow have I {{seemed to be in}} such peril. But for the honour of the brigade I had rather be cut down by a light cavalryman than by a heavy. I never drew bridle, therefore, or hesitated for an instant, but I let Violette have her head. I {{remember}} that I tried to pray as I rode, but I am a little out of practice at such things, and the only words I could remember were the prayer for fine weather which we used at the school on the evening before holidays. Even this seemed better than nothing, and I <b>was</b> <b>pattering</b> it out, when suddenly I heard French voices in front of me. Ah, mon Dieu, but the joy went through my heart like a musket-ball. They were ours--our own dear little rascals from the corps of Marmont. Round whisked my two dragoons and galloped for their lives, with the moon gleaming on their brass helmets, while I trotted up to my friends with no undue haste, for I would have them understand that though a hussar may fly, it is not in his nature to fly very fast. Yet I fear that Violette's heaving flanks and foam-spattered muzzle gave the lie to my careless bearing.|$|E
60|$|After a {{while she}} became very cold;--so cold that that now became for the moment her {{greatest}} cause of suffering. It was mid-winter, and though the cloak she had brought was the warmest garment that she possessed, it was very insufficient for such work as the present night had brought upon her. Besides her cloak, she had nothing wherewith to wrap herself. Her feet became like ice, and then the chill crept up her body; and though she clung very close to her lover, she could not keep herself from shivering as though in an ague fit. She had no hesitation now in striving to obtain some warmth by his close proximity. It seemed to her as though the cold would kill her before she could reach Augsburg. The train would not be due there till nine in the morning, {{and it was still}} dark night as she thought that it would be impossible for her to sustain such an agony of pain much longer. It was still dark night, and the violent rain <b>was</b> <b>pattering</b> against the glass, and the damp came in through the crevices, and the wind blew bitterly upon her; and then as she turned a little to ask her lover to find some comfort for her, some mitigation of her pain, she perceived that he was asleep. Then the tears began to run down her cheeks, and she told herself that it would be well if she could die.|$|E
60|$|The great drops <b>were</b> <b>pattering</b> down on {{the deck}} and causing {{splashes}} as of ink {{on the surface of}} the oily looking water. Another half minute it was pouring with such a mighty roar on the deck that the boys below needed to shout to make each other heard. It lasted but five minutes, and then stopped as suddenly as it began. The lads at once returned to the deck.|$|R

60|$|The {{function}} of afternoon tea {{was still being}} languidly observed in the big drawing-room when Yeovil returned to Berkshire Street. Cicely was playing the part of hostess to a man of perhaps forty-one years of age, who looked slightly older from his palpable attempts to look very much younger. Percival Plarsey was a plump, pale-faced, short-legged individual, with puffy cheeks, over-prominent nose, and thin colourless hair. His mother, {{with nothing more than}} maternal prejudice to excuse her, had discovered some twenty odd years ago that he was a well-favoured young man, and had easily imbued her son with the same opinion. The slipping away of years and the natural transition of the unathletic boy into the podgy unhealthy-looking man did little to weaken the tradition; Plarsey {{had never been able to}} relinquish the idea that a youthful charm and comeliness still centred in his person, and laboured daily at his toilet with the devotion that a hopelessly lost cause is so often able to inspire. He babbled incessantly about himself and the accessory futilities of his life in short, neat, complacent sentences, and in a voice that Ronald Storre said reminded one of a fat bishop blessing a butter-making competition. While he babbled he kept his eyes fastened on his listeners to observe the impression which his important little announcements and pronouncements were making. On the present occasion he <b>was</b> <b>pattering</b> forth a detailed description of the upholstery and fittings of his new music-room.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSoft {{lithography}} is {{a technique}} of replicating the patterns with feature sizes ranging from a few nanometers to micrometers. It was originally developed by Whitesides et al. and has gained tremendous attention due to its ease of operation, cost effectiveness, possibility of patterning non-planar surfaces etc. Soft lithography can be performed {{in a variety of}} ways like Micro Contact Printing (µCP), Micro Transfer Molding (µTM), Micro Molding in Capillaries (MIMIC), Replica Molding (REM) and Solvent-Assisted Micromolding (SAMIM). In this review we discuss the salient features of this technique along with some of our own results in which silica particles have <b>been</b> <b>patter...</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Patter</b> <b>was</b> used {{sparingly}} {{until the}} second half of the 18th century, but then became an increasingly familiar feature of comic operas. An example is Bartolo's [...] "La vendetta" [...] in Act1 of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, which contains the tongue-twisting [...] "Se tutto il codice" [...] section near the end. <b>Patter</b> numbers <b>are</b> found in the comic operas of Mozart's contemporaries, Haydn, Logroscino, Piccinni and Paisiello.

60|$|Falling back {{slowly and}} firing {{constantly}} {{as they came}} the four approached the house while Pesita and his full band advanced cautiously after them. They had almost reached the house when Bridge lunged forward from his saddle. The Clark boys had dismounted and were leading their ponies inside the house. Billy alone noted the wounding of his friend. Without an instant's hesitation he slipped from his saddle, ran back to where Bridge lay and lifted him in his arms. Bullets <b>were</b> <b>pattering</b> thick about them. A horseman far in advance of his fellows galloped forward with drawn saber to cut down the gringos.|$|R

50|$|The {{phosphors}} <b>were</b> <b>pattered</b> in an RGB-BGR-RGB pattern. The focusing grid {{was aligned}} so the beam would normally focus {{down onto the}} green strips {{in the middle of}} each pair of wires. To produce different colors, say blue, the beam would have to be pulled to the right for one pixel, and then to the left for the next. Since the adjacent stripes of phosphors shared one of the wires, this meant that a single voltage setting would produce the blue color on two adjacent pixels. Since a single frame of color television does not consist of a single color, the deflection system had to be continually varied as the beam moved across the screen.|$|R

Mr. H. next stopped at a dry goods store and bought a pair of blankets, with which he loaded down the boy, who was happy enough to be so loaded; and then, turning gradually from the more frequented streets, the two were soon lost to view in one of the dimmest alleys of the city.|$|R
