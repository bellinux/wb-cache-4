5000|$|Traditionally, {{mineral waters}} were used or {{consumed}} at their spring sources, {{often referred to}} as [...] "taking the waters" [...] or [...] "taking the cure," [...] at places such as spas, baths, or wells. The term spa was used for a place <b>where</b> the <b>water</b> was consumed and bathed in; bath <b>where</b> the <b>water</b> was used primarily for bathing, therapeutics, or recreation; and well <b>where</b> the <b>water</b> was to be consumed.|$|R
5|$|In {{the upper}} {{portion of the}} watershed, {{spectacular}} erosion-related events have occurred at English Canyon Creek, <b>where</b> <b>water</b> flowing at high velocity around a bend during a flood caused several landslides in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{raw water}} intake (headworks) at Bull Run is just below Dam 2.

5|$|A lack of {{fluorine}} in {{the diet}} {{is the cause of}} a greatly increased incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries <b>where</b> <b>water</b> fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.|$|E

5|$|All cacti {{have some}} adaptations to promote {{efficient}} water use. Most cacti—opuntias and cactoids—specialize in surviving in hot and dry environments (i.e. they are xerophytes), {{but the first}} ancestors of modern cacti were already adapted to periods of intermittent drought. A small number of cactus species in the tribes Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae have become adapted to life as climbers or epiphytes, often in tropical forests, <b>where</b> <b>water</b> conservation is less important.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with {{loading and unloading}} ramps <b>where</b> <b>water</b> and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk {{from the town of}} Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} during the first months of 2006. The main hurdle came up with the location. Barjatya wanted to shoot film in an {{authentic}} way. He asked the film's art director Sanjay Dhobade to create the entire town of Madhupur that can give a realistic look, particularly portions <b>where</b> <b>water</b> leaking takes place and portions where spit marks were visible {{on the walls of the}} buildings in the film. Later, the town was created in film city, Mumbai. Outdoor session of the film was done in Delhi, Lonavla, Ranikhet, Nainital and Almora.|$|E

5|$|Flooding from Komen was {{worst in}} Rakhine State, <b>where</b> <b>water</b> {{distribution}} was contaminated, and entire towns were largely destroyed. Waters started to recede by August4, allowing residents to return home; by September 2015, {{most of the}} displaced residents nationwide had returned home. High winds in Lailenpi within Chin State damaged a school and a training center for community health workers. Four schools were damaged nationwide by Komen alone. The storm and the preceding floods damaged 490,000houses and destroyed another 21,000, causing 132deaths, at least 55 of whom in Rakhine State. Komen was directly responsible for at least 39deaths in the country.|$|E
5|$|Pound lock: Indirect {{evidence}} suggests that pound locks {{may have been used}} in antiquity by the Ptolemaic Greeks and the Romans. In China, although the one gate canal flash lock existed beforehand, the two-gate pound lock was invented in 984 by an official of Huainan and engineer named Qiao Weiyo, during the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), so that ships could safely travel along canal waterways having gated and segmented chambers <b>where</b> <b>water</b> levels could be regulated. The economic and transport benefits of this innovation were described by the polymath official and inventor Shen Kuo (1031–1095) in his Dream Pool Essays.|$|E
5|$|The Everglades Forever Act, {{introduced}} by Governor Lawton Chiles in 1994, {{was an attempt}} to legislate the lowering of phosphorus in Everglades waterways. The act put the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in charge of testing and enforcing low phosphorus levels: 10parts per billion (ppb) (down from 500ppb in the 1980s). The SFWMD built Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) near sugarcane fields <b>where</b> <b>water</b> leaving the EAA flows into ponds lined with lime rock and layers of peat and calcareous periphyton. Testing has shown this method to be more effective than previously anticipated, bringing levels from 80ppb to 10ppb.|$|E

5|$|The {{most popular}} kind of coral kept is soft coral, {{especially}} zoanthids and mushroom corals, which are especially {{easy to grow}} and propagate {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, because they originate in enclosed parts of reefs <b>where</b> <b>water</b> conditions vary and lighting may be less reliable and direct. More serious fishkeepers may keep small polyp stony coral, which is from open, brightly lit reef conditions and therefore much more demanding, while large polyp stony coral is a sort of compromise between the two.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} abundance of {{different species of}} plants in ecological communities including forests and grasslands may be determined {{in part by the}} level of defensive compounds in the different species. Since the cost of replacement of damaged leaves is higher in conditions where resources are scarce, it may also be that plants growing in areas <b>where</b> <b>water</b> and nutrients are scarce may invest more resources into anti-herbivore defenses.|$|E

Director Singh also drew inspiration from the Italian painter Caravaggio and the video is laden with religious imagery such as Saint Sebastian, the Biblical episode of the Incredulity of Thomas and Hindu deities, portrayed in a series of tableaux.|$|E
