40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the time-dependent buckling behaviour of continuous composite steelconcrete T-section beams <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> shear connection. Creep and shrinkage effects in composite steel-concrete structures may cause a redistribution of internal actions within a member, which increases significantly the compression within the steel component, and that may lead to erosion of the buckling resistance of the steel member. In this paper, models for the in-plane analysis of continuous composite beams <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> shear connection stiffness and subjected to creep and shrinkage of the slab, and the out-of-plane buckling analysis capable of predicting local, distortional and lateral buckling modes are combined to study the time-dependent buckling behaviour of continuous composite beams. A parametric study is then undertaken to evaluate the effects of shear connection stiffness and geometric beam properties on the long-term elastic buckling capacities of these beams, and some conclusions are drawn.

5|$|Thorium is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} and electropositive metal. With a standard reduction potential of −1.90V for the Th4+/Th couple, it is somewhat more electropositive than zirconium or aluminium. Finely divided thorium metal can exhibit pyrophoricity, spontaneously igniting in air. When heated in air, thorium turnings ignite and burn with a brilliant white light to produce the dioxide. In bulk, the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow, although corrosion may eventually occur after several months; most thorium samples are contaminated <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> the dioxide, which greatly accelerates corrosion.
