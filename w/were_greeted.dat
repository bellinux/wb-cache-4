5|$|Crowds {{gathered}} across Tyrone {{the following}} day to celebrate {{the arrival of the}} Sam Maguire Cup. The players' homecoming began at Aughnacloy before moving on to Ballygawley and Omagh, where upwards of 40,000 fans gathered. Despite their defeat, Armagh <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> by hundreds of fans on the LouthArmagh border on their return.|$|E
5|$|The {{second was}} a staged {{publicity}} event, {{suggested by the}} reporter Charles Lesne, which took place on Thursday 8 May 1930. During the stunt, the 15-year-old Lucien Pepermans, a friend of Hergé's who had Tintin's features, arrived at Brussels' Gare du Nord railway station aboard the incoming Liège express from Moscow, dressed in Russian garb as Tintin and accompanied by a white dog; in later life Hergé erroneously claimed that he had accompanied Pepermans. They <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> by a crowd of fans, who mobbed Pepermans and pulled him into their midst. Proceeding by limousine to the offices of , they <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> by further crowds, largely of Catholic Boy Scouts; Pepermans gave a speech on the building's balcony, before gifts were distributed to fans.|$|E

5|$|As a team, the Australians <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> by record {{crowds and}} gate {{receipts}} across the country, even when wet weather curtailed the matches. The record attendance for a Test match in England was broken three times, in the Second Test at Lord's, the Third Test at Old Trafford, and the Fourth Test at Headingley. The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain {{a record for}} a Test on English soil.|$|E
5|$|Billy and Frank stopped {{first at}} the Grand Hotel on Allen Street, and <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> by Doc Holliday. They learned {{immediately}} after of their brothers' beatings by the Earps within the previous two hours. The incidents had generated {{a lot of talk}} in town. Angrily, Frank said he would not drink, and he and Billy left the saloon immediately to seek Tom. By law, both Frank and Billy should have left their firearms at the Grand Hotel. Instead, they remained fully armed.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Bradman, generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time, {{and the fact that}} he had announced that it was his farewell international tour, the Australians <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> with much fanfare across the country, and many records for match attendances were broken. The record for Test attendance at a match in England was broken three times, in the Second, Third and Fourth Tests, and stands to this day.|$|E

5|$|McCormick {{increasingly}} {{resented the}} favours FitzRoy gave to assist Darwin with collecting. On 16 February, FitzRoy landed a small party including himself and Darwin on St. Paul's rocks, finding the seabirds so tame {{that they could}} be killed easily, while an exasperated McCormick was left circling the islets in a second small boat. That evening novices <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> by a pseudo-Neptune, and in the morning they crossed the equator with the traditional line-crossing ceremony.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Thursday, April 16, 1948, the Leaf players <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> by thousands of Toronto fans as they got off the train from Detroit. They then rode open cars through a cascade of multi-coloured paper and ticket tape through Toronto's business district {{to arrive at a}} civic reception at City Hall. Speaking to the huge crowd, Conn Smythe announced that Kennedy was succeeding Syl Apps as captain who was retiring.|$|E

5|$|The {{years after}} their {{back-to-back}} championships saw a return to mediocrity for the Argos. Ticket sales remained flat, and there were changes in ownership. Gimmicks to attract fans <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> with criticism. The Argos seemingly bottomed out in July 2003 when the CFL stripped control over the team from owner Sherwood Schwarz. The team had amassed debts of over $20 million, including $17.4 owed to Schwarz himself.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} {{four thousand}} Beatles' fans were present on 7 February 1964 as Pan Am Flight 101 left Heathrow Airport. Among the passengers were the Beatles, {{on their first}} trip to the United States as a band, with their entourage of photographers and journalists, and Phil Spector. When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed JohnF.KennedyAirport, they <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> by a second large crowd, with Beatles fans again estimated to number four thousand, and journalists, two hundred. From having so many people packed in a little space, a few people in the crowd got injured. The airport had not previously experienced such a large crowd.|$|E
5|$|In August 1936 the Middletons made {{a leisurely}} drive to New York City where they boarded a ship for the Philippines. The trip took them 42 days and {{included}} {{passage through the}} Panama Canal with stops in Panama, San Francisco, Hawaii, and Guam. When they arrived in Hawaii, they <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> by George Patton and his wife Bea. Patton was on duty in Honolulu and had sailed his own boat from San Diego to Hawaii, and later sailed {{it back to the}} states {{at the end of his}} tour.|$|E

5|$|The band {{arrived in}} Japan on 9 August, {{a week before}} the tour started, to a strong reception, and <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> with gifts and flowers. Birch was not {{confident}} that the recording quality would be satisfactory, since the equipment supplied by Warner Bros. did not have any balance control and that the recorder's size did not appear big enough on sight to capture a commercial quality recording. The band were uninterested in the end result, concentrating on simply being able to deliver a good show. Lord later noticed however that he felt this attitude meant the spontaneity of the performances and interplay between the band members was captured well.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{seventeen}} {{people were}} indicted {{by a federal}} grand jury and five were found guilty of wilfully interfering with a marshal in performance of his duties (Braden, Patterson, Pryor, Purcell, and John J. Doyle, a leader in the Settler's League). They were convicted in federal court (with Judge Sawyer presiding) and sentenced to eight months in prison and fined $300 each. Their time spent in imprisonment was hardly difficult. Three of the men's wives were allowed to live with them, and Susan Curtis, daughter of one of the jailers, fell in love with and later married Braden. Upon their release in September 1881, they <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> by a joyous crowd of 3,000 in Hanford. Such was the anti-railroad sentiment that the five were looked upon as heroes by many across California, and those killed were considered martyrs who had given their lives for a cause.|$|E
5|$|Among Western Europeans, {{there had}} long been rumors and {{expectations}} that a great Christian ally would come from the East. These rumors circulated {{as early as the}} First Crusade (1096–1099), and usually surged in popularity after the Crusaders lost a battle. A legend arose about a figure known as Prester John, who lived in far-off India, Central Asia, or perhaps even Ethiopia. This legend developed a life of its own, and some individuals who came from the East <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> with expectations that they might be forces sent by the long-awaited Prester John. In 1210, news reached the West of the battles of the Mongol Kuchlug (d. 1218), leader of the largely Christian tribe of the Naimans. Kuchlug's forces had been battling the powerful Khwarezmian Empire, whose leader was the Muslim Muhammad II of Khwarezm. Rumors circulated in Europe that Kuchlug was the mythical Prester John, again battling the Muslims in the East.|$|E

5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} they <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> by {{a frenzy}} of excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E
5|$|At 4:00pm, {{following}} {{a period of}} artillery preparation, the commandos launched their attack. Amidst thick mist and heavy rain, the attack went badly from the start. Shortly after stepping off, No. 5 Troop was ambushed by a German force disguised as locals, reducing its strength to just five men. The main assault force pressed on, although by now it consisted of only 67 men due to earlier losses. Part of the assault force—No. 6 Troop—took heavy fire and lost forward momentum; however, the other two troops gained {{the top of the}} hill and broke in to the German position. Upon reaching the summit they <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> by an intense volume of heavy machine gun fire and at this point it became clear that the preparatory bombardment had not been successful. Calls for further artillery support were denied due to a shortage of ammunition amongst the field batteries and eventually after a number of unsuccessful attempts at taking the position the commandos were forced to retire.|$|E
5|$|During Beebe's later years, Simla was an {{important}} gathering point for researchers in many other areas of biology. Other biologists who visited to conduct studies there and exchange ideas with Beebe included myrmecologist Ted Schneirla, ethologist Konrad Lorenz, entomologist Lincoln Brower, ethologist Donald Griffin, and ornithologist David Snow. Snow became a regular visitor to Simla, and in return Beebe provided financial assistance for some of Snow's own research. Beebe devised an unusual method for determining how he would react to his visitors at Simla. His terrace there was decorated with statues of characters from Winnie-the-Pooh {{that had been a}} gift from A. A. Milne. Visitors who recognized these characters as Milne's creations <b>were</b> <b>greeted</b> by Beebe with enthusiasm, while those who did not recognize them were just endured by Beebe until they left.|$|E

I have come for trophies and nothing else. The least thing I can do is help AEK achieve their expectations after the way I <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> at the airport." ...|$|R
