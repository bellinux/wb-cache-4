5000|$|In {{his review}} for the Washington Post, Tom Shales praised Tom Sizemore's performance: [...] "What saves it, really, {{is the key}} performance: Tom Sizemore as Detective Sam Cole, head {{of one of those}} elite teams inside the police force that get to dress <b>well</b> and <b>barge</b> in without search {{warrants}} and so on. Sizemore veritably storms the screen in one of those can't-look-away performances that make a character instantly indelible. You feel you recognize Sam Cole and yet never saw anyone exactly like him before." ...|$|R

5|$|The site {{on which}} the SIS {{building}} stands had been {{the location of the}} Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in the 19th century. Several industrial buildings were subsequently built on the site after the demolition of the pleasure gardens in the 1850s, including a glass factory, a vinegar works and a gin distillery. Archeological excavation of the site during building found the remains of seventeenth century glass kilns, as <b>well</b> as <b>barge</b> houses and an inn called The Vine.

5|$|Barges {{were also}} used to {{transport}} ice, particularly along the Hudson River, doubling on occasion as storage units as <b>well.</b> These <b>barges</b> could carry between 400 and 800 tons (400,000 to 800,000kg) of ice and, like ice carrying ships, windmills were typically installed to power the barge's bilge pumps. Barges were believed to help preserve ice from melting, as the ice was stored beneath the deck and insulated by the river. Charlie Morse introduced larger, seagoing ice barges in the 1890s in order to supply New York; these were pulled by schooners and could each carry up to 3,000 tons (three million kg) of ice.|$|R

5000|$|The {{company was}} descended from Coulburn Lobnitz & Company, {{established}} in 1874, and the adjacent shipyard of William Simons & Co, established in 1860. Both builders specialised {{in the construction}} of dredgers and hopper barges. The two companies amalgamated in 1957 as Simons-Lobnitz Ltd. Faced with declining business the Renfrew yard finally closed in 1964 after some 1300 dredgers as <b>well</b> as <b>barges</b> and tugs had been built at the site. One late example survives: SS Shieldhall was built as a Clyde sludge boat in 1954 with reciprocating steam engines, and now operates as a pleasure cruiser on the Solent.

Her skipper was Bob Ruffles and, after him, there were Lucas, Wells, and Webb. Pauls looked after the <b>barge</b> <b>well</b> {{and she was}} found to be unusually sound and well-preserved when her last Board of Trade loadline inspection was carried out in 1964.|$|R
50|$|In 1826 it was {{the birthplace}} of Walter Bagehot a businessman, essayist and journalist, who wrote {{extensively}} about literature, government, economic affairs and other topics. He went into partnership with George Stuckey and by 1866 the company owned 14 East Indiamen as <b>well</b> as 19 <b>barges</b> on the River Parrett. This developed into the Somerset Trading Company. Stuckey's Bank had been founded in 1770 and by 1909 its banknote circulation was second only {{to that of the}} Bank of England. It was then taken over by Parr's Bank which became part of the Westminster Bank.|$|R
50|$|Elkhorn River—Wisner {{is located}} {{directly}} {{on the border of}} this tributary of the Platte River, and it has been the source of several momentous events, such as major floods in 1966 and 1994, as <b>well</b> as a <b>barge</b> accident that killed three children in 1888. Because the river runs at a southeast angle, the roads of Wisner run a similar path, and very few roads in Wisner actually run truly north, south, east or west, but at a severely altered angle. In June 2010 floodwaters washed away the approach to the bridge, inconveniencing local travel and commerce.|$|R

50|$|Virtual Boy Wario Land for the Virtual Boy is {{very similar}} to other Wario {{platforming}} games. Similarly to the original Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, Wario can collect different hats to give himself new abilities. The Dragon Hat allows Wario to use a flamethrower against his enemies, but must recharge (he also cannot barge). The Bull Helmet makes his barge attack faster and a lot more powerful along with the ability to do a ground pound, which can be used to crush his enemies and break blocks below. The Eagle Hat allows Wario to fly as <b>well</b> as <b>barge</b> while in mid-air. By combining the Eagle Hat with the Dragon Hat, Wario earns the King Dragon Hat with the powers of all three caps (except barging). In each stage, Wario must collect treasure and find a key to unlock the elevator to the next stage. Also, as in other Wario games, the player has an opportunity to find different treasures hidden around the stages to increase his or her overall score. There are also a few mini-games located between stages, in which Wario can gamble with the loot he has collected so far.|$|R
60|$|James Clinton, also, who had {{charge of}} the posts in the Highlands, {{was put on the}} alert. That trusty officer was now a brigadier-general, having been {{promoted}} by Congress, on the 8th of August. He was charged to have all boats passing up and down the river rigidly searched, and the passengers examined. Beside the usual sentries, a <b>barge,</b> <b>well</b> manned, was to patrol the river opposite to each fort every night; all barges, row-boats, and other small craft, between the forts in the Highlands and the army, were to be secured in a place of safety, to prevent their falling into the enemy's hands and giving intelligence. Moreover, a French engineer was sent up to aid in strengthening and securing the passes.|$|R
50|$|On 19 April, the German {{frontline}} was broken, this {{having been}} first signalled to Command HQ by the Group. The Allied forces {{had to set}} up bridgehead across the River Pó, before the German forces crossed it. This was {{to be done on}} the 23 April, after a softening up of the German defences by the Air Force on the previous day. On 22 April 1945, the day dawned cold, overcast and foggy. The three flights took off at five-minute intervals starting at 8:30 AM, to attack targets in the San Benedetto region, destroying bridges, barges and motorized vehicles. At 10:00 AM, a flight took off for an armed reconnaissance mission south of Mantua — more than 80 trucks and vehicles were destroyed. Other aircraft attacked fortified German positions, tanks and barges. By the end of the day, the Group had flown 44 individual missions, having destroyed more than a hundred vehicles as <b>well</b> as <b>barges,</b> etc. Two P-47s were damaged and a third was shot down, its pilot, 2º Ten.-Av. Armando de S. Coelho, being taken prisoner. This was the day when more sorties than ever were made by the Group, and is commemorated each year as the Brazilian Fighter Arm Day.|$|R
50|$|The Iraqi Navy {{was almost}} {{completely}} destroyed during the Gulf War of 1991. The force had 19 ships sunk and 6 vessels damaged. In total, more than 100 Iraqi ships were destroyed. The Navy was not rebuilt and played little {{part in the}} Iraq War (2003). One exception was two mine warfare vessels captured by US Navy and Coast Guard units during the assault on Al Faw; The tug Jumariya, towing a <b>well</b> camouflaged minelaying <b>barge,</b> and the tug Al Raya, which had been outfitted as a minelayer itself. Of the units that remained by late 2002, most were in a poor state of repair and the crews were in a poor state of readiness. Whatever units that remained after 1991 were used primarily for safeguarding Saddam's palaces on the Tigris river.|$|R

60|$|The {{next day}} she was taken from her palace at Greenwich up the river, {{probably}} in a <b>barge</b> <b>well</b> guarded by armed men, to the Tower of London. The Tower is an ancient and very extensive castle, consisting of {{a great number of}} buildings inclosed within a high wall. It is in the lower part of London, {{on the bank of the}} Thames, with a flight of stairs leading down to the river from a great postern gate. The unhappy queen was landed at these stairs and conveyed into the castle, and shut up in a gloomy apartment, with walls of stone and windows barricaded with strong bars of iron. There were four or five gentlemen, attendants upon the queen in her palace at Greenwich, whom the king suspected, or pretended to suspect, of being her accomplices in crime, that were arrested at the same time with her and closely confined.|$|R
50|$|Sarah waits with Chuck at {{home until}} Ellie returns. She tells them {{the doctors were}} unable to save Whitney and she {{believes}} he was poisoned, then decides to go to bed. Sarah takes Awesome's comments about their relationship seriously, and announces to Chuck that {{for the purposes of}} their cover, it's time they make love. The next morning Lou returns to bring Chuck a sandwich to thank him for fixing her phone. Sarah arrives, and Lou leaves in disgust at the thought Chuck would cheat on his girlfriend, despite Chuck's protests. Sarah, Chuck and Casey examine Whitney's corpse and discover a bug behind his ear. Meanwhile, Payne, disguised as a police officer, goes to Ellie's house and exposes her to his poisoned pentathol derivative, while also planting a bug on her. That night Sarah arrives at Chuck's home. Although nothing is actually going to happen and everything is for appearances, she and Chuck get into a fight. She realizes that Chuck is interested in Lou, but because of their cover, pursuing a real relationship outside their cover would be extremely difficult. Ellie, under the effects of pentathol, gets into a fight with Awesome as <b>well,</b> and <b>barges</b> into Chuck's room. They all take Ellie out to the living room while Casey, listening in over his bugs, picks up cross-talk interfering with his signal and comes to investigate. Ellie passes out, and they discover that she has been bugged just like Whitney.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} August Cameron's {{forces had}} grown to 6000 effectives. He had the {{armoured}} 40-ton paddle-steamer Avon—20m long, drawing one metre of water and armed with a 12-pounder Armstrong in the bows—as <b>well</b> as boats, <b>barges</b> and canoes. But Māori defences had also grown: the so-called Meremere Line—a 22km-long line of fortifications that spread from Pukekawa to Meremere and Paparata—had been built, commanding about 2000 square kilometres of bush and manned by a force of up to 1500. The Meremere Line allowed bands of between 20 and 200 Māori warriors to freely cross the Waikato River and harass troops and kill settlers towards Auckland. On 25 August a party of Māori snatched up the rifles and ammunition {{from a group of}} 25 soldiers who were timber-felling beside the Great South Road—part of an effort to destroy cover for Māori raiders intent on mounting further ambushes—and killed two soldiers. On 2 September a British party of 62 men was fired on from the rear during a march on the village of Pokeno, but managed to pursue their attackers and inflict some casualties.|$|R

I believe he is only acting as agent for another more dangerous rascal than himself. We are not prepared at the present moment to arrest the chief scoundrel. Before we do that we must obtain evidence that will render his conviction a certainty. We have reason to believe that this man that you know will not come down for some time, and that you will receive the money for the child's keep by post; but if we abstain altogether from prosecuting you in this matter, you must give us your word that you will not take any steps whatever {{to let them know that}} the child is no longer with you. He says that you promised to take him out in your <b>barge.</b> <b>Well,</b> if by any chance this man--not your man, but the other--comes down here, and wants to see the child, you or your wife will lead him to believe that he is on board your barge.

60|$|Gihon, {{that had}} seen many sports, learned {{to know the}} Hunt <b>barge</b> <b>well.</b> He met her {{rounding}} his bends on grey December dawns to music wild and lamentable as the almost forgotten throb of Dervish drums, when, high above Royal's tenor bell, sharper even than lying Beagle-boy's falsetto break, Farag chanted deathless war against Abu Hussein and all his seed. At sunrise the river would shoulder her carefully into her place, {{and listen to the}} rush and scutter of the pack fleeing up the gang-plank, and the tramp of the Governor's Arab behind them. They would pass over the brow into the dewless crops where Gihon, low and shrunken, could only guess what they were about when Abu Hussein flew down the bank to scratch at a stopped earth, and flew back into the barley again. As Farag had foretold, it was evil days for Abu Hussein ere he learned to take the necessary steps and to get away crisply. Sometimes Gihon saw the whole procession of the Hunt silhouetted against the morning-blue, bearing him company for many merry miles. At every half mile the horses and the donkeys jumped the water-channels--up, on, change your leg, and off again like figures in a zoetrope, till they grew small along the line of waterwheels. Then Gibon waited their rustling return through the crops, and took them to rest on his bosom at ten o'clock. While the horses ate, and Farag slept with his head on Royal's flank, the Governor and his Inspector worked {{for the good of the}} Hunt and his Province.|$|R
