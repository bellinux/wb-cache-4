Moments before his hanging, {{the discovery of}} the suicide note saves him. Louis finds both Edith and Sibella waiting for him outside the prison. When a reporter tells him that Tit-Bits magazine wishes to publish his memoirs, Louis suddenly remembers that he left his detailed confession in his cell.|$|E
5|$|San Martín {{proposed}} to mediate between Buenos Aires and the Federal League led by Artigas. He {{thought that the}} civil war was counter-productive to national unity, and that an end to hostilities <b>would</b> <b>free</b> resources needed for the navy. He calculated that Artigas might condition the peace on a joint declaration of war to colonial Brazil; so San Martín {{proposed to}} defeat the royalists first and then demand {{the return of the}} Eastern Bank to the United Provinces. O'Higgins recommended caution, fearing that San Martín might be captured. Pueyrredón rejected the mediation, as he did not recognize Artigas as an equal to negotiate with him.|$|E

5|$|The {{virtue of}} {{electronic}} realizations like the Kibble balance {{is that the}} definition and dissemination of the kilogram {{would no longer be}} dependent upon the stability of kilogram prototypes, which must be very carefully handled and stored. It <b>would</b> <b>free</b> physicists from the need to rely on assumptions about the stability of those prototypes. Instead, hand-tuned, close-approximation mass standards would simply be weighed and documented as being equal to one kilogram plus an offset value. With the Kibble balance, while the kilogram would be delineated in electrical and gravity terms, all of which are traceable to invariants of nature; it would be defined {{in a manner that is}} directly traceable to just three fundamental constants of nature. The Planck constant defines the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre. By fixing the Planck constant, the definition of the kilogram would depend only on the definitions of the second and the metre. The definition of the second depends on a single defined physical constant: the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium 133 atom Δν(133Cs)hfs. The metre depends on the second and on an additional defined physical constant: the speed of light c. If the kilogram is redefined in this manner, mass artifacts—physical objects calibrated in a Kibble balance, including the IPK—would no longer be part of the definition, but would instead become transfer standards.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, the German Zionist Max Bodenheimer {{founded the}} {{short-lived}} German Committee for Freeing of Russian Jews, {{with the goal}} of establishing a buffer state (Pufferstaat) within the Jewish Pale of Settlement, composed of the former Polish provinces annexed by Russia, being de facto protectorate of the German Empire that <b>would</b> <b>free</b> Jews in the region from Russian oppression. The plan, known as Judeopolonia, soon proved unpopular with both German officials and Bodenheimer's colleagues, and was dead by the following year.|$|E
25|$|It was the North British Locomotive Company of Glasgow, Scotland which {{secured the}} {{order for the}} P class {{locomotives}} in 1924, ahead of several other companies including Thompson & Co of Victoria. North British was to supply ten locomotives with delivery inside of 33-weeks, which would be {{in time for the}} 1924/1925 wheat harvest when the introduction of the P class locomotives <b>would</b> <b>free</b> up other locomotives for use on wheat trains. Accordingly, six locomotives entered traffic in December 1924, followed by an additional four in February 1925.|$|E

25|$|In {{her book}} Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45, Barbara Tuchman wrote that Stilwell was sacrificed as a {{political}} expedient because of his inability {{to get along with}} his allies in the theater. Some historians, such as David Halberstam in his final book, , have theorized that Roosevelt was concerned that Chiang would sign a separate peace with Japan, which <b>would</b> <b>free</b> many Japanese divisions to fight elsewhere, and that Roosevelt wanted to placate Chiang. The power struggle over the China Theater that emerged between Stilwell, Chennault, and Chiang reflected the American political divisions of the time.|$|E
25|$|In 1844, {{before leaving}} Missouri, Ford promised his slaves Polly and Robin Holmes that he <b>would</b> <b>free</b> them after {{reaching}} Oregon {{and establishing a}} farm. However, Ford did not keep this promise and only years later did he agree to free any of the family. Finally, in 1852, Robin Holmes sued Ford in civil court to free his family, as slavery was illegal in the territory. Eleven months later the new {{chief justice of the}} supreme court arrived and the case was heard July 13, 1854. Judge Williams freed the family, but never mentioned slavery in his decision.|$|E
25|$|No {{reconciliation}} ever {{occurred between}} husband and wife; instead, the Earl and Farren waited expectantly for Lady Derby's death, which <b>would</b> <b>free</b> him for remarriage. The Countess of Derby died on 14 March 1797 of tuberculosis, and her widowed husband married Farren {{less than two}} months later, following her retirement from the stage. Roy Hattersley and Hannah Grieg suggest that Lady Derby's social crime was not that she openly consorted with the Duke, but that she left her husband, while Robert Sackville-West, 7th Baron Sackville states that her mistake was in not conducting the affair more privately.|$|E

25|$|Haiti is the world's oldest black {{republic}} {{and one of}} the oldest republics in the Western Hemisphere. Although Haiti actively assisted the independence movements of many Latin American countries – and secured a promise from the great liberator, Simón Bolívar, that he <b>would</b> <b>free</b> their slaves after winning independence from Spain – the nation of former slaves was excluded from the hemisphere's first regional meeting of independent nations, held in Panama in 1826. Furthermore, owing to entrenched opposition from Southern slave states, Haiti did not receive U.S. diplomatic recognition until 1862 (after those states had seceded from the Union) – largely through the efforts of anti-slavery senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|A {{compromise}} {{was eventually}} established in which Britain would keep {{troops on the}} European continent {{under the command of}} the Duke of Brunswick, while Pitt was given authority to launch several colonial expeditions. He sent forces to attack French settlements in West Africa and the West Indies, operations which were tactically successful and brought financial benefits. In Britain a popular surge of patriotism and support for the government resulted. Pitt formed a triumvirate to direct operations with George Anson in command of the navy and John Ligonier in charge of the army. A Militia Act was passed to create a sizable force to defend Britain which <b>would</b> <b>free</b> up regular troops for operations overseas.|$|E
25|$|In 1819 Congressman James Tallmadge, Jr. of New York {{initiated}} {{an uproar}} in the South when he proposed two amendments to a bill admitting Missouri to the Union {{as a free}} state. The first barred slaves from being moved to Missouri, and the second <b>would</b> <b>free</b> all Missouri slaves born after admission to the Union at age 25. With the admission of Alabama as a slave state in 1819, the U.S. was equally divided with 11 slave states and 11 free states. The admission of the new state of Missouri as a slave state would give the slave states {{a majority in the}} Senate; the Tallmadge Amendment would give the free states a majority.|$|E

25|$|Needing {{to present}} Congress with reports of progress, Secretary of War William Eustis urged Dearborn to {{promptly}} embark for Albany and plan and make preparations for {{an invasion of}} Montreal in Canada. Dearborn maintained, however, that he must first get to New England and secure the militia for defending the New England coast, which <b>would</b> <b>free</b> up the regular troops of the region for the coming campaign against Canada, and before the Federalists effected an open revolt there. After disputes with New England's several Federalist governors, who refused to supply the militia for coastal defense, Dearborn reluctantly left New England for Albany with regular troops in late July, leaving the coast almost defenseless against British coastal attacks.|$|E
25|$|In 1831, Birney began {{considering}} {{moving to}} Illinois, {{as he was}} troubled {{with the idea of}} his children growing up in a slave state. He mentioned a move to Illinois frequently, stating he <b>would</b> <b>free</b> his remaining slave Michael, Michael's wife and three children there. However, this never came to pass. In 1832, the American Colonization Society offered him a position as an agent who traveled around the south promoting their cause and he accepted. He met with some success, including organizing the departure of settlers to Liberia and writing essays in defense of colonization. However, in failing to convert his audience to colonization, he began to doubt its effectiveness and the acceptability of slavery. In 1832, he had decided to return to Danville, Kentucky.|$|E
25|$|The {{largest and}} most {{significant}} of these uprisings occurred in 1835 in Salvador, called the Muslim Uprising of 1835. It was planned by an African-born Muslim ethnic group of slaves, the Malês, as a revolt that <b>would</b> <b>free</b> all of the slaves in Bahia. While organized by the Malês, all of the African ethnic groups were represented in the participants, both Muslim and non-Muslim. However, there is a conspicuous absence of Brazilian-born slaves {{who participated in the}} rebellion. An estimated 300 rebels were arrested, of which nearly 250 were African slaves and freedmen. Brazilian-born slaves and ex-slaves represented 40% of the population of Bahia, but a total of two mulattoes and three Brazilian-born blacks were arrested during the revolt. What's more, the uprising was efficiently quelled by mulatto troops by the day after its instigation.|$|E

25|$|After the Italian defeats in the Balkans and North Africa, exaggerated {{reports of}} British and Ethiopian troops {{operating}} from Sudan and increasing hostility from the Ethiopian population, a retirement by the Italians from western Gojjam, to Bahrdar Giorgis and Debre Marqos appeared imminent. A retreat <b>would</b> <b>free</b> the road needed by Gideon Force and on 19 February, the force reached Matakal, by a route which was found passable by the camel trains. Selassie and Gideon Force rallied Arbegnoch, using loudspeakers {{to announce the}} presence of the emperor and induce local notables and Italian Askari to desert. The Dangila garrison had retreated towards Bahrdar Giorgis and Wingate ordered that the remaining garrisons on the road were to be eliminated using guerilla tactics, to magnify the threat perceived by the defenders.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid {{electric}} vehicles, {{which featured}} a combined gasoline and electric powertrain, {{were seen as}} a balance, offering an environmentally friendly image and improved fuel economy, without being hindered by the low range of electric vehicles, albeit at an increased price over comparable gasoline cars. Sales were poor, the lack of interest attributed to the car's small size {{and the lack of}} necessity for a fuel-efficient car at the time. The 2000s energy crisis brought renewed interest in hybrid and electric cars. In America, sales of the Toyota Prius (which had been on sale since 1999 in some markets) jumped, and a variety of automakers followed suit, releasing hybrid models of their own. Several began to produce new electric car prototypes, as consumers called for cars that <b>would</b> <b>free</b> them from the fluctuations of oil prices.|$|E
25|$|Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 was a {{powerful}} action that promised freedom for slaves in the Confederacy {{as soon as the}} Union armies reached them, and authorized the enlistment of African Americans in the Union Army. The Emancipation Proclamation did not free slaves in the Union-allied slave-holding states that bordered the Confederacy. Since the Confederate States did not recognize the authority of President Lincoln, and the proclamation did not apply in the border states, at first the proclamation freed only those slaves who had escaped behind Union lines. The proclamation made the abolition of slavery an official war goal that was implemented as the Union took territory from the Confederacy. According to the Census of 1860, this policy <b>would</b> <b>free</b> nearly four million slaves, or over 12% of the total population of the United States.|$|E
