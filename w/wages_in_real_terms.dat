40|$|Since 2001, an {{increasing}} income inequality {{can be observed}} in most EU Member States. On aggregate level, this development is not reflected by statistics. They indicate growing average <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>terms.</b> Detailed statistics on average wages of different income classes reveal a tendency of diverging income distribution. Employees with low incomes even have to cope with decreasing <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>terms.</b> At the same time, energy prices have risen significantly due to exceeding peak oil and reinforcing oil scarcity. Considering these trends the question arises on how the income distribution in combination with increasing transport costs influences the mobility behaviour of persons in different income groups. The thesis addresses this question by performing a system-based analysis of income distribution impacts on mobility behaviour. The integrated macroeconomic, transport and environmental model ASTRA is chosen as basic modelling framework for this work. The model has been developed since 1998 for the purpose of assessing transport strategies and is based on System Dynamics methodology. It consists of nine modules interacting with each other and covers all current 27 EU Member States plus Norway and Switzerland. The major benefit of applying the ASTRA model is determined by its integrative approach, considering feedback structures between economic, transport and environment systems. Considering different explanatory approaches on income distribution a model is developed simulating the dynamics of personal income distribution in 18 European countries. Based on the requirements of the transport and vehicle fleet module, the population is allocated into five characteristic income groups. Finally, the model is validated for the period from 1990 to 2004 with micro-census data extracted from the Luxemburg Income Study database...|$|E

25|$|The García {{government}} tried {{a series}} of major and minor new policy packages from early 1988 into 1990 to no avail. The new policies never succeeded in shutting off the rapid infusion of Central Bank credit that was feeding inflation, even when they did succeed in driving production down significantly in 1989. Manufacturing production fell 18 percent in that year, agricultural output 3 percent, and total GDP 11 percent. Simultaneously, inflation increased from a record 666 percent in 1988 to a new record of 3,399 percent for 1989. The one positive change was the external current-account deficit: the fall in domestic production and income was so steep that the current account went from a deep deficit to a substantial surplus. The internal cost was perhaps clearest <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of <b>real</b> wages: the minimum <b>wage</b> <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>terms</b> for urban labor fell 61 percent between 1987 and 1989, and average <b>real</b> <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> manufacturing fell 59 percent.|$|R
30|$|There {{are three}} {{possible}} explanations for these findings.

Given that Belgium has very low downward nominal wage rigidity, consistent with full automatic indexation, we focus on real rigidity. Downward real wage rigidity is defined as the fraction of workers who would receive a <b>wage</b> freeze <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>terms</b> if they were due for a real wage cut.

30|$|The {{results of}} the econometric {{exercise}} is best seen as multivariate determinants of {{the response to the}} question on whether the enterprise had a policy to adapt changes in base wages to inflation 22, rather than determinants of real wage rigidity. As noted in the previous section, the answers to this question were subject to serious response error, taking into account institutional arrangements for wage indexation in Slovenia as well as the WDN survey responses regarding the frequency of wage adjustments to inflation. General collective agreements covered all private sector employees in Slovenia for indexation of base wages to inflation. If all the survey responses were consistent with this institutional feature, the econometric exercise would be redundant because of lack of variability in the dependent variable. Still, wage indexation per se should not be taken as evidence of downward real wage rigidity. In Slovenia, the indexation of base wage to inflation was partial, thus allowing for a decrease in base <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>terms</b> in all years. The growth of total gross wages exceeded inflation because of additional wage increases linked to productivity gains and performance, and there was variation in annual developments in real gross wages.|$|E

Myanmar {{with a population of}} over 60 million and at 676, 578 km 2 (Burma) is the largest country of mainland Southeast Asian Region, and second largest overall in size after Indonesia. It is a country that is rich in natural resources including precious stones, oil, and natural gas, however, Myanmar {{is still one of the}} poorest countries and majority of its citizens are still living in poverty and do not enjoy the benefit of their rich natural resources even under the newly introduced political reforms. There are differences in urban and rural poverty. The urban people have more money than the rural people but rural people on subsistence agriculture have more food but no hard cash. It is argued in this paper that poverty in Myanmar is mainly caused by the mismanagement of resources and inefficiency of governance, corruption and dishonesty in resource allocations, insecurities of social and economic conditions to the people.

40|$|I {{study the}} {{short-term}} impact of surprise inflation on the primary balance by separating those budgetary items which immediately respond to inflation from non-responding ones. I assume a passive fiscal policy in a one-year horizon; therefore items fully {{controlled by the}} central government are treated as non-responding ones. In {{the case of the}} private sector and decentralised government, their responses to inflation depend on decisions. If a 1 percentage point inflation surprise is compensated in the private sector by an increase in wages and consumption, then the nominal increase of the related tax revenue is equivalent to 0. 26 % of the GDP, i. e. their real value and their proportion to the increase of the nominal GDP remains unchanged. Otherwise, the nominal value of the revenue remains unchanged, resulting in a decrease in its real value and an increase in the deficit-to-GDP ratio by 0. 26 %. Compensation decided in a decentralised government has the opposite effect, because if it is implemented, then the real value of decentralised expenditure and its proportion to the GDP remains the same through an increase in the nominal expenditure, while if the nominal expenditure is fixed, it results in a decrease of the real expenditure and approximately a 0. 13 % decrease in the deficit-to-GDP ratio. The fixing of the other nominal expenditure, which does not respond to inflation, results in a 0. 08 % decrease in the GDP-proportionate expenditure and deficit compared to an increase in the nominal GDP. Reviewing certain episodes in Hungary, we have found that owing to planning errors, the official inflation forecast usually resulted in a larger ‘surprise’ for the budget than for the private sector. Thus, {{at the time of the}} impact of the surprise on the budget, the private sector experienced either no surprise or very little, which if materialising was in most cases immediately compensated for. An exception in this case was the adjustment in 1995 - supported by an inflation surprise - when the ratio of the moderately increasing nominal tax revenue to the GDP and its real value significantly decreased. The increase of indirect taxes had an adversary effect on the increase in nominal consumption (inflationary compensation) (1995 and 2004). In addition to moderating consumption, the indirect tax increase in mid- 2006 can also moderate <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>terms</b> since it was announced after the usual wage increases. The decentralised government behaved similarly, as indicated by the experiences in the developed OECD countries. The response of the decentralised government to the moderate nominal increase in central government transfers (i. e. to the decrease in real value of their funds) was to moderate the nominal increase of decentralised expenditure, i. e. real value loss was for the most part not compensated for. The rate of compensation was larger in those years when cheap financing was available (funds from privatisation in 2000), or when the surprise was not sizeable and coincided with the uprising phase of the election-related investment cycle (1998). In 2007 the optimistic inflation projection can result in lower-than-planned central transfers in real terms, which can in turn moderate the nominal increase of decentralised expenditure. Presumably, however, the size of the planning error and its deficit-decreasing effect will be not significant. surprise inflation, inflation sensitivity, decentralised government. ...|$|E

40|$|There are {{diverging}} {{views about}} how minimum wages affect labor markets in developing countries. Advocates of minimum wages hold that they redistribute resources in a welfare-enhancing way, and can thus reduce poverty, improve productivity, and foster growth. Opponents, {{on the other}} hand, contend that minimum <b>wage</b> interventions result <b>in</b> a misallocation of labor and lead to depressed <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> the very sectors - the rural and informal urban sectors - {{where most of the}} poor are found, with the effect of wasting resources and reducing the growth rate. Data from Colombia and Mexico for the 1980 s provide an opportunity to evaluate the impact of minimum <b>wages.</b> <b>In</b> Mexico in the 1980 s, the minimum <b>wage</b> fell <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>terms</b> roughly 45 percent. By 1990, Mexico's minimum wage was about 13 percent of the average unskilled manufacturing wage. During the same period, the minimum <b>wage</b> <b>in</b> Colombia increased at nearly the same rate, reaching roughly 53 percent of the average unskilled wage. The author charts how the mandated minimum wage affected the demand for skilled and unskilled labor in both countries during that decade. Findings are as follows. <b>In</b> Mexico, minimum <b>wages</b> have had virtually no effect on <b>wages</b> or employment <b>in</b> the formal sector. The main reason: the minimum wage is not an effective wage for most firms or workers. In the informal sector, in turn, there is considerable noncompliance with the mandated minimum wage, especially among part-time and female workers. As a result, significant numbers of workers are paid at or below minimum <b>wages.</b> <b>In</b> Colombia, minimum <b>wages</b> have a much stronger impact on wages, judging from their proximity to the average wage and both cross-section and time series estimates.

25|$|Exports fell sharply, {{to around}} US$1.1billion during the 1949–54 era (a severe 1952 drought trimmed this to US$700million), {{due in part}} to a {{deterioration}} in terms of trade of about a third. The Central Bank was forced to devalue the peso at an unprecedented rate: the peso lost about 70% of its value from early 1948 to early 1950, leading to a decline in the imports fueling industrial growth and to recession. Short of central bank reserves, Perón was forced to borrow US$125million from the U.S. Export-Import Bank to cover a number of private banks' debts to U.S. institutions, without which their insolvency would have become a central bank liability. Austerity and better harvests in 1950 helped finance a recovery in 1951; but inflation, having risen from 13% in 1948 to 31% in 1949, reached 50% in late 1951 before stabilizing, and a second, sharper recession soon followed.

Judged by that criterion the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID) comes up short with its South African data.

The 95 % confidence bands suggest that inequality in 1965, {{at the height of}} apartheid, was significantly lower than in the 2000 s. This, however, {{flies in the face of}} much other evidence.

Moreover, their adjustment over time is shown to be highly responsive to real shocks.

The most likely candidates to explain wage misalignment and <b>real</b> rigidity <b>in</b> CFA countries are therefore government pay policies and (possibly) limited competition in product markets. ______________ (*) I am grateful to Ingrid Ivins, John McIntire, Peter Niessen and Abdoulaye Seck for help in gathering the data, to Raquel Artecona for assistance with the empirical analysis, and to Geoffrey Bergen, Larry Hinkle and participants in seminars in Abidjan and Lomé for comments.

40|$|Growing {{inequality}} and stagnating wages {{at the bottom}} of the earning distribution are the most striking social phenomena of the last 30 years. Moreover, the 2009 Great Recession surged unemployment and created unprecedented tension between rich and poor in most developed countries. These circumstances renewed the interest of politicians, policy makers, and economists toward public policies aimed at alleviating inequality. In this thesis, I empirically assess the effectiveness of two prominent public policies in helping the poor: the minimum wage and unemployment insurance. Minimum wage is the most radical policy tool for elevating the wages of the bottom economic bracket. However, despite several decades of microeconometric evidence for increases, the minimum wage remains a highly controversial policy. The first two chapters of this dissertation are devoted to assessing the economic effects of an unusually large and persistent increase <b>in</b> the minimum <b>wage</b> instituted <b>in</b> Hungary in 2001. The minimum wage to the median wage increased from the current U. S. level (35 %) to the level of 55 %, which is equivalent with an (~ 60 %) increase <b>in</b> the minimum <b>wage</b> <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>terms.</b> <b>In</b> the first chapter, my co-author Péter Harasztosi and I study the employment effects of this unique minimum wage reform. We propose a new approach to estimating the employment effects of a minimum wage increase that exploits information on the distribution of wages before and after the policy change. We infer the number of jobs destroyed by comparing the number of pre-reform jobs below the new minimum wage to the excess number of jobs paying at (and above) the new minimum wage. The evolution of the earning distribution in Hungary shows that this ratio is close to one, suggesting that most firms responded to the reform by raising wages instead of destroying jobs. We confirm this conclusion using comparisons across subgroups of workers with larger and smaller fractions of worker affected by the minimum wage change. Our group-level estimates, again, imply that the higher minimum wage had, at most, a small negative effect on employment, and with the standard errors we can rule out larger than - 0. 3 employment elasticities with respect to <b>wages.</b> <b>In</b> the second chapter, my co-author Péter Harasztosi and I study the economic incidence of the minimum wage polices. If minimum wage increase has a small negative effect on employment and a large effect on wages, the total remunerations allocated to low-wage workers must increase. Using a large panel of firms and the Hungarian minimum wage increase, we show that this is indeed the case: firms highly exposed to the minimum wage experienced a large increase in their total labor cost. However, this raises a question: who pays for this cost increase? We show that firms' profits are not affected in response to the minimum wage, suggesting that firm-owners do not bear the incidence of the minimum wage increase. Instead, we document that total revenue of low-paying employers increased considerably, indicating that firms passed the effect of the minimum wage to consumers. Consistent with that explanation, we show that firms facing more elastic output demand, and so less ability to pass-through the effect of the minimum wage, experienced larger employment losses and lower increase in their total labor cost. In the third chapter, Stefanno DellaVigna, Balázs Reizer, Johannes Schmieder and I scrutinize the job search behavior of the unemployed. We propose a model of job search with reference-dependent preferences, where the reference point is given by recent income. Newly unemployed individuals are faced with a loss because their recent past income is higher than the unemployment benefit they receive, and so they search hard. However, over time they get used to lower income, and thus search less. They search harder, again, in anticipation of a benefit cut, only to ultimately get used to the change. The model fits the typical shape of the exit from unemployment, including the spike at the UI exhaustion point. The model also makes unique predictions for the response of benefit changes. Second, we provide evidence using a reform in the unemployment system in Hungary. Most unemployment insurance programs have constant replacement rate for a fixed period, typically followed by lower benefits under unemployment assistance. In November 2005, Hungary switched from this standard single-step UI system to a two-step system, with unchanged overall generosity. We show that the system generated increased hazard rates in anticipation of, and especially following, benefit cuts in ways the standard model has a hard time fitting, even when allowing for unobserved heterogeneity. We structurally estimate the model and estimate a weight on gain-loss utility comparable to the weight of the standard utility term, and a speed of adjustment of the reference point of eight months. The results suggest that a revenue-neutral shift to multiple-step UI systems can speed exit from unemployment...|$|R

The pension policy over the last 15 years, as discussed in more detail in Sect. 2.2, shows two clear trends: (1) the value of minimum pensions has increased <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>terms,</b> while maximum pensions have been adjusted with inflation—maintaining their value <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>terms</b> but reducing their purchasing power in relation to the average wage; and (2) minimum contribution bases have been reduced <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>terms,</b> while the upper limit of contributions has remained almost constant <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|R
