5|$|Traditionally {{courses in}} Piano Tuning and Piano Technology were also {{available}} at the college. However, these were significantly reduced in the late 2000s because of {{a decline in the}} number of students studying the subjects. There has also been a reduction in the number of A-levels available for study owing to changes in the types of courses that education funding bodies supporting students at RNC are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for.</b>|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's case rested {{largely on}} their {{contention}} that Kinne {{had been so}} interested in seeing her husband removed {{that she had been}} <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> his murder, supported by the grand-jury testimony of John Boldizs. Boldizs, though nominally a witness for the prosecution, weakened his testimony on the stand during the trial by claiming that Kinne's offer to pay him $1,000 in return for James Kinne's murder could have been a joke, and Hill was forced to attack his own witness's credibility. Further prosecution testimony alleged that the Kinne's marriage had been on the verge of dissolution at the time of James Kinne's death, that Sharon Kinne's adultery had been a cause of this, and that Sharon Kinne had known that she would collect her husband's $29,000 in life insurance policies only if she were still his wife.|$|E
5|$|Schmittou {{learned from}} {{a member of the}} Metro Board of Parks and Recreation that neither the Park Board or the city of Nashville would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> such a park. So, Schmittou, along with help from country music star Conway Twitty, put {{together}} a group of investors including other country stars Cal Smith, Larry Gatlin, Jerry Reed, and Richard Sterban (bass singer of the Oak Ridge Boys), as well as other Nashvillians, in order to finance a stadium and a minor league team. Twenty shares valued at US$15,000 each were issued, with Schmittou purchasing 2shares, or 10percent of the team. The Metro Parks Board agreed to lease to Schmittou the site of Nashville's former softball fields on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification, approximately two miles (3km) south of downtown, for a period of 20years as long he built a stadium with a minimum capacity of 6,500 at a cost of at least $400,000 within 10years. In the second ten years, he would be required to pay the city seven percent of the team's total revenue.|$|E

The Soviets noticed the inflated prices that westerners were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> their horses and accordingly set high reserves on their auction lots.|$|E
30|$|The {{results also}} showed that male gender has a {{positive}} effect on the WTP amount and is statistically significant at the 10 % level indicating that males <b>will</b> be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> higher premiums <b>for</b> tiger nut yoghurt (Table 8). If a customer is male, his expected WTP amount would be 0.234 higher than a customer who is female. Table 6 also presents similar statistically significant higher WTP premiums of male consumers vis-à-vis females. This could be due to the perceived aphrodisiac properties of tiger nuts and given that most men feel shy to buy them on the street, they <b>will</b> be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more <b>for</b> any product with tiger nut as an ingredient. The aforementioned results of more males <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> higher premium <b>for</b> tiger nut yoghurt is consistent with those of Yahaya et al.

Charles Eugène de Croÿ died in 1702 and was left unburied, as nobody was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the funeral. The air conditions in the chapel where the body was held protected the corpse from decaying and it became an attraction, remaining on display until 1897, when the authorities finally buried it.|$|E
25|$|Reflecting many citizens' growing {{perception}} that Grosse Pointe {{was a real}} town, {{the need for a}} high school became a topic of debate in 1910. After a five-year battle with landowners reluctant to have their land condemned, the school district began construction of the area's first public high school in 1927. Many residents saw the construction as a symbol that Grosse Pointe completed its transition from resort to town and thus were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> one of the finest public school buildings in Michigan.|$|E
25|$|Improvements were gradual {{over the}} 1960s.

The price was determined largely by the semiconductor industry; their move to integrated circuits in the 1960s led to the availability of larger boules at lower relative prices. As their price fell, {{the price of the}} resulting cells did as well. These effects lowered 1971 cell costs to some $100 per watt.|$|E

Brevik Municipal Council passed the plans and their financing on 31 March 1893. However, there was not community consensus as to the location of Brevik Station, with large camps each preferring Strømtangen and Setretangen.

25|$|A {{combination}} of rarity (perceived or known), condition, completeness and originality determines the price a collector is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> any given edition. Rarity arguably has the strongest influence on value as editions {{known to be}} very rare (e.g. those published in the periods when paper restrictions applied during both World Wars) are very much more expensive than comparable editions from the surrounding decades. Editions such as the 1916 containing the obituary and career details of W. G. Grace; 1934, detailing the 'Bodyline' series of 1932–33; 1949, the Australian 'Invincibles' tour of 1948; 1965, the first to have a yellow dust jacket: All are rare and expensive for specific reasons.|$|E
