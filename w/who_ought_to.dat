5|$|Once leave is granted, an {{applicant}} {{moves on to}} the second stage and applies for a prerogative order by filing in the High Court a document called a summons within the legal proceedings already started earlier. This must be done between eight and 14 days after leave {{to do so is}} granted by the Court; beyond that, the leave lapses. The applicant must serve the ex parte originating summons, the statement, the supporting affidavit, the order granting leave, and the summons by which the prerogative order is actually applied for, on all persons directly affected. Where the application relates to court proceedings and is intended to compel the court or a court official to do an act relating to the proceedings, or to quash the proceedings or any order made in them, the documents must be served on the registrar of the court and the other parties to the proceedings. The documents must also be served on the judge if his or her conduct is being objected to. If the Court is of opinion that any person <b>who</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have been served with the documents has not been served, the Court may adjourn the hearing on such terms as it may direct in order that the documents may be served on that person.|$|E
25|$|Hall {{was a man}} of {{independent}} means and seems to have been careless of fame; at least he took no trouble to communicate his invention to the world. At a trial in Westminster Hall about the patent rights granted to John Dollond (Watkin v. Dollond), Hall was admitted to be the first inventor of the achromatic telescope. However, it was ruled by Lord Mansfield that it was not the original inventor <b>who</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> profit from such invention, but the one who brought it forth for the benefit of mankind.|$|E
25|$|From 1948 until 1961, Israeli {{citizens}} {{required an}} exit visa {{as well as}} a passport to travel overseas even temporarily. Initially the intention was to prevent the departure of Jews <b>who</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be fighting, but also due to a perception that those leaving harmed national solidarity. After the war the restrictions were eased somewhat but still many administrative hurdles were put in front of those wishing to leave. To prevent the outflow of foreign currency, tickets could only be purchased with money sent from abroad. The general need for an exit visa was finally abolished in 1961 after several court cases and Knesset decisions.|$|E

25|$|On October 1, {{the insurgents}} started to battle in Rancagua {{in an attempt}} to prevent the expeditionaries from taking Santiago, Chile. Maroto, manifesting a disdain for his opponents typical of {{officials}} recently arrived in the Americas, ordered his troops to attack the enemy fortifications without bothering to send in either scouts or guerrillas. The result was that Maroto's Talaveras, bombarded by the volley of shots, were forced to retreat with heavy losses. On the next day, Bernardo O'Higgins managed to make his way past the royal troops and retreat to the capital, where his opponents entered without resistance a few days later. Whether due to a belief that Maroto had conducted himself clumsily in battle or due to other, unknown reasons, although the list of officials <b>who</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be promoted after the latest victories sent by Osorio to viceroy Abascal included Maroto's name, the messenger who delivered the list nonetheless had confidential instructions to let Abascal know that Osorio believed that Maroto should not be promoted. When Maroto received word several months later that the list that had been sent to Madrid did not include his name, he lodged the appropriate complaint with Abascal, who had not liked the confusing way of proceeding and ended up finding in Maroto's favor on May 10, 1815, granting him the grade of brigadier, backdated to 8 November 1814.|$|E

The position was first offered to Costa, who demanded a higher salary than {{the directors of}} the RAM could contemplate, and then to Otto Goldschmidt, who was then professor of piano at the RAM. He declined and urged the directors to appoint Bennett.

500|$|... "Creative evolution", Shaw's {{version of}} the new science of eugenics, became an {{increasing}} theme in his political writing after 1900. He introduced his theories in The Revolutionist's Handbook (1903), an appendix to Man and Superman, and developed them further during the 1920s in Back to Methuselah. A 1946 Life magazine article observed that Shaw had [...] "always tended to look at people more as a biologist than as an artist". By 1933, {{in the preface to}} On the Rocks, he was writing that [...] "if we desire a certain type of civilization and culture we must exterminate the sort of people who do not fit into it"; critical opinion is divided on whether this was intended as irony. In an article in the American magazine Liberty in September 1938, Shaw included the statement: [...] "There are many people in the world <b>who</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be liquidated". Many commentators assumed that such comments were intended as a joke, although in the worst possible taste. Otherwise, Life magazine concluded, [...] "this silliness can be classed with his more innocent bad guesses".|$|E

500|$|When the Court {{was a part}} of the curia regis, the Officers were fluid; {{they could}} include Doctors of Civil Law, members of the curia and [...] "those <b>who</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be summoned". As the members of the curia ceased to sit as Officers, however, the {{composition}} of the court became more solid. From an early period, the Lord Chancellor was assisted by twelve Clerks in Chancery, known as the Masters in Chancery. It was said that these positions had existed since before the Norman Conquest, sitting as part of the Witenagemot. After the conquest they gradually lost their authority, and became advisers and assistants to the Lord Chancellor. It was the Masters who started court cases, issuing the initial writs without which parties could not begin cases in the common law courts. In addition, they took depositions and acted as secretaries to the Lord Chancellor, maintaining the plea rolls. In the early years they were almost always members of the clergy, called the [...] "clericos de prima forma"; it was not until the reign of Edward III that they were referred to as Masters in Chancery.|$|E

2500|$|The new {{translation}} met immediate {{opposition that}} only gathered strength {{as the weeks}} passed.

[...] The translation was considered anti-religious, anti-national, full of vulgar words, degrading the true spirit and meaning of the Gospel. [...] The accusations levelled against Pallis himself were equally devastating. [...] He was called a traitor; one who had no patrida an agent of Pan-Slavism; a foolish and despicable merchant of ivory and indigo; a sleazy person who alongside the malliari [...] was attempting to dislodge katharevousa as the official language of the state; an evil little creature <b>who</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be excommunicated."

2500|$|In 1906 Mrs E J E Pilkington and Tangye Ltd were {{referred}} to as legal owners of Black Patch, having put it up for sale after employing land agents {{to carry out a}} court imposed eviction of the Gypsies on 26 July 1905. They did not finally relinquish links with the land until a [...] "peaceful eviction" [...] was negotiated by Birmingham Corporation Parks Department on 15 February 1909. Subsequent stories contribute to reasonable doubt as to <b>who</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have inherited the Black Patch and who now holds legal title to the Gypsies' old camping ground. Rudge reports that in 1960 Jane Badger, who lived near Black Patch, got into conversation while walking by the Park with a gentleman with an American accent. He claimed he owned the deeds to the land. This story resembles a statement made by Ray Plant, a distant relative of the Black Patch Gypsies, that a family called Murdock once owned the land and gave permission to camp there. According to Ray Plant when the Murdocks emigrated to America they handed over the Black Patch deeds to the Gypsies. The deeds were apparently stolen making any of the gypsies [...] claims to the land unfounded. Many of the gypsy descendants still live in the surrounding area - the names of descendants accessible via the National Census.|$|E
2500|$|Ousby {{argued that}} given the {{widespread}} belief that the Jews in France were mostly illegal immigrants from Eastern Europe <b>who</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> {{be sent back to}} where they came from, it was remarkable that so many ordinary people were prepared to step up to attempt to save the Jews from the genocide waged by the German state assisted by Vichy France. Perhaps the most remarkable example of ordinary French people coming together to save Jews threatened with extermination was the effort of the Calvinist couple André and Magda Trocmé who brought together an entire commune Le Chambon-sur-Lignon to save between 800-1,000 Jews. Ousby further noted that the Jews in France, whether they were Israélites or immigrant or refugee Juifs, had begun the Occupation as discouraged and isolated, cut off and forced to become more and more [...] "absent from the places they lived in. Now, as the threat of absence become brutally literal, their choices were more sharply defined, more urgent even than for other people in France". Ousby used {{as an example of the}} [...] "differing fates" [...] open to French Jews from 1942 onwards the three-part dedication to the memoir Jacques Adler wrote in 1985; the first part dedicated to his father, who was killed at Auschwitz in 1942, the second to the French family who sheltered his mother and sister, who survived the Occupation, and the third to the people who were the members of the Jewish resistance group Adler joined later in 1942.|$|E
2500|$|Resistance to the {{dominant}} colonial powers comes {{in a number of}} different forms including legal or political protest, healing, and art activism. Idle No More represents an Indigenous feminist activist group that works to [...] "shift the contemporary discourses of rights, sovereignty, and nationhood by arguing that it is Indigenous women <b>who</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> hold the political power of Indigenous nations, or at the very least have an equal seat at the debate table." [...] Their major themes of activism include sovereignty, the resurgence of nationhood, environmental protection, and resistance of violence against Indigenous women. This work is being done through making changes to The Indian Act of Canada, a piece of legislation that restricts Indigenous sovereignty, as well as advocating for environmental protection. Their activism asks people, regardless of Indigenous descent or not, to honor Indigenous sovereignty and to protect the environment. Another Canadian organization that focuses and promotes Indigenous feminist ideals is the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC). They work to empower women by developing and changing legislation which affects Indigenous people. On October 4th, they encourage the community to participate in vigils entitled “Sisters In Spirit Vigils” where they honor the lives of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG). These vigils have resulted in the Government of Canada launching a National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in September 2016. This inquiry examines and reports on the violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada by looking at the patterns, underlying factors and ultimately, the systemic cause of the violence. In the United States, the National Resource Center to Enhance Safety of Native Women and their Children (NIWRC) was created “to enhance the capacity of American Indian and Alaska Native (Native) tribes, Native Hawaiians, and Tribal and Native Hawaiian organizations to respond to domestic violence.” This organization also shares in Indigenous feminist themes by their dedication sovereignty and the safety of Indigenous women and children.|$|E
