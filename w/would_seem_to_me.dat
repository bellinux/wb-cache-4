He recalled that Drake's parents had described his mood in the preceding weeks as having been very positive, and that he had planned to move back to London to restart his music career. Boyd believes that this uplift in spirits was followed by a [...] "crash back into despair". Reasoning that Drake may have taken a high dosage of antidepressants to recapture this sense of optimism, he said he prefers to imagine Drake [...] "making a desperate lunge for life rather than a calculated surrender to death". Writing in 1975, NME journalist Nick Kent commented on the irony of Drake's death {{at a time when he}} had just begun to regain a sense of [...] "personal balance". In contrast, Gabrielle Drake has said she prefers to think her brother committed suicide, [...] "in the sense that I'd rather he died because he wanted to end it than it to be the result of a tragic mistake. That <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to be terrible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{working within}} the PNA and befriending the fascists, Streitman still {{assisted}} with leftist causes. Also in 1932, he joined the staff of Facla, where he was colleagues with several leftist and rightist political commentators: Sergiu Dan, Ion Călugăru, N. Davidescu, Sandu Eliad, Nicolae Carandino. Following up on Între da și nu, he returned in late 1933 with the volume Mi se pare că... ("Signs Point to..."), at Alcaly Publishers. A praise of agnosticism and relativism, it appeared on Pompiliu Păltânea's list of notable prose works for 1934. According to Păltânea: [...] "Mr. Henri Streitman reveals his very own manner [...] of searching for the truth through the most distant detours, those that run into surprises and open up grand perspectives." [...] Doctor Ygrec, the reviewer at Adevărul, found the book amusing overall, but objected to its [...] "commonplace" [...] jokes about God as an anthropomorphism deity. Underneath this covering, [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Mr. Streiman is a religious man".|$|E
2500|$|On 16 July, Bethmann Hollweg told Count Roedern, the State Secretary for Alsace-Lorraine, that he couldn't {{care less}} about Serbia or alleged Serbian {{complicity}} in the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. All that mattered was that Austria attack Serbia that summer, {{to result in a}} win-win situation for Germany. If Bethmann Hollweg's view was correct, an Austro-Serbian war would either cause a general war (which Bethmann Hollweg believed Germany would win) or cause the Triple Entente to break up. That same day, the Russian Ambassador to Austria-Hungary reported to St. Petersburg that, [...] "Information reaches me that the Austro-Hungarian government {{at the conclusion of the}} inquiry intends to make certain demands on Belgrade... It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> desirable that at the present moment, before a final decision on the matter, the Vienna Cabinet should be informed how Russia would react to the fact of Austria's presenting demands to Serbia such as would be unacceptable to the dignity of that state".|$|E

2500|$|In November 2005 expert {{evidence}} was {{submitted to the}} High Court in London by the mothers of thirty children who claimed that during their pregnancies they were exposed to contamination from the waste removal operations and who sought to bring a legal action to try to prove {{a link between the}} mismanagement of the toxic waste and the birth defects suffered by their children. The evidence presented included reports detailing the higher rate of birth defects, and alleging that exposure to the toxic waste was the likely cause of the children's deformities. They also presented a report written by Roger Braithwaite, an environmental expert instructed by the families, which concluded that the negligent handling of the waste by Corby Borough Council demonstrated [...] "naivety, arrogance, ignorance, incompetence and a possible serious conflict of interest... At this early stage it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that these... badly polluted lands have never been effectively or comprehensively assessed, properly permitted, regulated, monitored or adequate records maintained... This is environmental negligence on a grand scale." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Wait," [...] and Dane's voice stopped him. [...] "Now, I don't fancy that <b>would</b> do. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that this}} is a case in which a woman to look after him would be necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All that I have seen," [...] Pierre replied gravely, [...] "and it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that the}} riddle may easily be read, even by you {{who claim to}} have no {{knowledge}} of military matters." ...|$|E

60|$|Please {{come over}} here. The fact {{of one of}} our {{officers}} being killed on the Patuxent is a specimen of what I <b>would</b> avoid. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> we could send white men to recruit better than to send negroes and thus inaugurate homicides on punctilio.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Master Ned," [...] she said, [...] "I {{would not}} take money, not ever so. I came down to tell you because I thought it wicked and wrong of the men to destroy the mill, and because they would no doubt have murdered Mr. Cartwright and the people there; but I {{would not take}} money for doing it. Even if nobody ever got to know of it, it <b>would</b> always <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if I had sold the hands, and they have {{suffered}} enough, God knows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where did {{you pick}} him up?" [...] Saul asked impatiently. [...] "Why did you waste time on the scoundrel? It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that after all he has done it was your {{business}} to flog, rather than make friends with him." ...|$|E

The instant that I left 'the devil's seat,' however, the circular rift vanished; nor could I {{get a glimpse}} of it afterwards, turn as I <b>would.</b> What <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the chief ingenuity in this whole business, is the fact (for repeated experiment has convinced me it is a fact) that the circular opening in question is visible from no other attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge upon the face of the rock.|$|R
6000|$|I hoped, I thought, {{she loved}} me once, and yet, I know not why, [...] There is a coldness in her speech, and a coldness in her eye.

"I {{beg your}} pardon, Caroline," [...] and Marian {{was thrown into}} herself again; but she thought a little longer, and seeing that Caroline was still waiting and musing, she ventured on saying, in a timid voice, [...] "Somehow, I think, it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the more affection there was, the more painful it would all be." ...|$|E
60|$|I ask myself--suppose {{you knew}} that by inflicting {{prolonged}} pain on 100 rabbits you could discover a way to the extirpation of leprosy, or consumption, or locomotor ataxy, or of suicidal melancholia among human beings, dare you refuse to inflict that pain? Now I am quite unable to say that I dare. That sort of daring <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to be extreme moral cowardice, to involve gross inconsistency.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{all sounds}} a little portentous to me," [...] said Edward, and in the {{lightness}} of the night Bateman {{could see that he}} was smiling.

6000|$|... "In {{the name}} of the Republic, Sir Gervaise Tresham, and I may say in that of all Italy, I thank you most heartily for the splendid service that you have {{rendered}} us. It <b>would</b> have <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> well nigh incredible that a single galley, even if commanded and manned by the most famous knights of your great Order, should have accomplished so extraordinary a feat. Still more strange is it that it should have been performed by so young a knight, with a crew composed, as Sir Fabricius Caretto has told us, of knights chosen from among the youngest of the Order." ...|$|R

"Indifferently far," [...] {{the monk}} said: [...] "'tis five-and-twenty miles hence to Moffat, and it <b>would</b> have <b>seemed</b> farther <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> had not this good fellow {{overtaken}} me, {{and fell in}} with my pace.

6000|$|... "Why impossible?" [...] and for {{the first}} time since we had come upon Horry Sims did Pierre indulge in that indescribable shrug and wave of the hands which was {{peculiar}} to him. [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that now is the time, if ever, when we can do somewhat for the Cause--when we can prove that although our company of Minute Boys numbers but three, we are of importance, and may make our names known to those who are staking their lives for the liberty of this country." ...|$|E
60|$|Then we {{need not}} appeal to history, to the {{declarations}} of {{the framers of the}} government, but we know from judge Douglas himself that slavery began to be an element of discord among the white people of this country as far back as 1699, or one hundred and sixty years ago, or five generations of men,--counting thirty years to a generation. Now, it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that it might have occurred to Judge Douglas, or anybody who had turned his attention to these facts, that there was something in the nature of that thing, slavery, somewhat durable for mischief and discord.|$|E
6000|$|With {{regard to}} Knot V., I beg to express to VIS INERTIÆ and to any others who, like her, {{understood}} the condition {{to be that}} every marked picture must have three marks, my sincere regret that the unfortunate phrase [...] "fill the columns with oughts and crosses" [...] should have caused them to waste {{so much time and}} trouble. I can only repeat that a literal interpretation of [...] "fill" [...] <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to require that every picture in the gallery should be marked.

6000|$|After the Supervisor {{had rolled}} {{himself in the}} blanket, long after all sounds had ceased in the tent, there still {{remained}} for the youth a score of manifold excitations to wakefulness. Down on the lake the muskrats and beavers were at their work. Nocturnal birds uttered uncanny, disturbing cries. Some animal with stealthy crackling tread was ranging the hillside, and {{the roar of the}} little fall, so far from lulling him to sleep--as he had imagined it would--stimulated his imagination till he could discern in it the beat of scurrying wings and the patter of pernicious padded feet. [...] "If I am appalled by the wilderness now, what <b>would</b> it <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> were I alone!" [...] he whispered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{would have}} you do as I have done, rip them out page and chapter, annihilate them utterly.

60|$|So far as I {{can judge}} the process, {{which is always}} quickly done and {{extremely}} difficult to follow, the mother lights or walks directly over the chick and holds him between her knees as she flies.

There are those--and they are hunters and keen observers--who claim that the mother carries them in her bill, as a cat carries a kitten; but how that is possible without choking the little fellows is <b>to</b> <b>me</b> incomprehensible. The bill is not strong enough at the tip, I think, to hold them by a wing; and to grasp them by the neck, as in a pair of shears, and so to carry them, <b>would,</b> it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> most certainly suffocate or injure them in any prolonged flight; and that is not the way in which wild mothers generally handle their little ones.|$|R
