5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including <b>write</b> amplification. Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel to increase performance. If the SSD has a high <b>write</b> amplification, the controller {{will be required to}} <b>write</b> that many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more time to <b>write</b> the data from the host. An SSD with a low <b>write</b> amplification will not need to <b>write</b> as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high <b>write</b> amplification.|$|E

5|$|Intel and SiliconSystems (acquired by Western Digital in 2009) {{used the}} term <b>write</b> {{amplification}} in their papers and publications as early as 2008. <b>Write</b> amplification is typically measured by the ratio of writes committed to the flash memory to the writes coming from the host system.

40|$|This study {{examined}} relationships between college students’ <b>writing</b> achievement goal orientations, <b>writing</b> self-regulation, and <b>writing</b> grades. The {{study was conducted}} in a postsecondary setting at a large public university in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Using multivariate quantitative techniques (confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling), survey and <b>writing</b> sample data were gathered to address the following research questions: Do college students’ <b>writing</b> achievement goals relate to their <b>writing</b> grades; do college students’ <b>writing</b> achievement goals relate to their <b>writing</b> self-regulation; and, does <b>writing</b> self-regulation partially mediate the relationship between <b>writing</b> achievement goals and <b>writing</b> grades in college <b>writing</b> classrooms? A convenience sample of 107 participants completed both the survey and <b>writing</b> prompt portions of the study. Findings showed that all three <b>writing</b> achievement goal orientations tested (mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance) were related to college students’ <b>writing</b> self-regulation. However, only <b>writing</b> performance-approach orientation was related to college students’ <b>writing</b> grades. Additionally, <b>writing</b> self-regualtion did not partially mediate the relationship between all three <b>writing</b> achievement goal orientations and <b>writing</b> grades as expected. <b>Writing</b> self-regulation did fully mediate the relationships between <b>writing</b> mastery and performance-avoidance goal orientations and <b>writing</b> grades, but failed to mediate the relationship between <b>writing</b> performance-approach goal orientation and <b>writing</b> grades. These findings contradict some of the prior literature on achievement goal orientations and self-regulation. However, these results help bridge a gap in the achievement goal orientation and self-regulation research, as prior studies have predominantly focused on PK- 12 settings and domains other than <b>writing</b> (reading, mathematics, science, etc.). The findings from this study are limited by the size and nature of the sample, and the survey items used. Future studies should attempt to gather further insight into the goals college students set for their <b>writing,</b> how those goals impact their self-regulation behaviors, and ultimately their <b>writing</b> grades...|$|R
