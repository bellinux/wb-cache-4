In 1961, while still working in public relations, Blatty appeared as a contestant on the Groucho Marx quiz show You Bet Your Life, winning $10,000, enough money to quit his job and to write full-time.

On {{the night of the}} duel, Rahul escapes {{with the help of a}} local policeman, Shamsher (Mukesh Tiwari), but he ends up on a ship with Sri Lankan terrorists and smugglers. A gun battle ensues between the police force and the terrorists. When the police officers investigate and take Rahul into custody, he tells his story and ends up back in Komban. Terrified and once again surrounded by Azhagusundaram's sickle-wielding henchmen, Rahul pretends to take Meena hostage and escapes with her in her father's car, battling Azhagasundaram's men. When the car breaks down, Rahul and Meena quarrel and part ways. Rahul, not knowing <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> go, returns to Meena, who takes him to the Vidhamba village. Meena tells the villagers that they are a married couple who needs protection and rest, to which the villagers agree.|$|E

While the three Doctors are in their cell, The Moment encourages the War Doctor to ask them the questions he needs answered before he decides whether to destroy Gallifrey. After a tense exchange, the Doctors devise an escape plan. They then encounter the real Queen Elizabeth and learn through her of the Zygon scheme to conquer Earth. Kate Stewart also learns of the Zygon plan and locks herself in the Black Archive with the Zygons, starting a countdown that will detonate a nuclear warhead underneath the archive. The Doctors, unable to land a TARDIS in the Black Archive, instead use the stasis cube technology to enter a painting. They exit the painting in the present and use the archive's mind-wiping equipment to render the UNIT members and Zygons temporarily unaware which of them are which.

500|$|According to the CBS {{press release}} for Rawhide, the Universal (known then as Universal-International) film company was {{shooting}} in Fort Ord when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and {{invited him to}} meet the director. According to Eastwood's official biography, the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood. While in Los Angeles, Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak Eastwood into a Universal studio, where he showed him to cameraman Irving Glassberg. Glassberg arranged for an audition under Arthur Lubin, who, although very impressed with Clint's appearance and stature at 6'4" [...] (193cm), disapproved initially of his acting skills, remarking, [...] "He was quite amateurish. He didn't know <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> turn or <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> go or do anything". [...] Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwood's initial contract in April 1954, at $100 per week. After signing, Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his teeth, a lifelong trademark.|$|E
500|$|The {{outcome of}} most votes can be {{predicted}} beforehand since political parties normally instruct members <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> vote. Parties entrust some MSPs, known as whips, {{with the task}} of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line. MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties. Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright. Thus, as with many Parliaments, the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low, and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party's policies are rare. In some circumstances, however, parties announce [...] "free votes", which allows Members to vote as they please. This is typically done on moral issues.|$|E

(Russell 1938:147) When his remarks treat of current affairs, they are often pessimistic. [...] "Although men hate one another, exploit one another, and torture one another, they have, until recently, given their reverence to those who preached {{a different way of}} life." [...] (Russell 1938: 204; emphasis added) As Kirk Willis remarked on Russell's outlook during the 1930s, [...] "the foreign and domestic policies of successive national governments repelled him, as did the triumph of totalitarian regimes on the continent and the seemingly inexorable march to war brought in their wake... Despairing that war could be avoided and convinced that such a European-wide conflict would herald a new dark age of barbarism and bigotry, Russell gave voice to his despondency in <b>Which</b> <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> Peace? (1936) – not so much a reasoned defence of appeasement as an expression of defeatism". (Russell 1938:xxii-xxiii) ...|$|E
