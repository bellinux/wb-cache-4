5|$|The {{barbed wire}} which fenced us in {{did not cause}} us any real fear.... We {{appointed}} a Jewish Council, a Jewish police, an office for social assistance, a labor committee, a hygiene department–a whole government machinery. Everyone marveled at it. We should no longer have before our eyes those hostile faces, those hate-laden stares. Our fear and anguish were at an end. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> among Jews, among brothers...|$|E
25|$|It was Fala, my husband's little dog, {{who never}} really readjusted. Once, in 1945, when General Eisenhower came {{to lay a}} wreath on Franklin's grave, {{the gates of the}} regular {{driveway}} were opened and his automobile approached the house accompanied by the wailing of the sirens of a police escort. When Fala heard the sirens, his legs straightened out, his ears pricked up and I knew that he expected to see his master coming down the drive as he had come so many times. Later, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> in the cottage, Fala always lay near the dining-room door where he could watch both entrances just as he did when his master was there. Franklin would often decide suddenly to go somewhere and Fala had to watch both entrances in order to be ready to spring up and join the party on short notice. Fala accepted me after my husband's death, but I was just someone to put up with until the master should return.|$|E
500|$|One {{day when}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> at Kawaihae my {{grandmother}} went to Hulihee to see Kuakini, {{who was not}} well. I went with her and when Kinau saw me he chased me as he always did. I think {{he did not like}} me. I ran to my grandmother and she protected me. Kuakini saw me and said to my grandmother to let the haole go and told us to [...] "hakaka" [...] (fight). She did and we fought. I beat him. Kuakini made fun of Kinau who was about six years old then.|$|E
5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>living</b> longer — {{on average}} 30 {{years longer than}} {{at the start of}} the 20th century — yet <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not <b>living</b> healthier. The {{question}} is: Are we just living dependent and sick, or <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>living</b> healthy and able to contribute? ...|$|R

500|$|McCartney later said, [...] "We lived {{backstage}} in the Bambi Kino, {{next to the}} toilets, and {{you could}} always smell them. The room had been an old storeroom, and there were just concrete walls and nothing else. No heat, no wallpaper, not a lick of paint; and two sets of bunk beds, with not very much covers—Union Jack flags—we were frozen." [...] Lennon remembered: [...] "We were put in this pigsty. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> in a toilet, like {{right next to the}} ladies' toilet. We'd go to bed late and be woken up next day by the sound of the cinema show and old German fraus [...] pissing next door." [...] After having been awoken in this fashion, the group were then obliged to use cold water from the urinals for washing and shaving. They were paid £2.50 each a day, seven days a week, playing from 8:30-9:30, 10 until 11, 11:30-12:30, and finishing the evening playing from one until two o'clock in the morning. German customers found the group's name comical, as [...] "Beatles" [...] sounded like [...] "Peedles", which meant a small boy's penis.|$|E
2500|$|While {{studying}} {{painting at}} the Royal College of Art Emin became disenchanted {{with the art}} of painting, [...] "the idea of being a bourgeois artist, making paintings that just got hung in rich people's houses was a really redundant, old fashioned idea that made no sense for the times that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> in." [...] She felt {{there was no point}} in making art that someone had made decades or centuries before her, [...] "I had to create something totally new or not at all". When asked by a reporter, when she decided that her life 'as Tracey Emin' was going to be her art, she replied '"I realised that I was much better than anything I'd ever made".|$|E
2500|$|The band {{relocated}} to College Park, Maryland, to record its debut album from June to September 2005. Although {{they only had}} shells of songs when they arrived, {{the rest of the}} album shaped up fast through the marathon session. [...] "We didn't have a day off in the five-and-a-half weeks we were there, 12 or 14 hours a day," [...] Ross said in a 2005 interview. [...] "We were making things up in our heads that weren't there, and on top of the stress of trying to finish the record, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> in a one-bedroom apartment with four people on bunk beds," [...] recalled Ross. [...] "Everyone got on everybody's nerves. Someone would write a new part for a song and someone else would say they didn't like it just because you ate their cereal that morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, darling: so I will. Perhaps {{you were}} right. As to your question, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not obliged to prove anything. That was their business. Anyhow <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>living</b> together." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "See the outings of {{the tyrant}} [...] among silent crowds with eyes {{sparkling}} [...] {{and yet the}} next day journals announce that the sovereign was acclaimed… No book can be published without reaching the tyrant. The sovereign disposes of public opinion each morning, {{as soon as he}} wakes up. There is no public opinion, there is a committee of public opinion coordinating the wishes of the crowd. Raise not your voice, or else a will spy betray you, a plain clothes man will arrest you, a gendarme or a butcher will beat you up savagely, and occasionally, in the Police cellars, your head will be crushed or put up against the wall. It is as if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> under the terror of the GPU in Lubyanka. [...] Constitutional guarantees have disappeared. We know a man can be arrested, killed. Individual security is a trifle. We have no representatives in Parliament to decide our taxes and tell our grievances." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{live for}} today, {{but it is}} nice {{sometimes}} to look back to yesterday. We {{did not know that}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> through an era - the Big Band Era - that would last only 10 years or so and be remembered and revered for ever...it's hard to believe, but the best times were packed into a five-year period from the late 1930s through the early 1940s when I sang with the bands of Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman, and Harry James. The most dramatic moments of my life were crammed into a couple of years from the fall of 1941 to the end of 1943. They seem to symbolize my life...that was when the music of the dance bands was the most popular music in the country, and I was the most popular female band singer in the country and Harry had the most popular band in the country. It didn't last long, but it sure was something while it lasted. Everyone should have something like it at least once in their lives. I'm grateful I did." [...] - Helen Forrest (circa 1982) ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>living</b> in a computer-programmed reality, and {{the only}} clue we have to it is when some {{variable}} is changed, and some alteration in our reality occurs.|$|R
60|$|My answer is, that it {{was most}} {{probably}} just like {{the world in which}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>living</b> now, with the one exception that the plants and animals are different.|$|R
6000|$|... "End it? Yes, you're right. One {{way or the}} other. Either {{go back to the}} {{old life}} or start a new one. What <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>living</b> now <b>is</b> a horrible burlesque." ...|$|R

6000|$|Lady Anna did stand up, and {{did look}} {{her mother in}} the face. [...] "Mamma," [...] she said, [...] "we should {{understand}} each other better if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> together as we ought to do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Beatrice is made {{of silent}} stuff," [...] she declared. [...] "I should never be afraid of her. All the same, I wish I could find out just where she is. It would look better if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> together." ...|$|E
6000|$|One winter's {{night there}} was great commotion. Babette {{was nowhere to be}} found. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> in the country, miles away from everywhere.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Miss Featherstone, [...] "and, {{to say the}} truth, the American hoop-skirts are {{the only}} ones fit to wear.

60|$|I {{would not}} have it {{understood}} that during the siege <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> on the fat of the land; we had sufficient with which to partially allay our hunger, and took good care that the prisoners should not suffer from lack of food, even though we ourselves {{might be forced to}} fast.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Exactly,' {{he murmured}} {{in a voice}} and manner the {{counterpart}} of hers. 'To marry and part secretly, and live on as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>living</b> now; merely {{to put it out}} of anybody's power to force you away from me, dearest.' ...|$|R
50|$|At {{a deeper}} level, it {{reflects}} the fragmentation of human lives. To an extent, all of us live counterlives, as we do things that do not {{fit in with the}} 'official story' of the kind of person <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> and the kind of life <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>living.</b>|$|R
