5|$|Later on September23, {{the storm}} entered the Windward Passage, {{maintaining}} a broad circulation with <b>well-defined</b> banding and an eye-like feature. Little change {{occurred during the}} day; the storm made its fifth landfall near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba with winds of 75mph (120km/h). The storm began {{to take a more}} northwesterly track in response to a mid- to upper-level high pressure area to the northeast and a mid- to upper-level low over the Yucatán Peninsula. Throughout its passage across Cuba, Georges maintained a <b>well-defined</b> outflow pattern despite having an ill-defined center. By September24, the storm moved over water north of Cuba, and the eyewall quickly began to redevelop.|$|E
5|$|One {{must prove}} that this {{operation}} is <b>well-defined,</b> dealing with co-Cauchy sequences. Once that task is done, all {{the properties of}} real addition follow immediately from the properties of rational numbers. Furthermore, the other arithmetic operations, including multiplication, have straightforward, analogous definitions.|$|E
5|$|Other non-SI units (Table 8). This list {{catalogues}} {{a number}} of units of measure {{that have been used}} internationally in certain <b>well-defined</b> spheres including the bar for pressure, the ångström for atomic physics, the nautical mile and the knot in navigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} quickly {{showed signs}} of organization {{with the development of}} banding features around its blossoming convection. Due to a favorable upper level environment, forecasters predicted the depression to intensify to a 70mph (110km/h) tropical storm after making landfall on Haiti and eastern Cuba. Upper-level outflow remained <b>well-defined,</b> though convection waned near the center early on August 22. The depression appeared to continue organizing, with a <b>well-defined</b> cloud band to its north and east. However, strong southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly increased over the system, and the depression degenerated into a tropical wave late on August 22, south of the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic. The system retained a <b>well-defined</b> cloud pattern with a vigorous mid-level circulation, and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center indicated regeneration could have occurred at any time. The wave axis moved over the Dominican Republic early on August 23, and became disorganized over the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola. There existed the potential for redevelopment as it moved into a potentially more favorable area, though the National Hurricane Center ceased monitoring the system on August 25 when redevelopment appeared unlikely.|$|E
5|$|A <b>well-defined</b> low {{pressure}} system located about 350statute miles (560km) south-southwest of Bermuda organized into a tropical depression on September 5. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Nate that evening {{and continued to}} strengthen with little change in position, becoming the sixth hurricane of the season on September 7.|$|E
5|$|Although the B-DNA form is {{most common}} under the {{conditions}} found in cells, {{it is not}} a <b>well-defined</b> conformation but a family of related DNA conformations that occur at the high hydration levels present in living cells. Their corresponding X-ray diffraction and scattering patterns are characteristic of molecular paracrystals with a significant degree of disorder.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the winds}} rapidly {{decreased}} after landfall, the storm maintained a <b>well-defined</b> structure as it crossed from Mozambique into Zimbabwe late on February22. Weakening to tropical depression status, Eline crossed Zimbabwe and maintained its circulation, entering Botswana on February24. Three days later, the center drifted into eastern Namibia {{and turned to}} the south, dissipating on February29. After the circulation dissipated, the residual system merged with a heat low and an approaching cold front.|$|E
5|$|An upper-level trough and a {{decaying}} {{cold front}} persisted across the western Atlantic Ocean in early October. The {{interaction between the}} two {{led to the formation}} of an area of low pressure on October 8 to the southwest of Bermuda. The system lacked a single <b>well-defined</b> circulation, though it possessed gale-force winds as it moved northwestward. The system gradually became better organized, and though there were no signs of tropical development on October 9, computer models suggested a subtropical storm could form. On October 10, a <b>well-defined</b> low-level circulation developed as a band of clouds formed in the northern portion of the system. Shortly thereafter, curved bands developed in the northwestern portion of the center, while the strongest winds associated with the storm occurred more than 115miles (185km) from the center. Based on the broad wind field and the cloud signature, it is estimated the system organized into Subtropical Storm Nicole on October 10 while located about 140miles (225km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|By September24, {{it began}} to track northward away from the islands, and {{developed}} enough strong thunderstorm activity near its center and a <b>well-defined</b> enough circulation to be deemed a tropical storm on September25. It strengthened to a hurricane on September27 west of Bermuda. It made landfall in Nova Scotia as a Category 1 hurricane late on September 28, then became extratropical shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|Danvers carrots. These {{have strong}} foliage and the roots are longer than Chantaney types, {{and they have}} a conical shape with a <b>well-defined</b> shoulder, {{tapering}} to a point. They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing. They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts. Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'.|$|E
5|$|Each shot in {{an artistic}} billiards match is played from a <b>well-defined</b> {{position}} (in some venues within an exacting two millimeter tolerance), and each shot must unfold in an established manner. Players are allowed three attempts at each shot. In general, the shots {{making up the}} gameeven 4-point shotsrequire {{a high degree of}} skill, devoted practice and specialized knowledge to perform.|$|E
5|$|Four {{subspecies}} are recognised; {{there are}} zones with intermediate forms between the ranges of each subspecies, contrasting with the <b>well-defined</b> borders between M. lamberti {{and the other}} chestnut-shouldered wrens. However, molecular analysis may shed more light on relationships and the current taxonomic treatment may change. The purple-backed- and lavender-flanked fairywrens were considered distinct species in the past.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cases of}} {{hypothyroidism}} {{are associated with}} mild elevations in creatine kinase and liver enzymes in the blood. They typically return to normal when hypothyroidism has been fully treated. Levels of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and lipoprotein (a) can be elevated; the impact of subclinical hypothyroidism on lipid parameters is less <b>well-defined.</b>|$|E
5|$|Months {{after the}} {{hurricane}} season, when the National Hurricane Center was performing its annual review {{of the season and}} its named storms, forecasters Jack Beven and Eric Blake identified this previously unnoticed subtropical storm. Despite its unusual location and wide wind field, the system had a <b>well-defined</b> centre convecting around a warm corethe hallmark of a subtropical storm.|$|E
5|$|New {{species in}} the Russulaceae {{continue}} to be described from various regions, such as the US, Guyana, Brazil, Patagonia, Togo, Sri Lanka, or Thailand. It {{has been estimated that}} the real number of Russula species in North America alone (currently around 400 described) might be as high as 2000. Cryptic species may increase true diversity: some morphologically <b>well-defined</b> species, especially in Lactifluus, have been shown to actually encompass several phylogenetic species.|$|E
5|$|Python uses duck typing and has {{typed objects}} but untyped {{variable}} names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object {{is not of}} a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not <b>well-defined</b> (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting {{to make sense of}} them.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies {{consist of}} a {{rotating}} disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type S, followed by a letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms {{and the size of}} the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, <b>well-defined</b> arms and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and <b>well-defined</b> spiral arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.|$|E
5|$|The {{exponential}} function is defined for all integer, fractional, real, and complex values of x. In fact, the matrix exponential is <b>well-defined</b> for square matrices (in which case this exponential identity only holds when x and y commute), and {{is useful for}} solving systems of linear differential equations.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus on}} {{portability}} and standardization meant programs written in COBOL could be portable and facilitated {{the spread of}} the language {{to a wide variety of}} hardware platforms and operating systems. Additionally, the <b>well-defined</b> division structure restricts the definition of external references to the Environment Division, which simplifies platform changes in particular.|$|E
5|$|The {{protein that}} prions {{are made of}} (PrP) is found {{throughout}} the body, even in healthy people and animals. However, PrP found in infectious material has a different structure and is resistant to proteases, the enzymes in the body that can normally break down proteins. The normal form of the protein is called PrPC, while the infectious form is called PrPSc— the C refers to 'cellular' PrP, while the Sc refers to 'scrapie', the prototypic prion disease, occurring in sheep. While PrPC is structurally <b>well-defined,</b> PrPSc is certainly polydisperse and defined at a relatively poor level. PrP can be induced to fold into other more-or-less <b>well-defined</b> isoforms in vitro, {{and their relationship to}} the form(s) that are pathogenic in vivo is not yet clear.|$|E
5|$|The storm rapidly {{weakened}} as {{it continued}} northward, and degenerated into a tropical depression by July 20. The weak depression moved through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, maintaining a <b>well-defined</b> cloud signature. Due to a front behind the system, Danny unusually strengthened to {{a tropical storm}} over North Carolina on July 24. This rare phenomenon occurred due to interaction with a developing trough and its associated baroclinic zone.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Two-E {{formed from}} a broad area of low {{pressure}} on June 9. Six hours later the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Blanca. This system developed a good outflow, and reached its peak intensity with winds of 45mph (75km/h). However, its circulation was not <b>well-defined</b> and a weakening trend began, and Blanca was downgraded to a depression on June 12. It lost its closed circulation shortly thereafter and was thus declared dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression contained a somewhat <b>well-defined</b> low-level center of circulation, {{as well as}} convective banding. Based on Dvorak classifications, the storm was upgraded to a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on July 27; as the fourth tropical storm of the 2004 season, it was named Darby by the NHC. Darby continued to intensify, with established outflow and a <b>well-defined</b> banding feature. Later that day, forecasters predicted the storm to peak as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Darby was upgraded to a hurricane at 0000 UTC on July 28, at which time it began to turn towards the northwest. An eye, embedded within the deep convection, developed later in the day. Darby attained Category 2 intensity at around 1800 UTC, and it rapidly strengthened to Category 3, becoming the first Eastern Pacific major hurricane since Hurricane Kenna of the 2002 season.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where three {{or more of the}} curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is <b>well-defined</b> for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, and there may be {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but <b>well-defined</b> powers. Russell advocates {{the creation of a}} world government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war and the pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed over the southern Andaman Sea late in April moved north into the Bay of Bengal becoming the first depression of the year on May 2. The depression intensified {{under the influence of}} a high-level anticyclone and became a cyclonic storm the next day. The storm then turned to the northeast and strengthened into a severe cyclonic storm on May 4. Soon after this, it peaked with winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a <b>well-defined</b> eye formed. The storm made its landfall near Cox's Bazar in easternmost East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) early in the morning of May 7 and dissipated over western Burma that evening.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance {{north of the}} Bahamas showed signs of having a <b>well-defined</b> surface circulation and sufficient wind velocity, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tammy at 7:30a.m. EDT (1130 UTC) October 5 east of Florida, skipping tropical depression status. This marked {{only the second time}} that the 'T' name has been used to name an Atlantic storm since alphabetical naming began in 1950; the other time was for Tanya in 1995 (later on there would be Tomas in 2010 and Tony in 2012).|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean off {{the west coast}} of Africa during the last week of July. As it tracked across the Atlantic, it remained a <b>well-defined</b> system, but never organized into a tropical cyclone. On August8, the system entered the Gulf of Mexico, and by the following day, it developed a weak low-level circulation. The circulation became better defined later that day, and was confirmed by Reconnaissance aircraft that afternoon, when it was declared Tropical Depression Eight while east of Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on November5. It tracked steadily west across the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Its forward motion slowed after it passed the Lesser Antilles on November12. A large <b>well-defined</b> anticyclone persisted across much of the Caribbean Sea, providing a favorable environment for the system. A low-level circulation gradually became evident on satellite imagery within the disturbance. Based on ship observations, the National Hurricane Center estimated that the system organized into a tropical depression on November17, about 280miles (450km) south of the western tip of Haiti.|$|E
5|$|Above the chromosphere, {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a <b>well-defined</b> altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|As a {{complete}} normed space, Hilbert spaces are by definition also Banach spaces. As such they are topological vector spaces, in which topological notions like the openness and closedness of subsets are <b>well-defined.</b> Of special importance {{is the notion}} of a closed linear subspace of a Hilbert space that, with the inner product induced by restriction, is also complete (being a closed set in {{a complete}} metric space) and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} size, shape, and <b>well-defined</b> {{chemical}} structures, viruses {{have been used}} as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. Another example is the use of CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{returning}} {{north in}} spring across the central Mediterranean appear {{to follow a}} <b>well-defined</b> route. Large concentrations of ruffs form every year at particular stopover sites to feed, and individuals marked with rings or dye reappear in subsequent years. The refuelling sites are closer together than the theoretical maximum travel distance calculated from the mean body mass, and provide evidence of a migration strategy using favoured intermediate sites. The ruff stores fat as a fuel, but unlike mammals, uses lipids as {{the main energy source}} for exercise (including migration) and, when necessary, keeps warm by shivering; however, little research has been conducted on the mechanisms by which they oxidise lipids.|$|E
5|$|Bobcat {{activities}} {{are confined to}} <b>well-defined</b> territories, which vary in size depending on the sex {{and the distribution of}} prey. The home range is marked with feces, urine scent, and by clawing prominent trees in the area. In its territory, the bobcat has numerous places of shelter, usually a main den, and several auxiliary shelters on the outer extent of its range, such as hollow logs, brush piles, thickets, or under rock ledges. Its den smells strongly of the bobcat.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of August20, Bret was {{designated}} a hurricane following reports of 75mph (120km/h) winds during a Hurricane Hunter mission. At around the same time, Bret established a north-northwest track under the influences of a mid-level ridge. The following day, Bret began to undergo rapid intensification, as a <b>well-defined</b> eye developed. On the morning of August22, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 145mph (230km/h) and a barometric pressure of 944mbar (hPa; 27.88inHg). Shortly thereafter, an upper-level trough {{to the west of}} the storm began to erode its cloud pattern.|$|E
