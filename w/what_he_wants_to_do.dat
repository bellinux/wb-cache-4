25|$|Halakha (Jewish law) {{generally}} {{allows for}} divorce. The document of divorce is termed a get. The final divorce ceremony involves the husband giving the get document into {{the hand of}} the wife or her agent, but the wife may sue in rabbinical court to initiate the divorce. In such a case, a husband may be compelled to give the get, if he has violated any of his numerous obligations; this was traditionally accomplished by beating and or monetary coercion. The rationale was that since he was required to divorce his wife due to his (or her) violations of the contract, his good inclination desires to divorce her, and the community helps him to do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anyway. In this case, the wife {{may or may not be}} entitled to a payment.|$|E

In July 2011, Adrianne Palicki was {{confirmed}} for the lead female role of Lady Jaye, and Ray Stevenson was confirmed to portray the villain Firefly. Arnold Vosloo also confirmed that he would reprise his role of Zartan, although in the final film Vosloo appears only in a couple of non-dialogue scenes, with Jonathan Pryce playing Zartan in most scenes. Joseph Mazzello was confirmed to play Mouse. In August 2011, Walton Goggins was added as Warden Nigel James, and it was confirmed that Bruce Willis was cast to star in the film as the original G.I. Joe. The character of Joe Colton was a replacement for fan-favorite Joe character Sgt. Slaughter. Sgt. Slaughter stated that he [...] "was originally supposed to be the part of Bruce Willis' [...] Sgt. Slaughter but because we had a conflict in toy companies, Hasbro and Mattel, I wasn't able to do it. It's one of those things, Rock (Dwayne Johnson) doesn't have a contract so he can do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and he's been very successful".|$|E

From the child's initial hesitation in making use of the spatula, Winnicott derived his idea of the necessary 'period of hesitation' in childhood (or analysis), which makes possible a true connection to the toy, interpretation or object presented for transference.|$|E

Lewis had maintained that Chapman's decision to change his plea did not appear reasonable or explicable, and she implied that the judge did not want to allow an independent competency assessment.

2500|$|Currently, NFL quarterback Michael Vick {{is linked}} to {{property}} in southeastern Virginia where authorities believe a multi-state dog fighting operation was based.

Portis said that if Vick is charged and convicted of dog fighting, [...] "then you're putting him behind bars for no reason. I don't {{know if he was}} fighting dogs or not, but it's his property. It's his dog. If that's <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> do it." [...] Those comments were sharply criticized by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. The Redskins and Portis himself later apologized, stating that his controversial remarks about dog fighting were insensitive and that he now realizes he [...] "shouldn't have made the comments." [...] He added, [...] "At that time I had no idea the love people have for animals, and I didn't consider it when I made those comments." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{first of}} all English games is making money. That is an all-absorbing game; and we knock each other down oftener in playing at that than at foot-ball, or any other roughest sport; and it is {{absolutely}} without purpose; no one who engages heartily in that game ever knows why. Ask a great money-maker <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with his money--he never knows. He doesn't make it {{to do anything with}} it. He gets it only that he may get it. 'What will you make of what you have got?' you ask. 'Well, I'll get more,' he says. Just as, at cricket, you get more runs. There's no use in the runs, but to get more of them than other people is the game. And there's no use in the money, but to have more of it than other people is the game. So all that great foul city of London there,--rattling, growling, smoking, stinking,--a ghastly heap of fermenting brick-work, pouring out poison at every pore,--you fancy it is a city of work? Not a street of it! It is a great city of play; very nasty play, and very hard play, but still play. It is only Lord's cricket ground without the turf,--a huge billiard table without the cloth, and with pockets as deep as the bottomless pit; but mainly a billiard table, after all.|$|E

6000|$|That, {{like it or}} not, is the way {{to learn}} to write; whether I have profited or not, that is the way. It was so Keats learned, and there was never a finer {{temperament}} for literature than Keats's; it was so, if we could trace it out, that all men have learned; and that is why a revival of letters is always accompanied or heralded by a cast back to earlier and fresher models. Perhaps I hear some one cry out: [...] "But {{this is not the way}} to be original!" [...] It is not; nor is there any way but to be born so. Nor yet, if you are born original, is there anything in this training that shall clip the wings of your originality. There can be none more original than Montaigne, neither could any be more unlike Cicero; yet no craftsman can fail to see how much the one must have tried in his time to imitate the other. Burns is the very type of a prime force in letters: he was of all men the most imitative. Shakespeare himself, the imperial, proceeds directly from a school. It is only from a school that we can expect to have good writers, it is almost invariably from a school that great writers, these lawless exceptions, issue. Nor is there anything here that should astonish the considerate. Before he can tell what cadences he truly prefers, the student should have tried all that are possible; before he can choose and preserve a fitting key of language, he should long have practised the literary scales; and it is only after years of such gymnastic that he can sit down at last, legions of words swarming to his call, dozens of turns of phrase simultaneously bidding for his choice, and he himself knowing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and (within the narrow limit of a man's ability) able to do it.|$|E
6000|$|I shall {{send you}} all the Vailima Letters back to-morrow or next day by hand. I have {{completely}} read them. I can't say, and I don't want to say, anything of them but [...] "Publish them--they make the man so loveable." [...] It's on that I should take my stand. I think your estimate of them as ranking high in their class (epistolary) is perhaps (if I remember what you seemed to express of it) a larger one than I should concur in; but I think still more that that makes little difference; for they will assuredly be liked--immensely, and that is mainly what one is concerned to ask for him. They are charming, living, touching, absolutely natural; and I think better toward the end than at the beginning. What they suffer from is: 1º Want of interest and want of clearness as to the subject-matter of much of them--the Samoan personalities, politics, &c; all to me almost squalid--and the irritating effect of one's sense of his clearing the very ground {{to be able to}} do his daily work. Want also to a certain extent of generalization about all these matters and some others--into the dreary specifics of which the reader perhaps finds himself plunged too much. 2º A certain tormenting effect in his literary confidences (to you,) glimpses, promises, revelations &c., arising from his so seldom telling the subject, the idea of the thing--what he sees, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> &c--as against his pouring forth titles, chapters, divisions, names &c, in such magnificent abundance.--On the other hand the personality shines out so beautiful and there are so many charming things--passages, pages--that not to publish them would seem to me like the burial of something alive. I see but little in what you have left in these copies to excise on grounds of discretion, unless it be many of those reports of the state of public affairs and allusions to public personages which are primarily excisable by reason of obscurity, failure to appeal to reader's interest, &c. But I should like to see you and talk about the matter with you better than thus, and shall take the earliest occasion. The hideous sadness of them--to us! To readers at large--no. But I feel as though I had been sitting with him for hours.|$|E
