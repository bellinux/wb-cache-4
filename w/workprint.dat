5|$|Approximately {{four days}} before the {{theatrical}} release of the film, a <b>workprint</b> version of Halloween appeared online and was circulated around various BitTorrent sites. Upon hearing of the leaked copy, Zombie stated that whatever version had been leaked was an older version of the film, unlike what was about to be released in theaters. The leak of Zombie's <b>workprint</b> led to speculation that the film's box office success could be damaged, as director Eli Roth attributed the financial failure of his film, , to the leaking of a <b>workprint</b> version. Dark Horizons webmaster Garth Franklin noted that watching the <b>workprint</b> allows a viewer to see what was changed after test screenings of the film in June 2007. For example, one particular scene—the rape of one of the Smith's Grove female inmates—was replaced in the final version. Halloween was officially released on August 31, 2007, to 3,472 theaters in North America, giving it the widest release of any of the previous Halloween films.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 2009, a {{full-length}} DVD-quality <b>workprint</b> {{of the film}} without a timecode or watermark, with some unfinished effects shots, a different typeface for titles and casting, and alternate sound effects was leaked online. The studio {{said it would be}} able to determine the source of the leak using forensic marks in the <b>workprint.</b> The FBI and MPAA began investigating the illegal posting. Fox estimated the <b>workprint</b> was downloaded roughly 4.5million times by the time Wolverine was released in theaters. As of 2014, Fox estimates that a minimum of 15 million people downloaded it.|$|E
5|$|Several {{versions}} of Blade Runner have been shown. The original <b>workprint</b> version (1982, 113 minutes) was shown for audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. Negative {{responses to the}} previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version. The <b>workprint</b> was shown as a director's cut without Scott's approval at the Los Angeles Fairfax Theater in May 1990, at an AMPAS showing in April 1991, and in September and October 1991 at the Los Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theatre. Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut. A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the U.S. theatrical version but contained three extra scenes not shown in any other version, including the 2007 Final Cut.|$|E
50|$|Cinematographers {{often require}} one-light <b>workprints</b> to better judge their film exposures.|$|R
50|$|After {{the film}} is {{processed}} by the film lab, camera rolls are assembled into lab rolls of 1200 to 1500 feet. <b>Workprints</b> may be made for viewing dailies or editing the picture on film.|$|R
5000|$|Doctor Who - <b>Workprints</b> of {{the first}} five episodes of Series 8 were leaked online months in advance of their premieres. These {{versions}} were in black and white, were watermarked, and lacked the computer-generated effects seen in the final releases. Producer Steven Moffat publicly condemned the leaks, and urged fans to avoid watching the leaked episodes until they properly aired on TV.|$|R
5|$|The {{film was}} mostly shot in Australia and New Zealand, with Canada also {{serving as a}} location. Filming took place from January to May 2008. Production and {{post-production}} were troubled, with delays due to the weather and Jackman's other commitments, an incomplete screenplay that was still being written in Los Angeles while principal photography rolled in Australia, conflicts arising between director Hood and Fox's executives, and an unfinished <b>workprint</b> being leaked on the Internet one month before the film's debut.|$|E
5|$|The film {{went through}} {{post-production}} {{in the autumn}} to be finished {{in time for a}} Christmas release. Len Walter, who had edited episodes for Series One, reprised his role for Thunderbirds Are Go. The <b>workprint</b> of the film ran more than 15 minutes over the maximum runtime permitted by United Artists, forcing Walter to cut several minor scenes that were not essential to the plot.|$|E
5|$|A copy of {{the film}} leaked onto {{peer-to-peer}} file sharing networks just hours after opening in theaters. The film was a time-stamped <b>workprint,</b> suggesting it {{may have come from}} within the industry rather than from someone who videotaped an advance screening. Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally. Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a {{copy of the}} film was taken from an unnamed Californian post-production office by an employee, who later pleaded guilty to his charges. The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party, who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P2P network.|$|E
5|$|Universal Pictures spent $2.1million {{to market}} the film in a 30-second {{television}} spot during Super Bowl XXXVII on January 26, 2003. And a 70-second teaser trailer was attached to Spider-Man on May 3, 2002. Just weeks before the film's release, a number of <b>workprints</b> were leaked on the Internet. The visual and special effects were already being criticized, {{despite the fact that}} it was not the final editing cut of the film.|$|R
5000|$|In January, 2010, {{during a}} public Q&A after a {{screening}} {{of one of his}} films in Columbus, Ohio, Bogdanovich stated that the film had been examined and was in good condition, but [...] "Orson left such a mess with who owned what", and wondered whether editing the film would even be possible. (These comments were made a year before the death of Paul Hunt removed the last remaining legal obstacle to the film's copyright status.) Bogdanovich indicated that the original negative is in excellent condition, with the picture quality being far superior to the poor-quality <b>workprints</b> of the publicly available scenes described above.|$|R

[...] First time offenders can get up to three years in jail, or five if they committed the offense for financial gain. Repeat offenders can get ten years if the offense was committed for financial gain. These penalties are in addition to any penalties for violating non-disclosure agreements or trade secret law.|$|R
5|$|Another segment, Debussy's Clair de lune, was {{developed}} {{as part of}} the film's original program. After being completely animated, it was cut out of the final film to shorten its lengthy running time. The animation depicted two Great white herons flying through the Florida Everglades on a moonlit night. The sequence was later edited and re-scored for the Blue Bayou segment in Make Mine Music (1946). In 1992, a <b>workprint</b> of the original was discovered and Clair de Lune was restored, complete with the original soundtrack of Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra. It was included as a bonus feature in The Fantasia Anthology DVD in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{versions}} of Blade Runner {{exist as a}} result of controversial changes made at the request of studio executives. A director's cut was released in 1992 after a strong response to test screenings of a <b>workprint.</b> This, in conjunction with the film's popularity as a video rental, made it one of the first movies to be released on DVD. In 2007, Warner Bros.released The Final Cut, a 25th-anniversary digitally remastered version, and the only version over which Scott retained artistic control. The Final Cut was shown in selected theaters and released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray.|$|E
5|$|While at the Sundance Feature Film Program, Anderson {{already had}} a deal with Rysher Entertainment to direct his first feature. In 1996, Anderson made his first {{full-length}} feature, Sydney, which was retitled Hard Eight (1996). Upon completion of the film, Rysher re-edited it. Anderson, who still had the <b>workprint</b> of his original cut, submitted the film, which was accepted and screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. Anderson {{was able to get}} his version released but only after he retitled the film and raised the $200,000 necessary to finish it – he, Philip Baker Hall, Gwyneth Paltrow and John C. Reilly contributed the funding. The version that was released was Anderson's and the acclaim from the film launched his career.|$|E
5000|$|The Recobbled Cut {{has been}} revised {{three times in}} 2006, 2008, and 2013. Each version {{incorporated}} further higher-quality materials donated by animators from the film, including two rare <b>workprints</b> from the Fred Calvert production that contained footage not available in the released versions. The [...] "Mark 3" [...] version released in 2008 incorporated 21 minutes from a 49-minute reel of rare 35mm film. Gilchrist's last version, [...] "Mark 4", was released in September 2013 and edited in HD. [...] "Mark 4" [...] features about 30 minutes of the film in full HD quality, restored from raw 35mm footage which Gilchrist edited frame by frame. Artists were also commissioned to contribute new artwork and material. Gilchrist's YouTube account, [...] "TheThiefArchive", now serves as an unofficial video archive of Richard Williams' films, titles, commercials, and interviews, including footage from the Nasrudin production. Williams said that while he hasn't seen Gilchrist's Recobbled Cut, acknowledged {{the role that the}} fan edits had played in rehabilitating the film's reputation.|$|R
25|$|The Ridley Scott-approved Director's Cut (1992, 116 minutes) was {{prompted}} by the unauthorized 1990–1991 theatrical release of the <b>workprint</b> version of the movie. The Director's Cut contained significant changes from the theatrical <b>workprint</b> version. Scott provided extensive notes and consultation to Warner Bros., although film preservationist/restorer Michael Arick {{was put in charge}} of creating the Director's Cut.|$|E
25|$|After the film's home media release, the {{original}} <b>workprint</b> {{of the film}} (which featured 43 minutes of alternative footage and an alternate ending) was discovered by fans of the series. This version, dubbed The Producer's Cut, developed a cult following, with bootleg DVD copies sold on eBay and online petitions targeting for an official release of it. In 2014, The Producer's Cut was officially released on Blu-ray.|$|E
25|$|The film premiered at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival, but {{has gone}} {{virtually}} unseen {{by the public}} ever since. Disney owns the rights, but has never officially released it. In March 2012, a <b>workprint</b> of the documentary was leaked online and was uploaded onto YouTube, by a United Kingdom cartoonist, before it was ultimately pulled. As of April 2015, some scenes from the documentary could {{be seen from the}} home media release, including the behind the scenes and the making of My Funny Friend and Me.|$|E
25|$|The set {{included}} the <b>workprint,</b> the two 1982 original theatrical versions (US domestic and uncensored international cuts), the 2006-remastered director's cut, the 2007 final cut (completely restored {{from the original}} negative, and put through a new director approved transfer, with 35mm footage scanned at 4K or 6K resolution depending on which type of panavision camera filmed the scene, and 65mm elements scanned at 8K resolution, and given a completely new 5.1 mix taken from the original track elements but completely restored and put through the latest audio standards), and several hours of bonus features.|$|E

500|$|The {{worldwide}} opening {{was over}} $158.1million, but Fox stated that some markets underperformed, mostly {{due to the}} leaked <b>workprint</b> in countries with illegal downloading problems. However, in an article for the [...] "piracy issue" [...] of Screen International magazine, film critic John Hazelton was doubtful of this explanation, writing that the film's initial performance was [...] "uncertain" [...] as the outbreak of swine flu in territories with the worst copyright infringement problems means that other territories did not compare at all.|$|E
500|$|MGM's {{special edition}} of the 1981 film was not {{released}} until 2003 because the original negative had disappeared. [...] The <b>workprint</b> containing deleted scenes finally {{turned up in the}} Hutchinson, Kansas salt mine film depository. [...] The excised scenes feature Snake Plissken robbing a bank, introducing the character of Plissken and establishing a backstory. Director John Carpenter decided to add the original scenes into the special edition release as an extra only: [...] "After we screened the rough cut, we realized that the movie didn't really start until Snake got to New York. It wasn't necessary to show what sent him there." [...] The film has been released on the UMD format for Sony's PlayStation Portable.|$|E
500|$|The print {{contained}} {{a reference to}} Rising Sun Pictures, an Australian visual effects company working on the film. The company denied that they ever had a full copy of the film. Executive producer Thomas Rothman noted the leaked version lacked the ten minutes added during pick-ups in January 2009. However, the theatrical version of the film has no extra scenes that {{were not included in}} the leaked <b>workprint.</b> Both versions run exactly 107 minutes, but director Gavin Hood said [...] "another ending exists that features the film's villain." [...] The leak was traced down to a Bronx man named Gilberto Sanchez, who had bought an unlicensed DVD copy from a Korean man and later uploaded it under the name [...] "SkillyGilly".|$|E
500|$|The {{progress}} of filming was criticized early on. Bob Weinstein disliked the Ghostface mask, believing {{it was not}} [...] "scary". Upon reviewing the dailies footage of the opening scene, the studio was concerned that the film was progressing in an unwanted direction. They considered replacing Craven. To assuage their concerns, Craven and editor Patrick Lussier, developed a rough, <b>workprint</b> version of the opening 13 minutes of the film to demonstrate how the completed film might turn out. After viewing the new footage, the studio was content to let Craven continue as director. Weinstein, having seen the mask in action, was satisfied {{that it could be}} scary. The third and final act of the film, over forty minutes long, is set at a house party where Ghostface strikes. It was shot at a vacant property in Tomales over 21nights. The scene, labelled [...] "Scene 118", was considered the most difficult to shoot as it took place entirely in one location yet featured the individual stories and deaths of multiple characters. Actors spent weeks undertaking intense emotional and physical scenes while coated in fake blood and wounds. As the scene was set during the evening, production {{had no choice but to}} halt at dawn.|$|E
500|$|The Projected Man {{was shot}} {{at the same time}} as Island of Terror, with which it was {{released}} on a double bill. The idea of the double bill came to Richard Gordon when he ran Island of Terror for Universal Studios' executive in charge, Hi Martin. As The Projected Mans special effects were not yet finished, Gordon showed Martin Island of Terror. Martin enjoyed the film and obtained the American rights for a [...] "very large sum of money." [...] As Gordon was not keen on the idea of Island of Terror being placed at the bottom of the bill with one of Universal's other features, which he described as [...] "no good for [...] financially," [...] he proposed adding a second film, noting that The Projected Man was nearing completion. He showed an unfinished <b>workprint</b> of the film to see if Martin was interested, and he enjoyed it enough to accept the deal. When The Projected Man was shown in theatres in the United States, it was cut thirteen minutes shorter than the original British print, due to the fact that Universal felt the opening scene, which depicted a rehearsal for an experiment which came later in the film, was [...] "repetitive." [...] They also did not want a double bill with a duration of over three hours, and did not want to edit Island of Terror, so The Projected Man was trimmed to provide an exact 180-minute running time.|$|E
2500|$|All Our Variant Futures: From <b>Workprint</b> to Final Cut (2007, 29minutes) ...|$|E
2500|$|Ridley Scott {{publicly}} disowned this <b>workprint</b> {{version of}} the film as a [...] "director's cut," [...] citing that it was roughly edited, lacked a key scene, and the climax did not feature the score composed for the film by Vangelis. (It featured a temporary track using Jerry Goldsmith's score from Planet of the Apes.) In response to Scott's dissatisfaction, Warner Bros. pulled theatrical screenings of the <b>workprint</b> in some cities, though it played at the NuArt Theater in Los Angeles and the Castro Theatre in San Francisco beginning in late 1991.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>workprint</b> version (1982, 113 minutes) {{was shown}} to {{audience}} test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. It was also seen in 1990 and 1991 in Los Angeles and San Francisco as a Director's Cut without the approval of director Ridley Scott. Negative responses to the test previews led to the modifications resulting in the US theatrical version, while positive response to the showings in 1990 and 1991 pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut. This version was re-released {{as part of the}} five-disc Ultimate Edition in 2007 with a new transfer of the last known print in existence, with the picture and sound quality restored as much as possible. However, the result was still rough. The main differences between the <b>Workprint</b> and most of the other versions (in chronological order) are: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the sold-out screenings of the <b>workprint</b> (and to screenings of the theatrical cut in Houston and Washington, D.C.) and [...] to the film's resurgent cult popularity in the early '90s, Warner Bros. decided to assemble a definitive director's cut of the film—with direction from Scott—for an official theatrical re-release in 1992.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "6th replicant", named [...] "Mary" [...] {{in early}} {{versions}} of the screenplay. The only mention of this replicant occurs in the [...] "Final Cut” and <b>workprint</b> {{versions of the}} film (2007)—Captain Bryant alludes to her when he mentions that two replicants {{were killed by the}} electric field; in the 1982 U.S. theatrical version of the film, he mentions only one replicant.|$|E
2500|$|When the Cineplex Odeon Fairfax Theater in Los Angeles {{learned of}} this discovery, the theater {{management}} got permission from Warner Bros. to screen the print {{for a film}} festival set for May 1990. Until the screening, {{no one had been}} aware that this print was the <b>workprint</b> version. Owing to this surprise, Warner Bros. booked more screenings of the now-advertised [...] "Director's Cut" [...] of Blade Runner in 15 American cities.|$|E
2500|$|Seven {{different}} versions of Ridley Scott's 1982 American science fiction film Blade Runner have been shown, either to test audiences or theatrically. The best known are the <b>Workprint,</b> the U.S. Theatrical Cut, the International Cut, the Director's Cut and the Final Cut. These five versions are included in both the 2007 five-disc Ultimate Collectors Edition and 2012 30th-Anniversary Collector's Edition releases. There also exists the San Diego Sneak Preview Cut, which was only shown once at a preview screening and the U.S. Broadcast Cut, which was edited for television broadcast. In the 2007 documentary Dangerous Days: The Making of Blade Runner, there is a reference to director Ridley Scott presenting an eighth version, a nearly four-hour-long [...] "early cut", that was shown only to studio personnel. The following is a timeline of these various versions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{counterfeiting}} montage looks authentic because Friedkin consulted actual counterfeiters who {{had done}} time. The [...] "consultant" [...] actually did the scenes that do not show actor Willem Dafoe on camera to give this sequence more authenticity even though the actor learned how to print money. Over one million dollars of counterfeit money was produced but with three deliberate errors {{so that it could}} not be used outside the film. The filmmakers burned most of the fake money but some leaked out, was used, and linked back to the production. The son of one of the crew members tried to use some of the prop money to buy candy at a local store and was caught. Three FBI agents from Washington, D.C. interviewed 12-15 crew members including Friedkin who screened the <b>workprint</b> for them. He offered to show the film to the Secretary of the Treasury and take out anything that was a danger to national security. That was the last he heard from the government.|$|E
2500|$|Friedkin {{appointed}} Walon Green as the film's screenwriter. The director {{got to know}} Green in the 1960s, and was since highly {{impressed with}} his work in Sam Peckinpah's western The Wild Bunch. Friedkin described Green as a multilingual person, fluently speaking French, Spanish, Italian, and German, as well as having [...] "an encyclopedic knowledge of classical music and literature". Prior to writing the script, Green expressed enthusiasm about the project and suggested Friedkin read Gabriel García Márquez's novel One Hundred Years of Solitude. Friedkin described it as [...] "another lifechanging work" [...] which served as a <b>workprint</b> for their adaptation of Wages of Fear. The story outline was created by both Friedkin and Green, and the script was finished in four months. Gerard Murphy, who portrayed {{the head of the}} Irish gang during the Elizabeth church robbery, was a real-life criminal involved in a similar heist. Friedkin utilized details from Murphy's stories and used them as an inspiration. The remaining members of the gang were [...] "nonactors but part of Gerry's world", including one IRA member.|$|E
2500|$|For the film's killer, Williamson's script had {{provided}} Craven {{only with the}} description [...] "masked killer", forcing him and his design team to create the Ghostface costume from scratch to conceal the killer's identity. While awaiting permission from Fun World, creators of the Ghostface mask design, Craven had the design team KNB Effects create an alternative {{that was used in}} two scenes before being replaced by the original Fun World design once permission was granted. Bob Weinstein disliked the Ghostface mask, believing it was not [...] "scary", and the studio, upon reviewing the dailies footage of the opening scene, were concerned that it was progressing in a direction they did not want and there was consideration that Craven could ultimately be replaced. To assuage their concerns, the first thirteen minutes of the opening scene were compiled as a <b>workprint,</b> a rough version of the finished film, and upon seeing it, the studio were content to let Craven continue and Weinstein was satisfied that the mask could be scary. The third and final act of the film, set at a house party, was over forty minutes long and shot at a vacant property in Tomales over twenty-one nights. The scene was considered the most difficult to shoot, as it took place entirely in one location, yet featured the individual stories and deaths of multiple characters, and as it was set at night, meant that production had to halt at daybreak.|$|E
