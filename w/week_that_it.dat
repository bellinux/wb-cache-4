The first two episodes secured the second highest ratings of the week for BBC Two, with the first episode debuting with a strong 3.5 million. The final episode {{went on to become}} the top show on BBC Two the <b>week</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was aired. Nigella's Christmas Kitchen won Lawson a second World Food Media Award in 2007. Her influence as a food commentator was also demonstrated in late 2006, when after she had lauded goose fat as being an essential ingredient for Christmas, sales percentages of the product increased significantly in the UK. Waitrose and Tesco both stated that goose fat sales had more than doubled, as well as Asda's goose fat sales increasing by 65% from the previous week. Similarly, after she advised using prunes in a recipe on Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, Waitrose had increased sales of 30% year on year.|$|E

500|$|The episode's genesis {{stems from}} the second season entry [...] "The Client", in which the office discovers Michael's {{incomplete}} screenplay for Threat Level Midnight. The episode features the reappearance of several actors and actresses who had not appeared on the show in years. Due {{to the nature of}} Michael's film, scenes were filmed to create the illusion {{as if they had been}} shot years prior to the episode. [...] "Threat Level Midnight" [...] was viewed by 6.41 million viewers and received a 3.3 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49. The episode was the highest-rated NBC series of the <b>week</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> aired, and received acclaim from critics, many of whom enjoyed the humor and the continuity references to the show's past.|$|E

[...] Goodrem told TV <b>Week</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was important to her to tie up Nina's storylines and added: [...] "I really felt that Nina and myself had a lot of unfinished business there."

500|$|In 2004, Susan became {{involved}} with Tom Scully (Andrew Larkins), a Priest. Susan and Tom caused a scandal when they began a relationship. Television critic Andrew Mercado said that 2004 went down as [...] "a watershed year for controversy" [...] after Susan had sex with Tom. Woodburne told Jackie Brygel from TV <b>Week</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a [...] "very hot affair". Tom left the priesthood for Susan and she confessed her love for him. However, the relationship soon ended. Woodburne commented [...] "It becomes apparent {{to both of them}} that it is just not meant to be. They both reach a period in their life when they are feeling low and lonely and aren't feeling very good about themselves. They just realise that there is no future." [...] Tom returned in 2007 and he became Principal of Erinsborough High. He told Susan that he never stopped loving her and wanted her back. However, by then she was back with Karl.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{reviewer}} Jeannette Catsoulis praised it {{for avoiding}} the dichotomy of [...] "corporate greed versus environmental well-being", adding {{that instead of}} being an exposé, [...] "Under the gentle, humane investigations of its director, what emerges most strongly is a portrait of exploitation that ought to make us more nauseated than elated over those $20 jeans". Tamsin Blanchard, for the Daily Telegraph, called it a work that will [...] "do for the fast fashion business what Food Inc did for fast food". The Hollywood Reporters Frank Scheck commended it for approaching an issue often [...] "untouched by major news organizations". He said the film was [...] "more despair-inducing than instructive", but was optimistic about its possible impact on the fashion culture, citing the effect that films such as Super Size Me and Fast Food Nation had on the fast food industry. Carson Quiros of Paste also compared it to the former film. David Noh of Film Journal International called it a [...] "vitally important documentary" [...] that contains scenes that [...] "are {{enough to make you}} never want to go shopping again". Gabrielle Wilson of MTV stated it is [...] "hard to swallow but never feels preach-y or like a barrage of depressive factoids" [...] and will empower viewers to change their shopping habits. Casey Jarman said she was disappointed by [...] "the only solution offered: eliminating global capitalism"; however, ultimately, she wrote for Willamette <b>Week</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a [...] "compelling film, which is, above all else, a badly needed conversation-starter".|$|E

2500|$|Among those {{subscribing to}} the “revenge hypothesis” was Peter Ueberroth, the chief {{organizer}} of the 1984 L.A. Games, who expressed his views {{in a press conference}} after the boycott was announced, {{on the same day that}} the Olympic torch relay in the United States began in New York City. U.S. President Ronald Reagan later stated his belief that the Soviets feared some of their athletes might defect. [...] As well, President Reagan and his administration agreed to meet all of the demands of the Soviet Union in turn for the Soviet Bloc's attendance at the 1984 Olympics, marking a stark contrast in Reagan’s “hawkish” views on Cold War foreign policy. As more countries withdrew, the IOC announced on the deadline <b>week</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would consider extending the deadline for entry into the Olympics. The three top medal winners from the 1980 Games (which was the subject of a boycott by sixty nations) in Moscow were among the boycotters, and media analysis noted this would weaken the field of competitors in a number of sports.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{this drama}} series being a highly {{anticipated}} drama (with 83 episodes, 43 of them belong to Part 1), the viewership {{of the drama}} was not good at all. This made it a huge disappointment for MediaCorp. Most audience thought the drama would have at least 800,000 people watching in the first week, but the actual viewership showed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was only half the expectations, though the drama's ratings were always constantly higher than Channel U's Korean drama Be Strong Geum Soon that was aired at the same slot for the nine <b>weeks</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> aired (which incidentally ended its run {{on the same day}} as Kinship Part 1).|$|R
2500|$|In Britain, Beatles for Sale {{held the}} number-one spot for 11 of the 46 <b>weeks</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{spent in the}} top 20.

One of the songs omitted from the US version of the album, [...] "Eight Days a Week", became the Beatles' seventh {{number one in the}} United States when issued as a single there in February 1965. Beatles for Sale was not released in the US until 1987, when the Beatles' catalogue was standardised for release on CD.|$|R

60|$|Colonel Brandon's delicate, {{unobtrusive}} enquiries {{were never}} unwelcome to Miss Dashwood. He had abundantly earned {{the privilege of}} intimate discussion of her sister's disappointment, by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with confidence. His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her voice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or could oblige herself to speak to him. THESE assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; but Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither prevail on {{him to make the}} offer himself, nor commission her to make it for him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of Midsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, {{and by the end of}} a <b>week</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would not be a match at all. The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would all be made over to HER; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.|$|E
6000|$|Upon {{the first}} {{discovery}} of the corpse, it was not supposed that the murderer {{would be able to}} elude, for more than a very brief period, the inquisition which was immediately set on foot. It was not until the expiration of a <b>week</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was deemed necessary to offer a reward; and even then this reward was limited to a thousand francs. In the mean time the investigation proceeded with vigor, if not always with judgment, and numerous individuals were examined to no purpose; while, owing to the continual absence of all clue to the mystery, the popular excitement greatly increased. At the end of the tenth day it was thought advisable to double the sum originally proposed; and, at length, the second week having elapsed without leading to any discoveries, and the prejudice which always exists in Paris against the Police having given vent to itself in several serious émeutes, the Prefect took it upon himself to offer the sum of twenty thousand francs [...] "for the conviction of the assassin," [...] or, if more than one should prove to have been implicated, [...] "for the conviction of any one of the assassins." [...] In the proclamation setting forth this reward, a full pardon was promised to any accomplice who should come forward in evidence against his fellow; and to the whole was appended, wherever it appeared, the private placard of a committee of citizens, offering ten thousand francs, in addition to the amount proposed by the Prefecture. The entire reward thus stood at no less than thirty thousand francs, which will be regarded as an extraordinary sum when we consider the humble condition of the girl, and the great frequency, in large cities, of such atrocities as the one described.|$|E
