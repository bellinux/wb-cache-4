Initially, they offered the nomination for lieutenant governor to Judge John P. Oldham, but Oldham declined, and Breathitt was chosen as his replacement. Barry lost the governorship to National Republican Thomas Metcalfe, but Breathitt defeated Metcalfe's running mate Joseph R. Underwood by more than 1,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden {{supporters}} {{sought to}} make him the National Republican nominee for governor in the election of 1828. Though his nomination was all but certain, Crittenden declined the opportunity, fearing that his association with Clay, who was losing popularity in the state, would cost his party the election. Instead, he threw his support behind Thomas Metcalfe, {{who went on to}} carry a very close election over Democrat <b>William</b> <b>T.</b> Barry. Crittenden instead sought another term in the Kentucky House, but was again denied the seat.|$|E
5|$|Early in life, Breathitt was {{appointed}} a deputy surveyor in Illinois Territory.

Although his running mate <b>William</b> <b>T.</b> Barry lost the office of governor to Thomas Metcalfe, Breathitt defeated his opponent for lieutenant governor.|$|E

Denman to Leavenworth, Kansas, and began speculating in lands, roads, and government housing. They quickly established {{one of the leading}} law firms of Leavenworth, as well as a financially powerful land agency.|$|E

The next day the measure passed in the House by a vote of 5443. Governor Desha appointed pro-relief stalwart <b>William</b> <b>T.</b> Barry as Chief Justice, and three associate justices who were also Relief Party supporters.|$|E

5|$|The {{move was}} panned in the state's newspapers, and by {{prominent}} citizens such as future governor James Turner Morehead.

Despite this, the General Assembly made the appointment permanent when it convened in December 1816. However, the administration candidate for a full senatorial term, John Adair was defeated in the General Assembly, which opted for John J. Crittenden.|$|E
