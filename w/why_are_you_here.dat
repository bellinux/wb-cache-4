500|$|Cleave {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} in West Africa, which he credits for having partially inspired The Other Hand. Further inspiration came from Cleaves's temporary employment while studying experimental {{psychology at the}} University of Oxford. During the summer, Cleave painted underpasses, gardened and picked up litter, and hoped to use this experience to write a book. His final job was at Campsfield House in Oxfordshire, an immigration detention centre. Cleave spent three days serving food to residents from war zones including Somalia, Eritrea and the Balkans. He explained: [...] "I got talking {{with some of them}} and said <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here?</b> Why are you in prison? It's not illegal and yet we concentrate them in these places. It's a text-book definition of a concentration camp. The conditions are appalling. I was shocked enough for that {{to be the end of}} my light comedy book of my amusing summers working as a labourer." [...] Cleave believes he would not have written the novel were he not a parent, as he does not wish for his children [...] "to grow up into a world that is callous and stupid." ...|$|E
6000|$|LESLIE. A thief's sister! <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here?</b> <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here?</b> Tell me! Why {{do you not}} speak? Man, I {{know you}} of old. Are you Brodie, and have nothing to say? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where {{are all the}} sentinels, John?" [...] he inquired, as {{he gazed}} around {{with a look of}} curiosity, [...] "and <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No enmity!" [...] {{replied the}} officer. [...] "Then <b>why</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> with your gun amongst the shrubbery? But I have {{a mind to}} do my first deed of arms on you; so give up your weapon, and come with me as prisoner." ...|$|R
60|$|LARRY. I expect <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a Tory in {{a former}} existence; and that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>here.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Once more,' cried his opponent, wildly {{stamping}} on the ground, 'although you tear {{me from my}} better angel, I implore you not to {{come within}} the reach of my sword to-night. Oh! <b>why</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> at all! <b>Why</b> have we met! To-morrow would have cast us far apart for ever!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; I know that. California {{seems to}} be {{everything}} here. But how has it come about? <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> and what has brought me here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I mean. <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> {{you and that}} {{red-headed}} devil, Spike Mullins?" [...] He jerked {{his head in the}} direction of the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "No! If {{you open}} the bed-curtains, you let in the light. My poor eyes! <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> my dear? Why are you not at the school?" ...|$|E
60|$|Half an hour late! <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{loitering}} <b>here?</b> Away with <b>you</b> at once.|$|R
5000|$|Hearing this neesan replied, [...] "If {{you don't}} accept what was offered by me then <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> staying <b>here?</b> <b>You</b> can go anywhere" ...|$|R
6000|$|VERA (aside). One more blow! What does he mean? Oh, impossible! but <b>why</b> <b>is</b> he {{not with}} us? Alexis! Alexis! <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> not <b>here?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, WRETCH!" [...] said Tressilian; [...] "for were he aught better, <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> and alone, in my apartment? why was not fitting {{provision}} {{made for}} your honourable reception?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> anyhow?" [...] she demanded. [...] "I feel {{sure that}} Eug√®ne {{told me the}} reason which had brought you from your wilds, but I have {{forgotten}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Curse your honesty! [...] . Is {{there any}} honesty in all this! [...] . When did {{you begin to}} be honest? <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here?</b> What are you now? [...] . Still honest? [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{says they}} do, {{and that they}} are very {{dangerous}} when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> grown up. <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> alone <b>here,</b> and what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> working at?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Out with you, imp of Satan!' cried Miriam. 'This is no {{time for}} winebibbing. Raphael Aben-Ezra, <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> lying <b>here?</b> Did <b>you</b> not receive a note last night?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Norman of Torn, {{but once}} before have you entered {{within the walls}} of Leybourn, and then you did, in the service of another, a great service for the house of Leybourn; and you stayed the night, an honored guest. But a moment since, you said that you had no quarrel with me. Then <b>why</b> <b>be</b> <b>you</b> <b>here?</b> Speak! Shall it be as a friend or an enemy that the master of Leybourn greets Norman of Torn; shall it be with outstretched hand or naked sword?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God knows, I don't! But {{since you}} ask the question, <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> Isobel? It is Isobel, isn't it, or am I still dreaming? Let me touch you and I shall know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind my guests," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{have been}} wanting {{to talk to you}} alone for days. Why have you done this? <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here?</b> What is it that you are seeking for in life?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do. Or you wouldn't {{be found}} on the {{verandah}} every day. <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> then? There are plenty of rooms in the house. You have your own room to stay in--if you {{did not want to see}} me. But you do. You know you do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And for you also, if {{you desire}} it-even {{though some of}} your periods should be spoiled thereby. But <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> both <b>here</b> so early, before any {{business}} is stirring?" ...|$|R
60|$|THE WOMAN [continuing]--and <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{wandering}} <b>here</b> alone {{without a}} nurse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is this necessary?" [...] he {{interrupted}} coldly. [...] "I have never reproached you. You chose {{the path of}} safety for yourself. Many another woman in your place would doubtless {{have done the same}} thing! What I desire to know <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> in Cornwall. What has happened to make this journey seem necessary to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have never}} made claim to such distinction, {{nor do we}} believe we are {{expected}} to drive the redcoats out of Boston. But if the city is in such a turmoil as you would have us think, <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> instead of at Liberty Hall?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} a {{canonical}} mode of warfare, perhaps, Woods," [...] returned the chaplain, smiling, [...] "but not exactly a military. I think it safer that they should continue sober; for, as yet, they manifest no great intentions of hostility. But of this we can speak hereafter. <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> my son, and in this guise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{manner of}} {{greeting}} {{did you look}} for?" [...] he returned hotly. [...] "Did {{you expect me to}} set a ring upon your finger, and have the fattened calf killed in honour of your return? Sangdieu, sir! Have you come hither to show me how a father should welcome the profligate son who has dishonoured his name? <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> unbidden? Answer me, sir!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hetty made {{a little}} sign of impatience. [...] "Yes, there are--lots of them. Of course, you think all women are silly--you're only a man. Besides, Tom pinched me. But <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{stopping}} <b>here</b> and talking? Go and bring him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now where a-deuce <b>were</b> <b>you,</b> Richard?" [...] said he. [...] "You {{have missed}} as {{pleasing}} a sight as {{comes to a}} man in a lifetime. <b>Why</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> not <b>here</b> to see Miss Manners tread a minuet? My word! Terpsichore herself could scarce have made it go better." ...|$|R
6000|$|THE OLD WOMAN. Oh, what do I care <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>here?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> I here? I, who sacrificed all my inclinations to womanly {{virtue and}} propriety! ...|$|R
6000|$|It wounded, as {{she meant}} it should; and the evil spirit to whose {{guidance}} she had yielded herself exulted to see his self-love bleed, and pride vainly struggle to conceal the stab. He caught the expression in her averted glance, bent suddenly a fixed and scrutinizing gaze upon her, asking, below his breath, [...] "Then <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> to tempt me with the face that tempted me a year ago?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Morton (relaxing hold of OAKHURST). Alexander! Good God! <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here?</b> Why {{have you}} stepped {{between me and}} retribution? You hesitate. God in heaven! Speak, Alexander, my son, speak for God's sake! Tell me--tell me that this detective's suspicions are not true. Tell me that you are not--not--no, I cannot say it. Speak, Alexander Morton, I command you! Who is this man you have saved? Is it--is it--your accomplice? ...|$|E
6000|$|Bertram was {{standing}} {{with his back to}} the door, looking into a small conservatory that opened from the drawing-room, when the mistress of the house entered. She walked straight up to him, after having carefully closed the door, and just touching his hand, she said, [...] "Mr. Bertram, <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>here?</b> You should be thousands and thousands of miles away if that were possible. Why are you here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He will do so," [...] she {{declared}} confidently, [...] "and before long. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> I <b>am</b> <b>here.</b> <b>You</b> {{must come to}} me the moment--the very moment you know! You understand that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] said Ugu {{when the}} invaders had stood {{in silence for}} a moment, staring about them. [...] "This visit is an {{unexpected}} pleasure, I assure you. I knew <b>you</b> <b>were</b> coming, and I know <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>here.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> not welcome, for I cannot use any of you to my advantage, but as you have insisted on coming, I hope you will make the afternoon call as brief as possible. It won't take long to transact your business with me. You will ask me for Ozma, and my reply will <b>be</b> that <b>you</b> may find her--if you can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They <b>are</b> {{saying that}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> to be bought, that that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>here,</b> that Mr. Foley {{will pay a}} great price for <b>you.</b> They <b>are</b> saying that all those hopes we had built upon your coming, are to be dashed away. They say that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> for the flesh-pots. I daren't breathe a word of this to Aaron," [...] she added hurriedly, [...] "or I {{think that he would}} go mad. He is blind with passionate love for you. He does not see the danger, he will not believe that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not as a god." ...|$|R
