It hosts numerous nuclear facilities, some of which are maintained in operation, while others were shutdown in past years, namely: two research nuclear reactors, hot cells facilities, radiochemical laboratories, one Cyclotron (still in operation), facilities for studies on fissile material (in operation), and some facilities for the treatment and storage of liquid and solid waste (in operation). The JRC accounts for 16 nuclear licences, 14 Controlled Zones and 12 main Surveilled Zones, on its Ispra Site. The Radiation Protection Sector employs the services of some internal laboratories for the assessment of external and internal doses: the ¿Dosimetry¿ Laboratory (for personal and ambient TLDs), the <b>Whole</b> <b>Body</b> <b>Count</b> Laboratory, the Radiotoxicological Laboratory (for analyses on excreta), the Radiation Protection Sector itself (for ambient dose and contamination reporting, and electronic personal dosimeters readings). Some of these Services are open also to the external market, and JRC-Ispra is among the few being able to provide, in Italy, either for internal and external dosimetric services to Customers. The paper will discuss the organization and the structure of the Dosimetry and the <b>Whole</b> <b>Body</b> <b>Count</b> Laboratories, and their functions in the management of daily Radiation Protection tasks at the JRC. Moreover, in order to follow-up and control Personnel radiation doses, the Radiation Protection Sector has developed and put in place, in 2007, the ¿Unified Dosimetry System¿, a wide and flexible database centralizing all dosimetric data and making them on-line available to JRC Radiation Protection experts and to the JRC Qualified Expert.

Regression line between leg %D (Y-axis) and exercise loading amount (X-axis: exercise momentum × exercise time; watt・min) was not different in both groups. The regression line derived from the relation between kidney %D and exercise loading amount showed downward shift in OMI, compared to that in control. The regression line between the ratio of %D (kidney) to %D (leg) (Y-axis) and exercise loading amount (X-axis) also tended to the downward shift in OMI. Leg %D, arm %D and liver %D were not different between control (13 subjects) and OMI (12 subjects) with mathing for exercise loading amounts. In contrast, heart %D and kidney %D in OMI were significantly lower than those in control, and lung %D was significantly higher in OMI. We concluded that the reduction of blood flow in kidney during exercise might be compensatory mechanism to increase blood flow in working muscle, and the magnitude of attenuation of blood flow in kidney was higher in OMI than that in normal subjects, probably due to maintaining the working muscle flow by less-increasing cardiac output during exercise in patients with impairment of cardiac funcion...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{presence}} of multiple melanocytic naevi {{is a strong}} risk factor for melanoma. Use of the <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> naevus <b>count</b> to identify at-risk patients is impractical. OBJECTIVES: To (i) identify a valid anatomical predictor of total naevus count; (ii) {{determine the number of}} naevi that most accurately predict total naevus count above 25, 50 and 100; and (iii) evaluate determinants of multiple melanocytic naevi and atypical naevi. METHODS: Clinical data from 292 consecutive Spanish patients consulting for skin lesions requiring debriding were collected throughout 2009 and 2010. Correlations between site-specific and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> naevus <b>counts</b> were analysed. Cut-offs to predict total naevus counts were determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: The studied population was young (median age 31  years, interquartile range 28 - 43). The naevus count on the right arm correlated best with the total nevus count (R(2) 0 · 80 for men, 0 · 86 for women). Presence of at least five naevi on the right arm was the strongest determinant of a total naevus count above 50 [odds ratio (OR) 34 · 4, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 13 · 9 - 85 · 0] and of having at least one atypical naevus (OR 5 · 7, 95 % CI 2 · 4 - 13 · 5). Cut-off values of 6, 8 and 11 naevi on the right arm best predicted total naevus count above 25, 50 and 100, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the arm as a practical and reliable site to estimate the total naevus count when screening or phenotyping large populations.

The spatial trends in the oyster community and healthrelated variables for Galveston Bay oyster reefs indicated that some other factors in addition to salinity are major structuring forces. Three different directional trends were found including one diametric to salinity. Cluster analyses, taking into account all measured variables, produced groupings primarily defined by salinity, and secondarily by region along the salinity gradient. Comparison of Perkinsus marinus analyses by the standard thioglycollate method and by the <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>count</b> method showed that the standard method produced false negatives in many samples taken throughout the bay, probably due to low infection intensities associated with low salinity at the time of collection. Even after correcting for the false negatives, average Perkinsus marinus prevalence for the bay was unusually low (52. 6 %) compared to previous studies. Examination of different oyster size classes is important for the best estimate of P. marinus infection intensity and prevalence. Based on the variables directly related to oyster health and production, four regions:the Redfish Bar area, the Yacht Club Reef area, the Dickinson Embayment, and the Houston Ship Channel, maintained the healthiest oyster populations in terms of density, biomass, and gonadal state.

Thermo Scientific's TPM- 903 B Portal Monitor was investigated to determine if it is a suitable first cut screening tool for internal contamination assessment of victims. A portal monitor was chosen for this study because they are readily accessible, transportable, easy to assemble, and provide <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>count</b> rates due to the detector size. The TPM- 903 B was modeled in Monte Carlo N-Particles Transport Code Version 5 (MCNP). This computational model was validated against the portal monitor's response to a series of measurements made with four point sources in a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) slab box. Using the validated MCNP 5 model and models of the MIRD male and female anthropomorphic phantoms, the response of the portal monitor was simulated for the inhalation and ingestion radionuclides from an RDD. Six representative phantoms were considered: Reference Male, Reference Female, Adipose Male, Adipose Female, Post-Menopausal Adipose Female, and 10 -Year-Old Child. The biokinetics via Dose and Risk Calculation Software (DCAL) was implemented using both the inhalation and ingestion pathways to determine the radionuclide concentrations in the organs of the body which were then used to determine the count rate of the portal monitor as a function of time. Dose coefficients were employed to determine the count rate of the detector associated with specific dose limits. These count rates were then compiled into procedure sheets to be used by first responders during the triaging of victims following an RDD. M. S.

One of the chairs, Model WBC- 6000 with three associated NaI(T 1) detectors, was donated to Texas A&M University. In order to bring it into operation, physical repairs to the control box and emergency release mechanism were completed. The block phantom that accompanied the chair did not have source bottles. After establishing a set of procedures, several sets of source bottles were fabricated for use in the lung, Gl tract, and thyroid regions of the phantoms.

40|$|Radiolabeled {{monoclonal}} antibodies for {{the treatment}} of follicular low-grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma have been available for several years in the United States and more recently throughout Europe. Since their introduction to treatment of refractory or relapsed patients, they have been evaluated for efficacy earlier {{in the course of the}} disease including so-called 1 st line therapy in conjunction with initial chemotherapy and as consolidation therapy in patients who have achieved remission following a course of chemotherapy. It can be expected that these agents will become more widely available. Two agents are currently distributed commercially: Bexxar® consisting of 131 I-labeled tositumomab and cold (unlabeled) tositumomab and Zevalin® consisting of 90 Y-labeled Ibritumomab and cold rituximab. All 3 antibodies recognize a cell surface antigen, CD 20, found on normal and malignant B lymphocytes characteristic of follicular lymphoma. The nomenclature: ”…tumomab” indicates that it is a tumor murine monoclonal antibody while “…ximab” indicates that it is a chimeric molecule in which a portion of the murine IgG has been removed and replaced with an equivalent component of human IgG. Rituximab is available in many countries for use as an immunotherapeutic either alone in relapsed patients or in conjunction with standard chemotherapeutic regimen. Because of the limited access to the radiolabeled products in Australia, Harvey Turner and colleagues in Perth radioiodinated rituxan (the nonradioactive component of Zevalin®), developed a protocol similar to Bexxar® and obtained gratifyingly similar good results. Clinical use depends upon evidence of CD 20 expression (usually available from biopsy material at diagnosis), confirmation of less than 25 % of marrow involvement, platelet counts > 100, 000 and preferably 150, 000 and granulocyte count > 3500. For either product, dosing is based on platelet <b>count</b> and <b>body</b> weight [up to 137 % ideal weight). Zevalin® dosage is 15 MBq (0. 4 mCi) /kg if platelets exceed 150 K; 11 MBq (0. 3 mCi) /kg between 100 K- 150 K. Bexxar® administration is based on <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> radiation absorbed dose determined by measuring <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>counts</b> on 3 occasions after administration of 185 MBq (5 mCi) of the 131 I-tositumomab.

P(0) (counts per second) is the value of the plasma {{clearance}} curve P(t) at time zero, and it can be obtained by back extrapolation using a mono-exponential fit to P(t). The range used for this exponential fit was chosen to be identical with the combined extent of the individually determined LU segments. In an independent study [8], this choice of fitting range for the mono-exponential method has been shown to yield optimal results. The injected dose [ID] (counts per second) was estimated from the <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>count</b> rate averaged over the first minute of the study and corrected for any residual activity in the region of the injection site. The detection sensitivity of activity from both the kidneys and the injected dose were considered equal, and no correction for renal depth was applied. This approximation was felt to be justified on account of the small scale of the animal model and the consistency of both size and anatomy within the sample population studied. The calculation of FUR was performed {{with the aid of a}} user-written renal curve analysis software program (Renalcurve V 3.0 B 1) made available by Hermes Medical Solutions (Stockholm, Sweden/London, UK). A feature of this program is that the theoretical relationship between the linear segment of the PR plot and the plateau level of the renal impulse retention function [IRF] is utilized to identify the LU segments. The IRF is obtained by deconvolution analysis using a constrained least square method. In order to improve the robustness of the linear fit to the LU segments, an estimate of the expected intercept is calculated from the IRF and included in the fitting process as an additional data point. The resultant values for FUR were expressed in units of percent injected dose per minute. In order to test for possible dependence of the FUR values on the ROI size or position, the image data from a subset of eight kidneys were re-analyzed independently.|$|R

Within a period of 1 ½ years, we conducted <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>counts</b> of ticks from 80 hunter-killed roe deer originating from a beech dominated forest area in central Germany. Averaged over the entire study period (winter 2007 –summer 2009), the mean tick burden per roe deer was 64. 5 (SE ±  10. 6). Nymphs were the most numerous tick life stage per roe deer (23. 9  ±  3. 2), followed by females (21. 4  ±  3. 5), larvae (10. 8  ±  4. 2) and males (8. 4  ±  1. 5). The individual tick burden was highly aggregated (k =  0. 46); levels of aggregation were highest in larvae (k =  0. 08), followed by males (k =  0. 40), females (k =  0. 49) and nymphs (k =  0. 71). To predict total life stage specific burdens based on <b>counts</b> on selected <b>body</b> parts, we provide linear equations. For estimating larvae abundance on the entire roe deer, counts can be restricted to the front legs. Tick counts restricted to the head are sufficient to estimate total nymph burden and counts on the neck are appropriate for estimating adult ticks (females and males).

The anabolic effects of high doses of rhGH have been tested in different clinical catabolic conditions, recently including patients with short bowel syndrome. The authors have investigated the effects of low-dose rhGH in short bowel syndrome in a placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial. METHODS: Ten patients were treated with daily subcutaneous doses of rhGH/placebo (0. 5 international units/kg- 1 per week- 1 = 0. 024 mg/kg- 1 per day- 1) for 8 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial {{with a minimum of}} 12 weeks wash-out. Absorptive capacity and biochemical parameters were investigated in a metabolic ward before treatment and during first and last week of treatment. Body composition was determined by DEXA-Scan (Lunar DPX, Scanexport Medical, Helsingborg, Sweden), impedance analysis, and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> potassium <b>counting.</b> RESULTS: Low-dose rhGH doubled serum levels of insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) and increased body weight, lean body mass, and total body potassium by 5 % (p < 0. 05).

We report a pooled analysis conducted using individual nevus data from 15 case-control studies (5, 421 melanoma cases and 6, 966 controls). The aims were to quantify the risk better and to determine whether relative risk is varied by latitude. Bayesian unconditional logistic random coefficients models were employed to study the risk associated with nevus characteristics. Participants with <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> nevus <b>counts</b> in the highest of 4 population-based categories had a greatly increased risk of melanoma compared with those in the lowest category (pooled odds ratio (pOR) 6. 9 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 4. 4, 1. 1. 2) for those aged = 50). The pOR for presence compared with absence of any clinically atypical nevi was 4. 0 (95 % CI: 2. 8, 5. 8). The pORs for 1 - 2 and >= 3 large nevi on the body compared with none were 2. 9 (95 % CI: 1. 9, 4. 3) and 7. 1 (95 % CI: 4. 7, 11. 6), respectively. The relative heterogeneities among studies were small for most measures of nevus phenotype, except for the analysis of nevus counts on the arms, which may have been due to methodological differences among studies. The pooled analysis also suggested that an abnormal nevus phenotype is associated most with melanomas on intermittently sun-exposed sites. The presence of increased numbers of nevi, large nevi and clinically atypical nevi on the body are robust risk factors for melanoma showing little variation in relative risk among studies performed at different latitudes.

40|$|Most {{mammalian}} tissues regulate O 2 utilization {{such that}} O 2 consumption (VO 2) is relatively constant at O 2 delivery (DO 2) {{higher than a}} critical value (DO 2 c). We studied the relationship between VO 2 and DO 2 of kidney and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> during graded progressive exsanguination. The relationship between <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> VO 2 and DO 2 was biphasic, and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> VO 2 decreased by 5. 6 +/- 14. 4 % (P = NS) from the initial value to the value nearest <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 c. Kidney DO 2 decreased {{in direct proportion to}} <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 such that the average R 2 value describing the linear regression of kidney DO 2 vs. <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 was 0. 94 +/- 0. 02. The relationship between kidney, like <b>whole</b> <b>body,</b> VO 2 and DO 2 appeared biphasic; however, kidney VO 2 decreased by 63. 3 +/- 10. 4 % (P less than 0. 0001) from the initial value to the value nearest kidney DO 2 c. Renal O 2 extraction ratio was relatively constant over a wide range of kidney DO 2, whereas <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> O 2 extraction ratio increased progressively at all <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 values as <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 decreased. However, final values of O 2 extraction ratio were indistinguishable for <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> (0. 86 +/- 0. 1) and kidney (0. 86 +/- 0. 06) (P = NS). We conclude that the pattern of kidney and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> VO 2 response to decreasing DO 2 differs during hemorrhage, particularly in the range of DO 2 normally associated with tissue wellness...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{estimating}} vitamin B 12 absorption by <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>counting</b> in patients without known gastrointestinal disorder, and in patients with pernicious anaemia, idiopathic achlorhydria, achlorhydria following gastric operations, and various forms of small intestinal disease. Patients with pernicious anaemia absorbed less than 30 % of the test dose; they could be distinguished from patients without gastrointestinal abnormality and from most achlorhydric patients who secreted more than 300 mg units of intrinsic factor in the post-histamine hour. Nevertheless, {{the wide range of}} normal absorption and the variable absorption from the normal gastrointestinal tract is emphasized and discussed. There is no relation between histamine-stimulated intrinsic factor production and vitamin B 12 absorption in patients with small intestinal disease...|$|E
40|$|The human phantom IRINA, {{which is}} widely used for <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>counting</b> calibrations, has been {{modelled}} using MATLAB. This document summa-rizes and explains the procedure that was applied for building voxel ver-sions of IRINA in standing position. All 6 sizes in standing positions were successfully modelled {{with the help of}} MATLAB and the files are ready to use for any MC simulation. The MC code GATE was used to verify the geometry of the IRINA phantom by comparing the placement of source tubes and scatterers in the Monte Carlo model to the original IRINA docu-mentation. The methodology can easily be used for building voxel phan-toms of IRINA in sitting and bending position, as well as any other geome-try that may be needed...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of {{high doses of}} 2 chelating agents, D-penicillamine and iodochlorohydroxyquin, on the metabolism of orally ingested 65 Zn was studied on rats by means of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>counting</b> assay technique. Both drugs were found to increase zinc absorption in a dose-dependent way to values significantly above those of the untreated control group. At identical doses D-penicillamine had a significantly stronger enhancing effect than the 8 -hydroxyquinoline derivate, except for the highest dosage which was 100 mg daily. The turnover of the absorbed 65 Zn fraction was followed {{during the time of}} observation which was 11 days. The elimination rate was practically identical in all experimental groups, except for the 100 mg D-penicillamine group in which the biological half-life of 65 Zn was significantly decreased as compared to the control group...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effects of hypertonic/hyperoncotic solution on blood-brain barrier damage, brain edema and morphological changes of rats during <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia. 90 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 5 groups: Control group (a room temperature for 4 hours); <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia group without solution treatment; <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia group with Ringer's solution treatment; <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia group with hydroxyethyl starch and Ringer's solution treatment; <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia group with Hypertonic/hyperoncotic solution treatment. All rats except those of control group were housed in a heated container and maintained at 36 °C for 3 hours until the rectal temperature reached 41 - 42 °C. Corresponding solutions were administered intravenously at the beginning of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia within 30 minutes as designed. Following <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia, rats were subsequently cooled down for 1 h. Evans blue was administered intravenously when the rectal temperature was cooled down to 37 °C. The leakage of Evans blue-albumin and water content of brain were calculated and morphological changes were investigated. In group with hypertonic/hyperoncotic solution treatment, brain water content and the leakage of Evans blue-albumin were the lowest among the four <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia groups. Compared with the other three <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia groups, in which profound to moderate damages to blood-brain barrier and brain tissue and cells were found, there were only slight morphological changes in the group with hypertonic/hyperoncotic solutionon treatment.

40|$|To measure <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> fat accurately, {{the dual}} energy X-ray {{absorptiometry}} (DXA) is widely utilized. Simultaneously, bone mineral density (BMD) of the <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> {{can also be}} measured. BMD is one of important information to diagnose osteoporosis. However, it is not established to use <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD for this diagnosis. It is recommended that lumbar and/or hip BMD {{should be used for}} diagnosing osteoporosis by the guideline for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Although it is possible to measure <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD and lumbar and/or hip BMD separately at the same visit, it is inevitable to expose patients to more X-ray. Therefore, an aim {{of this study is to}} elucidate the relationship between <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD and lumbar BMD to find the cut off point of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD for screening of osteoporosis. Two hundred and thirty six Japanese adult females were ascertained to this study. <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD and lumbar BMD of each subject were measured with the use of Delphi W (Hologic, USA). One hundred and sixty five subjects were judged as possible osteoporosis (less than 80 % of young adult mean (YAM) of lumbar BMD and/or definite fracture of lumbar vertebras). The cut off point of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD for screening possible osteoporosis was estimated by receiver operated characteristic (ROC) analysis. The cut off point of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD was 84 % of YAM, equivalent to 80 % of YAM of lumbar BMD, with the following sensitivity and specificity (0. 84 and 0. 79, respectively), indicating that <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD could be used for screening osteoporosis...|$|R
