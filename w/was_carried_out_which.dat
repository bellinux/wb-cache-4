5|$|After the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the throne in 1660, {{a survey of the}} castle <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> recommended repairs to the site. A survey carried {{out at the end of}} the 1730s suggested that the castle had ten artillery positions, but that there were not enough guns on the island to arm both the castle and the other defences, and that some of the guns that were available were unusable.|$|E
5|$|As {{the highway}} would {{pass through the}} Hamersley National Park, the Environmental Protection Authority decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and Management Program report was {{required}} for the Newman to White Springs section. Consultants prepared the report for Main Roads, which found that the key risks were erosion, visual impact, and possible damage to flora. A detailed survey <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> included the use of laser and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was then produced, and the project was approved in mid-1984.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1931 the Sonneberg Observatory founded by Cuno Hoffmeister {{was attached to the}} Babelsberg Observatory. For more than 60 years a photographic sky survey <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> represents the second largest archive of astronomical photographic plates. This archive and the discovery and investigation of variable stars popularized the name Sonneberg all over the astronomical world.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{domestic}} and international projects related to tourism have <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> could make Phú Quốc a new tourist hub in Southeast Asia.|$|R
50|$|X-rays {{are usually}} necessary, {{but this is}} not always the case. A {{physical}} examination will <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> sometimes involves a rectal examination and/or neurologic examination.|$|R
50|$|In {{this show}} tests <b>are</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> can <b>be</b> sent {{in by the}} viewers. However, most tests are not based upon {{scientific}} methods. It is rather a show in which stunts are performed.|$|R
25|$|Temeraire {{was ordered}} to Spithead and an {{investigation}} <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> eventually saw the court-martial and punishment of the mutiny's ringleaders. After deliberations, twelve were sentenced to be hanged, the remaining two were to receive two hundred lashes each. Having carried out the executions, Temeraire was immediately sent to sea, and Eyles sailed for Barbados, arriving there on 24 February, and the ship remained in the West Indies until the summer. During her time there the Treaty of Amiens was finally signed and ratified, and Temeraire was ordered back to Britain. She arrived into Plymouth on 28 September and Eyles paid her off on 5 October.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the war of}} the First Coalition, revolutionary France {{defeated}} the coalition of Prussia, Austria, Spain, and Britain. One result was the cession of the Rhineland to France by the Treaty of Basel in 1795. Six years later, the Concordat of 1801 an agreement between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII, was signed on 15 July 1801. Another two years later, in 1803, to compensate the princes of the annexed territories, a set of mediatizations <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> brought about a major redistribution of territorial sovereignty within the Empire. At that time, large parts of Germany were still ruled by Catholic bishops (95.000km² with {{more than three million}} inhabitants). In the mediatizations, the ecclesiastical states were by and large annexed to neighbouring secular principalities. [...] Only three survived as nonsecular states: the Archbishopric of Regensburg, which was raised from a bishopric with the incorporation of the Archbishopric of Mainz, and the lands of the Teutonic Knights and Knights of Saint John.|$|E
2500|$|The Niutaons {{financed the}} {{building}} of a church which was designed and built by Mr Foster Wesley and his assistant Lifuka Falakai from Vaiputo, with skilled Niutaons also working on the church. [...] Building began in April 1915 and was completed in about September 1919. The service of dedication was led by Pastor Panapa of Samoa and the church was named Tineifale. Ernest Tanumafili Allen, son of Captain E.F.H. Allen of the Samoa Shipping Trading Co Ltd, recalled in his memoir that his firm was involved in {{the building of}} the church. Part payment of $4,000 of the costs of the church was being delivered to the ship Dawn off Niutao. The money, mostly gold sovereigns, was in a small box, the lid secured by sinnet string; as the box was being passed from the canoe to the ship it was turned upside down and the coins fell into the sea. [...] Immediately a further collection <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> yielded $3,000.|$|E
50|$|In 1963 {{the castle}} became the {{possession}} {{of the state of}} Rhineland-Palatinate. In 1979 to 1981 comprehensive remediation measures <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> saw the remains of the detached chapel being uncovered and partially restored.|$|R
50|$|In 1929 some {{excavations}} <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> {{recorded the}} outline of the fort. The local authority marked out this outline in white paving stones. In the 1970s the terraced houses covering the site were demolished.|$|R
50|$|One {{thing that}} the elite are {{especially}} interested in is scientific research that the walkaways <b>are</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> could finally {{put an end to}} death - and all this leads to revolution and eventual war.|$|R
2500|$|In 1993, the East Anglian Waterways Association (EAWA) {{decided to}} step up its efforts to get the {{waterway}} restored, and an engineering study of the locks and channel restoration <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> found the concept to be feasible. They then commissioned and paid for a full environmental study, and North Norfolk District Council voiced their support in October 1999, although they did not envisage powered boats using the waterway. The EAWA organised working parties for volunteers from December 2000, and worked on clearing vegetation and repairs at Briggate, Bacton Wood and Honing. In 2008 the North Walsham and Dilham Canal Trust was formed. The aims of the Trust are to [...] "protect, conserve and improve {{the route of the}} canal and its branches {{for the benefit of the}} community and the environment." [...] It does this by working with the owners of the canal, local land owners, the East Anglian Waterways Association, local authorities and other interested parties. Since its formation, working parties have been joint ventures between the Trust and the EAWA.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2007, a civil {{protection}} national exercise Valtellina 2007 <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> simulated hydraulic and hydrogeological risk {{similar to that}} of the 1987 disaster.|$|E
50|$|End of 1996 {{the most}} {{important}} work <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> restored the entire facade, with focus on the sculptures which were heavily damaged by environmental pollution and pigeons.|$|E
50|$|Following the intervention, {{exploitation}} of the target <b>is</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> may lead to further refinement of the process for related targets. The output from the exploit stage will also be passed into other intelligence assessment activities.|$|R
50|$|Since July 2002, the {{airfield}} {{has been in}} use also for civil aviation. In December 2002, the airport received a license for international flights. Between 2002 and 2007 over 2,500 flights <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> transported about 25,000 passengers.|$|R
3000|$|... 10 The {{first four}} rounds of Phase II also record time use information, but the {{measures}} {{are not directly}} comparable and a separate analysis of those years should <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> could <b>be</b> {{the subject of a}} future study.|$|R
50|$|Eight years later, in 1803, to {{compensate}} the princes of the annexed territories, a set of mediatisations <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> brought about a major redistribution of territorial sovereignty within the Empire.|$|E
50|$|From 1965 to 1972 a {{programme}} {{of expansion}} <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> included {{the addition of}} a canteen, 6th Form Centre, sports hall, music and lecture rooms, art room, science laboratories, assembly hall and general subjects classrooms.|$|E
50|$|From 18 to 22 February, an Ipsos Reid poll <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> {{showed the}} Conservatives had regained their lead, with the Conservatives picking up support of 37 percent of decided votes, with the Liberals falling to 29%.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{development}} projects at Sungei Serangoon had <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> include {{the construction of}} an overhead bridge linking Old Tampines Road and the KPE expressway to Sengkang and the metal bridge linking Punggol East and Lorong Halus.|$|R
30|$|For this purpose, a systematised {{literature}} {{review of a}} relevant sample (measured by its subsequent editorial impact) of educational experiences published in specialised scientific literature will <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> will <b>be</b> subjected to an observation guide in which these various aspects are explored.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{includes}} {{multilayer structure}} description, its efficiency, general characteristics, and applications. Analysis <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> include {{research of the}} composite reinforced concrete. Fabrication methods, materials used, their quantities, fabrication process and used testing equipment of samples are described in this research. Using data acquired from compression machine a statistical analysis <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> showed that textile reinforced concrete strength increases from 150 % to 200 % on average and its plasticity also increases from 400 % to 660 % on average. Theoretically calculated textile reinforced concrete strength sustained, when it is being bent, is 1, 5 times greater than measured during the experiments due to the glass fiber layer‘s strength not always being used to its full potential...|$|R
50|$|In 2001, {{an audit}} <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> {{established}} the embezzlement of funds and corruption {{of a public}} instrument by a municipal official. It was reported that Mayor Pedro Araya filed a federal court complaint regarding this event.|$|E
50|$|The {{power plant}} {{was a major}} source of {{pollution}} for the adjoining areas owing to the coal-based generators, but things changed after electrostatic precipitators were installed in the chimneys, and large-scale afforestation <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> lowered the pollution levels significantly.|$|E
50|$|The Sekta {{village where}} the archaeological {{excavation}} <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> {{is now an}} open air living museum, is situated about 16 km from Imphal and 4 km north of Lamlai, on the Imphal-Ukhrul road to the northeast of Imphal on the left bank of the Iril River.|$|E
50|$|Another {{reason for}} their demise was the {{canalization}} of rivers. On the Elbe a lot of current regulating work had <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> evened <b>out</b> the gradient, reduced bends in the river and removed the shallows. As a result, the advantages of chain ship were reduced.|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{development of}} a technique to recover velocities measured with a Fabry-Perot interferometer {{in the presence of}} scattered light is presented.

40|$|A {{classification}} of integrable two-component systems of non-evolutionary partial differential equations that are {{analogous to the}} Camassa-Holm equation <b>is</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> via the perturbative symmetry approach. Independently, a {{classification of}} compatible pairs of Hamiltonian operators <b>is</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> leads to bi-Hamiltonian structures for the same systems of equations. Some exact solutions and Lax pairs are also constructed for the systems considered...|$|R
30|$|From 1980 to the present, {{different}} recessions and expansions {{took place}} with varying magnitude and duration. Moreover, {{a series of}} structural reforms <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>which</b> changed the dynamic of output in the long term. This irregular pattern of Peruvian GDP leads to non-linearities in the long-term component and to asymmetries in the cycles.|$|R
