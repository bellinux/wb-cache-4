5|$|On December 21, 1995, Israeli troops {{withdrew from}} Bethlehem, {{and three days}} later the city came under the {{complete}} administration and military control of the Palestinian National Authority in conformance with the Interim Agreement on the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> the Gaza Strip in 1995.|$|E
5|$|At 10:40, Gonen ordered Adan {{to cross}} to the <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> Sharon {{to move towards}} Suez City. Short of forces, Adan {{requested}} that Sharon send a battalion to protect his southern flank. Gonen consented, but Sharon would not comply, and consequently several critical positions would be lost to the Egyptians later on.|$|E
5|$|Bethlehem {{is home to}} Bethlehem University, a Catholic Christian co-educational {{institution}} of higher learning founded in 1973 in the Lasallian tradition, open to students of all faiths. Bethlehem University is the first university established in the <b>West</b> <b>Bank,</b> <b>and</b> can trace its roots to 1893 when the De La Salle Christian Brothers opened schools throughout Palestine and Egypt.|$|E
50|$|The Mississippi Delta AVA is an American Viticultural Area on {{the left}} (east) bank of the Mississippi River, between Memphis, Tennessee, and Vicksburg, Mississippi. It {{includes}} portions of the Mississippi Delta and the watershed of the lower Mississippi River in the U.S. states of Louisiana (<b>west</b> <b>bank),</b> Mississippi, <b>and</b> Tennessee.|$|R
50|$|In the 18th {{century the}} {{territory}} of Lichte (Wallendorf) was located in two different principalities with the Lichte river forming the border. On the <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> was Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt <b>and</b> on the east bank Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{this area}} on the <b>west</b> <b>bank,</b> Phelps <b>and</b> Gorham gave 100 acre at the high falls of the Genesee River to Ebenezer [...] "Indian" [...] Allen, on the {{condition}} that he build the grist mill and sawmill. The grist mill was distant from potential customers—only about 25 families lived on the <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> at the time—and there were no roads going to it from the few nearby farms on the <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> of the river. It never prospered. Allen's tract became the nucleus of modern Rochester, New York. The section of land on the <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> of the Genesee River became known as the Mill Yard Tract.|$|R
5|$|In 1997, in {{the wake}} of the 1995 Interim Agreement on the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> the Gaza Strip, {{administrative}} control over Bani Na'im was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). On August 31, 2010, four Israelis, two men and two women, were killed in a Hamas drive-by shooting on the road between Kiryat Arba and Bani Naim. The attack was condemned by Israel and the PNA.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Bethlehem {{hosted the}} largest {{economic}} conference {{to date in}} the Palestinian territories. It was initiated by Palestinian Prime Minister and former Finance Minister Salam Fayyad to convince {{more than a thousand}} businessmen, bankers and government officials from throughout the Middle East to invest in the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Gaza Strip. A total of 1.4 billion US dollars was secured for business investments in the Palestinian territories.|$|E
5|$|The Intifada {{began as}} an {{uprising}} of Palestinian youth against the Israeli occupation of the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Gaza Strip. On June 7, 1986, about {{a year before the}} Intifada started, al-Wazir was deported from Amman to Baghdad, eventually moving to Tunisia days after King Hussein declared that efforts in establishing a joint strategy for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict between Jordan and the PLO were over.|$|E
50|$|River Seiont {{is a small}} river which {{flows to}} the sea at Caenarfon, North Wales. Gwynedd County Council and Caernarfon Harbour Trust own this site, with no public access. The <b>west</b> river <b>bank,</b> <b>and</b> also in a past river cliff located 200m inland, is of {{particular}} interest for strata. The exposed rocks include the Arenig and overlying Llanvirn series.|$|R
25|$|In 2005 Del Naja {{organised}} {{and performed}} at a charity concert in Bristol for Tsunami Relief with Adrian Utley and Geoff Barrow of Portishead. The two-night event featured Massive Attack, Portishead, Robert Plant, The Coral and Damon Albarn. Del Naja and Marshall performed three shows in 2005 {{in support of}} Hoping, an organisation that helps raise money, support projects for Palestinian youth in refugee camps in the Gaza strip <b>and</b> the <b>west</b> <b>bank,</b> Lebanon <b>and</b> Syria.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{became the}} first east-west land {{connection}} between Batticaloa coastal belt and mainland. It reduced previous 30 km road access from other side and gives alternative road access to and from Batticaloa town {{to other areas of}} <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> of Batticaloa <b>and</b> Ampara District. Earlier, transport between the <b>west</b> <b>and</b> east <b>banks</b> was carried out by a small ferry through Batticaloa Lagoon.|$|R
5|$|Tubas was {{transferred}} to Palestinian National Authority (PNA) control in 1995 under the Interim Agreement on the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> the Gaza Strip. During the Jordanian and Israeli periods, the city was under {{the administration of the}} Nablus Governorate, but in 1996, the PNA declared Tubas and the immediate area to be an electoral district, and later, an independent administrative area—the Tubas Governorate.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Second Intifada (also called al-Aqsa Intifada) began, and Israel built a {{separation}} barrier. In the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, Israel withdrew all settlers and military presence from the Gaza Strip, but maintained military control of numerous {{aspects of the}} territory including its borders, air space and coast. Israel's ongoing military occupation of the Gaza Strip, the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> East Jerusalem {{continues to be the}} world's longest military occupation in modern times.|$|E
5|$|In December 2002, Fonda visited Israel and the West Bank {{as part of}} a tour {{focusing}} on stopping violence against women. She demonstrated with Women in Black against Israel's occupation of the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Gaza Strip outside the residence of Israel's Prime Minister. She later visited Jewish and Arab doctors, and patients at a Jerusalem hospital, followed by visits to Ramallah to see a physical rehabilitation center and Palestinian refugee camp. She was heckled by three members of Women in Green as she arrived to meet with leading Israeli feminists.|$|E
50|$|James Spalding from Perthshire, Scotland, and now of Frederica town on St. Simon's Island, {{operated}} two Indian trading {{stores on}} the St. Johns River, {{one on the}} east <b>bank,</b> <b>and</b> another on the <b>west</b> <b>bank.</b> He <b>and</b> his partner Roger Kelsall bought many of their goods through John Gordon in Charleston and merchant Basil Cowper in Savannah. Spalding and Kelsall, like many of their fellow traders, as well as Gordon and Cowper, were loyal to Great Britain. Panton, Leslie and Company, later the most well-known of the Creek trading firms, took over the Spalding and Kelsall stores when the two merchants emigrated to the Bahamas following the American Revolution.|$|R
50|$|Trent University routes {{connect the}} school with {{downtown}} and run at 10-minute headways daily during the Fall and Spring semesters, with reduced service during breaks and the Summer semester. A late night service {{that serves the}} <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> route outbound <b>and</b> the eastbank route inbound runs until 3:20 AM. The service is directly {{paid for by the}} students through their tuition fees.|$|R
50|$|United States President Abraham Lincoln {{was well}} aware of Confederate {{intentions}} and sent an expedition to establish a military presence in Texas and to discourage Maximilian from opening trade with the Confederacy. The military Federal force was commanded by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks, a political general with little discernible command ability. Banks's original intent was to launch a combined Army-Navy campaign in northwest Louisiana. The Union plan was to send Union Navy warships from the Mississippi up the tributary Red River, which was navigable upstream as far as where the boundaries of the Confederate states of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas came together. The Union had effected its Capture of New Orleans on May 1, 1862, and after the July 3, 1863 surrender of Confederate Vicksburg, the Union military had better control of both the east <b>and</b> <b>west</b> <b>banks</b> <b>and</b> of the mouth of the Mississippi. Unusually low water in the Red River at this time, however, prevented even relatively low-draft Union gunboats from operating effectively, and the anticipated overland Union invasion of Texas was further delayed.|$|R
5|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the terms of the}} Oslo agreement, Arafat was required to implement PLO authority in the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Gaza Strip. He insisted that financial support was imperative to establishing this authority and needed it to secure the acceptance of the agreements by the Palestinians living in those areas. However, Arab states of the Persian Gulf—Arafat's usual source for financial backing—still refused to provide him and the PLO with any major donations for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. Ahmed Qurei—a key Fatah negotiator during the negotiations in Oslo—publicly announced that the PLO was bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|On 28 September 2000, {{two days}} before the shooting, the Israeli {{opposition}} leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, a holy site in both Judaism and Islam with contested rules of access. The violence that followed had its roots in several events, but the visit was provocative and triggered protests that escalated into rioting across the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Gaza Strip. The uprising became known as the Second Intifada; it lasted over four years and cost around 4,000 lives, over 3,000 of them Palestinian.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, Sharon's {{division}} {{across the}} canal included the 243rd Paratrooper Brigade under Colonel Danny Matt and an armored brigade under Colonel Haim Erez. Sharon, wanting {{to expand the}} Israeli bridgehead northward, received permission to cross a third unit, an armored brigade under Colonel Amnon Reshef, to the <b>west</b> <b>bank,</b> <b>and</b> did so on October 19. The paratroopers {{and part of the}} armor had been holding the Israeli bridgehead since October 16, facing little resistance, while Reshef's brigade had been involved in heavy fighting at the Chinese Farm until it was relieved by Israeli reinforcements.|$|E
50|$|The defence {{consisted}} of three close-set banks separated by ditches.On the <b>west</b> the <b>banks</b> <b>and</b> ditches are well-preserved and about 50 m wide in total.On the other two sides only terraces remain where the defences once ran.The fort appears to have had just one entrance {{in the middle of}} the west side, at a slightly oblique angle to the rampart line, with gaps in the ramparts and causeways across the ditches.The interior is almost level and about 60 m above O.D.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the success}} the Israelis were having on the <b>west</b> <b>bank,</b> Generals Bar-Lev <b>and</b> Elazar ordered Sharon to {{concentrate}} on securing the bridgehead on the east bank. He was ordered to clear the roads leading to the canal {{as well as a}} position known as the Chinese Farm, just north of Deversoir, the Israeli crossing point. Sharon objected and requested permission to expand and breakout of the bridgehead on the <b>west</b> <b>bank,</b> arguing that such a maneuver would cause the collapse of Egyptian forces on the east bank. But the Israeli high command was insistent, believing that until the east bank was secure, forces on the <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> could be cut off. Sharon was overruled by his superiors and relented.|$|R
50|$|Bergen, {{along the}} <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> Hudson River <b>and</b> Bergen Hill would become {{contemporary}} Hudson County, New Jersey. Though it only became independent municipality from 1661 with {{the founding of}} a village at Bergen Square, Bergen began as a factorij at Communipaw circa 1615 and was first settled in 1630 as Pavonia, with settlements at Harsimus, Paulus Hook, Hoboken and Vriessendael were in the following years. They were {{along the banks of}} the North River (Hudson River) across from New Amsterdam, under whose jurisdiction they fell.|$|R
5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|In the Pyramid Age, {{the tomb}} of the king was {{associated}} with a mortuary temple located close to the pyramid. As {{the tomb of}} the king was hidden, this mortuary temple was located away from the burial, closer to the cultivation facing toward Thebes. These mortuary temples became places visited during the various festivals held in the Theban necropolis. Most notable is the Beautiful festival of the valley, where the sacred barques of Amun-Re, his consort, Mut, and son, Khonsu, left the temple at Karnak in order to visit the funerary temples of deceased kings on the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> their shrines in the Theban Necropolis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah {{officials}} engaged the Israeli {{government in a}} series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords. The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Gaza Strip over a five-year period, along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas. The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government. Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E
50|$|Colonel Roy E. Lindquist, {{commanding}} officer of the 508th PIR, was left in charge at Manoir de la Fière and led an assault at noon that eradicated the German defense, effecting a link up with an isolated group on the <b>west</b> <b>bank.</b> Through miscommunication <b>and</b> poor assumptions, the lodgment was not consolidated and was overrun by a German counterattack an hour later. A counterattack by Company B of the 508th crossed the bridge but was broken up and the survivors forced to swim the river to safety.|$|R
50|$|The Kita-Kyushu Railway {{opened the}} Fukuyoshi to Hamasaki section in 1923, {{extending}} it west to Higashi-Karatsu (situated {{on the east}} bank of the Matsuura River, opposite the Karatsu Line on the <b>west</b> <b>bank)</b> in 1924 <b>and</b> east to Hakata in 1924 and 1925. The line was again extended west to Yamamoto where it junctioned with the Karatsu line (establishing Higashi-Karatsu as a reversing station in the process) in 1929, and to Imari in 1935. Diesel locomotives were introduced in 1933, and the company was nationalised in 1937.|$|R
50|$|Garnish, a town {{located on}} the west coast of the Burin Peninsula, was well known for its lumbering and now for its lobstering operations. Located on Route 213, it is 25 km along route 220 north <b>west</b> of Grand <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> 18 km along Route 220 east of Marystown. The Way Office was {{established}} in 1852 and the first Waymaster was Henry Campe. In 2006 the town had a population of 578.|$|R
5|$|Mansaf is a {{traditional}} meal in the central <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Naqab region in the southern West Bank, having its roots from the Bedouin population of ancient Arabia. It is mostly cooked on occasions such as, during holidays, weddings or a large gathering. Mansaf is cooked as a lamb leg or large pieces of lamb {{on top of a}} taboon bread that has usually been smothered with yellow rice. A type of thick and dried cheesecloth yogurt from goat's milk, called jameed, is poured on top of the lamb and rice to give it its distinct flavor and taste. The dish is also garnished with cooked pine nuts and almonds. The classic form of eating mansaf is using the right hand as a utensil. For politeness, participants in the feast tear pieces of meat to hand to the person next to them.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian groups used to {{initiate}} few attacks on Israeli targets {{from both the}} <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Jordan before the Six-Day War, some of which caused Israel to retaliate which {{became known as the}} Reprisal operations. Following the seizure of the West Bank from Jordan in the June 1967 Six-Day War, Israel destroyed the existing Palestinian group Fatah networks there. In early 1968, however, Fatah guerrillas began raiding Israel from bases on the Jordanian side of the river. Most of these attacks were blocked by the Israel Defense Forces. At times, Jordanian Army infantry and artillery units gave the Fatah squads covering fire, leading to frequent direct skirmishes between the IDF and the Jordanian Army.|$|E
5|$|The 20,000-man right (north) wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg {{stood on}} the east bank of the Rhine behind the Sieg River, observing the French {{bridgehead}} at Düsseldorf. A portion patrolled the <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> behind the Nahe River. The Mainz Fortress and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress garrisons totaled about 10,000 more, including 2,600 at Ehrenbreitstein. Charles concentrated {{the bulk of his}} force, commanded by one of his more experienced generals, Count Baillet Latour, between Karlsruhe and Darmstadt, where the confluence of the Rhine and the Main made an attack most likely; the rivers offered a gateway into eastern German states and ultimately to Vienna, with good bridges crossing a relatively well-defined river bank. A force occupied Kaiserslautern on the west bank. Wilhelm von Wartensleben's autonomous corps covered the line between Mainz and Giessen.|$|E
5000|$|Heron Road {{starts on}} the Heron Road Bridge which crosses the Rideau River, Rideau Canal, {{and part of}} Vincent Massey Park. From there, most of Heron Road is a four- to six-lane divided {{principal}} arterial, and often becomes a speed trap; the speed limit is 60 km/h <b>west</b> of <b>Bank</b> Street <b>and</b> 50 km/h east of Bank Street despite the overall lack of pedestrians and relatively free flow (especially west of Bronson Avenue).|$|R
50|$|On September 7, the Right Bank Group of the Fifth Army {{with the}} flotilla's backing reached the right (<b>west)</b> <b>bank</b> of Volga <b>and</b> shelled Kazan from the {{commanding}} position of Uslan Hill. The Left Bank Group reached {{the mouth of}} the Kazanka River. That day the Arsk Group took Kinderle and Klyki villages to the east of Kazan. On September 9, sailors and landed marksmen under Nikolay Markin took the beachhead at the western part of Kazan. On that day the Left <b>Bank</b> Group <b>and</b> Arsk Group joined and laid siege to part of Kazan. On September 10, after storming the city from three directions, Red Army troops took control of Kazan.|$|R
2500|$|The canal {{then ran}} broadly <b>west</b> between <b>Bank</b> Street <b>and</b> West Canal Street, then turning {{a little more}} northerly from Blairhill Street, south of the present King Street, as far as Blair Street. Just east of Blair Bridge the Langloan branch diverged, heading a short {{distance}} south on the eastern margin of West End Park (originally called Yeomanry Park) to a basin serving Drumpellier Pit and Langloan Iron Works, founded in 1841, where Langloan Street now joins Bank Street. There was an [...] tunnel under <b>Bank</b> Street <b>and</b> Buchanan Street.|$|R
