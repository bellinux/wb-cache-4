5|$|The game's story {{centers on}} four youths {{whose parents were}} killed during an army {{invasion}} by the empire of Palamecia, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> hellspawn to conquer the world. Three of the four main characters join a rebellion against the empire, embarking on missions to gain new magic and weapons, destroy enemy superweapons, and rescue leading members of the resistance. The Game Boy Advance remake adds a bonus story after the game is completed.|$|E
5|$|Globally, condoms are {{the most}} common method of birth control. Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane. Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects. Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency. In Japan about 80% of couples <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|E

Steamworks also provides Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC), Valve's proprietary anti-cheat system; game servers automatically detect and report users <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> cheats in online, multiplayer games. In August 2012, Valve added new featuresincluding dedicated hub pages for games that highlight the best user-created content, top forum posts, and screenshotsto the Community area. In December 2012, a feature called Game Guides, where users can upload text and images detailing games and game strategies {{in the same manner}} as GameFAQs was added.

5|$|Knuckles' Chaotix is a side-scrolling, action-platform {{game that}} shares {{the same basic}} {{gameplay}} elements that defined earlier entries in the Sonic series. New to this game, however, is a partner mechanic which tethers the player to a computer or human-controlled partner. This tether behaves like a rubber band, and requires the player(s) to use its physics to maneuver through the zones. Players can choose between playing as five different characters, each with their own unique set of moves. Knuckles the Echidna can glide and climb walls, Mighty the Armadillo can jump up and kick off walls, Espio the Chameleon can run along walls and ceilings, Vector the Crocodile can boost {{through the air and}} climb walls, and Charmy Bee can fly and hover in the air. There are two other partner characters, Heavy the Robot and Bomb, who hinder players' progress due to their slow or destructive nature, respectively. The story follows the group's efforts to save a mysterious island from Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> its magical Chaos Rings for their evil plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{four are}} being aided by local Ibizan Carmen (Leticia Dolera), who begins a {{relationship}} with Baxter. They soon realise they are still being hunted when their rental car explodes. Quinn is kidnapped by Mackenzie (David Warner), an elderly British expatriate who is revealed {{to be the leader}} of the drug operation. The four are forced to return the money in exchange for their lives. When they are €100 short from a speeding fine, Mackenzie makes the four produce fake ecstasy for a nightclub, at which point he allows them to return home with five million euros that were paid to them by the nightclub, though Carmen is left behind. Mackenzie tricks them into boarding a ferry for Morocco, where they are arrested and sent to a black site prison in the desert. After another attempt on their lives, they are informed that the drug operation was organised by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> the operation to fund black operations, {{and as a result of}} the four's interference a kill contract is out against them. With assistance by the British government, they move to Cape Town, South Africa, to live new lives and identities to avoid CIA detection, though they are no longer allowed to contact each other or their families.|$|E

Telegram is the most widely used online messaging service in Iran, while Instagram is the most popular online social networking service. Direct access to Facebook has been blocked in Iran since the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, due to organization of the opposition movements on the website; however, Facebook has around 12 to 17 million users in Iran <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> virtual private networks and proxy servers to access the website.

500|$|From Dust has {{the option}} of two main game modes, one being the Story mode, the other a Challenge mode. The former {{consists}} of a sequence of missions which play through {{the story of a}} lost tribe <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> the player (who controls [...] "The Breath") to travel to different levels in an attempt to discover what happened to their old tribe. By helping the tribe to find the different totems scattered on a map, they can begin constructing their village next to the totem. Players can also send tribespeople to look for magical stones, which will grant them the ability to manipulate the world, by repelling water and fire for example. When the tribe successfully builds villages next to every totem, a portal will open and the player can proceed into the next map. These maps become more and more challenging as players progress. New elements, such as trees that erupt in fire, and plants that explode, are introduced in later levels.|$|E

Maggie offers to join Quinn, Wade, and Rembrandt to chase down Rickman using the Sliders' original timer and recover the one with their Earth's coordinates.|$|E
2500|$|They largely {{function}} as a distinct class, and so distinguish themselves by using language inaccessible to people outside the academy, with more or less deliberately exclusionary effects. In Chomsky's view {{there is little reason}} to believe that academics are more inclined to engage in profound thought than other members of society and that the designation [...] "intellectual" [...] obscures the truth of the intellectual division of labour: [...] "These are funny words actually, I mean being an 'intellectual' has almost nothing to do with working with your mind; these are two different things. My suspicion is that plenty of people in the crafts, auto mechanics and so on, probably do as much or more intellectual work as people in the universities. [...] There are plenty of areas in academia where what's called 'scholarly' work is just clerical work, and I don't think clerical work's more challenging than fixing an automobile engine—in fact, I think the opposite.... So if by 'intellectual' you mean people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> their minds, then it's all over society" [...] (Understanding Power, p.96).|$|E
