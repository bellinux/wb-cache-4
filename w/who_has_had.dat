40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in women <b>who</b> {{reported}} <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with {{both men and women}} and women <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with a man in the 3 months before and <b>having</b> at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during the year before the study. Of these women, 38 % <b>who</b> reported ever <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with a woman were compared with those <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only. RESULTS: Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with both men and women were more likely than women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a sex partner <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with both men and women <b>had</b> a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with both men and women were more likely than women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only to engage in multiple risk behaviors. Health workers should be aware of bisexual experience among women, since this may be a marker for multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STDs...|$|R

5|$|Members of {{the current}} and {{previous}} Worldcon are eligible to nominate new writers for the Campbell Award under the same procedures as the Hugo Awards. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, at which point a shortlist is made of the five most-nominated writers, with additional nominees possible {{in the case of}} ties. Voting on the ballot of five nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Writers become eligible once they have a work published anywhere in the world which was sold for more than a nominal amount. While final decisions on eligibility are decided by the WSFS, the given criteria for an author to be eligible are specifically defined as someone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> a written work in a publication which had more than 10,000 readers and which paid the writer at least 3 cents per word and a total of at least 50 US dollars.|$|E

5|$|The {{estimated}} {{prevalence of}} active epilepsy (as of 2012) {{is in the}} range 3–10 per 1,000, with active epilepsy defined as someone with epilepsy <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> a least one unprovoked seizure {{in the last five}} years. Epilepsy begins each year in 40–70 per 100,000 in developed countries and 80–140 per 100,000 in developing countries. Poverty is a risk and includes both being from a poor country and being poor relative to others within one's country. In the developed world epilepsy most commonly starts either in the young or in the old. In the developing world its onset is more common in older children and young adults due to the higher rates of trauma and infectious diseases. In developed countries the number of cases a year has decreased in children and increased among the elderly between the 1970s and 2003. This has been attributed partly to better survival following strokes in the elderly.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveWomen <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia {{demonstrate}} higher {{prevalence of}} metabolic syndrome (MetS), impaired vascular function, and increased sympathetic activity and are {{at increased risk}} of cardiovascular disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of 12 weeks of exercise training (70 - 80 % maximum volume of oxygen utilization) in women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia on physical fitness, components of MetS, vasculature, and autonomic functions compared with healthy control subjects. Study DesignOur prospective case-control study included 24 normotensive women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia and 20 control subjects who were matched for age and postpartum interval (all 6 - 12 months after delivery). Before and after training, we measured all components of MetS (ie, BP, lipids, glucose/insulin, and albuminuria), carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and brachial and superficial femoral artery endothelial function that used flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Autonomic activity was quantified with power spectral analysis (low-frequency/high-frequency power [LF/HF] ratio). ResultsAt baseline, women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia demonstrated higher values of most components of MetS. Compared with the control subjects, women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia <b>had</b> increased IMT (580 ± 92 μm vs 477 ± 65 μm, respectively), impaired endothelial function (FMD brachial artery, 5. 3 % ± 2. 2 % vs 10. 8 % ± 3. 5 %, respectively; FMD superficial femoral artery, 4. 9 % ± 2. 1 % vs 8. 7 % ± 3. 2 %, respectively) and increased LF/HF power ratio (2. 2 ± 1. 0 vs 1. 3 ± 0. 4, respectively; all P <. 05). In both groups, exercise training decreased values of most components of MetS and IMT, improved FMD, and concurrently reduced LF/HF. Despite these improvements, vascular and autonomic variables did not normalize by 12 weeks of training in women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that exercise training in women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia and control subjects improves components of MetS, endothelial function, vascular wall thickness, and autonomic control. Nonetheless, trained women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia only reached a cardiovascular status that is comparable with sedentary healthy control subjects...|$|R
