5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels {{and should not be}} {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions.

5|$|The {{mating season}} lasts from August to February, and {{coincides with the}} arrival of the rainy season in {{northern}} Australia. The female does the bulk of the nest building, although the male does assist; this is unusual for the genus Malurus. Concealed in grass tussocks or low shrubs, the spherical nest is constructed of dried grasses and usually lined with smaller, finer grasses and hair. Nests examined in southeast Queensland tended to be larger and untidier than those in northern Australia; the former measured 1215cm high by 912cm wide and bore a partly covered 36cm diameter entrance, whereas the latter average around 1013cm in height by 68cm wide with a 24cm entrance. Construction takes around one week, and there may be an interval of up to another seven days before eggs are laid. The eggs produced are white with reddish-brown spots in clutches of three to four, and measure 14.517 x 1013mm; those of subspecies melanocephalus are a little larger than those of cruentatus. The eggs are incubated for two weeks by the female alone. The nestlings are hidden under cover for one week after hatching. The juveniles depend on parents and helpers for approximately one month. They learn to fly between 1112days after hatching. Broods hatched earlier in the season <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> raise the broods hatched later on. They will stay as a clutch group for the season after hatching.|$|E
