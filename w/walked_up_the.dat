5|$|At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda {{left the}} bunker {{and walked up}} to the garden of the Chancellery, where they {{committed}} suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot Magda and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into his body, which did not move.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E

5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in a Last Man Standing match next. In a Last Man Standing match, {{there are}} no {{disqualifications}} or count outs, instead to win the match the competitor has to force their opponent to {{not be able to}} reach a standing position by the count of 10. However, this match was only promoted as a Last Man Standing match, instead it was held under Texas Death match rules where a wrestler must pin or submit their opponent and then have them fail to respond to a count of 10. Styles got the first fall of the night, when he forced Angle to tap out to Angle's own signature submission maneuver the Ankle lock. Angle made it to his feet before the count concluded. Angle gained a pinfall later on in the match after slamming Styles off the top of a padded turnbuckle with a suplex. Before Styles could reach his feet to beat the count, Angle slammed Styles onto the mat back-first with his signature Olympic slam maneuver and gained another pinfall to start the count over. Styles beat that count as well, with Angle trying for the Olympic Slam again before Styles' countered it into his signature Styles' Clash maneuver and pinned Angle. After Angle reached his feet, Styles and Angle fought up a padded turnbuckle with Styles gaining the advantage. At this time, Styles grabbed Angle by the neck and fell backwards from the turnbuckle and drove Angle head-first into the mat. Angle failed to reach the 10 count afterwards, with Styles being declared the winner of the contest at 24 minutes and 50 seconds. Following the encounter, the referee called for medical attention for Angle who was scripted to appear as if he had suffered a neck injury. Styles then entered the ring once Angle reached his feet and lifted Angle up and dropped him on his head. As Styles <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ramp, he was attacked by Sting, who drove Styles' head into the ramp with his signature Scorpion Death Drop maneuver, as Kevin Nash looked on.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 1818 {{a retired}} officer on half-pay, Lieutenant Davies, {{who had a}} {{grievance}} about his application from the War Office for a pension and was also mad, shot Palmerston as he <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stairs of the War Office. However, the bullet only grazed his back and the wound was slight. After Palmerston learned that Davies was mad, he paid for his legal defence at the trial (Davies was sent to Bedlam).|$|E

At about five kilometres (3.1mi) from the river's mouth, he observed a ford allowing the easy crossing from the west shore to the east shore. This discovery {{was followed by a}} solid skirmish between British soldiers, attempting to cross, and French soldiers entrenched on the other side. The British reported 45 killed and wounded.|$|E

25|$|The {{group on}} the pier was a rusty one — men and women, and boys and girls, all ragged, and barefoot, uncombed and unclean, and by instinct, education, and profession, beggars. They trooped after us, and never more, while we tarried in Fayal, did {{we get rid of}} them. We <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> middle of the {{principal}} street, and these vermin surrounded us on all sides, and glared upon us; and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back, just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street.|$|E

Burton <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> track to confront Gordon and the two got into a shoving match. Burton finished 12th in the final standings. Afterwards, Burton assumed responsibility for the incident, stating he was attempting {{to catch up to}} Gordon, but was unable to see in the sunlight's glare.|$|E

25|$|Undertaker {{would return}} on the March 6 episode of Raw after Braun Strowman called out Reigns. Strowman left the ring {{following}} a brief staredown with Undertaker, who was then confronted by Reigns. After disrespectful comments were made by Reigns, The Undertaker performed a chokeslam on him. This led to a No Holds Barred match between Undertaker and Reigns at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, where Undertaker lost to Reigns after five spears in his fourth WrestleMania main event. After the match, Undertaker left his gloves, coat and hat {{in the center of}} the ring before slowly making his exit, also walking over to his wife Michelle McCool to kiss her, then <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ramp and performed his signature arm-raised pose as smoke surrounded him and he descended down into the ramp to the sound of his music. After he disappeared, the lights went out and his signature gong sounded off three times to end the show.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{it is well}} {{established}} that Caspar had been niggling Coleman since the very start of the match, which included making persistent and heavy contact with a nasty boil on Coleman's neck; and that Caspar had punched Coleman twice whilst play was {{at the other end}} of the ground, immediately before Coleman retaliated; and that, apart from his reaction to Caspar's thuggery, Coleman had not been proactive in any way. The match to that time had been a somewhat brutal encounter, and the crowd was highly agitated. During the match bottles were thrown at Coleman, and as he came off the ground at half-time, and <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> players race, a Carlton fan spat at him through gaps in the cyclone wired barriers that separated the spectators from the players. Coleman snapped, and smashed the fan in the face, badly hurting his hand. He went into the Essendon rooms, shouting with rage at the total absence of any protection from the match officials, took off his jumper, and spoke of not returning to the field.|$|E
500|$|On February 21, 2012, {{as part of}} {{a protest}} {{movement}} against the re-election of Vladimir Putin, five women from the group entered the Cathedral of Christ the Savior of the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow. There was no church service in session at the time, and only a few people were in the cathedral. Removing their winter clothes, they put on colorful balaclavas, <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> steps leading to the altar, and began to jump around, punching the air. After less than a minute, they were escorted outside the building by guards. Film of the performance was later combined with footage shot at a different church, identified by Russian Orthodox Church spokesman Vsevolod Chaplin as the Epiphany Cathedral in Yelokhovo, to create a video clip for the song, which they entitled [...] "Punk Prayer: Mother of God Drive Putin Away".|$|E

500|$|Snowdon {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "probably the busiest mountain in Britain", with approximately 444,000 people having <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mountain in 2016. A number of well-established and engineered footpaths lead to Snowdon's summit from all sides, and can be combined in various ways. The circular walk starting and ending at [...] and using the [...] route and the route over [...] is called the Snowdon Horseshoe, and is considered [...] "one of the finest ridge walks in Britain". The routes are arranged here anticlockwise, starting with the path leading from Llanberis. In winter conditions, all these routes become significantly more dangerous and the Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team state that [...] "additional skills, equipment and knowledge are required". Many inexperienced walkers have been killed over the years attempting to climb the mountain via the main paths.|$|E
500|$|With this in mind, the {{positioning}} of Castle Rising may have exposed it to higher ground, {{but it also}} made it strikingly prominent across the valley. The whole entrance to the castle was also designed to communicate to a visitor {{the status of the}} castle lord. As they came through the gatehouse and past the earthworks into the bailey, {{the south side of the}} forebuilding - deliberately facing the entrance - would have been revealed, covered in fashionable carving and decorative features. Visitors would then have <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stairs of the forebuilding, have paused in a waiting room, originally largely open to the elements, before being allowed through a decorative entrance door. The doorway led into the great hall, from where the lord, possibly sat in a throne alcove to the left, would have met the [...] visitor.|$|E
500|$|The next {{match was}} the No Disqualification match between Big Show and Floyd Mayweather, Jr.. Early in the match, Mayweather {{repeatedly}} escaped Big Show's grasp and delivered body shots to him. Mayweather and his accomplices tried to [...] "walk out" [...] of the match, but Big Show <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ramp and brought Mayweather {{back in the}} ring. As Big Show was about to chokeslam Mayweather, one of Mayweather's accomplices struck a steel chair on Big Show's back, and the latter chokeslammed him in retaliation. Capitalizing from this distraction, Mayweather grabbed that chair and hit Big Show multiple times {{on the head with}} it. Finally, Mayweather removed his right glove and {{put on a pair of}} brass knuckles to hit Big Show in the face. As a result, Big Show was knocked out as he could not answer the referee's ten count, and Mayweather was declared the winner.|$|E

There are several different accounts on what followed. According to one account, Goebbels shot his wife and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards by Goebbels' SS adjutant, Günther Schwägermann.

500|$|Ray Harding {{wrote the}} script for [...] "Episode 523". Bruce Andrews from Charles Sturt University noted that {{it is one of}} only a few Neighbours episodes to include the entire cast. The {{producers}} asked Rod Hardy to direct the episode, due to his experience of directing other television weddings. Hardy believed that [...] "the magic of the episode" [...] is captured best in two close-up shots of Scott and Charlene. The director recalled [...] "The image that stays with me is the close-up of Kylie as she arrives and then the close-up on Jason's face, and those two looks epitomised what the whole scene was about." [...] The episode was shot [...] "in great secrecy" [...] three months before it was broadcast on Australian television. The shoot was initially delayed due to bad weather. Due to a limited budget, there were very few extras on set and crew were asked to stand in at the church instead. The scenes were shot in soft focus, creating [...] "a halo effect" [...] around Charlene as she <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> aisle.|$|E
