5|$|<b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> lot of {{recording}} at his house. I'd come {{by in the}} morning and Stuart would answer the door in his stocking feet– as he'd been up all night. I'd bring him {{a cup of coffee and}} say, 'Stuart, your house is a mess, there's no food in the cupboard.' Then I'd call someone from my house to bring food over for him. And then we'd work all day. We're very much the odd couple.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

500|$|Faye Marsay, who {{portrayed the}} Waif, spoke about her scenes and filming with Williams, saying, [...] " [...] I think <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> month in Belfast {{before we started}} shooting. We went into the stunt tent and lived there. It was choreographed like a dance. Maisie is so well coordinated and good at what she does. I'm {{a little bit less}} coordinated and easily pissed off. I would drop the stick down and go, [...] "I can't do it!" [...] And she would {{encourage}} me. She's so supportive. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> month, and then the day before the cameras turned on, we would go through the moves a couple of times so we wouldn't hurt each other. There were a few times we clipped each other. I remember getting her in the stomach really bad one time, and she nearly cut my ear off at one point. It was fun. It was a lot of fun, but we were exhausted as well." ...|$|E

The location was suggested by Godrich, who had used the studio to produce records by Travis and Beck and {{thought it would be}} a [...] "good change of scenery" [...] for Radiohead. Yorke said: [...] "We were like, 'Do we want to fly halfway around the world to do this?' But it was terrific, because we worked really hard. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> track a day.

Kavner {{described}} the show as, [...] "like being back in school, {{a chance to play}} a wide variety of characters, some really vicious people, to not rest on laurels, to not play it safe". Kavner commented, [...] "What I do is not mimicry or an impersonation, but more of an assimilation. [...] <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> lot of looking at people to find out who to base our characters on. We did our homework on our lunch hour." [...] She received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Best Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.|$|E

I had been to a music festival so I hadn't slept the whole weekend. Then I was jumping in the Irish sea. It was a totally manic day. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> million different takes.

Impressed? I was very impressed." [...] A guitarist was still needed, and Farndon recruited lead guitarist James Honeyman-Scott into the group that summer.

500|$|As {{the series}} progressed during its {{broadcast}} season, the writers received frequent notes and directives from Fox network executives calling for increases and decreases in the science-fiction, comedy and traditional Western elements. Cuse said, [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> particularly {{good job of}} maintaining continuity with all the schizophrenic notes we were getting from the network." [...] However, midway through the first season, the writers made a thematic shift from science-fiction to more comedy and adventure. Cuse said, [...] "We were biting off more than we could chew... {{we were trying to}} do a comedic action adventure Western, with tongue-in-cheek humor, genuine drama, plus science fiction. All these things added too many elements to serve simultaneously." [...] By the final third of the series, the writers had wrapped up the science-fiction plot with the Orb and focused more on traditional Western motifs.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Godsmack {{returned}} to the studio after the multi-platinum success of Godsmack to start recording Awake. The album was released on , 2000. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200, and has been certified 2x platinum by the RIAA. [...] "Vampires", a song on the album, also earned the band a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2002. With the release of Awake, Godsmack toured Europe supporting Limp Bizkit. Erna said at the time, [...] "We've been touring nonstop since August 1998, So most of Awake was written on tour while we were ping-ponging between America and Europe, building up the band. [...] "Ozzfest" [...] was actually the only big tour where we rode under someone else's wings; <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of work on}} our own." [...] The band played Ozzfest in 2000 again as they had in 1999.|$|E

[...] To achieve the explosion at Luke's Bar, Weeks said, [...] "We {{could not take}} out the windows , which are [...] multiple small colored glass and metal frames. We didn’t know frankly when we picked that location {{that we would have}} that explosion... What we did was build a fireproof box in the entrance and we had a cannon in there which blew out debris and smoke and some fire. And then <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> lighting effect on the inside and then the rest of the explosion was handled by visual effects." [...] For the scenes on the PATH train and station, location manager Jason Farrar noted that production had exclusive use of the tracks and platform during the day when ridership was low to get their shots.|$|E

It would be a really amazing experience just to get back and work with the same guys again." [...] Soon after, Morello said that he's interested in working with Cornell again, remembering their 2014 Seattle performance with great fondness: [...] "I love Chris and consider him a great friend. The Hall of Fame jam was nice, but a little chaotic. Playing with him in Seattle, that was just fantastic. I love that guy. He's one of the most talented vocalists in the history of vocalists. And {{to be able to play}} the songs that we wrote together, it was awesome and so much fun. I hope we do something like that again." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Clarkson explains that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] is [...] "about the dipstick who completely screwed up and now is unhappy and you're happy." [...] She also considered the song {{as one of her}} favorites that she once intended to name Breakaway after the song. Critics speculated that the song reflects Clarkson's break-up with David Hodges, an ex-member of Evanescence. According to MTV, the song was originally written prior to the break-up. Nonetheless, Clarkson decided to tweak the song lyrics after breaking up with Hodges to express her emotional pain. Clarkson also said that the song almost did not make it into the album. She explained, [...] "It had different lyrics in the beginning [...] I ended up calling Luke , the writer, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> totally different song to it. It's now my favorite song on the record. Crappy relationships [...] a good song." ...|$|E

To improve his physique and athletic abilities {{for the role}} of Drago, he trained intensely in bodybuilding and boxing for five months before the film was shot. Lundgren said, [...] "We trained six days a week—weights in the morning for about an hour, then boxing in the afternoon. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> split of chest and back one day and then shoulders, legs, and arms the next. We boxed {{for an hour and a}} half, practiced the fight choreography, and did bag work and abs." [...] He weighed [...] – [...] during the filming, but in the film he was billed at one publisher said of Drago, [...] "He's a hulking 261pounds of merciless fighting machine, the best that Soviet science & medicine can create".

500|$|... "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" [...] is a comical Halloween episode {{which was}} filmed in Auckland, New Zealand. [...] After {{shooting}} for two days, director T.J. Scott went to producer Robert Tapert and asked permission {{to alter the}} episode's artistic style to stylised rock video horror. [...] Scott said, [...] "I got the crew together and said, 'Okay guys, here we go. This {{is going to be}} a lot more vampy and fun,' and cranked up the ghetto blaster with rock music and away we went." [...] Because of the subject, Scott was able to increase the episode's level of sexual content. [...] Scott said, [...] "we did two takes that were on the edge of tasteful vampire sexuality, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> third take where Lucy really let loose. Of course, we all died laughing and said, 'Okay, that one is never going to make it to the screen'; we definitely pushed it too far!" [...] Ultimately, Scott felt that [...] "if you pull it too far out of context and try to take it seriously, it's a bit too rock video at times." ...|$|E
500|$|Arcade Fire {{also contributed}} to the movie's {{original}} score, The Hunger Games: Original Motion Picture Score. The group composed the grand, fascistic-inspired, ominous Panem national anthem, entitled [...] "Horn of Plenty", an important and signature leitmotif appearing throughout the film. [...] "We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise," [...] Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. [...] "And there’s an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It’s like the Capitol’s idea of itself, basically." [...] He further added that [...] "it's not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting event like the [...] Games. So <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> structure for that, and then James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film." [...] Arcade Fire's Panem national anthem has received strong reviews. According to Spin Mobile, [...] "'Horn of Plenty' sounds both exactly like Arcade Fire and exactly like a futuristic anthem." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Jennifer Lee {{strongly}} {{believed that}} there couldn't be any other Anna but Kristen Bell, saying, [...] "It was definitely a wonderful surprise hearing her voice , not knowing {{that she had been}} classically trained. Also, she had such a warm, sweet voice. She was everything that we could've hoped for Anna." [...] Co-director Chris Buck shared Lee's ideas, commenting, [...] "Kristen Bell for Anna was the very first person that we saw. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> lot of casting to find Anna, but she just hit it out of the park. From the beginning we loved her, and she just kind of became Anna and Anna became her. I don't know which one is which." [...] Idina Menzel was also surprised by her co-star's singing ability, stating that, [...] "I didn't know how great a singer she was. I quickly found out and need to constantly tell her because she doesn't tell anybody else! She's always playing it down." [...] Songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez later commended Bell's quick comprehension of her ideas, saying that she would collaborate with the actress for [...] "the rest of [...] life" [...] if she could. Anna's animator Becky Bresee commented that Bell's voice [...] "lends itself well, so you are taking bits and pieces." ...|$|E
