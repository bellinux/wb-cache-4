5|$|In June 2014 a {{study by}} the <b>Woods</b> <b>Hole</b> Oceanographic Institution {{concluded}} that emperor penguins are at risk from global warming, which is melting the sea ice. This study predicted that by 2100 all 45 colonies of emperor penguins will be declining in numbers, mostly due to loss of habitat. Loss of ice reduces the supply of krill, which is a primary food for emperor penguins.|$|E
5|$|MIT {{maintains}} substantial {{research and}} faculty ties with independent research {{organizations in the}} Boston area, such as the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the <b>Woods</b> <b>Hole</b> Oceanographic Institution.

5|$|A <b>Woods</b> <b>Hole</b> Oceanographic Institution {{study in}} January 2009 found that emperor {{penguins}} could be {{pushed to the}} brink of extinction by the year 2100 due to global climate change. The study constructed a mathematical model to predict how the loss of sea ice from climate warming would affect a big colony of emperor penguins at Terre Adélie, Antarctica. The study forecasted an 87% decline in the colony's population, from three thousand breeding pairs in 2009 to four hundred breeding pairs in 2100.|$|E

5|$|Forecasters {{initially}} predicted Beryl {{to brush}} the Carolinas; as such, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued for the eastern coast of North Carolina from Cape Lookout northward to Currituck Beach Lighthouse. When a more northeastward track became apparent, a tropical storm watch was issued about 33hours prior to moving ashore from <b>Woods</b> <b>Hole</b> to Plymouth, Massachusetts, including Cape Cod, Nantucket, and Martha's Vineyard. About 22hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center replaced the watch with a tropical storm warning for the same area, and also issued a tropical storm watch from <b>Woods</b> <b>Hole,</b> Massachusetts westward to New Haven, Connecticut and for the eastern portion of Long Island from east of Fire Island to Port Jefferson. In anticipation for the storm, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency was activated as a trial run for the hurricane season. Local Red Cross chapters were opened, as well, with two volunteer teams placed on standby to assist. Across southeastern Massachusetts, police departments maintained extra staff in preparation for any potential problems from the storm. Many fishermen secured their boats, while some business owners boarded up windows to prevent storm damage.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiocarbon}} dating {{analysis of the}} papyrus by the Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory in 2013 dated the papyrus to between 404 and 209 BC. However, the cleaning protocol had to be interrupted during processing to preserve the fragment. A second analysis was performed by Harvard University and the <b>Woods</b> <b>Hole</b> Oceanographic Institution found a mean date of AD 741. A Raman spectroscopy analysis at Columbia University found that the ink was consistent with those in manuscripts from 400 BC to AD 700–800. These analyses suggest that the fragment as a material artifact is probably medieval and not modern.|$|E
5|$|Titanic sank in 1912, {{when she}} {{collided}} with an iceberg during her maiden voyage. The wreck {{could not be}} located {{at the time and}} was not discovered until 1985. Numerous expeditions tried using sonar to map the sea bed in the hope of spotting it, but were unsuccessful. The wreck was finally located by a joint French-American expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel of IFREMER and Robert Ballard of the <b>Woods</b> <b>Hole</b> Oceanographic Institution. The wreck {{has been the focus of}} intense interest since its discovery and has been visited by numerous expeditions, including salvage operations which have controversially recovered thousands of items which have been conserved and put on public display.|$|E

5|$|Great {{white sharks}} were {{previously}} thought to reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age, but are now believed to take far longer; male great white sharks reach sexual maturity at age 26, while females take 33 {{years to reach}} sexual maturity. Maximum life span was originally believed {{to be more than}} 30 years, but a study by the <b>Woods</b> <b>Hole</b> Oceanographic Institution placed it at upwards of 70 years. Examinations of vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied. The shark's late sexual maturity, low reproductive rate and slow growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and environmental change.|$|E
5|$|Journalists include NBC {{reporter}} Chris Hansen, AP White House correspondent Nedra Pickler and NPR Washington correspondent Don Gonyea. Novelist Michael Kimball {{graduated in}} 1990. Novelist and true crime author R. Barri Flowers, who in 1977 earned a bachelor's degree and in 1980 a master's degree in criminal justice, was inducted in 2006 into the MSU Criminal Justice Wall of Fame. Author Erik Qualman graduated with honors in 1994 {{and was also}} Academic Big-Ten in basketball. Susan K. Avery, the first woman {{president and director of}} the <b>Woods</b> <b>Hole</b> Oceanographic Institution, received an MSU bachelor's degree in physics. In addition, two of the Little Rock Nine attended Michigan State, including Ernest Green, the first black student to graduate from Little Rock Central High School, and Carlotta Walls LaNier.

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the shark kills {{a young boy}} named Alex Kintner and an old man {{not far from the}} shore. A local fisherman, Ben Gardner, is sent by Amity's {{authorities}} to kill the shark but disappears on the water. Brody and deputy Leonard Hendricks find Gardner's boat anchored off-shore, empty, and covered with large bite holes, one of which has a massive shark tooth stuck in it. Blaming himself for these deaths, Brody again tries to close the beaches, while Meadows investigates the Mayor's business contacts to determine why he wants to keep the beaches open. Meadows uncovers links to the Mafia, who pressure Vaughn to keep the beaches open {{in order to protect the}} value of Amity's real estate, in which the Mafia invested a great deal of money. Meadows also recruits marine biologist Matt Hooper from the <b>Woods</b> <b>Hole</b> Institute to advise them on how to deal with the shark.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} storm warning from Surf City to Cape Fear was discontinued at 05:00UTC on July4. A few hours later, {{the portion of}} the hurricane warning south of Bogue Inlet was removed. At 09:00UTC on July4, the {{tropical storm}} warning in Massachusetts was extended westward to <b>Woods</b> <b>Hole.</b> Around that time, areas west of Cape Lookout in North Carolina were no longer under a hurricane warning. In North Carolina, the hurricane warning was canceled for areas south of Ocracoke Inlet at 11:00UTC. All hurricane warnings in the state were discontinued four hours later, as was the tropical storm warning at Albemarle Sound; in addition, all tropical storm watches issued by Environment Canada were then converted to tropical storm warnings. By 18:00UTC on July4, the tropical storm warning on the east coast of Virginia, including the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, was discontinued. After passing by Nantucket and Cape Cod, the remaining tropical storm warnings in New England were rescinded.|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, {{inspired}} by a 1979 [...] "New Directions Workshop" [...] held at <b>Wood's</b> <b>Hole,</b> NASA conducted a joint summer study with ASEE entitled [...] to produce a detailed proposal for self-replicating factories to develop lunar resources without requiring additional launches or human workers on-site. The study was conducted at Santa Clara University and ran from June 23 to August 29, with the final report published in 1982. The proposed system would have been capable of exponentially increasing productive capacity and the design could be modified to build self-replicating probes to explore the galaxy.|$|R

She sortied with TF 65 on 5 July and 4 days later, began unloading waves of troops in the <b>Wood's</b> <b>Hole</b> sector, some 5.5 miles west of Socglitti, Sicily. At dawn of the 10th, her gunners fired at an enemy bomber which dropped bombs 200 to 300 yards astern, and kept up an antiaircraft barrage throughout the day, helping to splash three planes. With unloading completed and damaged landing craft salvaged, the ship got underway for Norfolk, Virginia on the 12th, arriving 4 August.|$|R
25|$|Metals are {{typically}} isotropic, and an ordinary twist drill bit shears {{the edges of}} the <b>hole</b> cleanly. <b>Wood</b> drilled across the grain has long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend {{to pull out of the}} <b>wood</b> <b>hole,</b> rather than being cleanly cut at the hole edge. The lip and spur drill bit has the outside corner of the cutting edges leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of the cutting edges plane off the base of the hole. By cutting the periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having them pull messily out of the timber.|$|R
50|$|Kim Cobb {{was born}} in 1974 in Virginia. She became {{interested}} in oceanography after attending a summer school at <b>Wood’s</b> <b>Hole</b> Oceanographic Institute, Massachusetts. She studied biology and geology at Yale University, where she became increasingly aware of the anthropogenic causes of climate change. She moved off her original pre-med track and applied for a summer program at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, graduating in 1996. Cobb completed her PhD in oceanography at the Scripps Institute in 2002, hunting El Niño events in a sediment core from Santa Barbara. She spent two years as a post doc at Caltech before joining Georgia Tech as an Assistant Professor in 2004. She has published over 100 peer-reviewed publications in major journals.|$|R
