5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance dropped {{heavy rainfall}} across eastern Indonesia, causing widespread flooding and mudslides. The {{worst of the}} damage was on Flores island, though damage was also reported on <b>West</b> <b>Timor</b> and Sumba. The flooding and mudslides damaged or destroyed thousands of houses, forcing many to leave their homes. A total of 58casualties were reported {{in association with the}} disturbance. In Australia, Inigo produced locally heavy rainfall, but little damage.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March, Cyclone Erica formed {{offshore}} Queensland {{and strengthened}} {{as it moved}} in a parabolic path, before leaving the Australian region on 12 March. Erica caused only minor damage in Queensland. Cyclone Craig originated offshore Northern Territory on 8 March. The system subsequently struck the territory and eventually made another landfall in Queensland on 12 March, after crossing the Gulf of Carpentaria. Impact from Craig was generally minor. Cyclone Inigo formed on 30 March and caused severe impact in Indonesia, especially in Flores, Sumba, and <b>West</b> <b>Timor.</b> Inigo later deepened into the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region, tied with Cyclone Gwenda in 1999. Inigo weakened significantly before striking Western Australia on 8 April and dissipating shortly thereafter. The final system, Tropical Cyclone Epi developed east of Papua New Guinea on 5 June and dissipated on the following day. Overall, the tropical cyclones of this season caused 60deaths and about $12million (2003USD) in damage.|$|E
60|$|In {{the islands}} <b>west</b> of <b>Timor,</b> {{as far as}} Flores and Sandalwood Island, a very similar race is found, which also extends eastward to Timor-laut, where the true Papuan race begins to appear. The small islands of Savu and Rotti, however, to the <b>west</b> of <b>Timor,</b> are very {{remarkable}} in possessing a different and, in some respects, peculiar race. These people are very handsome, with good features, resembling in many characteristics the race produced by the mixture of the Hindoo or Arab with the Malay. They are certainly distinct from the Timorese or Papuan races, and must be classed in the western rather than the eastern ethnological division of the Archipelago.|$|R

5|$|Under {{the overall}} command of Australian Major General Peter Cosgrove, INTERFET began {{arriving}} on 12 September 1999 and was tasked with restoring peace and security, protecting and supporting UNAMET, and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations. With {{the withdrawal of}} the Indonesian armed forces, police and government officials from East Timor, UNAMET re-established its headquarters in Dili on 28 September. On 19 October 1999, Indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a UN peacekeeping force, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) was established, becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence. The hand-over of command of military operations from INTERFET to UNTAET was completed on 28 February 2000. Australia continued to support the UN peacekeeping operation with between 1,500 and 2,000 personnel, as well as landing craft and Blackhawk helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission. During these operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro-Indonesian militia and {{on a number of occasions}} Indonesian forces as well, especially along the border with <b>West</b> <b>Timor.</b> Significant actions occurred in Suai, Mota'ain and at Aidabasalala in October 1999. However, with the security situation stabilised the bulk of the Australian and UN forces were withdrawn by 2005. Two Australians died from non-battle related causes, while a number were wounded in action.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, {{the island}} of Timor was divided into two territories under {{different}} colonial powers: Portuguese Timor and <b>West</b> <b>Timor</b> part of the Dutch East Indies. The Australian and Dutch governments agreed that, {{in the event of}} Japan entering World War II, Australia would provide forces to reinforce <b>West</b> <b>Timor.</b> Consequently, a 1,400-strong detachment, known as the Sparrow Force, and centred on the 2/40th Battalion, arrived at Kupang on 12 December 1941.|$|E
25|$|Australia contributed $1 {{million for}} the {{restoration}} and reconstruction of Borobudur in 1973.

5000|$|The Amarasi were a {{powerful}} princedom in the <b>west</b> section of <b>Timor</b> {{during the initial}} occupation of the Portuguese beginning in the 16th century. According to legend, {{a young man named}} Nafi Rasi, accidentally broke a family heirloom and left his home in East <b>Timor</b> to the <b>west,</b> out of fear of retaliation. He acquired guns from the Portuguese-Timoric Topasses, and used them to gain power and prestige, collecting a following from his home province of Belu, and forming a lasting dynasty. [...] By the mid 17th century, the Amarasi had been mostly converted to Catholicism by Dominican missionaries, an influence that has lasted to present day. A 2010 census found that 96.9% of the population in Timor is Catholic, and that 2.2% are Protestant. Because of their debt to the Portuguese for helping found their dynasty, Amarasi sided with them to help resist the Dutch East India Company's settlement in 1640. For over a hundred years the Amarasi fought against the Dutch in the Kupang area along the <b>west</b> coast of <b>Timor,</b> engaging in [...] "low-scale warfare" [...] and headhunting.|$|R
60|$|THE Moluccas {{consist of}} three large islands, Gilolo, Ceram, and Bouru, the two former being each {{about two hundred}} miles long; and {{a great number of}} smaller isles and islets, the most {{important}} of which are Batchian, Morty, Obi, Ke, Timor-Laut, and Amboyna; and among the smaller ones, Ternate, Tidore, Kaióa, and Banda. They occupy a space of ten degrees of latitude by eight of longitude, and they are connected by groups of small islets to New Guinea on the east, the Philippines on the north, Celebes on the <b>west,</b> and <b>Timor</b> on the south.

In that year, the Portuguese government had José Joaquim Lopes de Lima {{to sign a}} treaty with the Netherlands concluded that the <b>west</b> of <b>Timor,</b> Flores island and {{other areas of the}} Lesser Sunda Islands are ceded to them. This agreement was later confirmed by the Treaty of Lisbon in 1859. The Sika people are formed in addition to the Bidau and Moradores as one of the three people groups that make up the Portuguese Armed Forces in the colony. All three ethnic groups lived in separate districts of the capital. As for language they still retained their original Malay language, but later switched to a Creole Portuguese. Today they have been absorbed into the same population and do not form their own distinct group anymore.|$|R
50|$|The {{ancestor}} {{of the royal}} line {{is said to have}} come from Roti island, <b>west</b> of <b>Timor.</b> Amanuban is mentioned in Dutch sources as early as 1613, when the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC) first approached Timor. Amanuban had resources of sandalwood, which was the main Western interest on the island. The Dutch concluded a contract with the King of Amanuban in 1616, but the princedom came {{under the influence of the}} Portuguese, political and commercial rivals of the Dutch. This influence lasted up to 1748. During this period there was intermittent warfare with the VOC enclave around Kupang in westernmost Timor. A political crisis in 1748 turned a number of Atoni princedoms, including Amanuban, against the Topasses or Portuguese Eurasians on Timor. After the Topass defeat at the hand of the VOC in November 1749, the territory of Amanuban was included in the Dutch political alliance network.|$|R
40|$|The {{clay mineral}} {{distribution}} in sediments between Indonesia and NW Australia has been assessed {{on the basis}} of 166 core-top samples. Clay mineral assemblages are closely related to the geology and weathering regime of the adjacent hinterland and allow the distinction of four clay mineral provinces. Three provinces, Western, Central and Eastern Province are situated along the Indonesian Islands Arc, from Sumatra in the <b>west</b> to <b>Timor</b> in the east. Illite is the major clay mineral of the Western and eastern Province, whereas the Central Province abounds with smectite. The fourth province comprises the NW and West-Australian shelf and slope, as well as offshore plateaus and is dominated by kaolinite. Transport of clays by surface and subsurface ocean currents can be observed within the provinces, e. g. with the Leeuwin and West Australian Current in the NW Australian Province and with the outflow of low-salinity water through the Sunda and Lombok straits in the Central Province. Transport of clays across province boundaries is inhibited by strong salinity fronts, {{with the exception of the}} boundary between the Central and Eastern Province...|$|R

The Battalion Group based in Suai was responsible for securing the south west of the country from pro-Indonesian militia and Indonesian military (TNI) that included a long section of the border between East and Indonesian controlled <b>West</b> <b>Timor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Contacts {{with the}} militia {{continued}} throughout the deployment, however, {{as a result}} of the offensive carried out by 6 RAR, the battalion was able to maintain the tactical initiative and prevented the militia from achieving their stated aims of forcing the UN to withdraw from the country.

25|$|On 10 December, {{a second}} {{invasion}} {{resulted in the}} capture of the second biggest town, Baucau, and on Christmas Day, around 10,000 to 15,000 troops landed at Liquisa and Maubara. By April 1976 Indonesia had some 35,000 soldiers in East Timor, with another 10,000 standing by in Indonesian <b>West</b> <b>Timor.</b> A large proportion of these troops were from Indonesia's elite commands. By {{the end of the}} year, 10,000 troops occupied Dili and another 20,000 had been deployed throughout East Timor.

2500|$|Evidence of {{drainage}} ditches at Kuk Swamp on {{the borders of}} the Western and Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea shows evidence of the cultivation of taro {{and a variety of other}} crops, dating back to 11,000 BP. Two potentially significant economic species, taro (Colocasia esculenta) and yam (Dioscorea sp.), have been identified dating at least to 10,200 calibrated years before present (cal BP). Further evidence of bananas and sugarcane dates to 6,950 to 6,440 BP. This was at the altitudinal limits of these crops, and it has been suggested that cultivation in more favourable ranges in the lowlands may have been even earlier. CSIRO has found evidence that taro was introduced into the Solomon Islands for human use, from 28,000 years ago, making taro cultivation the earliest crop in the world. [...] It seems to have resulted in the spread of the Trans–New Guinea languages from New Guinea east into the Solomon Islands and <b>west</b> into <b>Timor</b> and adjacent areas of Indonesia. This seems to confirm the theories of Carl Sauer who, in [...] "Agricultural Origins and Dispersals", suggested as early as 1952 that this region was a centre of early agriculture.|$|R
50|$|In 1749 a {{political}} crisis involving Topass leader Gaspar da Costa resulted in another {{war with the}} Dutch. When he marched on Kupang with a considerable force he was routed and killed at the Battle of Penfui, after which the Dutch expanded their control of western Timor. Many Timorese princedoms which had hitherto been subordinated to Topass authority now fell away and allied with the VOC instead. The Topass still managed to hang on in Oecussi, and killed the Dutch commander Hans Albrecht von Plüskow in 1761, when he attempted to expand the Dutch sphere on Timor. Their power nevertheless receded by the late 18th century, due to diminishing economic and political opportunities. Still neither Portuguese nor Dutch colonial influence could be firmly established on Timor until the 19th century and only with continuous and heavy military force. The concept Topass disappears from the records in the 19th century. Between 1847-1913 the Portuguese had to mount more than 60 armed expeditions in order to subdue the Timorese {{in the interior of}} the island; a few of these revolts occurred in the old Topasses part, <b>west</b> of East <b>Timor.</b> Hornay and Da Costa descendants continued to govern locally as Rajas (or Liurais) of Oecussi up to modern times.|$|R
25|$|On {{the night}} of 28 March 1791, Martin, along with William Bryant, his wife Mary (née Broad) and their two {{children}} Charlotte and Emanuel, William Allen, Samuel Bird, Samuel Broom, James Cox, Nathaniel Lillie, and William Morton, stole the colony's six-oared open boat. In this vessel, the party navigated the eastern and northern coasts of Australia, survived several ferocious storms, encountered Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, and reached Kupang in Dutch <b>West</b> <b>Timor</b> on 5 June 1791, the entire party having survived. There, they successfully - for a while, at least - passed themselves off as the survivors of a shipwreck.|$|E
25|$|Later {{intelligence}} {{reported that}} the Indonesian military special forces unit Kopassus—who were alleged {{to be involved in}} co-ordinating the activities of the militia—after hearing the Black Hawk helicopter landing on the day of insertion, had formed the view a reconnaissance patrol had been inserted. There had been at least 60 armed militia with another 40 unarmed militia organised to search for the patrol. These were organised into three 20-man groups, divided into six man teams. Farrell states that intelligence from Falintil sources claimed that the militia involved had been part of a group that was trying to cross the border to Atambua in <b>West</b> <b>Timor</b> after previously being cut-off.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of 19/20 February, the Imperial Japanese Army's 228th Regimental Group, began landing in Portuguese Timor. The first contact was at Dili, the capital of Portuguese Timor, where the Allies were caught by surprise. Nevertheless, they were well-prepared and after inflicting heavy {{casualties}} on the troops attacking the airfield, the garrison destroyed the airfield and began an orderly retreat towards the mountainous interior and the south coast. On the same night, Allied forces in <b>West</b> <b>Timor</b> were under extremely intense air attacks, which had already caused the RAAF force to be withdrawn to Australia. Sparrow Force HQ was immediately moved further east, to its supply base at Champlong, and soon lost contact with the 2/40th.|$|E
6000|$|The Timorese of the {{interior}} are dusky brown or blackish, with bushy frizzled hair, and the long Papuan nose. They are of medium height, and rather slender figures. The universal dress is a long cloth twisted round the waist, the fringed ends of which hang below the knee. The people {{are said to be}} great thieves, and the tribes are always at war with each other, but they are not very courageous or bloodthirsty. The custom of [...] "tabu," [...] called here [...] "pomali," [...] is very general, fruit trees, houses, crop, and property of all kinds being protected from depredation by this ceremony, the reverence for which is very great. A palm branch stuck across an open door, showing that the house is tabooed, is a more effectual guard against robbery than any amount of locks and bars. The houses in Timor are different from those of most of the other islands; they seem all roof, the thatch overhanging the low walls and reaching the ground, except where it is cut away for an entrance. In some parts of the <b>west</b> end of <b>Timor,</b> and on the little island of Semau, the houses more resemble those of the Hottentots, being egg-shaped, very small, and with a door only about three feet high. These are built on the ground, while those of the eastern districts art, raised a few feet on posts. In their excitable disposition, loud voices, and fearless demeanour, the Timorese closely resemble the people of New Guinea.|$|R
25|$|Following {{the deaths}} of {{two members of the}} New Zealand Battalion Group in late June and early August 2000, combat {{tracking}} support was requested from the NZSAS. In August 2000, a Troop of about 12 NZSAS combat trackers were deployed with the task of locating militia who were crossing the border into East Timor. The Troops' efforts lead to the successful placing of a number of ambushes, resulting in {{the deaths of}} three militia. In addition to performing combat tracking, on 6 September 2000, this Troop was utilised to conduct a permissive cross-border helicopter extraction operation of United Nations staff based at Atambua, <b>West</b> <b>Timor.</b> The Troop departed East Timor for New Zealand in January 2001.|$|E
25|$|On Anzac Day 2000 6 RAR {{relieved}} 5/7 RAR at Balibo in East Timor, commencing {{a six-month}} {{tour of duty}} on the western border as part of Operation Taniger. Heavy rain in March had resulted in widespread flooding throughout the border region which had continued into May, however, by June the rivers had subsided and reports of incursions {{across the border from}} <b>West</b> <b>Timor</b> by pro-Indonesian militias were received, prompting 6 RAR to conduct extensive patrol operations throughout their tactical area of operations. Through a program of intensive active patrolling and tracking, surveillance, blocking and other security operations the battalion came to dominate the western border regions. However, during May and June {{there were a number of}} attacks on 6 RAR's positions.|$|E
25|$|Amid {{fears of}} a Japanese advance towards {{mainland}} Australia, the 2nd Independent Company was sent to Timor, as part of Sparrow Force, along with the 2/40th Battalion and a small force of artillery. Upon arriving at Dili on 17 December 1941, most of the 2nd Independent Company moved to protect Dili airfield in east Timor, whilst other elements took up positions in the nearby mountains. The Japanese invaded Timor on 20 February 1942, attacking both east and <b>west</b> <b>Timor</b> at the same time, quickly overwhelming the small force of Australian and Dutch defenders. Hopelessly outnumbered the 2nd Independent Company was unable to hold the airfield {{and was forced to}} retreat into the mountains, from where they would wage a guerrilla campaign against the Japanese for over a year.|$|E
25|$|On 21 October 1999, INTERFET {{launched}} a combined amphibious and airmobile operation into the Oecussi Enclave, {{which was the}} last part of the country to be secured. Following covert reconnaissance of militia activity in the previous weeks, a number of special forces teams from RESPFOR were inserted by Black Hawk helicopter around Port Makasa to secure the beachhead. Meanwhile, Australian Navy Clearance divers infiltrated the area aboard the Collins-class submarine , conducting a covert beach reconnaissance ahead of the amphibious landing. The following day mechanised infantry from the 5/7 RAR conducted a beach landing at first light. RESPFOR subsequently secured Ambeno. Reinforced by Gurkhas from 2 RGR, the force then swept through the area, capturing a number of militia while the remainder were believed to have fled to <b>West</b> <b>Timor.</b> In mid-November, 3 RAR took over responsibility for the Oecussi Enclave.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasion}} in early 1942 was swift and complete. By January 1942, parts of Sulawesi and Kalimantan were under Japanese control. By February, the Japanese had landed on Sumatra {{where they had}} encouraged the Acehnese to rebel against the Dutch. On 19 February, having already taken Ambon, the Japanese Eastern Task Force landed in Timor, dropping a special parachute unit into <b>West</b> <b>Timor</b> near Kupang, and landing in the Dili area of Portuguese Timor to drive out the Allied forces which had invaded in December. On 27 February, the Allied navy's last effort to contain Japan was swept aside by their defeat in the Battle of the Java Sea. From 28 February to 1 March 1942, Japanese troops landed on four places along the northern coast of Java almost undisturbed. The fiercest fighting had been in invasion points in Ambon, Timor, Kalimantan, and on the Java Sea. In places {{where there were no}} Dutch troops, such as Bali, there was no fighting. On 9 March, the Dutch commander surrendered along with Governor General Jonkheer A.W.L. Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer.|$|E
25|$|Later, the Australian Army {{looked to}} revive a {{parachute}} infantry capability, with D Company, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6 RAR) forming a trial airborne company in 1974. Meanwhile, the Army also took over responsibility for parachute training at this time, with Airborne Platoon being {{absorbed into the}} Parachute Training School (PTS). Yet the capability was not maintained {{and it was not}} until 1980 that airborne company was re-raised by 6 RAR. Moves then began to develop a parachute capable battalion, with the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) selected for this role in 1983. Based at Holsworthy Barracks in Sydney, 3 RAR subsequently formed the basis of the Parachute Battalion Group, which also included an engineer troop, signals detachment, artillery battery, and medical support, including a parachute surgical team. In 1997, a full-time commando unit was formed based on the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (later renamed to 2nd Commmando Regiment). In September 1999, 3 RAR deployed to East Timor as part of INTERFET, although not in the parachute role. The battalion helped secure Dili during {{the early stages of the}} operation, before conducting patrols along the <b>West</b> <b>Timor</b> border and later secured the Oecussi Enclave. The bulk of the battalion returned to Australia in December 1999.|$|E
500|$|The {{precursor}} {{tropical disturbance}} dropped heavy rainfall in eastern Indonesia; {{on the island}} of Flores, Larantuka recorded 223mm (8.78in) in a 24‑hour period. The rainfall caused flash flooding and mudslides, primarily in Flores but also on <b>West</b> <b>Timor</b> and Sumba. In some locations, the depth of the floodwaters reached 5meters (16ft). The Oessao River in <b>West</b> <b>Timor</b> exceeded its banks, which flooded seven villages. In Kupang in <b>West</b> <b>Timor,</b> the system destroyed hundreds of homes and large fields of corn, bean, and rice crop. Heavy damage was reported near Ende, where flooding and mudslides destroyed 20houses and destroyed the roads connecting to East Flores. In Ende, a total of 294animals were killed. [...] The city's [...] airport was flooded with one meter (3ft) of water, preventing aerial transportation and leaving the city temporarily isolated. In East Flores Regency in eastern Flores Island, the system left 75destroyed houses, along with 77 severely damaged and a further 56 receiving light damage. Damage in Indonesia totalled less than $6million (2003USD, $6.8million 2007USD), and 102injuries were reported.
