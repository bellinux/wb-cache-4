And I am not just speaking as a father here, though I am a pretty angry father.” ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a Muslim scholar about {{performing}} a specific action, the reply {{will be a}} fatwa explaining which of these five categories this action would fall under. So if you ask a Muslim scholar to give a fatwa about adultery, they <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> it is [...] "Not Permitted". If you ask about fasting in Ramadan, they would answer that it is [...] "Obligatory". Muslims are usually encouraged to ask for reasoning and evidence behind any fatwa, and should avoid blindly following the opinions of Muslim scholars without understanding the reasons behind them. This is because Muslims should always {{feel that they are}} practicing Islam to gain the pleasure of God, and not to gain the pleasure of acceptance of any human being.|$|E
2500|$|The two actual {{founders of}} the Bond party were a German man named Borckenhagen who lived in Bloemfontein, and an Afrikaner named Reitz, who {{afterwards}} became the state secretary of the Transvaal. There are two recorded interview that show the true aims of the {{founders of the}} Bond from the very beginning. One occurred between Borckenhagen and Cecil Rhodes, the other between Reitz and T. Schreiner, whose brother later became prime minister of Cape Colony. In the first interview, Borckenhagen remarked to Rhodes: [...] "We want a united Africa," [...] and Rhodes replied: [...] "So do I". Mr Borckenhagen then continued: [...] "There is nothing in the way; we will take you as our leader. There is only one small thing: we must, of course, be independent of the rest of the world." [...] Rhodes replied: [...] "You take me either for a rogue or a fool. I should be a rogue to forfeit all my history and my traditions; and I should be a fool, because I should be hated by my own countrymen and mistrusted by yours." [...] But as Rhodes said in Cape Town in 1898, [...] "the only chance of a true union is the overshadowing protection of a supreme power, and any German, Frenchman, or Russian <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the best and most liberal power is that over which Her Majesty reigns." ...|$|E

"Little to me, indeed, to whom all {{the world}} will soon be as nothing," [...] {{answered}} Sir Kenneth boldly; [...] "but were I now stretched on the rack, I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> what I have said is much to thine own conscience and thine own fame. I <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> Sir King, <b>that</b> if thou dost but in thought entertain the purpose of wedding thy kinswoman, the Lady Edith--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, not <b>that.</b> I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{anything}} <b>that</b> I could <b>tell,</b> because <b>you</b> {{have been}} so very, very good to me. But I cannot tell. I cannot explain even to myself. Oh, Lady Albury, why have you been so good to me?" ...|$|R
2500|$|On March 9, {{during a}} segment of Mad Money, Cramer admitted, [...] "OK, I'm a tempting target. Plenty of people come in and give their {{criticism}} on this show. But we're dealing with serious issues here; we need solutions, which I offer almost every night. I don't want ad hominem attacks. Take The New York Times columnist Frank Rich and Jon Stewart; I criticize Obama, so both of them seize on the urban legend that I recommended Bear Stearns the week before it collapsed, when I simply told an e-mailer that the deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe. 'Your money is safe in Bear Stearns,'" [...] Cramer repeated, referring to his own quote during a March 11, 2008 segment of Mad Money. Moreover, Cramer outlined, [...] "But through a clever sound bite, Stewart, and subsequently Rich—neither of whom have bothered {{to listen to the}} context of the pulled quote—pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the common stock might be worthless, but I would never tell you to pull your money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency. Your money is safe in Citi as I said it was in Bear. The fact that I was right rankles me even more." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "May I {{go and see}} her?" [...] said Dorothea, eagerly. [...] "Would she {{accept my}} sympathy? I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> her <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have not been blamable before any one's {{judgment}} but your own. I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> her <b>that</b> <b>you</b> shall be cleared in every fair mind. I would cheer her heart. Will you ask her if I may go to see her? I did see her once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{a cripple}} {{in the sense}} that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a {{powerful}} and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> Watson, <b>that</b> weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chimoltrufia's speech patterns: Chimoltrufia had a {{large number}} of {{nonsensical}} catchphrases, usually involving malapropisms, redundancies, or just plain weird speech.

6000|$|Just {{before they}} took their {{departure}} Lady Ushant came to Arabella saying that Mr. Morton wanted to speak one other word to her before she went.

5000|$|... "Our {{script was}} written {{a year and}} a half back. It is very unfortunate that something, which is about women athletes, has just started {{becoming}} about Negi. And if you would go and ask Negi, he <b>would</b> probably <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> he came and read the script that was written {{a year and a}} half back, and he started crying.

6000|$|... "No, Clara, I {{did not do}} that. I'll {{tell you}} what I did.

6000|$|... "The vicar knew. He {{was in our}} confidence. He <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> she was {{an angel}} upon earth. That was why he telegraphed to me and I returned.

6000|$|... "It ain't {{entirely on}} your account, lad, as I am {{thinking}} of going; and I am pretty sure the chief <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{it is the same}} with him. You see, he tried to persuade your uncle to turn back. My opinion is, that though he had to come here to keep the appointment, he had it in his mind to go back again to join your uncle.

6000|$|... "Softly, softly, {{my young}} master. You {{need to be}} told {{something}} that your eyes <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> and <b>that</b> is, that the poor lass is betrothed already to a son of old King Ranald the Ostman, of Waterford, son of old King Sigtryg, who ruled there when I was a boy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not mind}} in the least," [...] he said, [...] "and {{certainly}} I am young; but I can assure <b>you</b> <b>that</b> my former captain <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I was quiet, for I had {{the reputation of being}} the most troublesome middy on board his frigate. But, you see, responsibility has sobered me, and I can assure <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{there is a great deal}} of responsibility in commanding a small craft like this, which has nothing but her speed and her luck to rely on if she happens to fall in with a strongly-armed vessel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{can be a}} {{very hard}} master when I like,' said he smiling. 'You were there when I spoke to Admiral Bruix. We have all our duty to do, and {{discipline}} is as necessary in the highest as in the lowest ranks. But anger with me never rises above here,' and he drew his hand across his throat.

6000|$|... "At the priory, in fact, {{with his}} father's family. Yes, {{it is rather}} an unfortunate state of affairs," [...] he said, {{answering}} the captain's countenance rather than his words; [...] "but I have no responsibility. I merely assist in the Sunday duty; and, indeed, I advise you to have as {{little to do with}} the Uphill people as possible. An idle good-for-nothing set! Any magistrate <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there's no parish where they have so many up before them." ...|$|E
60|$|Do {{you know}} the {{engravings}} in the 'Story without an End'? The picture of the 'child' is just my Penini. Some one was observing it the other day, and I thought I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> you might image him to yourself. Think of his sobbing and screaming lately because of the Evangelist John being sent to Patmos. 'Just like poor Robinson Crusoe' said he. I scarcely knew whether to laugh or cry, I was so astonished at this crisis of emotion.|$|E
