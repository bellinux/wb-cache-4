We expanded the program to MT, TX, PA, MO, NJ, and NM. To accomplish this expansion, Galaxy Explorers has established partnerships with government agencies, businesses, and non-profit organizations. In addition, the effort is strongly supported by Congressional Members and staff.|$|E

5000|$|The {{foundation}} {{has long had}} an interest in helping to improve the delivery of health care in the U.S. In the 1970s, under the direction of CEO Bob Higgins, the foundation played a key role as a convenor of stakeholders to discuss cost containment in healthcare. [...] "We would go into a community and get key people together. In Des Moines we got together the Des Moines Register, a union, and some local businesspeople and <b>we</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>a</b> study {{about what was going on}} in healthcare. In Utah it was the Mormon Church sic, a key senator, and the governor who all came together. We would go into these communities and bring all these people together and get them to look at the healthcare situation. Only foundation money could bring these people together. Inevitably, these activities led to an initiative of some kind and, often, the creation of an HMO." ...|$|E
5000|$|We {{thought there}} was a lot we could do in Flanders. We also wanted to publish a paper aimed at the Flemish peoplein their own {{language}} and give them confidence as Flemish. <b>We</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>a</b> 10-year war with the French-speaking management of the national cycling federation in Brussels. And we won it. Race co-founder Karel Van Wijnendaele By the beginning of the 20th century, cycling was in a poor state in Belgium. Velodromes were closing and national championships on the road or track were no longer organised. The one major Belgian race, Liège-Bastogne-Liège, was in the French-speaking South. As the gloom increased, Odile Defraye became the first Belgian winner of the Tour de France in 1912. He was a 20-year old Fleming and, although he rode for Alcyon, a French team, he symbolized a potential rise for Belgian cycling. Defrayes victory inspired August De Maeght, mayor of Halle and director of the press group Société Belge dImprimerie, to publish a Dutch-language sports magazine called Sportwereld.|$|E
