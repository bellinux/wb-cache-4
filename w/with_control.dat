5|$|Ronnie Rocket was {{to feature}} {{many of the}} {{elements}} which have since come {{to be seen as}} Lynch's hallmarks; including industrial art direction, 1950s popular culture and physical deformity. The script featured a three-foot tall man <b>with</b> <b>control</b> over electricity; Lynch first met Michael J. Anderson when tentatively casting for this role, and later cast him in Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive as a result.|$|E

5|$|Almirante Latorres genesis can {{be traced}} to the {{numerous}} naval arms races between Chile and Argentina, which in turn were spawned by territorial disputes over their mutual borders in Patagonia and Puna de Atacama, along <b>with</b> <b>control</b> of the Beagle Channel. Naval races flared up in the 1890s and in 1902; the latter was eventually settled via British mediation. Provisions in the dispute-ending treaty imposed restrictions on both countries' navies. The United Kingdom's Royal Navy bought the two Constitución-class pre-dreadnought battleships that were being built for Chile, and Argentina sold its two Rivadavia-class armored cruisers under construction in Italy to Japan.|$|E
5|$|Another {{element is}} a {{powerful}} attack substitution that occasionally appears when a character's health is low. Similar features appear in later Final Fantasy titles {{under a variety of}} different names, including Limit Breaks, Desperation Moves, Trances, and Overdrives. Characters are rewarded for victorious battles with experience points and money, called gil (Gold Piece (GP) in the original North American localization). When characters attain a certain amount of experience points, they gain a level, which increases their statistics. An additional player may play during battle scenarios, <b>with</b> <b>control</b> of individual characters assigned from the configuration menu.|$|E
5|$|Control is {{the third}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Janet Jackson, released on February 4, 1986, by A Records. Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R. The album became Jackson's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, <b>with</b> <b>Control</b> {{becoming one of the}} foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music.|$|E

The ADGB was reorganised on 13 July 1936, <b>with</b> <b>control</b> of fighter aircraft passing to the newly established RAF Fighter Command, which moved to RAF Bentley Priory. The following day the remaining elements of ADGB became RAF Bomber Command, headquartered in Hillingdon House.|$|E
5|$|In 1088, Robert's {{plans for}} the {{invasion}} of England began to falter, {{and he turned to}} Henry, proposing that his brother lend him some of his inheritance, which Henry refused. Henry and Robert then came to an alternative arrangement, in which Robert would make Henry the count of western Normandy, in exchange for £3,000. Henry's lands were a new countship based around a delegation of the ducal authority in the Cotentin, but it extended across the Avranchin, <b>with</b> <b>control</b> over the bishoprics of both. This also gave Henry influence over two major Norman leaders, Hugh d'Avranches and Richard de Redvers, and the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel, whose lands spread out further across the Duchy. Robert's invasion force failed to leave Normandy, leaving William Rufus secure in England.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the fall}} of the Republic, the {{authority}} of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi-monarchical system of government established by Augustus, known as the Principate. The Principate allowed the existence of a de facto dictatorial regime, while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic. Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy, and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor's status as a de facto monarch. The civil war of 69 had made it abundantly clear that real power in the Empire lay <b>with</b> <b>control</b> over the army. By the time Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in Rome, any hope of restoring the Republic had long dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the treaty}} signed at the {{conclusion}} of the war, Hierapytna agreed to break off all relations and alliances with foreign powers and to place all its harbors and bases at Rhodes' disposal. Olous, among the ruins of which the terms of the treaty have been found, had to accept Rhodian domination. As a result, Rhodes was left <b>with</b> <b>control</b> of a significant part of eastern Crete after the war. The conclusion of the war left the Rhodians free to help their allies in the Second Macedonian War.|$|E

Notable player departures included Mike Mussina—who announced his retirement on November 20, 2008—as well as Bobby Abreu, Jason Giambi, and Carl Pavano, who all left as free agents. Notable free agent acquisitions included starting pitchers CC Sabathia and A. J. Burnett, and first baseman Mark Teixeira. Another major addition was outfielder Nick Swisher, acquired in a trade with the Chicago White Sox.|$|E

5|$|After {{the player}} defeats the Elite Four {{and enters the}} Champion's chamber, he or she finds that N has {{defeated}} Alder and become the newest Pokémon Champion. Soon after, he summons a large castle that surrounds the Pokémon League, challenging the player to find him {{to take part in}} one final battle. When the player finally reaches him, Reshiram in Black or Zekrom in White appears before the player, and the player must capture the legendary Pokémon before challenging N. After his defeat, N laments the possibility that his ideals are mistaken, Ghetsis intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use N to ensure that he would be the only human left <b>with</b> <b>control</b> over Pokémon and use them to rule the world. In his rage, Ghetsis challenges the player to battle. After Ghetsis's defeat, he is arrested, allowing Alder to resume his position as the Pokémon Champion of the Unova region. N then thanks the player for helping realize his mistake {{about the nature of the}} relationship between people and their Pokémon before leaving the castle on his captured Pokémon to a far-off land.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Indian {{independence}} in 1947, India was divided into two sets of territories, one under direct British rule, and the other under the suzerainty of the British Crown, <b>with</b> <b>control</b> over their internal affairs remaining {{in the hands of}} their hereditary rulers. In addition, there were several colonial enclaves controlled by France and Portugal. The political integration of these territories into India was a declared objective of the Indian National Congress, and the Government of India pursued this over the next decade. Through a combination of factors, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon convinced the rulers of the various princely states to accede to India. Having secured their accession, they then proceeded, in a step-by-step process, to secure and extend the central government's authority over these states and transform their administrations until, by 1956, there was little difference between the territories that had been part of British India and those that had been part of princely states. Simultaneously, the Government of India, through a combination of diplomatic and military means, acquired de facto and de jure control over the remaining colonial enclaves, which too were integrated into India.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth I {{gave the}} chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, {{creating}} a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons <b>with</b> <b>control</b> over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended {{with the onset of}} the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Sir Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailer, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair. The bishop went into retirement and some of the clerics were reduced to performing menial tasks.|$|E

Well-controlled clinical trials conducted from 1993 to 2014 showed SAL, combined <b>with</b> <b>controlled</b> compression therapy (CCT), {{to be an}} effective lymphedema treatment without recurrence. Long-term followup (11–13 years) of patients with lymphedema showed no recurrence of swelling. Lymphatic liposuction combined <b>with</b> <b>controlled</b> compression therapy was more effective than controlled compression therapy alone.|$|R
40|$|The {{levels of}} total antioxidants, vitamin E and certain trace metals (Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Cr, Cd, Pb and Se) were {{determined}} in Nigerians who were occupationally exposed to chemicals {{for a period}} ranging from 16 to 20 years using colorimetric method and atomic absorption spectrophotometer respectively. In the automobile mechanics, the levels of chromium, cadmium and lead were significantly higher when compared <b>with</b> <b>controls.</b> In the motor painters, chromium and cadmium were significantly higher when compared <b>with</b> <b>controls.</b> Levels of manganese, copper, cadmium, lead and total antioxidants were significantly higher in panel beaters compared <b>with</b> <b>controls.</b> In the battery chargers, only total antioxidants were significantly higher compared <b>with</b> <b>controls.</b> The study shows that metal toxicity is imminent in panel beaters, automobile mechanics and motor painters and that the metals involved vary with occupations.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} whether traffic policemen exposed to urban pollutants and psycho-social stressors may be at risk of modifications in serum levels of immunoglobulins G antibodies (IgG Ab) against Herpes Simplex Virus (type 1) (HSV- 1) compared <b>with</b> <b>controls.</b> Traffic policemen were matched by sex, age, working life and drinking habits (less than two glasses of wine or beer per day) <b>with</b> <b>controls,</b> after excluding the subjects with the principal confounding factors (smoking habit, use of paints, solvents, pesticides and drinking habits). Were included in the study 125 traffic policemen (54 men and 71 women) with outdoor activity and 125 controls (54 men and 71 women) with indoor activity. Mean levels of IgG Ab against HSV- 1 were significantly higher in traffic policemen of both sexes compared <b>with</b> <b>controls.</b> The frequency of workers with IgG Ab against HSV- 1 levels higher than our normal laboratory values, was significant in traffic policemen compared <b>with</b> <b>controls</b> of both sexes. The distributions of IgG Ab against HSV- 1 levels in traffic policemen compared <b>with</b> <b>controls</b> of both sexes were significant. The authors hypothesise an effect of the working activity in traffic policemen on serum levels of IgG Ab against HSV- 1 compared to controls...|$|R
5|$|In 1344, the regency {{concluded}} a further alliance with Bulgaria, which required {{the surrender of}} Philippopolis (Plovdiv) and nine other towns in northern Thrace along the river Evros. Nevertheless, after their occupation, Ivan Alexander refrained from direct action against Kantakouzenos' forces operating in southern and eastern Thrace. At the same time, Momchil, a former brigand whom Kantakouzenos had entrusted <b>with</b> <b>control</b> over the region of Merope in the Rhodope mountains, switched over to the regency. In early 1344, Kantakouzenos was deprived of Umur and {{the bulk of his}} army, who had sailed home to repel a Latin attack on his main harbour, Smyrna. On their way, the Turkish force was attacked by the Serbs under Gregory Preljub, but prevailed at the Battle of Stephaniana. Nevertheless, Kantakouzenos was able to ward off joint attacks by Dušan and Apokaukos until Umur returned to his aid the next spring at the head of an army of 20,000men.|$|E
5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, <b>with</b> <b>control</b> over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E
5|$|Texas got {{the ball}} at their 20 to start the second half. On the first play from scrimmage, Jamaal Charles rushed for threeyards. On second down, Vince Young's pass was intercepted by Nate Salley at the UT37. Two rushes by Antonio Pittman {{resulted}} in a first down at the UT 30. After a short gain on first down and an incomplete pass on second down, Troy Smith recovered his own fumble on third down {{to set up a}} successful 44-yard field goal by Huston. Texas used six plays, including a 63-yard pass to Billy Pittman before being stopped at the Ohio State eightyard-line. David Pino made the 25-yard field goal. On the ensuing kick-off by Richmond McGee, OSU's Ted Ginn, Jr. took the ball at the oneyard-line and ran it out to almost mid-field. The drive ended with a successful 26-yard field goal by Huston. The following three possessions (two for Texas and one for Ohio State) resulted in punts. The third quarter expired with Ohio State leading 22 to 16 and <b>with</b> <b>control</b> of the ball near mid-field.|$|E
