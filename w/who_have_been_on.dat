5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without {{any interest in}} the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, {{in the opinion of}} Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the cast of Flashpoint are Canadians, including Enrico Colantoni, David Paetkau, Hugh Dillon, Sergio Di Zio, Michael Cram, Mark Taylor and Ruth Marshall. Amy Jo Johnson is the only American. Johnson said she had no problems with the physical demands of the show despite being pregnant with her first child with her fiancé Oliver Giner during initial production of Flashpoint. Ruth Marshall left the series after Season 1 and Mark Taylor left after the tenth episode of Season 2 (a.k.a. episode 210) after his character, Lou, died. During Amy Jo Johnson's maternity leave (during which her character was hospitalized with a gunshot wound), she was temporarily replaced by Jessica Steen, who played Donna Sabine. Steen left the main cast in the sixth episode of Season 2, Part 1 (a.k.a. episode 206), when Johnson's character returned full-time, although she has appeared in some later episodes. Taylor was replaced by Olunike Adeliyi, who portrays Leah Kerns as of the second episode of Season 2, Part 2 (a.k.a. episode 212). In season 4, episode 5 (a.k.a. episode 405), Michael Cram, known as [...] "Wordy," [...] left the show when his character was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. Cram was replaced by Clé Bennett, portraying Rafik Rousseau. This character left by the first episode of Season 5. Two episodes later, Adeliyi's character returned to Team One.

60|$|But {{perhaps there}} is a corner for you somewhere along the {{batteries}} on the gun-deck, where you may enjoy a snug nap. But as no one is allowed to recline on the larboard side of the gun-deck (which is reserved as a corridor for the officers when they go forward to their smoking-room at the bridle-port), the starboard side only is left to the seaman. But most of this side, also, is occupied by the carpenters, sail-makers, barbers, and coopers. In short, so few are the corners where you can snatch a nap during daytime in a frigate, that not one in ten of the watch, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> deck eight hours, can get a wink of sleep till the following night.

If, when we get there, we find the place empty, we must come to a decision as to what our best course will be. In that case I think we ought to climb the hills and make our way up the mountains as rapidly as possible. We could calculate on eight or ten hours' start, and by keeping as much as possible on the rocks, might hope to get so high among the mountains {{that they would not be}} able to follow our traces and overtake us before we reach a point where they would not dare follow us. In that case, of course we should have to give up all hope of finding the gold valley, and lose the mules with all our belongings, which would cripple us terribly." ...|$|E
