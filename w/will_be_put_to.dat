Modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be Aristotle's own (unpolished) lecture notes (or in some cases possible notes by his students). However, one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation.

They have their own traditions to give us, formed in the society's work of teaching since 1802, and the fruit of the experience gathered, to speak only of Australia and New Zealand, of over 500 Brothers teaching more than 20,000 boys". Liston added, [...] " ... if I know the Brothers at all, the boys under their care <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> hard work - an excellent thing - and teachers will not do for them what they should do for themselves.

2500|$|Rabbi Eleazar {{interpreted}} the words [...] "He withdraws not {{his eyes from}} the righteous" [...] in [...] to teach that God rewards righteousness, even generations later. The Gemara taught that in reward for Rachel's modesty as shown in her dealings with Jacob, God rewarded her with King Saul as a descendant. The Gemara taught that Jacob asked Rachel, [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] She replied, [...] "Yes, but my father is a trickster, and he will outwit you." [...] Jacob replied, [...] "I am his brother in trickery." [...] She said to him, [...] "Is it permitted to the righteous to indulge in trickery?" [...] He replied, [...] "Yes, with the pure you show yourself pure, and with the crooked you show yourself subtle." [...] He asked her, [...] "What is his trickery?" [...] She replied: [...] "I have a sister older than I am, and he will not let me marry before her." [...] So Jacob gave her certain tokens through which he could identify her. When night came, she said to herself, [...] "Now my sister <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> shame," [...] so she gave Leah the tokens. Thus when [...] reports, [...] "And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah," [...] we are not to infer that up until then she had not been Leah, but rather that on account of the tokens that Rachel had given Leah, Jacob did not know until then that it was Leah. Therefore, God rewarded Rachel with having Saul among her descendants..|$|E
