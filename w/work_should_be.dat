He disputed the idea that missionary <b>work</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> focused on the non-Islamicised eastern portion of the colony. He believed instead that missionary <b>work</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> prioritsed in the western portion, where Islam had already become entrenched.|$|E

5|$|Like Lovinescu, other {{advocates of}} modernist {{literature}} rejected most of Cerna's contributions. One {{of the first}} to have done so is Ovid Densusianu, who stated his belief that an artist's <b>work</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> separated from his life. Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu had a tendency to reject all poets who registered popular success, and that he treated Dimitrie Anghel's work in much the same way.|$|E

5|$|That Autumn the {{government}} conducted a formal inquiry into military aviation. Capper {{had to return}} early from Blair Atholl in order to present his evidence. He argued strongly for a promising future {{of all forms of}} aeronautics and especially the aeroplane. However his Army superiors on the committee were against aeronautics in any form. It was decided that only small-scale airship experiments should continue and that aeroplane <b>work</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> stopped. It formally ceased when Dunne and Cody's contracts ran {{out at the end of}} March 1909.|$|E
5|$|Following the report, the NRM {{commissioned}} First Class Partnerships (FCP) to independently {{review the}} remaining work identified as necessary by the NRM, and make recommendations {{on how to}} proceed. In March 2013, the museum announced FCP had determined the locomotive would {{not return to the}} main line until 2015, and believed the outstanding <b>work</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> put out to external tender. On 29 October 2013 the museum announced Riley & Son in Bury as the winning contractor, and the same day the locomotive was moved to their workshop in order to return it to running condition no earlier than summer 2015. On 29 April 2015, Flying Scotsmans boiler left the National Railway Museum to be reunited {{with the rest of the}} locomotive at Riley & Son in Bury.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Household Management {{has been}} edited, revised and {{enlarged}} several times since Isabella's death {{and is still}} in print as at 2016. Food writers have stated that the subsequent editions of the work were far removed from and inferior to the original version. Several cookery writers, including Elizabeth David and Clarissa Dickson Wright, have criticised Isabella's work, particularly her use of other people's recipes. Others, such as the food writer Bee Wilson, consider the censure overstated, and that Beeton and her <b>work</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> thought extraordinary and admirable. Her name has become associated with knowledge and authority on Victorian cooking and home management, and the Oxford English Dictionary states that by 1891 the term Mrs Beeton had become used as a generic name for a domestic authority. She is also considered a strong influence in the building or shaping of a middle-class identity of the Victorian era.|$|E

5|$|The {{search for}} a singer-actress to play Carmen began {{in the summer of}} 1873. Press {{speculation}} favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the <b>work</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.|$|E

25|$|The {{series was}} {{conceived}} as a web series on Adult Swim's defunct comedy website, Super Deluxe, in 2008. Neely, who had produced Baby Cakes and The Professor Brothers shorts for Super Deluxe in 2006, envisioned the characters in each series to coexist in the same universe. With this relationship in mind, he produced a four-part online series entitled China, IL, hand-drawn by him in his apartment in Austin, Texas. The series was published onto Super Deluxe in 2008. Intended for online consumption, he considered the web series independent from China, IL, due to the differences in format and structure that he stated he feels his <b>work</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> dictated by.|$|E
