5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content knowledge and skills to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E

2500|$|Nick Gibb, England's Schools {{minister}} says: [...] "We {{want all}} schools {{to consider the}} needs of their pupils to determine how technology can complement the foundations of good teaching and a rigorous curriculum, so that every pupil is able to achieve their potential." [...] Tom Bennett, the UK government's expert on pupil behaviour, said teachers had been [...] "dazzled" [...] by school computers. Andreas Schleicher, education director at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, urged schools to ensure that children gain a good grasp of reading, writing and mathematics, opining that school technology had raised [...] "too many false hopes (...) If you look at the best-performing education systems, such as those in East Asia, they've been very cautious about using technology in their classrooms," [...] (...) Those students who use tablets and computers very often tend to do worse than those who use them moderately.". In September 2015, a survey conducted by the OECD into the impact of heavy investments in digital technology <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> showed that Pisa test results for reading, mathematics or science showed [...] "no noticeable improvement". In October 2015, a study by researchers at the University of Washington, Stanford University and the Mathematica policy research group discovered that on-line pupils fell far behind counterparts who studied <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> The National Study of Online Charter Schools found [...] "significantly weaker academic performance" [...] in maths and reading in 'virtual schools' when compared with the conventional school system.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges school psychologists face with systemic approaches is cooperation between schools and families. [...] This is sometimes hard to achieve simply due to conflicting schedules, cultural differences, and lack of trust between schools and families. [...] Leaders in the field of school psychology recognize the practical challenges that school psychologists face when striving for systems-level change and have highlighted a more manageable domain within a systems-level approach – the classroom [...] [...] School psychologists offer many services to teachers and students on a classroom level. [...] For example, school psychologists help develop classroom behavior modification plans and alternative teaching strategies. [...] School psychologists are often consultants to teachers <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> level of systemic school psychological services.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his ideas regarding what education is and what effect it should have on society, Dewey also had specific notions regarding how education should take place <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> In The Child and the Curriculum (1902), Dewey discusses two major conflicting schools of thought regarding educational pedagogy. The first is centered on the curriculum and focuses almost solely on the subject matter to be taught. Dewey argues that the major flaw in this methodology is the inactivity of the student; within this particular framework, [...] "the child is simply the immature being who is to be matured; he is the superficial being who is to be deepened" [...] (1902, p.13). He argues {{that in order for}} education to be most effective, content must be presented in a way that allows the student to relate the information to prior experiences, thus deepening the connection with this new knowledge.|$|E

40|$|The {{findings}} of the three experiments reported herein indicate that normal children can successfully teach social responses (i. e., delayed imitation cooperative play, and verbalization of positive comments) to withdrawn mentally retarded peers. The effects of the intervention generalized across stimulus and response conditions, while the trained and generalized levels of responding were maintained {{after the end of}} the intervention. Moreover, the subjects developed social responding within their classrooms and play areas parallel to the intervention and continued to increase such responding after the interruption of the intervention. Direct edible reinforcement appeared to be necessary at least during the initial period of the intervention. Vicarious edible reinforcement seemed useful to prompt the appearance of responding. Vicarious social reinforcement was ineffective at the beginning of the intervention, but apparently acquired prompting power at a later stage of training. Generalization results indicated that the similarity between the response occasions used for training and those used for testing generalization played an important role. Yet, the extensiveness of training and the development of responding <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> and play areas may also have had a relevant effect. The development of social responding <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> and play areas appeared to be mainly the effect of new learning. This was perhaps due to vicarious and direct social reinforcement...|$|R

2500|$|World War I {{affected}} {{children in}} the United States through several social and economic changes {{in the school curriculum}} and through shifts in parental relationships. For example, a number of fathers and brothers entered the war, and many were subsequently maimed in action or killed, causing many children to be brought up by single mothers. Additionally, as the male workforce left for battle, mothers and sisters began working in factories to take their positions, and the family dynamic began to change; this affected children as they had less time to spend with family members and were expected to grow up faster and help with the war effort. [...] Similarly, Woodrow Wilson called on children involved in youth organizations to help collect money for war bonds and stamps in order {{to raise money for the}} war effort. This was very important because the children were having a direct effect on the financial state of the United States government during World War I. [...] As children were collecting large amounts of money outside of school, <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> curriculum also began to change as a result of the war. [...] Woodrow Wilson again became involved with these children as he implemented government pamphlets and programs to encourage war support through things like mandatory patriotism and nationalism classes multiple times a week. Even though war was not being fought on United States soil, children's lives were greatly affected as all of these changes were made to their daily lives as a result of the conflict.|$|E
