60|$|Thus, {{in turning}} over some {{excellent}} books recently {{written on the}} spirit of Indian or Chinese art and decoration, I found it quietly and curiously assumed that the artist must be at his best if he flows with the full stream of Nature; and identifies himself with all things; so that the stars are his sleepless eyes and the forests his far-flung arms. Now in this way of talking both the two injustices will be found. In so far as <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>is</b> {{a strong sense of}} the divine in all things, the Eastern artists have no more monopoly of it than they have of hunger and thirst.|$|E
50|$|Al-Warraq {{challenged}} {{the notion of}} revealed religion. He argued that if humans are capable of figuring out that, for instance, {{it is good to}} be forgiving, then a prophet is unnecessary, and that we should not heed the claims of self-appointed prophets, if <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>is</b> found to be contrary to good sense and reason. Al-Warraq admired the intellect not for its capacity to submit to a god, but rather for its inquisitiveness towards the wonders of science. He explained that people developed the science of astronomy by gazing at the sky, and that no prophet was necessary to show them how to gaze; he also said that no prophets were needed to show them how to make flutes, either, or how to play them.|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{views of}} {{causation}} are cause-effect views. Among other things, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>is</b> {{that when a}} causal report is true, a cause and an effect exist. Similarly with theories of causal beliefs, such as Gärdenfors's (1988) view that - {{by looking at the}} contraction with respect to the cause of the given epistemic state - we can apply the simple criterion that the occurrence of C raises the probability of the occurrence of E. The cause and the effect has been at centre in much theorising about causation and causal beliefs...|$|E

40|$|Se estudia y analiza el acabado {{superficial}} de aceros nacionales mecanizados con herramientas de metal duro insertos (TNMG); cuando actúan las variables: profundidad, avance, velocidad de corte, tipo de herramienta y material de la pieza, utilizando un Diseño Factorial Fraccionado (DFF) 2 (7 - 4), que disminuye significativamente el esfuerzo, tiempo y costo de la experimentación al realizar el análisis multifactorial. Como resultado se tiene el avance como único factor de manera individual, éste no será analizado por su poco efecto en el significativo sobre el acabado, ya que el análisis se utiliza siguiendo la metodología para el caso de diagramas de dos vías con interacción o combinación de variables como: profundidad a 0, 5 mm., y velocidad de corte a 266, 41 m/min., que resultan ser la situación más favorable al lograr un valor promedio de rugosidad de 3. 51 &# 956;m; mientras que la menos favorable, se logra con la misma velocidad pero a mayor profundidad 1, 5 mm. Se comprueba experimentalmente que al aumentar la profundidad de corte empeora el acabado, situaci&# 963;n esta, muy similar a la que sucede con el desgaste del flanco de herramienta, sin embargo, el hecho de no conseguir los factores operacionales totales para mejorar el acabado no afectan ya que lo que se pretende es determinar las tendencias para la búsqueda de la optimización. The finished superficial one is {{studied and}} analyzes in national steels of the mechanized one by tools of hard metal (cermets) (TNMG); when they actuate the variables: depth, advance {{and speed of}} cut, type of tool and material of the piece, using the experimental design, applying a Fractional Factorial Design (DFF) 2 7 - 4, which diminishes significantly the effort, time and cost of the experimentation on having realized the analysis multifactorial. Since result takes the advance as an only one factor of an individual way, this one will not be analyzed by his little effect in the significant one on the finished one, since the analysis is in use following the methodology for the case of graphs of two routes with interaction or combination of variables as: depth to 0. 5 mm. And speed of cut to 266. 41 m/min, they {{turn out to be}} the most favorable situation on having achieved a value I mediate of 3. 51 &# 956;m; whereas the least favorable, is achieved by the same speed but to major depth 1, 5 mm. There is verified experimentally that on having increased the depth of cut it worsens the finished one, this situation, very similar to the one that happens with the wear of the flank of tool, nevertheless, the fact of not obtaining the operational total factors to improve the finished one they do not concern since <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>is</b> to determine the trends for the search of the optimization...|$|E
