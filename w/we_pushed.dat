McCulloch said, [...] "What they said is, 'We'll {{keep you on}} if you don't take {{as much money as}} in the contract,' and we had no {{intention}} of staying anyway, so it was kind of 'were <b>we</b> <b>pushed</b> or did we fall?'" [...] There was also a change in the band's management with Toogood departing to start his own record label. With the session musicians who recorded What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? moving on, McCulloch and Sergeant recruited a new band, with whom they would go on to record the 2000 EP, Avalanche, which was only available to buy over the internet.|$|E

[...] could outturn a P-38, a fact that some pilots didn't realize when they made the {{transition}} between the two aircraft. [...] The real problem with it was lack of range. As <b>we</b> <b>pushed</b> the Japanese back, P-40 pilots were slowly {{left out of the}} war. So when I moved to P-38s, an excellent aircraft, I did not [...] that the P-40 was an inferior fighter, but because I knew the P-38 would allow us to reach the enemy. I was a fighter pilot and that was what I was supposed to do." [...] The 8th, 15th, 18th, 24th, 49th, 343rd and 347th PGs/FGs, flew P-40s in the Pacific theaters between 1941 and 1945, with most units converting to P-38s from 1943–44. In 1945, the 71st Reconnaissance Group employed them as armed forward air controllers during ground operations in the Philippines, until it received delivery of P-51s. They claimed 655 aerial victories.|$|E
