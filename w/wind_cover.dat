40|$|Abstract: As an {{important}} part of hydroelectric power station,wind cover is under a high temperature stress in the process of running the station,and the structure may be in danger. This paper analyze a hydropower turbine wind cover’s temperature stress in two different conditions with large general-purpose finite element analysis software ANSYS. Study shows that in the worst case of load combination,Wind cover appears higher tensile stress values. In order to ensure the structural safety, the measures of arranging ring bar and vertical bar on the outer wall of the <b>wind</b> <b>cover</b> are suggested...|$|E
