5|$|German {{classical}} archaeologist Roland Hampe (1908–1981) {{disagreed with}} Picard's hypothesis, {{saying that the}} size of the stele should demonstrate that both women <b>were</b> <b>standing,</b> not sitting.|$|E
5|$|And then it grew dark {{again with}} a squall, this time even {{stronger}} and worse than before. And {{right at the beginning}} of the squall Hávard the Hewing saw that two women <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> on the earl's ship, and both were doing the same thing that Thorgerd had done before.|$|E
5|$|The {{notes were}} handed to two {{horsemen}} who <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> by. The Manchester and Salford Yeomanry were stationed {{just a short}} distance away in Portland Street, and so received their note first. They immediately drew their swords and galloped towards St Peter's Field. One trooper, in a frantic attempt to catch up, knocked down a woman in Cooper Street, causing the death of her son when he was thrown from her arms; two-year-old William Fildes was the first casualty of Peterloo.|$|E
50|$|In Wales, 213 {{candidates}} <b>are</b> <b>standing,</b> {{a reduction}} from the 275 {{who stood in}} 2015.

5|$|When Carpathia {{arrived at}} Pier54 in New York {{on the evening}} of 18April after a {{difficult}} voyage through pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas, some 40,000people <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> on the wharves, alerted to the disaster by a stream of radio messages from Carpathia and other ships. It was only after Carpathia docked– three days after Titanics sinking– that the full scope of the disaster became public knowledge.|$|E
5|$|About half-past {{one o'clock}} on the morning, an {{explosion}} {{took place in}} Felling colliery, by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into eternity, several others severely burnt, and all the underground horses but one destroyed. The accident occurred {{at the time of}} calling course, or when one set of men were relieving another. Several of the morning shift men <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> round the mouth of the pit, waiting to go down, when the blast occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.|$|E
5|$|After the {{foremost}} Turkish troops crossed the fortifications {{and dealt with}} the Bulgarian defenders, they began plundering the vicinity. However, {{to the surprise of}} Kantakouzenos and Umur Bey, the majority of Momchil's men <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> in front of the city walls and had not yet participated in the skirmishes. As the Byzantine–Turkish force advanced towards the defenders, Momchil led his troops ahead into battle. His cavalry was promptly eliminated by Turkish sharpshooters and his remaining troops were surrounded on three sides by heavily armed horsemen. Momchil's remaining men continued the fight on foot {{and for the most part}} did not surrender until Momchil himself perished.|$|E

5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{at the opposite end of}} the track waving towels.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the 1990 Taylor Report, {{in the wake of the}} Hillsborough disaster, top-flight English football grounds had to become all-seated. At the time three of the four sides of the ground had standing areas. The Enclosure, fronting the main stand, had already been made all-seated in time for the 1987–88 season and was given the new name of Family Enclosure. The Paddock, the Park End terrace and the Gwladys Street terrace, known as 'the Ground', <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> and had to be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen briefly {{appeared}} on the World Wrestling Federation program {{in the summer of}} 1994 on WWF Monday Night Raw; capitalizing on Frank Drebin. Nielsen (and George Kennedy) were hired as sleuths to unravel the mystery of The Undertaker who had disappeared at January's Royal Rumble event. At SummerSlam 1994, in a Naked Gun parody, they were hot on the case (in fact, they <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> on a case). Although they did not find The Undertaker, the case had been closed (the literal case had been shut) and thus, they solved the mystery. In 1990, Nielsen appeared as a Frank Drebin character in advertisements in the United Kingdom for Red Rock Cider.|$|E

5|$|Nine {{people and}} al-Balawi {{were killed by}} the blast. Seven were CIA personnel: five officers, {{including}} the chief of the base, and two contractors. One was a Jordanian intelligence officer and another was the Afghan driver. Six other CIA personnel were seriously wounded in the attack, including the deputy chief of Kabul station. Some of those killed had already approached the bomber to search him, whereas others killed <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> some distance away. At least 13 intelligence officers were within 50 feet of al-Balawi when the bomb went off.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the very}} few {{confirmed}} attacks on humans by wild killer whales, none have been fatal. In one instance, killer whales tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition <b>were</b> <b>standing.</b> The sled dogs' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the killer whale's hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey. Unlike wild killer whales, captive killer whales are reported to have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, {{some of which have}} been fatal.|$|E
5|$|Only 403 (45 percent) of {{the total}} number of sorties flown by Fighter Command were {{directed}} at the three major German raids. A further 56 (or just over 6 per cent) <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> patrols to protect shipping off the coast. Most of the remaining 427 sorties (nearly 50 per cent) were made to engage the reconnaissance aircraft. Usually several half-squadrons were committed. This was not excessive. But by sending more units to counter the flights, German aircraft were forced to fly higher and were denied the opportunity to drop to low altitude to take higher resolution photographs. This contributed to a lack of German intelligence which often failed to distinguish fighter, bomber and naval airfields from each other. Much of the time their strength was directed at non-fighter airfields on this date.|$|E

5|$|Several Gibraltar Police officers, {{including}} Special Branch officers, gave {{evidence about}} {{the aftermath of the}} shootings and the subsequent police investigation. Immediately after the shootings, the soldiers' shell casings were removed from the scene (making it difficult to assess where the soldiers <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> when they fired); two Gibraltar Police officers testified to collecting the casings, one for fear that they might be stolen and the other on the orders of a superior. Statements from other police and military witnesses revealed that the Gibraltar Police had lost evidence and that the soldiers did not give statements to the police until over a week after the shootings.|$|E
5|$|When Newark, New Jersey, {{hosted the}} 21st National Sängerfest, held on 1–4 July 1906 in Olympic Park, 25,000 {{people showed up}} to hear the music, many {{arriving}} on chartered trains. Only a few thousand {{were able to get}} into the hall, and 2,000 <b>were</b> <b>standing.</b> Five thousand singers from more than a hundred sängerbunds representing forty cities from New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware competed for a $20,000 prize offered by Kaiser Wilhelm II. Park vendors offered souvenirs, refreshments, games, and a carousel.|$|E
5|$|After {{fifteen minutes}} of combat, Boston lost its cross-jack yard and by 05:45 had {{suffered}} significant damage to its rigging and sails, rendering the ship significantly less manoeuvrable than Embuscade. At 06:10 the main topmast was knocked over and the mizzen mast badly damaged, and ten minutes later, as he was exhorting his men to greater efforts, a cannonball struck the rail where Captain Courtenay and Royal Marine Lieutenant James Butler <b>were</b> <b>standing.</b> Butler was killed instantly and Courtenay fell to the deck unresponsive, possibly killed. Believing his commander to be dead, Lieutenant John Edwards assumed command and had the bodies thrown overboard {{in an effort to}} prevent his sailors losing morale from the death of their captain. Boston continued to suffer under the heavier guns of the French ship and by 06:40 the mizzen mast was close to collapse and much of the remaining rigging had been shot away. Casualties mounted, with Lieutenant Edwards and Lieutenant Alexander Kerr both badly wounded, the latter blinded in one eye and the former struck on the head and briefly rendered unconscious.|$|E

5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
5|$|Free silver Democrats {{challenged}} Hunter's naturalization. It {{was finally}} concluded that Hunter, an Englishman, was naturalized under provisions {{of a federal}} law {{that allowed him to}} omit the standard preliminaries because of his service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army. Over the course of the contest, Hunter was also indicted for bribery, but was acquitted in short order for lack of evidence. Voting proceeded over several days, and demonstrators in the chamber galleries became disruptive in their support of various candidates. A Kentucky Post account from March 7, 1896, recorded that good-humored legislators began pelting each other with paper wads during the day's deliberations. This attempt at levity escalated until wrapped transcripts of the governor's message to the legislature were flying through the air. By March 11, tensions had reached the point that armed Democratic supporters <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> outside the state house in an attempt to intimidate Republican lawmakers and discourage them from entering. Attempts were made to unseat several legislators in the General Assembly, leading to threats of violence. Observers were banned from the gallery, and everyone entering the state house was searched for weapons.|$|E
5|$|The killing {{process at}} Treblinka {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} method used at Auschwitz and Majdanek, where the poison gas Zyklon B (hydrogen cyanide) was used. At Treblinka, Sobibór, Chełmno, and Bełżec, the victims died from suffocation and carbon monoxide poisoning. After visiting Treblinka on a guided tour, Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss concluded that using exhaust gas was inferior to the cyanide used at his extermination camp. The chambers became silent after 12 minutes and were closed for 20 minutes or less. According to Jankiel Wiernik, who survived the 1943 prisoner uprising and escaped, when {{the doors of the}} gas chambers had been opened, the bodies of the dead <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> and kneeling rather than lying down, due to the severe overcrowding. Dead mothers embraced the bodies of their children. Prisoners who worked in the Sonderkommandos later testified that the dead frequently let out a last gasp of air when they were extracted from the chambers. Some victims showed signs of life during the disposal of the corpses, but the guards routinely refused to react.|$|E
