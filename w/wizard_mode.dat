50|$|Big Millions: The <b>wizard</b> <b>mode.</b> The right ramp {{is worth}} 5M, 10M, 15M {{and so on}} for 10 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|Missions:In {{order to}} get to the <b>Wizard</b> <b>Mode</b> [...] "Battle for the Kingdom" [...] one has to achieve the {{following}} goals: ...|$|E
50|$|In total, {{there are}} five character-related {{missions}} which the individual player must complete. The main goal in South Park is to complete the Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Chef mode in order to unlock the secret <b>wizard</b> <b>modes.</b> In order to start a character mode, the player must hit each individual character’s slot (or shot) {{a certain number of}} times. After a successful completion, the number of shots it takes to activate the next character mode will increase, making it more difficult to activate. Character modes can be replayed regardless of completion.|$|R
2500|$|Wizard Mode: This is {{a special}} scoring mode, which is reached after meeting certain {{prerequisites}} to access this mode (e.g., finishing all modes). This is the pinball equivalent of the final boss fight in video games. Classic examples of this include Williams' Black Knight 2000 (The King's Ransom) and Midway's Twilight Zone (Lost in the Zone). Named after The Who's song [...] "Pinball Wizard". <b>Wizard</b> <b>modes</b> come in two varieties: goal-oriented types where the player receives {{a huge number of}} points after completing a specific task, or multiball modes with 4–6 balls in play, and virtually every feature active. Some games offer both and award the latter as a condition for completing the former.|$|R
50|$|The single-player {{campaign}} and Realm Quest mode are a narrative game world map overlay linking together {{a series of}} battles culminating in a boss battle with the player(s) pitted against a wizard king unit and a <b>wizard</b> unit. The <b>mode</b> introduces both strategy game and role-playing game elements such as capturing infrastructure, sending units to a target, hiring mercenary units to accompany the wizard unit, and resolving story driven elements.|$|R
5000|$|Ultimo {{appears as}} a core part of the Iron Man-themed table in Marvel Pinball. He appears during the table's <b>wizard</b> <b>mode</b> after {{completing}} all the main modes of the table.|$|E
5000|$|Once all modes are completed, the Start Mode saucer will {{light for}} a <b>wizard</b> <b>mode</b> by {{completing}} the 007 Top Lanes, finishing Shootout, successfully completing Q's Pen, and spelling [...] "GOLDENEYE".|$|E
5000|$|There {{are other}} modes where the player has {{multiple}} balls in action, {{but these are}} not considered [...] "multiball modes", such as the <b>wizard</b> <b>mode</b> where every ball is put in play.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of natural language spoken dialog systems requires collection and labeling {{of a large}} set of user-system interactions (knowledge). Ideally, it should be collected from live traffic in the field, since scripted scenarios in a lab typically result in unnatural phraseology. To achieve this, we introduce a hidden human agent, the "Wizard of Oz", to oversee the machine side of the interaction {{in collaboration with the}} automated dialog manager, unbeknownst to the user. The Wizard can provide a continuum of supervision ranging from explicitly controlling every step to a <b>Wizard</b> override <b>mode</b> where the machine operates semi-autonomously and the human overrides only when necessary. All interactions are entered directly into a database using a standard access interface and SQL. The collected data will typically be analyzed in the laboratory to quantify system performance, and to introduce algorithmic improvements prior to a new set of experiments. Over the course of system develop [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Post-independence African novel {{reflects}} disillusionment {{of writers}} with African reality. Corruption, mainly political, and of other forms is scrutinized by these writers in their fictional renderings. As such satire {{has become a}} favorite form of writing for them to express their disillusionment. This paper attempts to analyze Chinua Achebe’s A Man of the People and Ngugi Wa Thiango’s Wizard of the Crow as political satires. This {{has been done by}} exploring different techniques these writers have used that qualify these works as satires. The paper aims at showing how these writers create a world that the desire rejects and how that world is related to African reality. It is to be noted that though both the works are satires, yet the methods used by the writers are not the same. While A Man of the People is written in realistic <b>mode,</b> <b>Wizard</b> of the Crow is a sort of fantasy where the author, apart from using traditional way of storytelling, has taken recourse of magic realism...|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} Mary Shelley's Frankenstein pinball is to finish eight scenes {{indicated}} {{in a circular}} pattern on the playfield in order to engage a 6-ball multiball <b>wizard</b> <b>mode</b> after finishing all other modes: ...|$|E
50|$|Meet Your Maker: This is a four-ball <b>wizard</b> <b>mode</b> where {{everything}} is lit: all shots are 250,000 points, the Raceway inner loop is maxed out at 25 million, return lanes, kickback, Extra Ball, Jackpot, Super Jackpot, and Super Spinner are lit, Payback Time is started by shooting each ramp once, and Autofire (ballsaver) is lit for 20 seconds.|$|E
50|$|The {{game has}} an {{upper and lower}} level, a repeating U-Turn, Skyway Loop shots and a Drawbridge toy. Black Knight 2000 {{includes}} the patented Magna-Save feature from the original - a ball saving magnet preventing balls from draining. Other gameplay features include Lightning Wheel Awards, Hurry-Up bonuses, three Multi-Ball rounds, and The King's Ransom <b>Wizard</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
5000|$|When all six {{of these}} {{objectives}} are met, shoot the [...] "Stroke of Luck" [...] scoop to start Rule the Universe, a four-ball <b>wizard</b> <b>mode.</b> In this mode, everything is lit, and {{the objective is to}} score 5 billion points with at least two balls in play, and if you succeed, you will score an extra 5 billion points.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>wizard</b> <b>mode,</b> Valinor Multiball, {{is said to}} be one of {{the hardest}} to reach to date (only being topped by The Simpsons Pinball Party) as it needs all multiballs to be fully completed, {{reaching}} and playing [...] "There and Back Again...", collecting all the [...] "Gifts of the Elves", and finishing [...] "Destroy the Ring".|$|E
50|$|Once all {{the modes}} are completed, the Start Mode light will {{indicate}} Mystery Mode, a <b>wizard</b> <b>mode</b> {{where you have}} 20 seconds to knock down the BED and ROCK drop targets for 100 million points. Each target down scores 5 million. The mode ends after 20 seconds, or when the big points are awarded, and Fred's Choice will become the currently flashing mode.|$|E
50|$|Completing {{all of the}} Cryo-Claw modes {{lights the}} Underground shot for the <b>wizard</b> <b>mode,</b> Demolition Time. In this mode, three balls are {{launched}} into play, {{and all of the}} major shots are initially worth 15 million points. Hitting the five standup targets increases the base value of all the major shots by 5 million points, and launches another ball into play, up to five balls.|$|E
50|$|Once the 9 {{missions}} have finished, the <b>wizard</b> <b>mode</b> Master Alarm will start. It's a 40-second frenzy {{where every}} target scores 1 million and adds 1 {{million to a}} Jackpot that is lit at the Blastoff ramp. The Jackpot does not reset after collecting it, and {{does not have a}} limit. This round can be worth many points if the player has mastered the ramp shot.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the game you are given the choice of playing either the normal 3 ball game or a novice game which {{guarantees}} a 2-minute game time with the ball saver active. When the ball saver times out, the first drain ends the game. Holding in the left flipper and pressing start gives League mode and holding the right flipper gives <b>Wizard</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
50|$|The playfield {{most notable}} include a {{magnetic}} helicopter toy that can lift {{the ball from}} the ground. The <b>wizard</b> <b>mode</b> starts a light and sound show including an EKG heartbeat sound similar to the metamorphosis effects on Bride of Pinbot. The game does not have images or the voice of Rescue 911 TV show host William Shatner because Gottlieb {{did not get the}} rights from him. A planned reference was cancelled in an advanced state of development, as a result four stand up targets that should spell TREK are left empty.|$|E
5000|$|Eternal Life (6-ball): Completing all 12 modes {{lights the}} [...] "Start Mode" [...] scoop for Eternal Life, a frenetic six-ball <b>wizard</b> <b>mode.</b> In this mode, all six balls are {{launched}} into {{play and the}} objective is to hit all the targets on the playfield (including the Path of Adventure mini-playfield and excluding the outlanes) with at least two balls in play to score a 1 Billion point bonus. At the start of Eternal Life, the [...] "Eternal Life" [...] ballsaver is active for a limited amount of time.|$|E
5000|$|Lost in the Zone (6-ball) - The game's <b>wizard</b> <b>mode,</b> {{awarded for}} {{successfully}} lighting {{all of the}} door panels. The doorknob (bearing a question mark) becomes lit, and any of the normal mode-starting shots will start this mode. The player has approximately 45 seconds to make an unlimited number of shots to all targets - every playable single-ball mode, including Battle the Power, is active during this period, and balls are immediately put back into play when they are lost. Once time runs out, all targets and flippers go dead and all balls are allowed to drain. The total score is tallied while the machine refills the Gumball Machine, cycling the balls so that the Powerball goes in last. Gameplay then returns to normal.|$|E
5000|$|After {{completing}} all {{the other}} missions, starting the eighth and final [...] "mission", the <b>Wizard</b> <b>Mode</b> of the game. First, bonuses of 25 million points are awarded for each Artifact collected. In addition, each full [...] "set" [...] of four Artifacts awards 1 Billion points per set. The number of artifacts also sets the point value of each lit shot for this mode (25 million per Artifact, maxing out at 250 million for 10 or more Artifacts). Two balls are loaded into the cannons, and the player must launch them. The other four also enter the playfield and all targets are lit. Any target hit with one of their six balls in play will score the value established {{at the beginning of}} the mission which can be hit multiple times. The mission will continue until five of the balls are drained.|$|E
5000|$|Battle for the Kingdom This two-phased <b>Wizard</b> <b>Mode</b> starts {{once the}} player pockets {{the ball in}} the castle, with five balls on the playing field. In the first phase, the player has to score all the Battle Jackpots by hitting the madness targets. Once all the Battle Jackpots have been scored, {{the second phase of the}} mode starts and the player must hit the castle gate seven times, and get inside to score the final jackpot. Unless the player has any [...] "Troll Bombs", two trolls will be in the way of the gate making hitting the gate very challenging. If the player succeeds in scoring the final jackpot, all {{remaining}} balls are drained and the display shows the King of Payne's demise and Merlin announces you are the new King of the realm, and the game continues, also for the rest of the current ball, all major shots are lit for victory laps.|$|E
