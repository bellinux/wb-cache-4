The match remained at 1–0 and Liverpool won their second consecutive European Cup, becoming the first British team to retain the trophy.|$|E

5|$|In 1333–34, {{an attempt}} by some {{dissatisfied}} Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, <b>was</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III. Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in western European countries.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 1915, the Mill Creek (Lake Erie) flooded {{downtown}} Erie. A culvert, or a tunnel, <b>was</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> debris, and collapsed. A four-block reservoir, {{caused by}} torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge destroyed 225houses and killed 36people. After the flood, Mayor Miles Brown Kitts had the Mill Creek directed into another larger culvert, constructed under more than 2 miles of city, before emptying into Presque Isle Bay on the city's lower east side.|$|E
5|$|The Tariff Court {{is a large}} {{rectangular}} enclosure {{south of}} the agora and sharing its northern wall with it. Originally, {{the entrance of the}} court was a massive vestibule in its southwestern wall. However, the entrance <b>was</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> the construction of a defensive wall and the court was entered through three doors from the Agora. The court gained its name by containing a 5 meters long stone slab that had the Palmyrene tax law inscribed on it.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{struggled}} {{to move to}} the offense, and finally managed a shot on goal in the 25th minute, which <b>was</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> English goalkeeper Bert Williams. The English counterattacked with three successive clear shots at the goal in minutes 30, 31, and 32, but failed to score. Mortensen twice went over the crossbar, and Tom Finney's header to the top corner was tipped away by Borghi.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea came}} closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon {{received}} Premier League approval {{to relocate to}} Dublin, Ireland, but the move <b>was</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> the Football Association of Ireland. Additionally, the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland's two biggest teams, Celtic and Rangers, should or will {{take part in the}} Premier League, but nothing has come of these discussions.|$|E

5|$|When borings {{were made}} in the 1870s prior to the {{building}} of chemical works a deep gorge measuring around 100 feet (30 m) was found in the bedrock which was filled with glacial deposits. From this it was concluded that before the Ice Age the Mersey had flowed in a more northerly course, and when it <b>was</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> glacial deposits it had made a new channel through Runcorn Gap.|$|E
5|$|A {{touchdown}} pass reception by end Dale Van Sickel {{of more than}} 30 yards provided another score in the third period, followed by Brumbaugh's extra point kick. To close the third quarter, fullback Rainey Cawthon made a 40-yard broken field run. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Crabtree passed to Brumbaugh for another score, but Brumbaugh's extra point attempt <b>was</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> the Bulldogs. In {{the middle of the}} fourth quarter, Gator fans rushed the field to tear down the goal posts, and fist fights broke out between Georgia and Florida fans.|$|E
5|$|After a ten-yard gain by Richardson {{to start}} the quarter, Alabama lost a total of seven yards on {{consecutive}} plays and a McCarron incompletion on third down set up a third long field goal attempt. This time the 49-yard attempt from Jeremy Shelley <b>was</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> Bennie Logan and recovered by Eric Reid who returned it to the Alabama 48. On this LSU possession, Jordan Jefferson took over as the Tigers' quarterback, and LSU gained a first down on a six-yard Michael Ford run {{and a pair of}} short runs by Ware.

5|$|As the {{fighting}} was seemingly coming to an end, Carmelo Anthony confronted Collins and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. Jared Jeffries immediately tried to attack Anthony but tripped over Marcus Camby, before being restrained by coaches and teammates, while Anthony backed up towards the Nuggets' bench. Collins also ran down the court to get at Anthony but <b>was</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> Nenê and Smith. All ten players on the court {{at the time of}} the incident were ejected by the officiating crew that consisted of Dick Bavetta, Violet Palmer, and Robbie Robinson.|$|E
5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward because it <b>was</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> a ridge of high {{pressure to the}} north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began to execute a turn to the northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Cameron had {{a chance}} to score for Alloa in the 92nd minute but his shot <b>was</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> goalkeeper Fridge.

Ten minutes later, Sheerin then {{completed}} a hat-trick of goals for Inverness in the 112th minute, becoming only the second player to score three goals in the final match of the competition after Billy Dodds in 1990. With the score equal at 4–4 at the end of extra time, the game was decided by a penalty shoot-out.|$|E

5|$|Digging {{the tunnel}} {{turned out to}} be more {{difficult}} than expected. The soil was rocky, which forced the men to dig deeper than planned. There, they discovered a leaking gas main, which required the installation of special pumps to bring fresh air to the men. To hide the noise from the digging, one of the crew played piano and sang in the house while the others worked below. On July5, Berkman visited the prison stable, planning to make his escape. He was horrified to discover that the entrance <b>was</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> a large load of stones and bricks recently dumped for a construction project.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's brigade {{departed}} on {{the same}} road it used to enter Wytheville, the road that leads to Tazewell Courthouse (Jeffersonville). It was a good decision to leave, because the Confederate army had already begun an attempt to block their return home. One of the two main roads available for the return trip was occupied by troops {{under the command of}} Colonel John McCausland, and the other road <b>was</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> the command of Brigadier-General John S.

5|$|In October 2016, the U.S. {{state of}} Ohio {{announced}} that it would resume executions in January 2017, using a cocktail of midazolam, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride but this <b>was</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> a Federal judge. On 25 July 2017, Ronald Phillips was executed with a three-drug cocktail including midazolam after the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay. Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio had been that of Dennis McGuire. Murderer Gary Otte's lawyers unsuccessfully challenged his Ohio execution, arguing that midazolam might not protect him from serious pain when the other drugs are administered. He died without incident in about 14 minutes on September 13, 2017.|$|E
