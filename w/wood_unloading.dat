O ciclo operacional de transporte de madeira é ordenado pelas atividades de carregamento de madeira no campo, viagem carregada, descarregamento no depósito e viagem vazia. Utilizou-se a Rede de Petri Temporal, por trabalhar com dois tempos duração de sensibilização. Realizaram-se simulações com os softwares JARP e ARP, a fim de simular, analisar e avaliar o desempenho operacional. As variações empregadas em cada cenário se devem à qualidade da estrada, sob as condições atuais quanto à geometria {{vertical}} e horizontal e ao quociente de irregularidade, em cada depósito para os diferentes tipos de veículo e forma de carregamento da madeira adotado. Nas regiões de topografia acidentada, a melhoria das estradas alterando seu nível de qualidade tem maior influência para o aumento do desempenho dos veículos, e os veículos 4 x 2 e 6 x 2 apresentaram os melhores resultados. Nas regiões de planícies, a escolha do veículo tem maior influência no aumento do desempenho do transporte, já que a topografia e qualidade das estradas atuais já contribuem para isso. Nesses casos, a relação tonelada transportada por distância e tempo será maior para os veículos com capacidade de carga líquida maior. This study {{aimed at}} applying {{the model of}} logistic performance evaluation of productive chains (ADELCAP), based on the times {{of the elements of}} the operational cycle of wood transport from areas of fomentation of a cellulose producing company in the State of Espírito Santo, to indicate means of optimizing physical resources, guaranteeing a flow of uninterrupted provisioning and appropriate volume of wood entrance in the regional deposits. The operational cycle of wood transport is organized by the activities of wood loading in the field, wood hauling, <b>wood</b> <b>unloading</b> in the deposit and unhauling. The Temporal Petri Net was used, because it works with two times - sensitization duration. Simulations were carried out with the ARP and ARP software systems, in order to simulate, analyze and evaluate the operational performance. The variations employed in each scenery are due {{to the quality of the}} highway, under the current conditions, as for the vertical and horizontal geometry and the irregularity quotient, in each deposit, for the different types of vehicle and form of the adopted wood loading. In the areas of uneven topography, the improvement of the highways altering their quality level has a higher influence for the increase in the performance of the vehicles, and Toco and Truck presented better results. In the areas of plains, the choice of the vehicle has a higher influence in the increase of the performance of the transport, since the topography and the quality of the current highways already contribute to the performance. In these cases, the relation between transported ton and distance and time will be higher for the vehicles with higher capacity of liquid load...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho teve por objetivo utilizar o modelo de avaliação do desempenho logístico de cadeias produtivas (ADELCAP) centrado nos tempos dos elementos do ciclo operacional do transporte de madeira, visando otimizar os recursos, garantir um fluxo contínuo de abastecimento e assegurar um volume adequado de entrada de madeira na fábrica. O ciclo operacional de transporte de madeira é composto pelo carregamento de madeira no campo, viagem carregada, descarregamento, garagem e viagem vazia. Para tanto, utilizou-se como estudo de caso uma empresa produtora de celulose do Estado de Minas Gerais. Nesse modelo de cadeia logística de transporte de madeira, utilizou-se a Rede de Petri Temporal, por trabalhar com dois tempos que correspondem a uma duração de sensibilização. Criaram-se cenários com as mesmas variações nas duas regionais estudadas e realizaram-se simulações com os softwares JARP e ARP, a fim de avaliar o desempenho operacional e econômico. As variações aplicadas nos cenários foram: melhoria das estradas florestais; aumento do número de carregadores; e melhoria da eficiência da garagem. Em ambas as regionais, o cenário com as três variações (Cenário 7) apresentou a maior redução nos tempos dos ciclos de transporte de madeira em relação à situação atual, sendo 19, 24 e 21, 48 %, respectivamente, para Rio Doce e Cocais das Estrelas. Considerando-se apenas como custo operacional o valor pago pelo frete, não estando incluso o custo referente a investimentos, tanto na {{regional}} do Rio Doce quanto em Cocais das Estrelas, ele apresentou maior redução no cenário 7 (20, 09 e 21, 22 %, respectivamente). The present work {{aimed at}} using {{the model of}} logistic performance evaluation of productive chains (ADELCAP) centered in the operational cycle time elements of wood transport, seeking to optimize the resources, to guarantee a continuous flow of supplying and to assure an appropriate volume of wood entrance in the industry. The wood transport cycle time consists of wood loading, wood hauling, <b>wood</b> <b>unloading,</b> garage and wood unhauling. A cellulose producing company in the State of Minas Gerais was used as case study. Initially, the logistics and supply chain of the company was diagnosed to know the main existent obstacles along the chain; defining their preliminary vary key parameters, based on the characterization of their structure and operation; finally, the main directors that condition their efficiency and competitiveness were identified and evaluated. The model of chain logistics of wood transport used the Temporal Petri Net for working with two times that correspond to a sensitization period. Their properties are as follows: simulation (working with hypothetical scenarios), dynamic (exit values depend on the entrance values); determinist (exit variables are not random); continuous (time is measured by real numbers); and temporal in the transitions. Scenarios, with the same variations in the two wood-producing regionals were created, and simulations with the JARP and ARP software were carried out to evaluate the operational and economic performance. The variations applied to the scenarios were: improvement of the forest roads; increase of loader numbers, and improvement of garage efficiency. For both regionals, the scenario with the three variations (Scenario 7) presented the largest reduction in cycle times of wood transport {{in relation to the}} current situation, being 19. 24 % and 21. 48 %, respectively, for Rio Doce and Cocais das Estrelas. The analyzed operational cost is the value paid for the freight, not including the investment costs. Both regionals, Rio Doce and Cocais das Estrelas, presented a larger reduction in the Scenario 7, of 20. 09 % and 21. 22 %, respectively...|$|E

5000|$|From there, teams went to Thamalakane River to {{take one}} of the [...] "safari taxis" [...] to the Royal Tree Lodge Game Preserve for the Detour. In Brains, teams had to go on a horseback safari and spot ten wooden animal cutouts: (zebra, African buffalo, kudu, giraffe, meerkat, {{boomslang}} snake, leopard, warthog, ostrich, and hippopotamus with a heron). They then traveled to a nearby campsite and arranged a set of tiles featuring the silhouettes of the animals in the order they appeared. The were tiles for animals they did not see. There was no tile representing the hippopotamus, but there was one for the heron. Once they picked the right order, they received their next clue. If they werei ncorrect, they had to start again before being allowed another attempt to arrange the tiles. In Brawn, teams had to fill a traditional sand sledge with firewood and then, using a carrot dangling from a stick, coax a team of donkeys to pull the sledge to a campsite over a 1/2 mi away. Once the <b>wood</b> was <b>unloaded</b> from the sledge, teams received their next clue. Either task allowed teams to search the game preserve for the Pit Stop.|$|R
6000|$|Not many of {{the boys}} really had to saw wood, though a good {{many of the}} fellows' fathers had saws and bucks in their wood-sheds. There were public sawyers who did most of the wood-sawing; and they came up with their bucks on their shoulders, and asked for the job almost as soon as the <b>wood</b> was <b>unloaded</b> before your door. The most popular one with the boys was a poor half-wit known among them as Morn; and he was a {{favorite}} with them because he had fits, and because, when he had a fit, he would seem to fly all over the woodpile. The boys would leave anything to see Morn in a fit, and he always had a large crowd round him as soon as the cry went out that he was beginning to have one. They watched the hapless creature with grave, unpitying, yet not unfriendly interest, too ignorant of the dark ills of life to know how deeply tragic was the spectacle that entertained them, and how awfully present in Morn's contortions was the mystery of God's ways with his children, some of whom he gives to happiness and some to misery. When Morn began to pick himself weakly up, with eyes of pathetic bewilderment, they helped him find his cap, and tried to engage him in conversation, for the pleasure of seeing him twist his mouth when he said, of a famous town drunkard whom he admired, [...] "He's a strong man; he eats liquor." [...] It was probably poor Morn's ambition to eat liquor himself, and the boys who followed that drunkard about to plague him had a vague respect for his lamentable appetite.|$|R
40|$|Eusocial insects such as ants and wasps, {{bees and}} {{termites}} communicate via visual and chemical cues, touch or mechanical vibrations. In particular termites {{make use of}} substrate-borne vibrations, to either detect conspecifics such as nest-mates or to locate food competitors. By building solid clay mounds, termites stay well hidden and protected from their many predators; {{only as a last}} resort termite soldiers attack nest intruders, often in a suicidal manner. Detecting the dangers as early as possible, exchanging information cryptically and the avoidance of conflicts are therefore the main survival strategies in termites. The secretive feeding signals such as gnawing wood are therefore very different to the soldiers’ obvious alarm signal, a repetitive head drumming on the ground. Camouflaging and building solid constructions are further paramount for the termite colonies’ survival against predators such as ants. Termite mounds have been shown to be complex, with much research being conducted on self-organising aspects in their constructions. Recent findings of the mound building, lower termite Coptotermes acinaciformis indicate its ability to detect loaded wood fibres. If necessary the termites supported the wood with solid clay constructions to unlock additional food resources for consumption. Here we give an overview of the vibro-acoustic experiments we conducted with termites in the past to illustrate their ability to identify promising foraging sites, to eavesdrop on food competitors and to distinguish between loaded and <b>unloaded</b> <b>wood</b> fibres. We discuss the influence of the material properties on vibrational communication and how building activities might influence the quality of the communication channel...|$|R
