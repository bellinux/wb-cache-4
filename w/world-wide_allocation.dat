40|$|Open source {{software}} (OSS) {{is marked}} by free access to the software and its source code. OSS is developed by a 'community' consisting of thousands of contributors {{from all over the}} world. Some research was undertaken in order to analyze how global the OSS community actually is, i. e. analyze the geographic origin of OSS developers. But as members of the OSS community differ in their activity levels, information about the allocation of activities are of importance. Our paper contributes to this as we analyze not only the geographic origin of (active) developers but also the geographic allocation of OSS activities. The paper is based on data from the SourceForge research Data Archive, referring to 2006. We exploit information about the developers' IP address, email address and indicated time-zone. This enables us to properly assign 1. 3 million OSS developers from SourceForge to their countries, that are 94 % of all registered ones in 2006. In addition we have information about the number of posted messages which is a good proxy for activity of each developer. Thus we can provide a detailed picture of the <b>world-wide</b> <b>allocation</b> of open source activities. Such country data about the supply-side of OSS is a valuable stock for both, cross-country studies on OSS, as well as country-specific research and policy advice.

40|$|Abstract: At last year’s AMSAT Annual meeting, W 3 IWI {{presented}} {{the concept of}} a C-band in-band transponder 1, dubbed “C-C Rider”. This was {{based on the fact that}} the C-band satellite frequency allocation has matched pair of 20 MHz wide allocations: 5650 - 5670 MHz uplink, paired with 5830 - 5850 MHz downlink. The status of the 5650 - 5670 MHz uplink band has changed since last year; the FCC has adopted an industry proposal for expanded 802. 11 a spectrum, and a <b>world-wide</b> <b>allocation</b> was made at WARC 2003. In this paper we speculate on the QRM level that might exist 5 - 10 years from now as seen by a C-band receiver on a HEO satellite. We will also discuss the RFI environment to be expected by a typical user at the C-band downlink frequency. Many of the options that were presented in the previous paper have been considered in the context of a significant part of AMSAT’s HEO (High Earth Orbit) EAGLE Project. Recent advances in SDR (Software Defined Radio) technology have led to {{the concept of a}} modular transponder that can be easily reconfigured in orbit. Since there is little suitable C-band hardware available for the amateur community, we will discuss the idea that the spacecraft RF and SDR modules can be “dual use ” with low-cost compact user terminals developed as a system, in parallel with the spacecraft development. The C-Band Radio Spectrum: Let us begin by examining the amateur frequency allocations between 1 and 10 GHz in Table 1 1, 2...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} production distortion for income redistribution in an international trade model. In particular, this paper examines {{the role of the}} Stolper and Samuelson effect (Stolper and Samuelson 1941) on efficient income redistribution. It first shows that production inefficiency can {{be a part of a}} Pareto-efficient tax system when there is an asymmetric information problem between the government and individuals. Second, by using the technique that Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) originally developed, this paper shows that such production inefficiency is not only Pareto-improving for a small country but also essential to achieve <b>world-wide</b> Pareto-efficient <b>allocation.</b> Those two results suggest important policy implications for commercial policies. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{crisis of}} the {{financial}} markets had its onset as early as February 2007, when the first defaults of mortgage debts with a low rating of creditworthiness were reported. Following that, the crisis shifted to the secured mortgage debt market to finally affect the entire financial system. All in all, the required valuation adjustments in the financial services are estimated to $ 3, 400 billion. The resulting losses compelled, on a <b>world-wide</b> basis, the <b>allocation</b> of public funds to credit institutions, a considerable increase of government guarantees to finance credit institutions, {{the reduction of the}} key interest rates to approximately 0 percent, and, moreover, direct measures safeguarding liquidity in the credit sector on behalf of the central banks. Macroeconomic imbalances, arbitrage dealings between low and high interest currencies and an overly expansive monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve can be quoted as the macroeconomic reasons for the crisis on the financial markets. However, the crisis also unveiled deficiencies within the control and supervision systems of the financial service providers. The securisation of mortgages and other financial instruments allowed financial service providers to shift business activities outside the regulated area. These regrouping activities in turn required a fair-value assessment of securitised credits and pro-cyclically triggered higher equity provisions within the Basel II standards.

40|$|Agriculture is {{the largest}} {{consumer}} of freshwater resources - around 70 percent of all freshwater withdrawals are used for food production. These agricultural products are traded internationally. A full understanding of water use is, therefore, impossible without understanding the international market for food and related products, such as textiles. Based on the global general equilibrium model GTAP-W, we offer a method for investigating the role of green (rain) and blue (irrigation) water resources in agriculture and {{within the context of}} international trade. We use future projections of allowable water withdrawals for surface water and groundwater to define two alternative water management scenarios. The first scenario explores a deterioration of current trends and policies in the water sector (water crisis scenario). The second scenario assumes an improvement in policies and trends in the water sector and eliminates groundwater overdraft <b>world-wide,</b> increasing water <b>allocation</b> for the environment (sustainable water use scenario). In both scenarios, welfare gains or losses are not only associated with changes in agricultural water consumption. Under the water crisis scenario, welfare not only rises for regions where water consumption increases (China, South East Asia and the USA). Welfare gains are considerable for Japan and South Korea, Southeast Asia and Western Europe as well. These regions benefit from higher levels of irrigated production and lower food prices. Alternatively, under the sustainable water use scenario, welfare losses not only affect regions where overdrafting is occurring. Welfare decreases in other regions as well. These results indicate that, for water use, there is a clear trade-off between economic welfare and environmental sustainability. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
