40|$|People <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> low-vision {{may have}} a harder time {{participating}} in exercise due to inaccessibility or lack of ex-perience. We employed Value Sensitive Design (VSD) to ex-plore the potential of technology to enhance exercise for peo-ple <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> low-vision. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews about exercise and technology with 10 people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> low-vision and 10 people who facil-itate fitness for people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> low-vision. We also conducted a survey with 76 people to learn about outsider perceptions of hypothetical exercise with people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> low-vision. Based on our interviews and survey, we found opportunities for technology development in four ar-eas: 1) mainstream exercise classes, 2) exercise with sighted guides, 3) rigorous outdoors activity, and 4) navigation of exercise spaces. Design considerations should include when and how to deliver auditory or haptic information based on exercise and context, and whether it is acceptable to develop less mainstream technologies if they enhance mainstream ex-ercise. The findings of this work seek to inform the design of accessible exercise technologies. Author Keywords Accessibility; exercise; exergames; visual impairments...|$|R
40|$|Unemployment and {{underemployment}} have, {{for many}} years, been {{a social and}} economic problem for people with disabilities. This study looks at consumers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of access to employment for people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> vision impaired as one target group within the disability field. Using the Employment Access Questionnaire (EAQ), the perceptions of people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> vision impaired <b>were</b> compared with the perceptions of people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> vision impaired (nondisabled). Results of the study indicated that people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> vision impaired and people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> nondisabled view work as equally important in their lives. However, people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> vision impaired {{reported that they were}} significantly less satisfied with career development and services and training opportunities as compared with their peers <b>who</b> <b>were</b> nondisabled. A factor analysis of the data gathered from 85 <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> vision impaired and 84 nondisabled participants revealed a four factor structure for the EAQ. These results are discussed with reference to previous work in this area and suggestions for future research are proposed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This article {{reports on}} {{a survey of the}} {{opinions}} of employment networks (ENs) about serving social security beneficiaries <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> visually impaired under the Ticket to Work program. Although most of the 267 ENs who participated in the survey expressed concerns about working with those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> visually impaired, they {{did not seem to be}} biased against working with this population based solely on their disability type. The Ticket to Work (TTW) program was established by the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. The program began in 13 states in February of 2002, and by the end of 2004, it was in effect nationwide. TTW is meant to help all persons with disabilities <b>who</b> <b>are</b> receiving federal aid from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to obtain employment. However, because of the way the act has been implemented, there is a question of whether it will be effective with certain groups of consumers. One such group <b>are</b> those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> visually impaired. The purpose of this study was to begin to investigate TTW's effectiveness with consumers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> visually impaired...|$|R

40|$|File created (12 / 03 / 2015). This is not {{the final}} version of record. The {{following}} article was published in the Journal of Visual Impairment & Blindness, 109 (4), article 4. The final version of record can be found at [URL] The ability to get out and about is important to social inclusion and quality of life and {{it is one of the}} most significant challenges for people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> visually impaired. There has been little research into the underlying concerns of people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> visually impaired when making decisions about mobility. Method: This grounded theory study explored the main mobility-related concerns of people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> visually impaired. It uses qualitative data, drawn from a combination of online discussions, face-to-face, telephone and email interviews, and focus groups with people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> visually impaired and rehabilitation practitioners. Results: The primary concern of people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> visually impaired when making choices about where to go, and when and how to do so, was a desire to see oneself and to be seen by others as “normal”. Self-identity and perceived “normality” are subjective and changeable and are continually internally co-reconstructed to achieve congruence between them. The mobility strategies used are those that are perceived as most “normal”. Discussion: Perceived “normality” has a powerful influence on behaviour. By harnessing this, rehabilitation services may be better able to promote autonomy and self-reliance. Implications for Practitioners: To promote independence, rehabilitation services must change people’s perception of what is “normal”. People must be supported to come to perceive fulfilment of valued social roles, autonomy and self-reliance as “normal”...|$|R
