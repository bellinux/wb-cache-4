5|$|George Calvert {{went up to}} Trinity College at Oxford University, matriculating in 1593/94, {{where he}} studied foreign {{languages}} and received a bachelor's degree in 1597. As the oath of allegiance was compulsory {{after the age of}} sixteen, he <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> certainly have pledged conformity while at Oxford. The same pattern of conformity, whether pretended or sincere, continued through Calvert's early life. After Oxford, he moved in 1598 to London, where he studied municipal law at Lincoln's Inn for three years.|$|E
5|$|Burke stated on March 27 that he <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> {{certainly}} {{enter the}} draft if Michigan {{won the national}} title. On April 9 before boarding the airplane to return from the NCAA Final Four, head coach Beilein met with Burke, Hardaway, Robinson and McGary to direct them to seek {{the advice of the}} NBA advisory committee. The draft board had until April 15 to develop each individual report and the players have until April 28 to enter the draft. On April 13, reports surfaced that Burke would announce that he would enter the NBA draft at a press conference the following day. On April 14, he entered the 2013 NBA draft.|$|E
5|$|By 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in {{its fourth}} year. The {{previous}} year {{had been one of}} success for France and her allies, most particularly on the Danube, where Marshal Villars and the Elector of Bavaria had created a direct threat to Vienna, the Habsburg capital. Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to the brilliant Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, the threat was still real: Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vendôme's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy. In the courts of Versailles and Madrid, Vienna's fall was confidently anticipated, an event which <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> certainly have led to the collapse of the Grand Alliance.|$|E

5|$|Grace's final {{appearance}} in 1878 {{was for the}} USEE against Twenty of Essex in a two-day match at Witham, starting on Friday, 13 September. The game was played {{for the benefit of}} the Essex and USEE stalwart Frank Silcock. Essex at this time was not a first-class club but capable of providing the USEE with a stern test, especially with odds in their favour, and they had by far the best of a drawn game. Essex scored 175 and 235; USEE replied with 134 and 65–5, so Essex <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> certainly have won with more time. Grace starred with the ball and took a total of 26 wickets. But his indifferent form with the bat haunted him right to the end of the season and he could only score 10 and 4.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 NSB Gardermoen {{stated that}} they {{expected}} to charge commuter and intercity trains 100 million Norwegian krone per year {{to use the new}} line. County politicians in Akershus stated that it was not reasonable for commuters to {{have to pay for the}} new railway. Early estimates showed that this <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> double to price from Oslo to Eidsvoll, and that passengers would have different prices, depending on which route they followed. Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk, which was responsible for buses in Akershus, {{stated that they}} had no way to influence NSB's prices, but that they would consider starting a coach service along the route, which would not charge the surcharge.|$|E
5|$|Jovan Vladimir {{was buried}} in Prespa, in the same church in front {{of which he was}} martyred. His relics soon became famous as {{miraculously}} healing, attracting many people to his tomb. Shortly after his death he was recognized as a martyr and saint, being commemorated on 22May, his feast day. At that time, saints were recognized without any formal rite of canonization. Vladimir was the first ruler of a Serbian state who was elevated to sainthood. The rulers from the Nemanjić dynasty, who reigned over the Serbian state which grew around Raška, <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> all be canonized—starting with Nemanja, the saintly founder of the dynasty.|$|E

5|$|On May 1, 2009, Paul {{said that}} if Bunning, whose {{fundraising}} in 2009 matched his poor numbers in opinion polling for the 2010 election, declined to seek a third term, he <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> certainly run in the Republican Party primary to succeed him, and formed an exploratory committee soon after, while still promising {{to stay out of}} the race if Bunning ultimately decided to run for reelection. Paul made this announcement on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, though a Kentucky news site first broke the news.|$|E
5|$|Only three Milky Way naked-eye {{supernova}} {{events have}} been observed during the last thousand years, though many have been seen in other galaxies using telescopes. The most recent directly observed supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, but the remnants of two more recent supernovae have also been found. Statistical observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur on average about three times every century in the Milky Way, and that any galactic supernova <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> certainly be observable with modern astronomical telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{through the}} hands of four owners during its troubled 23-year history, Nittany Furnace never {{fulfilled}} the expectations developed when it replaced the antiquated (charcoal) Bellefonte Furnace. It should arguably never have been built: {{by the time it}} went into blast in 1888, the price per ton of iron had already been driven below $22, a historic low, and it <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> never rise above that figure until the onset of World War I. The sprawling steel works of Pittsburgh, fed by Mesabi Range ore, could produce iron more cheaply than the furnaces at Bellefonte ever could. The principal advantage of a Bellefonte location — proximity to local ore deposits — was negated by the availability of easily mined, high-grade Mesabi ore, hauled by rail.|$|E

5|$|Recognising the {{increasing}} congestion in the City and its rapidly growing suburbs, Pearson published a pamphlet in 1845 {{calling for the}} construction of an underground railway through the Fleet valley to Farringdon. The proposed railway would have been an atmospheric railway with trains pushed through tunnels by compressed air. Although the proposal was ridiculed and came to nothing (and <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> certainly have failed if it had been built, due to the shortcomings of the technology proposed), Pearson continued to lobby for a variety of railway schemes throughout the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} fiction in Galaxy had dipped {{towards the end}} of Gold's editorship, and Pohl worked hard to restore the magazine's high standards. Gold's {{difficult}} editorial personality had driven away some of his contributors, but Pohl, who had worked as an agent in the 1950s, was a central figure in the sf community and was able to attract submissions from the star writers of his day. In the case of one of these stars, he offered an unusual arrangement: Robert Silverberg could write whatever he wished and Pohl promised that he <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> invariably buy it. Silverberg, who had been a high-volume producer of competent but unremarkable science fiction, began writing more ambitious work as a result, much of which was published in Galaxy throughout the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
5|$|By July 27, the FEAF Bomber Command had a {{comprehensive}} rail interdiction plan ready. This plan sought {{to cut the}} flow of North Korean troops and materiel from North Korea to the combat area. Two cut points, the P'yong-yang railroad bridge and marshaling yards and the Hamhung bridge and Hamhung and Wonsan marshaling yards <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> completely sever North Korea's rail logistics network. Destruction of the rail bridges over the Han near Seoul would cut rail communication to the Pusan Perimeter area. On July 28 the Far East Air Forces gave a list of targets in the rail interdiction program to the Bomber Command, and two days later a similar plan was ready for interdiction of highways. On August 3, the FEAF issued lists of targets for coordinated interdiction attacks south of the 38th Parallel to the Fifth Air Force and to the Navy. In general, the Han River divided the Fifth Air Force and FEAF Bomber Command zones.|$|E
5|$|Even if the ARBiH had not {{provided}} aid, the HV <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> certainly have defeated the Banija Corps on its own, albeit at greater cost. The lack of reserves was the ARSK's key weakness that was exploited by the HV and the ARBiH since the ARSK's static defence could not cope with fast-paced attacks. The ARSK military {{was unable to}} check outflanking manoeuvres and their Special Units Corps failed as a mobile reserve, holding back the HV's 1st Guards Brigade south of Slunj {{for less than a}} single day. The ARSK traditionally counted on the VRS and the Yugoslav military as its strategic reserve, but the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina immobilized the VRS reserves and Yugoslavia did not intervene militarily as Milošević did not order it to do so. Even if he had wished to intervene, the speed of the battle would have allowed a very limited time for Yugoslavia to deploy appropriate reinforcements to support the ARSK.|$|E

5|$|In February 1975, Whitlam {{decided to}} appoint Senator Murphy a {{justice of the}} High Court of Australia, even though Murphy's Senate seat would not be up for {{election}} if a half-Senate election were held. Under proportional representation, Labor could win {{three of the five}} New South Wales seats, but if Murphy's seat was also contested, it was most unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, appointing Murphy <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> certainly cost the ALP a Senate seat at the next half-Senate election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis, felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton, former mayor of Albury and an independent.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, the UN Far East Air Force Bomber Command began {{a steady}} and {{increasing}} campaign against strategic North Korean logistics targets. The {{first of these}} targets was Wonsan on the east coast. Wonsan was important as a communications center that linked Vladivostok, Siberia, with North Korea by rail and sea. From it, rail lines ran to all the North Korean build-up centers. The great bulk of Russian supplies for North Korea {{in the early part}} of the war came in at Wonsan, and from the beginning it was considered a major military target. By July 27, the FEAF Bomber Command had a comprehensive rail interdiction plan ready. This plan sought to cut the flow of North Korean troops and materiel from North Korea to the combat area. Two cut points, the P'yong-yang railroad bridge and marshaling yards and the Hamhung bridge and Hamhung and Wonsan marshaling yards, <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> completely sever North Korea's rail logistics network. Destruction of the rail bridges over the Han near Seoul would cut rail communication to the Pusan Perimeter area. On August 4, FEAF began B-29 interdiction attacks against all key bridges north of the 37th Parallel in Korea and, on August 15, light bombers and fighter-bombers joined in the interdiction campaign.|$|E
5|$|Julian's {{best hope}} for a quick victory lay in a cavalry breakthrough. Not only was the German cavalry {{probably}} smaller than his own, but its lack of armour made it vulnerable to his armoured regiments, especially the cataphracts. If they could rout the enemy horse, his squadrons could then wheel and attack the German lines in the flank or rear, and the battle would {{be as good as}} won. Julian's cavalry would thus aim to deliver a shock charge, careering forward in a wedge formation with the cataphracts forming the spearhead, the conventional armoured cavalry on either side and the light regiments on the extreme right, ready to block outflankers and to pursue fleeing enemy horse. The initial collision would shatter the enemy formation, and then the Germans could be overpowered in the ensuing melee. Failing a cavalry breakthrough, Julian would have to rely on a struggle of attrition on foot, in which superior Roman armour, training and formation discipline <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> inevitably prevail.|$|E
