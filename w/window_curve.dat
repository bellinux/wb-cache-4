Numerical {{horizontal}} magnetic gradients {{obtained from}} total intensity anomaly profile of dipping dike geological structure, using filters of successive window lengths {{can be used}} to determine the depth, width and dipping angle of the dike. By defining the horizontal gradient magnetic anomaly values at three points on the profile, a simple formula relating the depth to half-width of the dike is derived. For a fixed window length, the depth is determined iteratively using this simple formula for different half-width values. The computed depths are plotted against the half-width values representing a continuous <b>window</b> <b>curve.</b> The solution for the depth and half-width of the buried structure is read at the common intersection of the window curves. The method is applied to synthetic data with and without random errors and approved to be fair and exact for the noise free data, while gives acceptable range of errors for the case of noisy data. Moreover, when the error in profile origin position determination is studied, the method is approved to be not sensitive to it. Two of cited field examples from Canada have also been analyzed and interpreted by the proposed method, where an acceptable agreement has been approved between the obtained results and other published results...|$|E

2500|$|As styling {{development}} commenced it was realised that {{to design}} another coach {{to match the}} success of the Panorama Elite series was to be a challenge. Looking at the existing range of Panorama Elite III it was decided to use the Elite's most striking feature, notably the size of the <b>windows</b> and the <b>curves</b> that departed in every direction. The front of the coach was to follow closely with Elite by utilising the same double headlights with a panel between them (although the centre panel depended on the chassis requirements). The slats again horizontal but were fewer in number and thicker. The sides of the grill were squared up and were of stainless steel and not aluminium. A chrome bumper with [...] overriders at the bottom with two steps to allow access to the windscreen. Pantograph wipers with speed control were added. The dome was slatted on the early models but was not popular so was removed and simplified from Supreme IV. The side profile again had angles going in all directions although the main change to the side was that the <b>windows</b> <b>curved</b> into the cant rail almost like the Mercedes-Benz O302 bodies. The effect was to catch the light and highlighted the whole coach at roof level. The rear was like Panorama Elite with vertical lozenge shaped lights but the units themselves were slightly bigger, squared, more definite.|$|R
