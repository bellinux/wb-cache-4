5|$|David Cameron (Conservative {{leader and}} Prime Minister) said:... {{he was an}} {{extraordinary}} man: a great writer, a brilliant speaker, extraordinary in Parliament, and a great life of public and political and parliamentary service. I mean, I disagreed with most of what he said. But he was always engaging and interesting, and you were never bored <b>when</b> <b>reading</b> or listening to him, and the country a great campaigner, a great writer, and someone who I'm sure whose words will be followed keenly for many, many years to come.|$|E
5|$|Rongorongo glyphs {{were written}} in reverse boustrophedon, left to right and bottom to top. That is, the reader begins at the bottom {{left-hand}} corner of a tablet, reads a line from left to right, then rotates the tablet 180 degrees to continue on the next line. <b>When</b> <b>reading</b> one line, the lines above and below it would appear upside down, {{as can be seen}} in the image at left.|$|E

5|$|Southern Min dialects undergo {{considerable}} tone sandhi, i.e. {{changes to}} the tone depending on {{the position of the}} syllable in any given sentence or utterance. However, like pinyin for Mandarin Chinese, POJ always marks the citation tone (i.e. the original, pre-sandhi tone) rather than the tone which is actually spoken. This means that <b>when</b> <b>reading</b> aloud the reader must adjust the tone markings on the page to account for sandhi. Some textbooks for learners of Southern Min mark both the citation tone and the sandhi tone to assist the learner.|$|E
5|$|Strickland's {{career began}} in 1999 {{with a brief}} {{appearance}} as a mourner at a funeral after-party in The Sixth Sense, a two-line part that she received after impressing writer-director M. Night Shyamalan <b>when</b> <b>reading</b> lines for those auditioning for the film. According to Strickland, {{her role in the}} film helped her learn to temper her fake crying. The same year, she served as an extra in the independent film The Sterling Chase, and appeared in a small role opposite Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie in James Mangold's drama Girl, Interrupted.|$|E
5|$|The Hebrew {{alphabet}} is, {{like the}} Persian alphabet, an abjad. It {{is used for}} the Jewish Bukhori dialect primarily in Samarkand and Bukhara. Additionally, since 1940, when Jewish schools were closed in Central Asia, the use of the Hebrew Alphabet outside Hebrew liturgy fell into disuse and Bukharian Jewish publications such as books and newspapers began to appear using the Tajik Cyrillic Alphabet. Today, many older Bukharian Jews who speak Bukharian and went to Tajik or Russian schools in Central Asia only know the Tajik Cyrillic Alphabet <b>when</b> <b>reading</b> and writing Bukharian and Tajik.|$|E

Peter only knows what is happening <b>when</b> <b>reading</b> the episode's plot synopsis in TV Guide (the reason he entered the rodeo), and finds out who Luke is. As Luke escapes out the window, Peter alerts Joe, who apprehends Luke. Joe also arrests Meg for harboring a fugitive, and she is sent to prison. Luke is never heard from again in the episode.|$|E

She is ranked in the top 10 {{throughout}} the whole country in standardized exam results of every subjectâ€”she always goes to library to read extra materials, especially books in foreign languages. Kotomi is a very quiet girl with poor social skills and it is quite difficult to communicate with her; Kotomi can even completely ignore someone <b>when</b> <b>reading,</b> even if they make loud disturbances around her. Clannad fourth heroine is a second-year student named Tomoyo Sakagami who transfers into Tomoya's school. Tomoyo can be aggressive is a very strong fighter, preferring to use kicking over punching, and is very athletic. Although Tomoya is older than her, Tomoyo does not show him respect as a senior student. Tomoyo appears in Key's fifth game, , as the main heroine.|$|E

25|$|Though Slim was a civil {{engineering}} major, he also displayed {{an interest in}} economics. He took economics courses in Chile once he finished his engineering degree.

25|$|He used {{traditional}} terms {{as much as}} possible, though consistently redefining them. Further, some of his terminology changed throughout the later part of his career, with the terms gaining greater consistency but breaking from their traditional meaning (thus creating neologisms). <b>When</b> <b>reading</b> Castoriadis, {{it is helpful to}} understand what he means by the terms he uses, since he does not redefine the terms in every piece where he employs them.|$|E

25|$|The British {{edition of}} the novel had 43 illustrations; American editions {{generally}} had fewer. The popular United States paperback edition published by Collier between 1970 and 1994, which sold many millions, had only 17 illustrations, many of them severely cropped from the originals, giving many readers in that country a very different experience <b>when</b> <b>reading</b> the novel.
