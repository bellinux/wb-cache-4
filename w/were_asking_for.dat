5|$|The same year, Krichell went to Hartford, Connecticut to sign shortstop Leo Durocher for a $7,500 bonus ($ in 2010). When {{the deal}} was concluded, Barrow sent Krichell to Salt Lake City to watch young second baseman Tony Lazzeri, who played for the Salt Lake Bees of the Pacific Coast League and hit 60 home runs and {{achieved}} over 200 RBIs the previous season. The Bees <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> $50,000 ($ in 2010), but several scouts placed his value ten times lower. The Chicago Cubs were given the option to sign him for a discounted rate, but declined because he had epilepsy. Krichell saw promise in the player and convinced Barrow to buy him. Around the same time, he helped acquire shortstop Mark Koenig from the Minneapolis Millers. These Krichell signings formed part of the 1927 New York Yankees team, {{considered by many to}} be the greatest team ever assembled. Four of the starters in this squad were signed by Krichell, including three-quarters of its infield and Mike Gazella, its main backup, who signed for $500 in 1923 ($ in 2010). The Yankees took just four games to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates and win the 1927 World Series.|$|E

The company originally offered recording services via a remote recording studio in Surack's Volkswagen microbus and a recording studio based out of his home. When the Kurzweil K250 programmable keyboard and sampler was introduced in 1984, Surack became known for his custom K250 sound library and programming skills as well as his upgrade kits. Surack became a Kurzweil dealer, but his clients <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> advice regarding other products as well. Surack expanded Sweetwater to become a music retailer whose emphasis was pre- and post-sale customer service.

500|$|In August 2011, [...] the CCAF won a case at {{a federal}} appeals court in California in which they objected to class action {{settlements}} and attorneys' fees in litigation regarding Bluetooth headsets. The original case over the headsets had been filed when lawyers had noticed news articles about potential hearing loss and headsets and filed suits on behalf of millions of Motorola and Plantronics customers. The prior settlement would have effectively paid consumers nothing but given the lawyers who negotiated the pact $850,000 in fees, amended by Frank and his firm. Frank regards the case as a milestone in his fight to prevent abuses. Frank also unsuccessfully filed an objection to a settlement in an antitrust case against Sirius XM Radio, which provided nothing for the plaintiffs, but a 100 percent payout of $13 million for the attorneys. Judge Harold Baer, Jr. ruled on 24 August that the settlement terms [...] "demonstrate sufficient fairness, adequacy and reasonableness" [...] and rejected Frank's claims. Frank vowed to appeal, saying [...] "you don't like to lose, but it's a good case to take to the appellate court." [...] In June 2010, the CCAF filed an objection on behalf of four class members to the Dewey v. Volkswagen, Water Ingress Settlement where attorneys <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> over $23 million for recovering an $8 million reimbursement fund for a small subset of the class.

Williams' remains are interred at the Oakwood Annex in Montgomery.

60|$|Dr. C. J. Romanes {{tells of}} a female {{chimpanzee}} who was taught to count straws up to five. She held the straws in her hand, exposing the ends to the number requested. If she <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> three, she held up three. If she <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> four, she held up four. All this is a mere matter of training. But consider now, Mr. Burroughs, what follows. When she <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> five straws and she had only four, she doubled one straw, exposing both its ends and thus making up the required number. She did not do this only once, and by accident. She did it whenever more straws <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> than she possessed. Did she perform a distinctly reasoning act? or was her action the result of blind, mechanical instinct? If Mr. Burroughs cannot answer to his own satisfaction, he may call Dr. Romanes a nature-faker and dismiss the incident from his mind.|$|R
