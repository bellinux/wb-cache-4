5|$|With Misery we had {{the luxury}} of doing a two-day shoot, which is totally luxurious these days. And <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not having any rules. It was very much on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in there. We were there for two days and it was like an art project.|$|E
25|$|So {{we could}} get down to business. We divided the exhibitors in two, those who were headed by Signac and Luce, the other made up of artists of the new generation. On {{one side of the}} central room the rooms would be given to the older members; on the other, the young {{painters}} organised the rooms that had been given to them. For our part, we took Room 41. In the following rooms, André Lhote, Segonzac, La Fresnaye etc. would take their place. It was at this moment that <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know each other.|$|E
25|$|I didn't {{play that}} well in {{stages of the}} tour and other players {{deserved}} a game. But <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> halfway through the tour and (captain) Greg Chappell {{came to me and}} said there was trouble at the top of the order and asked if I would like to open the batting in the county games. I did that and I was quite successful. I think at the end of the tour I finished about fifth in the batting averages. But that didn't seem to make any difference. I was the only one who didn't play a Test match.|$|E

"Look here, boys," [...] Harry said, [...] "this is {{not going}} to be a holiday time, you bet. <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> make this place a sight snugger than it is now, for, I tell you, when the winter sets in in earnest, it will be cold enough here to freeze a buffalo solid in an hour. <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> set to work to make a roof all over this place, and <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> hunt to lay in a big stock of meat. <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get a big store of food for the horses, for we must be mighty careful with our flour now. We can wait a {{fortnight}} to see how things go, but if it is clear then that <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> fight it out here through the winter, we must shoot the pack-ponies at once, and I reckon the others will all have to go later. However, we will give them a chance as long as we can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{suppose you}} had," [...] said the manager. [...] "But now <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> act. <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{do one of}} two things, and Godolphin knows it; <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> let Miss Havisham go, or <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> let him go. For my part I would much rather let him go. She is a finer artist every way, and she is more {{important}} {{to the success of the}} piece. But it would be more difficult to replace him than it would be to replace her, and he knows it. We could get Miss Pettrell at once for Salome, and we should have to look about for a Haxard. Still, I am disposed to drop Godolphin, if Mr. Maxwell feels as I do." ...|$|R
25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken {{us back to the}} era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot have a situation where everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as we go forward into this year.|$|E

500|$|On May 1, 2012, [...] "Sexify" [...] was {{released}} {{as part of}} the sampler album Pharrell Williams and Jermaine Dupri Present Leah LaBelle; it also included four other tracks: [...] "So Hot", [...] "Make Me Get Up", [...] "What Do <b>We</b> <b>Got</b> <b>To</b> Lose?", and [...] "Mr. Scissors". LaBelle described the sampler as representative of her overall sound, calling it [...] "that feel-good-texture music, that throwback-but-new feel". [...] "Sexify" [...] {{was released}} separately as a digital download on the following dates in July depending upon the country: (July 19, July 22, and July 29).|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta, and {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis. [...] "Company Picnic" [...] was the 100th overall episode of The Office, and show creator Greg Daniels said he was especially proud the series made it to that landmark because he felt it meant he did not disappoint Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British version of the show. Daniels said, [...] "I remember interviewing with them seven years ago, and this (100th episode) was certainly the goal, so I'm very pleased that <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> 100 episodes in a strong fashion. I think the show {{is in a very}} good place right now." [...] Steve Carell said he was especially pleased with the landmark because when the show began, people had doubts it would live up to the original series and were skeptical about its mockumentary style: [...] "It's sort of remarkable, especially with this show because I don't think anybody felt it would go past the pilot. ... I think most everyone was kind of dubious about our chances of pulling it off." [...] Likewise, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment and an Office executive producer, said, [...] "It's a thrill that <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> 100 episodes, and probably incredibly surprising looking back at the process it took. But the reality is, we believed in it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{nonlinear}} narrative involving Joan's storyline and Don's Jaguar pitch was [...] "a {{solution to}} how to tell the story" [...] according to Weiner. [...] "The ordering of those events really was a problem and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{a point where we}} can either show Don doing the pitch, or show Joan being with the guy, but we can't do them both," [...] he said, explaining that he felt [...] "if Don gives the pitch after [...] seen Joan do this, {{no one is going to}} listen to a word that he says. It doesn't matter how good it is. [...] not going to believe he could have won." ...|$|E
500|$|Hetrick {{felt that}} the move away from TNG gave Vash more independence, and she enjoyed the new {{relationship}} between Vash and Quark, calling them [...] "kindred spirits". [...] She was also pleased {{to be working with}} de Lancie again. [...] "I love the way they write for John, and I loved the stuff <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do together in 'Q-Less'", she said. Hetrick underwent ten hours of make-up for the sequence where Q shows Vash what could have happened if he did not save her life following an insect bite in the Gamma Quadrant. [...] The experience left her with a newfound appreciation for not having to wear prosthetics like other members of the cast.|$|E

500|$|... "Lift Up Your Face" [...] {{was written}} by Mac Powell; Third Day {{composed}} the music to [...] "Lift Up Your Face" [...] with Bo and Bear Rinehard of Needtobreathe. Third Day's bassist Tai Anderson recalls that [...] "We got together in their home studio and had a jam session that went with Mac's idea of a song {{based on the idea}} of 'lift up your head' from the Psalms... By working with another 'southern' rock band from South Carolina, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> show our Georgia roots musically with a [...] "gospel" [...] sound"; he further noted that [...] "the big message of the song is 'salvation is calling'". It was recorded at The Quarry in Kennesaw, Georgia and The Smokestack in Nashville, Tennessee.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{had already}} raved over the record because it leaked. I was like listen, {{there is no}} way this [...] be on your album, you'd have to be crazy. He was like 'Really, you think so?'

We can't treat this like mixtape throwaways like everybody else does. Everybody else does half-ass music. So what people don't know is that what Kanye did during that album is literally, I walked into the studio and I had the pick of 17 records and he was like {{do what you want to}} do to any of these, do what you like." ...|$|E
500|$|By 2004, Microsoft {{brought the}} team the Xbox 360 {{hardware}} and suggested moving {{the game to}} that system, with a release date {{in the spring of}} 2006. [...] By November 2004, the whole of Pacific City was in place, and cooperative mode was possible. [...] However, in January 2005 they switched to the Renderware 4 engine, which caused many problems and was considered a [...] "gross mistake" [...] by Wilson. [...] Microsoft was able to provide additional programmers to help during 2006 to correct the problems, just in time to create a demo for the 2006 E3 Convention. [...] Wilson admitted that when Crackdown was first unveiled, the team thought the game was too early to debut. [...] "By the time <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the end of pre-production we were woefully understaffed and over budget", Wilson commented.|$|E

500|$|Kevin Reed, {{a friend}} of the band, set up the drums and {{lighting}} when touring with the band. Reed's father, Lawrence R. Reed drew the Minotaur with a sword on the album's cover. Araya's younger brother, Johnny Araya, who was thirteen or fourteen at the time, was a roadie who set up the back line and sound. The band hardly made enough money to sustain themselves, only buying the [...] "essentials" [...] such as food, gas, and beer. Araya asserts, [...] "We basically used whatever money <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get from point A to point B. When we got back, Brian was like, 'So, where's the money?' And we were like, 'What money?' At that time, we didn't realize that you had to ask for money up front. I think he got a lot of money sent directly to him, and we were supposed to pick up the rest." ...|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{tried to}} work quickly and spontaneously, {{avoiding}} procrastination and over-analysis. Yorke was forced to write lyrics differently, as {{he did not have}} time to rewrite them in the studio; for some songs, he returned to the method of cutting up words and arranging them randomly he had employed for Kid A and Amnesiac. Greenwood said: [...] "We didn't really have time to be stressed about what we did. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of the second}} week before we even heard what we did on the first two days, and didn't even remember recording it or who was playing things. Which is a magical way of doing things." [...] The approach protected against the tension of previous sessions; O'Brien told Rolling Stone that Hail to the Thief was the first Radiohead album [...] "where, at the end of making it, we haven't wanted to kill each other." ...|$|E
500|$|The final {{segment is}} based on the Halloween cartoon It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. It could not be titled [...] "It's the Great Pumpkin, Milhouse" [...] to exactly match its namesake because of a [...] "big legal issue", {{according}} to Al Jean. However, the characters were redesigned to resemble the style of Peanuts, and they also obtained rights to use Vince Guaraldi's music. Jean said in 2011 that [...] "For years we {{had never been able to}} parody Charlie Brown's Halloween special, which is one of the all-time top three animated shows ever. The Vince Guaraldi music is such a huge part of it, so <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> clear it. It was just a dream come true to satirize it. I thought it was a really funny idea that instead of not ever seeing the Grand Pumpkin, it comes to life, and he's really horrified at the way humans cook pumpkins into pies, and eat pumpkin seeds, which are basically pumpkin fetuses...." ...|$|E

500|$|Mercury {{released}} the demo in 1989 as The Kentucky Headhunters' debut album, Pickin' on Nashville. The album produced four singles, {{all of which}} reached top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart. The first of these, the [...] "Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine" [...] cover, peaked at number 25 in December 1989. After it came [...] "Dumas Walker," [...] about a then-74-year-old marbles player who owned a liquor store that the band frequented. According to Doug, Mercury Records was initially reluctant to release the song as a single: [...] " [...] thought it was too regional, {{and that no one}} outside the area would get it, but what they didn't see, was the reaction <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> it every night that we played it in front of a crowd, and it didn't matter where we were playing either."

500|$|On November 16, 2009, {{the paper}} was {{abruptly}} shut down because of the financial status of its parent company, Window Media, and its majority shareholder, Avalon Equity Partners.

[...] Kevin Naff, editor of the Blade, said employees [...] "found out when two of the corporate officers were waiting for us when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> work this morning". [...] Since the Blade had been a profitable newspaper, and because the debt-ridden Window Media was no longer draining the publication's finances, the same day the Blade shut down, Naff told the Washington City Paper he and the remaining staffers [...] "We're all together. Our first meeting for our new venture is tomorrow morning." [...] Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton said the Blade had been a [...] "weekly must-read", and pledged support for a new publication to serve Washington's LGBT community.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} shot in Studio City, California on Stage 17 at CBS Studio Center. It was filmed on April 10, 11, and 13, 2006. The make-up effects used in Grace's dream and the scenes fifteen {{years into the future}} were done by Academy Award-winning make-up artists. Kohan and Mutchnick joined long-time {{director}} James Burrows on the set as filming began. The cast and crew tried to remain cheerful in front of the live audience between takes while the writers gathered in a room to rework lines for potentially larger laughs. However, [...] "there were a lot of snotty, tearful faces all around the set. When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the very, very last scene, everybody was just a mess. We started sobbing and hugging each other," [...] said Megan Mullally, who plays Karen. Eric McCormack, who portrays Will, commented that his saddest moment was [...] "the last time I stood in Will's kitchen. That was the most colorful position for me, standing there and stirring something. It was my pulpit, the place where I delivered my best jokes." ...|$|E
