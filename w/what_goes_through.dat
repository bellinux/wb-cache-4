50|$|While {{this has}} {{very little to do}} with modern psychology, Guido's {{philosophy}} of spiritelli was part of the guiding principles of Arabic medicine, considered very advanced at Dante's times. The merit of such philosophy in Cavalcanti's verse is its ability to describe <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> the poet's mind in a very detailed, personal manner, creating sensuous, autobiographic poetry. This is revolutionary compared to the rhetoric and academic-seeming manner of the Sicilian and Neo-Sicilian Schools that had preceded the Dolce Stil Novo and, perhaps, a sign of the changing times.|$|E
50|$|Nme2, {{one of the}} NDPK genes, {{has been}} {{associated}} with cardiovascular functions. Nme2 gene is known to form a complex with the beta subunit of the heterotrimetric G protein in heart cells and regulates the contractility of heart. There are two functions of Nme2 that allow for such regulation; one is the histidine kinase activity, which is the phosphorylation of the channels to regulate <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> and the other is a scaffold function of the formation of caveolae. The depletion of Nme2/caveolin interaction exhibited a decreased rate of cardiac contractility. Furthermore, more studies with zebra fish revealed that the NDPK depletion has a detrimental effect on heart functioning.|$|E

5000|$|Starting {{with the}} youngest, fear of surgery is {{extremely}} common among young children. Explained best by Christine Gorman in Kids and Surgery, “Surgery is scary enough for adults. But imagine <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> {{the mind of}} a three-year-old when he sees a doctor or nurse all suited up and wearing a surgical mask: “It’s a monster! It’s got big eyes and no mouth! It’s taking me away from Mommy and Daddy.” No wonder half of all children from ages of 2 to 10 show evidence of distress—from bed-wetting to nightmares—for at least two weeks after their operation. Some of them remain traumatized even six months later.” This statement shows that the fear that comes when young children go into surgery can be a serious matter because they are still traumatized by the effects for weeks after the surgery has taken place. Being scared of surgery has led to “eating disorders, sleep disturbances, regression to earlier levels of behavior, depression, and somatizations such as loss of voice after tonsillectomy.” [...] Many children see surgery as a form of punishment and, since they sometimes can’t see what they did “wrong”, the fear is escalated, leaving greater chance for a longer effect on the psychological and emotional feelings of the child. Many ways have been tried to help children overcome this fear, including their parents and doctors simply telling them that the surgery won’t hurt, or sedatives given by the doctor to minimize the feelings of anxiety later. There are certain types of treatments that have been proven to be better methods than others. Some hospitals allow parents to come into the surgery room and stay with the child, calming them until the anesthetic has taken effect. This is noted to keep anxiety down for both the parent and the child.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{promotes}} {{a reflection on}} the relationship between daily practices and consumption. Understanding how conflicts, resistance and consensus are generated from daily consumption practices opens up possibilities for reflecting on the construction of sustainability in the context of diversity, one of the landmarks of the globalized world. Within this socio-cultural context, the central issue is: can consumption generate citizenship practices? The concepts of subject and agent help one think about collective action and subjectivation processes and their interferences on the collective consuming behavior. Based on empirical data from a research carried out in the municipality of Estrela in 2007, in the Taquari Valley - Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) on local reality consumption practices, it was possible to conclude that various reasoning mechanisms and values underlie the daily consumption practices. Citizenship construction, based on consumption practices, depends on the subject's reflection capacity on his/her daily practices or on <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> the circulation of environmental information based on sociability spaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{criminal}} justice system prides itself on being proactive by using preventive law enforcement techniques {{while at the same}} time protecting society by removing those who attempt to or actually do break the law. A problem this system faces is what happens to offenders after they come out of prison? Are these offenders reformed into proper functioning members of society? These questions are important to jurors when they consider the guilt or innocence of an alleged offender. Research has shown that outside forces act upon not only the memory of jurors but also their decision making process during the trial and deliberation. Many trials end in hung juries or wrongly convicted offenders. <b>What</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> the juror members ’ mind while he or she sits in the jury room discussing the case?

Finally, the question posed in this study, are White offenders more likely to be socially accepted back into society as compared to their counterpart Black offender, when both offenders commit the same crime.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Todays {{job market}} is {{extremely}} competitive. Having the basic job qualifications {{for a specific}} opening usually {{is not enough to}} gain a position. Getting a job can be as lucky as being {{in the right place at}} the right time, or as simple as who you know. For those who do not have the luck to be in the right place, and have not had the opportunity to know the right person; finding a job is both difficult and frustrating. The collegiate coaching profession is no different in that aspect. <b>What</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> a collegiate athletic directors mind when they choose the person to build or maintain a program? That is the question every aspiring coach wants answered. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to help people earn jobs in the collegiate coaching profession by determining what collegiate athletic directors deem the most important qualities of candidates. SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study provided useful information to aspiring collegiate athletics coaches in their search for employment in the coaching profession. METHOD: Two hundred one college athletic directors were chosen randomly. There were eighty-two chosen from NCAA Divisions I, fifty-one from NCAA Division II, and sixty-eight from NCAA Division III. The instrument was a survey questionnaire with twenty-five common factors in hiring coaches. They were asked to rank the top fifteen factors from one to fifteen with one being the most important and fifteen the least important of the ranked factors. Additional comments were encouraged. A cover letter that explained the purpose and benefits of the study accompanied the survey. The data were evaluated by adding the numbers of a given factor. The lowest number determined the most important factor, on average. Any strong or recurring comments were examined. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. A. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{school is}} the setting of an {{encounter}} with the tradition {{through the medium of}} the teacher, who builds the conditions of possibility for the meeting with the other and the opportunity for the subject to give a foundation in his desire through the relationship with knowledge. The incidence of unconscious processes and their interference in the structuring of subjectivity requires the analysis of <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> the space of the educational relationship, because it generates essential needs, as well as ambivalent and disorganized pressures by individuals and institutions involved. Hence the idea of a psychoanalytic study of mental training in the relationship between subjects and between subjects and objects of knowledge. The main objective of this paper is the development of a model of teacher training in psychoanalytic approach, as a proposal of a professional qualification in relational terms, and not just in technical-disciplinary terms. In the postmodern school teachers face different issues, primarily the issue of access to knowledge in the sense of search of something of self that passes through the exploration and reading the other’s world. During the operation we will attempt to answer some questions: what is education and how can we know if it succeeded or failed? Where do the desire and the need to train, and to be trained in work practices and educational processes of teaching / learning lie? In the school of knowledge and skills is there place for self-care, and for care of others? What is the meaning we give to the study? Education enriches us and drains us? How teachers bring into play their desire, their passion for knowledge? This is to define those protective factors so that young people come looking for their peculiarities and not drifting towards the pre-approval standards, resulting in loss of subjectivity...|$|E
40|$|When {{you hear}} the word "{{homeless}} " what comes to your mind? When you see {{out of the side}} of your eye a person holding a sign asking for money, <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> your mind? Do you wonder if the homeless person is an addict or even crazy? Do you wonder if the person holding the sign is a scammer trying to prey on people's sympathy? Or do you feel compassion, but just are not sure how to help? These are all questions I have at one time or another thought. And while it is good to question what you see, I also think it is good to take the time to learn about what you are seeing and do something to help. It may be true that some people are homeless due to poor choices or that some people try to scam others. But if you think about it, how humbling it is to hold a sign and ask strangers for help, you will find yourself giving that homeless person the benefit of the doubt. Now take this thought a step further and put yourself in the place of a homeless person. A homeless person is just like you and me- they just don't have a roof over their head. According to the last biennial survey released by the Champaign County Continuum of Care for January 2013, there were 214 homeless people in Champaign County. The number has gone down from 549 homeless in January of 2011. But these numbers are just estimates that depend on the openness of the individuals asked. Plus the term homeless can cover a broad spectrum of individuals- from those with no shelter at all to those who stay on a friend’s couch. Another factor taken into account is how long the person has been homeless. A person is deemed chronically homeless if they have been homeless for over a year or been homeless four or more times in three years and have a disabling condition...|$|E
