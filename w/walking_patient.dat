30|$|The {{documented}} {{significant changes}} in laxity in the coronal plane have to {{be compared with the}} patient reported outcome score, to identify whether they have any clinical relevance. Patients experience walking with a deformed leg, whether valgus or varus, often as an instability in <b>walking.</b> <b>Patient</b> reported outcome measures after the medial CWHTO showed significant less knee instability and knee instability-related problems 6 [*]months after the surgery that corrected their leg to neutral as measured with the Lysholm scoring tool. The VAS instability score, solely developed to assess the patients subjective stability feeling of the knee, also improved postoperative however, did not reach significance. Due to our short follow up time (6 [*]months) no comparisons can be made with previous studies (Coventry 1987, Shoji and Insall 1973, Chambat et al. 2000, Van Egmond et al. 2017) that reported on outcome after an medial CWHTO. Furthermore, no long-term conclusions can be drawn based on our outcome scores. However, the  findings do support our hypothesis that patients do not experience a disadvantage of the increase in laxity of the MCL. In our department as yet unpublished data among 113 comparable patients showed a 77 % satisfaction after a medial CWHTO with a mean follow up of four years (van Lieshout WAM et al. n.d.).|$|E
40|$|Metatarsus adductus is a {{deformity}} {{located at}} Lisfranc’s joint in a pure transverse plane. It is spontaneously corrected {{for the majority}} of newborns. In rare toddler cases, it demonstrates a clinical stiffness and results in Z-shaped foot, where valgus of the heel creates equilibration of resistant metatarsus adductus. Although, recurrent metatarsus adductus varus is observed in treated idiopathic clubfeet, usually in children over three years, but presence of heel's valgus is related to the surgical overcorrection of the heel’s varus. Conservative treatment is advocated in flexible metatarsus adductus. Surgery is performed after conservative treatment fail, and in <b>walking</b> <b>patient.</b> Soft tissue releases, osteotomies of metatarsals and lateral epiphysiodesis of the metatarsal base gave good results on short term, but deformity recurrence and foot growth disturbance couldn't be avoided. Although, osteotomies carried out proximal to the Lisfranc's joint: opening wedge osteotomy of medial cuneiform, calcaneocuboid fusion and the anterior resection of calcaneus, gave permanent correction, but they act only on one of the sides of deformity. Therfore, the theory of elongated lateral column associated with a shortened medial column is crucial in dealing with this deformity: combining opening wedge osteotomy of cuneiform with closing wedge osteotomy of cuboid described by Jawish et al. in children after 4 years allows in all causes of metatarsus adductus stiffness a lateral shifting of forefoot. Concerning the associated heel’s valgus, it is corrected in Z-shaped foot after the double osteotomy cuneiform/ cuboid. However, in complicated treated clubfoot a particular treatment for the posterior tarsal is necessary...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the need for}} {{physical}} activity interventions is investigated in a general adult population, the characteristics of physical activity referral (PAR) scheme recipients and referral practitioners, {{and the effectiveness of}} PAR in a routine primary health-care (PHC) setting in the county of Östergötland, Sweden. The thesis consists of four papers: three papers are based on a quantitative, uncontrolled prospective PAR study and one paper is based on a population survey in the county of Östergötland, Sweden. In 2006, only one in four of the adult population, aged 18 – 84 years, in Östergötland was considered sufficiently active to meet the Swedish national public health recommendations, stated as “ 30 minutes of moderate physical activity a day”. More than one-third (37 %) reported that they hade no intentions to change their physical activity levels, while 36 % had thought about change, and 27 % were determined to change. Although the individuals felt a large responsibility for their own physical activity, they also believed that this responsibility is partly shared by health-care providers. Among those who wanted to increase their physical activity level, almost one in seven of the total population and one in four among those reporting poor general health, with a BMI over 30 and those who were inactive reported that they wanted support to bring about this change. More than half of them wanted this support from their health-care provider. During 2004 and 2005, a total of 6300 patients received PARs as part of the Östergötland PAR scheme. Two-thirds of the patients were female and half of the patients were 45 – 64 years old. The PAR scheme reached a relatively high proportion of physically inactive people. PARrelated statistics, including the numbers of referrals made at individual PHC centres and by different professional categories, showed large differences in prescribing activities, both by patient categories, and by prescribing professionals, indicating great potential for further improvements of this scheme in the future. Half of the patients (51 %) who received PARs were recommended home-based activities, such as <b>walking.</b> <b>Patient</b> follow-up showed that an increase in self-reported physical activity level was achieved by 52 % of the patients at the 12 -month follow-up. The proportion of inactive patients decreased from 33 % at baseline to 20 % at 12 months. The proportion of patients who were physically active on a regular basis increased from 22 % at baseline to 32 % at 12 months. Neither patient age, diagnosis/PAR reason nor the profession of the prescriber were associated with differences in effectiveness. Low activity levels at baseline and homebased activities were significantly associated with increased physical activity at 12 months. Half of the patients (50 %) achieved adherence to PARs at the 12 -month follow-up, with adherence assessed by simply asking the patients about their adherence to prescribed activity. Patients’ activity levels at baseline (being at least somewhat physically active) and being issued home-based activities were significantly associated with higher adherence at 12 months...|$|E

30|$|It {{has been}} shown that the neck shaft angle (NSA) {{increases}} over time after a VDRO. Therefore, some authors suggest that children with higher GMFCS levels may require a higher amount of varisation with extensive soft-tissue release to maintain hip stability, accepting the possible higher risk of avascular necrosis (AVN) [15, 16]. Regarding the amount of VDRO, no consensus exists on how much correction of the proximal femur should be executed. One of the rare recommendations by Miller et al. [15] suggests a correction to a post-operative NSA down to 100 ° in non-walking patients and 120 ° in <b>walking</b> <b>patients,</b> mostly in conjunction with an extensive release of the adductors.|$|R

40|$|Intermittent Claudication [1] is {{a walking}} symptom. After {{a short time}} <b>walking,</b> <b>patients</b> suffer from pains at lower limbs.

Methods Ten consecutive patients participated, three of whom had strict bed rest, three were allowed to walk around and four performed strenuous single arm exercise by lifting a 7. 5 -kg weight. [18 F]Methylcholine uptake was measured in the biceps and gluteus muscles on both sides. Results Strenuous exercise resulted in a 202 % increase in [18 F]methylcholine uptake in the activated biceps muscle {{as well as a}} 112 % increase in muscle groups used to retain body position.

40|$|Introduction. Walking is of high {{priority}} {{for people with}} multiple sclerosis (PwMS). It remains unclear whether aerobic exercise can improve walking ability and upregulate neurotrophins. This review aims to consolidate evidence to develop optimal aerobic training parameters to enhance walking outcomes and neuroplasticity in PwMS. Methods. Clinical studies examining aerobic exercise for ≥ 3 weeks, having outcomes on walking with or without neurotrophic markers, were included. Studies utilizing animal models of MS were included if they employed aerobic exercise with outcomes on neurological recovery and neurotrophins. From a total of 1783 articles, 12 clinical and 5 animal studies were included. Results. Eleven clinical studies reported improvements in walking ability. Only two clinical studies evaluated both walking and neurotrophins, and neither found an increase in neurotrophins despite improvements in <b>walking.</b> <b>Patients</b> with significant <b>walking</b> impairments were underrepresented. Long-term follow-up revealed mixed results. Two animal studies reported a positive change in both neurological recovery and neurotrophins. Conclusion.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the spatio-temporal and joint {{kinematic}} gait parameters of stroke <b>patients</b> <b>walking</b> on a treadmill and overground, to examine the assumption that <b>patients</b> <b>walking</b> on a treadmill will approximate the requirements of walking overground. Methods. Ten independently ambulant chronic stroke patients were included in the study. Vicon™ was used to collect spatio-temporal and joint kinematic data during overground walking at comfortable speed and at matched speed on the treadmill. Results. Walking on the treadmill demonstrated statistically significantly lower cadence, and longer step times of the non-hemiplegic and hemiplegic limbs. Absolute stance times of both limbs, absolute double support time, relative stance time and relative double support time were significantly longer during treadmill walking. Compared to overground walking, the inter-limb symmetries of step time, stance time, and stance/swing time ratio were significantly greater on the treadmill. During treadmill walking, joint kinematic data showed statistically significant changes with greater flexion of the nonhemiplegic knee and hip at initial contact, and less hip extension of the hemiplegic limb. Maximal ankle plantarflexion and knee extension of the hemiplegic limb occurred later in the gait cycle on the treadmill. Conclusion. These differences suggest it may be useful to use treadmill in conjunction with overground walking to focus on improving specific <b>walking</b> deficits in <b>patients</b> with strok...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Dalfampridine {{extended}} release (ER) 10 mg is an oral tablet {{form of the}} potassium (K +) channel-blocking compounded dalfampridine, {{also known}} as fampridine, and chemically 4 -aminopyridine or 4 -AP, which received regulatory approval in the United States {{for the treatment of}} <b>walking</b> in <b>patients</b> with multiple sclerosis (MS) in January 2010. Two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated significant improvements in <b>walking</b> in <b>patients</b> with the four primary forms of MS following administration of dalfampridine ER tablets 10 mg twice daily. The drug is thought to act by restoring conduction in focally demyelinated axons and by enhancing neurotransmission, thereby leading to improved neurological function. This review describes how dalfampridine represents a new pharmacotherapeutic approach to the clinical management of mobility impairment. It describes the mechanism of action and chemistry of dalfampridine ER, its pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and side effects, and the outcomes of multicenter trials showing its efficacy in improving walking speed. Clinician and patient global assessments, as well as patient self-assessment of the impact of MS on their gait disability, confirm clinically relevant benefit from the therapy. Patients tolerate the drug well and their improvement in terms of household and community ambulation, inferred from analysis of pooled data from several studies, is likely to translate into benefits in the performance of instrumental activities of daily living and a reduction in the neuropsychiatric burden of disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to identify factors likely to elevate the incidence of walking dependence upon discharge of elderly patients from a hospital where they received treatment of acute internal disease. The study involved 68 patients aged 65 　and over who had been able to walk unassisted before hospitalization. 　These patients were divided into the groups of <b>walking</b> dependence (<b>patients</b> unable to walk) and the groups of <b>walking</b> independence (<b>patients</b> able to walk unassisted) at the discharge period. The author analyzed using a model of multiple logistic regression analysis with a category framework involving 10 variables. 　Results were as follows : 1) The author picked out 4 factors, i. e. "period of bedredden status", "period of symptoms", "period of hospital stay" and "period of physical immobilization". 2) It shown that the risk of walking dependence became higher as the period of each of these variables increased by another day. 3) Using this analysis, the author could suppose the walking dependence at discharge period in 54 % of the patients. It is therefore desirable that patients at elevated risk for walking dependence are identified by evaluation of these four factors and to provide active support to these patients so as to shorten the period of these four factors as soon as possible during the hospital stay. 本研究の目的は、内科の急性疾患で入院した高齢患者の退院時の歩行能力低下にどのような要因が関与しているかを後ろ向き調査から検討した。対象は、入院前、自ら歩行可能であった６５歳以上の患者６８名である。退院時に自立した歩行が不可の患者を歩行能力低下群、自立した歩行が可能の患者を歩行自立群とした。要因の検討には、１０変数からなる概念枠組みから多重ロジスティック回帰分析を用いモデル化した。結果、１）「ベッド上生活日数」、「症状持続日数」、「在院日数」、「身体拘束日数」の４因子が抽出された。２）各変数の日数が１日増すごとに危険率が高まることが示された。３）４つの要因の検討から、退院時に歩行能力を低下させる高齢患者の５４％を予測できることが説明された。以上を通して退院時に歩行能力低下をさせないためには、４つの要因からリスクの高い患者を予測し、早期にこれらの日数を減らす援助を入院時より意図的に実践することが必要であると示唆された...|$|R
