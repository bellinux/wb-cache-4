The entryway, which resembles a Roman triumphal arch, is decorated with the initials of Gilles Berthelot and his wife, while the pediments overhanging each <b>window</b> <b>bay</b> are carved with the salamander and ermine of Francis I and his wife, Claude of France, in honour to the monarch of the time.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time the Panorama was offered on all chassis types, {{including}} Ford R226 and Bedford VAL, looking particularly well-suited to the latter, where the chrome trim on the first <b>window</b> <b>bay</b> harmonised with the twin steering axles below. There was even a Panorama for the Bedford SB and Ford Thames 570E, although here the thickened window pillar was absent, and the chrome trim did not extend across the front of the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The {{frontispiece}} is {{flanked by}} two bell-towers, will corner pilasters and sectioned into three registers. The first register includes bay window and pediment; the second a clock; and the third register occupied by the bells. These towers are crowned by bulbous vaulted-ceiling. The church porch is open to a segmented arch topped by large <b>window</b> <b>bay,</b> with monumental shoulders bound by pediment and interrupted by a royal coat-of-arms.

2500|$|Described as a [...] "humble but {{beautiful}} village church", {{in terms}} of design Saint George's is a simple single-nave church which follows the typical single-nave design employed by the Slavine School. It has two gates, one {{from the south and}} one from the west, and nine relatively large windows which let a lot of light into the interior. The windows are of the more basic design used by Slavine School architects, with a simple sharp-pointed <b>window</b> <b>bay,</b> as opposed to a more complex (and also sharp-pointed) one. Such windows can be typically found on churches in poorer villages within the range of Slavine School activity. Their simplistic appearance is attributed to the limited financial resources of the congregation. The gates are also of a basic yet typical design.|$|E
2500|$|The Plaxton coach range which {{appeared}} at the 1964 Commercial Motor Show had been extensively revised with assistance from the Ogle design consultancy. Waistrails were virtually straight, and rooflines distinctly shallower. On the new Panorama (later to become Panorama I), a wide chrome trim band wrapped around the front and encompassed the first <b>window</b> <b>bay</b> on either side. The trim then swept upwards to the roof line and neatly terminated on the air scoop at the roof line. The window pillar on the first bay was noticeably thicker than the others and {{gave the impression of}} size that managed to enhance the appearance of the whole vehicle. The front grill was revised and basically split in two horizontally. Twin headlights were on each side of a panel that contained ventilation louvres at the top with the lower part being the actual grill that spanned the width of the vehicle. This grill was to become standard with little change until the Supreme IV of 1978. Again a bit of a Plaxton that was instantly recognisable and a familiar sight throughout Britain. The rear featured two large 9" [...] circular rear lights each side arranged vertically, and the entrance door was now the forward in-swinging type.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} grand {{entrance to}} the building is accentuated by the chamfered corner of the building’s southwest façade. The effect of the chamfered corner is enhanced by careful placement of three <b>window</b> <b>bays.</b> The three rows of windows outline the chamfered corner with one bay in the center nestled between two remaining <b>window</b> <b>bays.</b> Two grand Ionic order pilasters made of red brick and topped with terra cotta capitals with decorative volutes separate and enrich the corner <b>window</b> <b>bays.</b> On the chamfered corner, a name stone reading “Howes” sits between the windows on {{the third and fourth}} level and a date stone reading “A.D. 1900” sits atop the fourth story window, just under the roof cornice.|$|R

The first is an office section, which protrudes from the main body. Like {{the main part of}} the building it is six stories, but is topped by a clock tower. The other three sections were originally labelled D, E, and F, and extend eastward from the office. Section D is 33 <b>window</b> <b>bays,</b> E is 42, and F 45 <b>window</b> <b>bays</b> in length. There are three stairwell towers that interrupt the pier-and-spandrel construction of the length of the building on its south (street-facing) elevation. These stairhouses are where entry is gained to the premises, through doorways recessed under arches.
