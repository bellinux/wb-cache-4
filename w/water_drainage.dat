5|$|Horticulturists and {{scientists}} Rodger Elliot and David L. Jones {{have proposed that}} cultivating the plant would aid in its conservation. Cultivating the plant would most likely require good <b>water</b> <b>drainage,</b> a sunny or part-shaded position and acidic soil. P.terminalis is hardy to heavy frosts, {{and is expected to}} fare better in a temperate rather than subtropical garden climate. Propagation would theoretically be by seed or by taking cuttings of new growth, though plants of the genus Persoonia as a genus are generally difficult to propagate by any means in cultivation.|$|E

Kohala's bogs are characterized by sedges, mosses of the genus Sphagnum, and oha wai, native members of the bellflower family. Other habitats include rain forest and mesophytic (wet) forests.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} in Shanghai flooded 84city streets; in some locations insufficient <b>water</b> <b>drainage</b> left {{homes and}} apartments flooded, {{with a total}} of 20,000houses reporting flooding. The flooding also closed the city subway system for a few hours. Strong winds downed 2,700 trees and 400 power lines in the city. The typhoon damaged a construction site in the city, leaving three injured and one person killed. Throughout the city an estimated 15,000houses were destroyed. Additionally, four people were electrocuted {{as a result of the}} flooding. In Shanghai alone, damage totaled $1.33billion (2005CNY, $164.5million 2005USD); seven people died in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{contracted}} {{period for}} construction was {{planned to be}} around two years, but the timescale was lengthened by nearly 25% due to rainfall that persisted {{throughout much of the}} early construction period. The heavy rainfall in late 1956 had profound effects on the heavy engineering works required to construct the road foundation, resulting in this aspect of work being postponed until early 1957; an extension of five months was granted due to the extraordinary and unforeseen weather conditions.

5|$|The {{geographic}} and geomorphic characteristics of Argentina tend to create extreme weather conditions, often leading to natural disasters that negatively impact the country both economically and socially. The Pampas, {{where many of}} the large cities are located, has a flat topography and poor <b>water</b> <b>drainage,</b> making it vulnerable to flooding. Severe storms can lead to tornados, damaging hail, storm surges, and high winds, causing extensive damage to houses and infrastructure, displacing thousands of people and causing significant loss of life. Extreme temperature events such as heat waves and cold waves impact rural and urban areas by negatively impacting agriculture, one of the main economic activities of the country, and by increasing energy demand, which can lead to energy shortages.|$|E

40|$|Long term <b>drainage</b> <b>water</b> {{salinity}} of pipe drains {{is modeled}} with the advection-dispersion equation for the zone above drain level and stream functions for the zone below drain level. Steady-state water flow is assumed. The model {{is applied to}} two experimental pipe drainage sites in Haryana State, India. Calculations are conducted for different values of leaching fraction and drain spacing. On average, comparison between measured and predicted <b>drainage</b> <b>water</b> salinity is satisfactory for both the Sampla site and the Hisar site. Calculations show that it may take 15 - 50 years before <b>drainage</b> <b>water</b> salinity has reduced to equilibrium levels. Leaching fraction has considerable influence on the <b>drainage</b> <b>water</b> salinity.

40|$|Objective: To {{demonstrate}} the technical feasibility of the reuse of agricultural <b>drainage</b> <b>water</b> for irrigation. Methods: The agricultural <b>drainage</b> <b>water</b> near Banjar El-Sokar, Borg El-Arab City, Alexandria, Egypt was collected. The measured heavy metals in the <b>drainage</b> <b>water</b> {{were compared with}} the permissible levels stated in environmental regulations, Law No. 48 of 1982 concerning {{the protection of the}} Nile River and waterways from pollution. Results: Heavy metals and trace elements were detected in this agricultural <b>drainage</b> <b>water</b> as following: Al (1. 64 mg/L), Ca (175. 00 mg/L), Cd (1. 87 mg/L), Co (2. 23 mg/L), Cu (1. 71 mg/L), Fe (1. 64 mg/L), K (20. 50 mg/L), and Pb (2. 81 mg/L).

5|$|Argentina's geomorphic {{characteristics}} {{make the}} country highly vulnerable to floods. These floods can damage infrastructure, cause loss of life, {{increase the risk of}} diseases, and negatively impact agricultural productivity, {{which is one of the}} main economic activities of the country. Many of the large Argentinean cities and agriculturally productive areas lie near rivers. The plains are at highest risk for flooding, particularly in the northeastern and central parts of the country, including Greater Buenos Aires. This is because these plains, which cover 35% of the land area in the country (including the Chaco and Pampean areas), are characterized by a flat landscape, which can impede proper <b>water</b> <b>drainage.</b> Both the Parana and Paraguay basins have a flat landscape and are thus highly susceptible to flooding due to river overflows following high rainfall. These floods can last for months, particularly in the Parana River, owing to its large basin. In the most extreme case, during the year 1982–1983, the floods in the Parana River persisted for more than a year, negatively impacting the area both socially and economically. Major flooding events in the Parana River include those of 1992 and 1997 and have been more frequent since the 1980s due to higher precipitation trends. Similarly, in Buenos Aires Province, flooding occurs due to river overflows and poor water drainage; major flooding events in the province occurred in 1987, 2002/2003, 2012 and in 2014, causing damage to agriculture production. Most of the flooding events occur in El Niño years owing to higher rainfall. Flooding can also affect Patagonia and urban centers in the northwest, but the number of people affected and economic losses are lower than those in the Pampas owing to lower population densities. Flooding can jeopardize access to safe water. A leptospirosis outbreak occurred following a flood in 1998.|$|E

40|$|<b>Drainage</b> <b>water</b> from an {{abandoned}} galena mine {{is currently being}} used for livestock, a fish hatchery and irrigation of agricultural crops in Payson, Utah. The <b>drainage</b> <b>water</b> also feeds a losing stream very near to springs that are used for drinking water for local residences. The <b>drainage</b> <b>water</b> flows year round and could potentially be contaminating {{a large body of}} groundwater and surface water. The goal of this research was to determine whether the mine <b>drainage</b> <b>water</b> has levels of lead, copper and silver exceeding the State of Utah Groundwater Standards, which are 0. 015 mg/L for lead, 0. 1 mg/L for silver and 1. 3 mg/L for copper. Water samples were collected from 15 locations, including the mine, a pipeline fed by the <b>drainage</b> <b>water,</b> and the losing stream fed by the <b>drainage</b> <b>water.</b> All sample bottles were rinsed with nitric acid to prevent contamination from the bottle. Sample bottles for lead analysis included an acid preservative agent to prevent adsorption of lead onto the bottle. All samples were analyzed using the Hach DR- 2700 Spectrophotometer. No samples had silver or copper levels exceeding Utah standards. However, six out of 15 samples exceeded the Utah standard for lead with average lead concentration Pb = 0. 033 mg/L. The maximum lead concentration, found in water flowing over the mine tailings, was Pb = 0. 148 mg/L, nearly ten times the Utah standard.

The chemistry of the <b>drainage</b> <b>water</b> was analyzed by measuring pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and electric conductivity on site as well as by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and ion chromatog-raphy. As the drainage flowed downstream, the pH decreased rapidly from 7. 05 to 3. 26 and then increased slowly to 3. 50. In a section where the pH increased, ocherous precipitates occur on a <b>drainage</b> <b>water</b> channel. We determined Sb levels in the <b>drainage</b> <b>water,</b> and the distribution of Sb in the mineral phases of waste rocks and precipitates was estimated by means of a sequential extraction procedure.
