5|$|Following the 2010 General Election the new {{government}} scrapped the database {{as one of their}} measures 'to reverse the substantial erosion of civil liberties under the Labour Government and roll back state intrusion.'

5|$|A {{building}} {{close to}} the western border of the Žirmūnai elderate, an example of Socialist historicism built soon {{after the end of}} World War II, was the home of the Tėvynė ("Motherland") Cinema until the early 1990s; it has been hosting the New York musical theatre and club since 2004. It is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> building will be demolished to make way for underground parking lots or saved by virtue of its inclusion into the Registry of Cultural Values.|$|E
5|$|A key {{distinction}} between the bills of rights of the Commonwealth jurisdictions referred to above and the Singapore Constitution {{is that in the}} latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in a democratic society. One may query <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E
5|$|A phylogenetic study {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, published by Björn Stelbrink and colleagues in 2010, {{reported that the}} sister species of the Pacific angelshark is the sand devil (S. dumeril) of the western North Atlantic. The two species are estimated to have diverged approximately 6.1 Ma, close to when the Isthmus of Panama first began to form. The authors also found that Pacific angelsharks from the Gulf of California differed genetically from those elsewhere, though they were equivocal as to <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> represented a species-level distinction.|$|E

5|$|An extinct {{relative}} of the fossa was described in 1902 from subfossil remains and recognized as a separate species, Cryptoprocta spelea, in 1935. This species was larger than the living fossa (with a body mass estimate roughly twice as great), but otherwise similar. Across Madagascar, people distinguish two kinds of fossa—a large fosa mainty ("black fossa") and the smaller fosa mena ("reddish fossa")—and a white form {{has been reported in}} the southwest. It is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> is purely folklore or individual variation—related to sex, age or instances of melanism and leucism—or whether there is indeed more than one species of living fossa.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} during his campaigns in Thessaly, Philip {{captured}} the strategic port of Pagasae, which was in effect the port of Pherae. It is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> was during {{the first or second}} campaign; both Buckler and Cawkwell suggest that it took place in the second campaign, before the Battle of Crocus Field. By taking Pagasae, it is possible that Philip prevented Pherae from being reinforced by sea during his second campaign. Buckler suggests that Philip had learnt his lesson from the previous campaign, and intended to cut Pherae off from outside help before attacking it.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} King Poniatowski decided {{to sue for}} peace, the Polish army was still in good {{fighting}} condition, not suffering from any major defeat nor from lack of supplies. King Poniatowski thought that due to Russian numerical superiority defeat was nonetheless imminent, and more could be gained through negotiations with the Russians, with whom he hoped a new alliance could be formed. Although subsequent events would prove him wrong, the question of <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> could have been foreseen, and prevented through continued military resistance, has been subject to much debate among historians.|$|E

5|$|Burkard von Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann for {{the last}} time at around 08:00 on the command bridge just prior to the final battle. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg {{described}} the normally intelligent, humorous and optimistic Lindemann now as pessimistic and withdrawn. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg tried to talk to him and was ignored, and later wondered <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> was due to combat fatigue or whether the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down.|$|E
5|$|Caribbean sponges of {{the genus}} Aplysina suffer from Aplysina red band syndrome. This causes Aplysina to develop one or more rust-colored bands, {{sometimes}} with adjacent bands of necrotic tissue. These lesions may completely encircle branches of the sponge. The disease appears to be contagious and impacts approximately 10 percent of A. cauliformis on Bahamian reefs. The rust-colored bands are caused by a cyanobacterium, but it is unknown <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> organism actually causes the disease.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{forms of}} human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA)especially B46, DR9, DQB1*0303, A2, Bw22, AW19, B17, and DRW8are more common in TPP. Linkage to particular forms of HLA, which plays {{a central role in}} the immune response, might imply an immune system cause, but it is uncertain <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> directly causes TPP or whether it increases the susceptibility to Graves' disease, a known autoimmune disease.|$|E

5|$|Customers {{with their}} own {{installations}} include the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The station also reads and distributes data from the Japanese Hinode solar research satellite. The facility has seen a large increase in smaller customers after 2004, when the Svalbard Undersea Cable System started providing a fiber Internet connection. Concessions for downloading are only issued to civilian satellites, yet some data has been indirectly used by armed forces. There is a disagreement as to <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> constitutes a breach of the Svalbard Treaty.|$|E
5|$|If that is so, {{it is not}} unthinkable that {{circumstances}} could arise {{where the}} courts may have to qualify a principle established on a different hypothesis of constitutionalism.
