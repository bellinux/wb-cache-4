40|$|December 2004. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 18) As {{part of a}} field operational test, 96 {{drivers were}} lent instrumented vehicles for approximately 26 days. During this time, a variety of measures regarding vehicle use were recorded, including <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> use, wiper setting adjustments, and headway time margin to preceding vehicles. <b>Windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> activity was examined in detail {{in order to provide}} data regarding the naturalistic use of <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> systems. The results have implications for the design and durability of <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers,</b> <b>wiper</b> motors, <b>windshields,</b> and glazing treatments (such as hydrophobic coatings). Overall, <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers</b> were used 8. 6 % of the time the vehicles were being operated. Across all conditions, the slowest intermittent setting was the most frequently used—whereas the fastest continuous setting was used the least. When ambient lighting diminished, a shift towards higher wiper speeds was observed. Average headway time margin and range increased, and speed decreased, when <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers</b> were engaged. Middle-aged drivers used wipers more often than either their younger or older counterparts. Finally, older females used their wipers the least amongst female drivers, while male drivers used wipers fairly uniformly across age groups...|$|R
5000|$|Windshield Wiper/360 Windshield Wiper: The rider spins a tailwhip and, {{while still}} in the air, spins another tailwhip back the other way. Matt Sparks was the first rider {{to do it on}} a BMX bike in 2006, calling it a <b>Windshield</b> <b>Wiper.</b> A 360 <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> is when the rider spins a 360 degree {{rotation}} while doing a <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> at the same time. James foster did it in 2008 at the Jomopro contest in Joplin, MO. Foster also landed it in the fifth Cameron White Annual Dirt Jam. The trick has also been pulled by Kyle Baldock, Alessandro Barbero, among others. Baldock landed a 360 <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> to late tailwhip at the 2011 Salt Lake City Dew Tour. At the Dew Tour in Orlando, FL in 2009, T.J. Ellis pulled the world's first <b>Windshield</b> <b>Wiper</b> Backflip.|$|R
25|$|The <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> is a bladed device used to wipe {{rain and}} dirt from a windshield. In 1903, Mary Anderson is {{credited}} with inventing the first operational <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper.</b> In Anderson's patent, she called her invention a window cleaning device for electric cars and other vehicles. Operated via a lever from inside a vehicle, her version of <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers</b> closely resembles the <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> found on many early car models. Anderson had a model of her design manufactured. She then filed a patent (U.S. patent number 743,801) on June 18, 1903 that was issued to her by the U.S. Patent Office on November 10, 1903.|$|R
