5|$|Jones was {{not alone}} in his wish to get more screen time; the writers, who were reading Internet forums and {{receiving}} mail from the audience that requested the same thing, decided that Pete would learn Clark's secret in season two. The creative team hoped that knowing Clark's secret would allow the character to be written into more scenes, and become involved on a daily basis with the Kent family. Ultimately, Pete's primary story arc in season three became the character's inability to deal with knowing Clark's secret, and his growing feeling of abandonment from Clark, who was spending more time with Chloe, Lana and Lex. Millar explains that they felt that the character was being wasted on Smallville, and that led to the decision of writing the character off the show with the hope that he could come back in future episodes. There was dissension between the cast and crew over Jones's departure. According to Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent), Clark needs a guy friend in his life, and she feels that the Kents would have taken Pete in when his parents left Smallville. Though Gough does not disagree that writing out Pete Ross <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing,</b> he does feel that his exit could have gone better. According to Gough, Pete's departure felt rushed, and seemed to lack the importance that it should have had.|$|E

500|$|Efforts at {{improvement}} {{before the}} bombing had in some respects made matters worse, cutting off the area north of the Arndale Centre– the exterior of which was widely unloved– {{from the rest of}} the city centre. A large building nearby, now redeveloped as The Printworks and formerly occupied by the Daily Mirror newspaper, had been unoccupied since 1987. Many locals therefore considered that [...] "the bomb <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> that ever happened to Manchester", as it cleared the way for redevelopment of the dysfunctional city centre, a view also expressed in 2007 by Terry Rooney, MP for Bradford North. The leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Manchester City Council, Simon Ashley, responded that [...] "I take exception to his [...] comments about the IRA bomb. No one who was in the city on that day, who lost their jobs or was scared witless or injured by the blast, would say the bomb <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> to happen to Manchester". [...] Sir Gerald Kaufman, MP for Manchester Gorton, stated that the bomb provided the opportunity for redeveloping Manchester city centre, although it was not fully exploited. [...] "The bomb was obviously bad but from a redevelopment point of view, it was a lost opportunity. While the area around St Ann's Square and Deansgate is not disagreeable, if you compare it with Birmingham and its exciting development, we've got nothing to touch that in Manchester". Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester City Council, has been quoted as saying [...] "people say the bomb turned out to be a great thing for Manchester. That's rubbish." [...] There was already substantial regeneration and redevelopment taking place in the city centre {{before the bombing}}, in support of the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, its second Olympic bid. Tom Bloxham, chairman of property development group Urban Splash and of the Arts Council England (North West), agreed with Bernstein that the bomb attack was not the trigger for the large-scale redevelopment that has taken place in Manchester since the early 1990s: ...|$|E

500|$|When O'Malley {{admits he}} cares for Christine, she finally breaks down and reveals the ugly truth. Her {{husband had been}} {{corrupted}} by the power and adulation he received. He became a fascist, plotting {{to gain control of}} the United States and use his enormous influence to turn Americans to fascist ideals. She shows O'Malley papers stored in the arsenal which reveal how Forrest (backed by secretive, ultra-wealthy, power-hungry individuals) planned to use racism, anti-union feeling, and antisemitism to divide the country, turning one group against another if it became too powerful to control, in order to create the chaos that would let him seize power. Christine discovered the plot the day before her husband's death. She went riding the next morning and came upon the washed-out bridge.

After completing twenty songs, the rough demo master tapes were stolen that November. The musicians insisted they had no leads on its whereabouts until 2016, when during an interview with NME Armstrong and Dirnt stated that they eventually recovered the material, and that the band is now using the tapes for ideas. The band consulted longtime producer Rob Cavallo about what to do next. Cavallo told the members to ask themselves if the missing tracks represented the group's best work. Armstrong said that the band members [...] "couldn't honestly look at ourselves and say, 'That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> we've ever done.'

500|$|After the {{departure}} of Duchovny, the show garnered much criticism by fans and critics alike, with many saying that the bond between Mulder and Scully was what actually kept the show {{together for the first}} seven seasons of the show. Realizing his importance in the series, Chris Carter and his crew opened negotiations with Duchovny in the hopes that he would reprise his character for the finale. Initially, they were unsure if he would appear, but he eventually elected to return. Spotnitz said, [...] "My impression from talking to him was that he still cares about the show. He's still invested in it and certainly cares about [...] And I think he recognized that it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> for the show and the audience [...] to come back and give closure to nine years of the series." [...] Not only did Duchovny return for the finale, he also returned to write and direct the episode [...] "William"; he even had a small cameo in the episode, appearing as a reflection in Scully's eye. Three episodes later, Duchovny returned as an actor for the season finale, [...] "The Truth".|$|E

500|$|He made a full {{recovery}} from his injuries in time for Born in the U.S.A. (1984), which featured an aerobics-timed beat on some tracks that also owed something to the popular Phil Collins drum sound. [...] Weinberg's own experimentation since the Darkness days had also led to a more reverberant sound. Overall, Weinberg's more fluid drumming combined with Roy Bittan's use of synthesizers and better overall production to give Springsteen a more modern sound, resulting in the album becoming Springsteen's best-selling one ever and spawning a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles. Springsteen later said of the album, [...] "Max <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> on the record." [...] Weinberg's most well-known drum part came on [...] "Born in the U.S.A.", where his snare drum paired against Bittan's signature synthesizer riff on the opening and throughout {{the main part of}} the song. The recording then descends into improvised chaos; Springsteen had told Weinberg, [...] "When I stop, keep the drums going." [...] Upon the restart, intentional drum breakdowns matched bass swoops and guitar feedback; Springsteen subsequently said of the performance overall, [...] "You can hear Max – to me, he was right up there with the best of them on that song." [...] Weinberg said it was one of his most intense musical experiences.|$|E

500|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the NHL trade deadline, Columbus {{announced}} that unlike earlier in the season, they would listen to trade proposals involving Rick Nash, though they were not actively shopping him. Howson stated that the team was open to all options for improving the team, including trading Nash. Speculation was that in return for Nash the Blue Jackets would ask for a [...] "combination of young, proven players, high-end prospects and draft picks." [...] Leading up to the trade deadline, the Blue Jackets dealt Antoine Vermette to the Phoenix Coyotes for two draft picks and goaltender Curtis McElhinney. Despite being injured at the time, the acquisition of McElhinney was believed to give Columbus the flexibility to trade Curtis Sanford. The following day, on February 23, Columbus traded Jeff Carter to the Kings. In the deal, Columbus acquired defenseman Jack Johnson and a first-round draft pick; the team was given the choice of taking the pick in either 2012 or 2013. At the deadline, Columbus was unable {{to come to terms}} on a deal involving Nash, but they did make one more move; they sent center Samuel Pahlsson to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for two fourth-round draft picks and minor league defenseman Taylor Ellington. Following the trade deadline, Howson announced that the team had attempted to trade Nash at the player's request. Nash stated that he had requested the trade after being informed that the franchise was going into another rebuilding phase. He further noted that he felt that he [...] "could be a huge part of that towards bringing assets in," [...] and in his view [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> for the team, the organization, and personally for [...] career."
