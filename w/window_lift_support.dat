6000|$|O all ye fair ladies {{with your}} colours and your graces, [...] And your eyes clear in flame of candle and hearth, Toward {{the dark of}} this old <b>window</b> <b>lift</b> not up your smiling faces, [...] Where a Shade stands forlorn from the cold of the earth.|$|R
60|$|I {{lifted the}} paper {{up and saw}} that the chest was divided into two compartments. Lying on the top of one was a small, square, inlaid box. This Mrs. DeLisle took up and carried to the <b>window.</b> <b>Lifting</b> up the cover she laid it in my lap.|$|R
6000|$|Joscelyn {{rose and}} went to the <b>window.</b> <b>Lifting</b> back the curtain, she stood in the splendour of the moonlight, and sang the grand old hymn. At first Aunty Nan beat time to it feebly on the counterpane; but when Joscelyn came to the verse, [...] "With mercy and with judgment," [...] she folded her hands over her breast and smiled.|$|R
60|$|After {{reading for}} perhaps a half-hour {{he seemed to}} {{come to the end of}} a chapter and quietly laid away the book. He then rose and taking the reading-stand from the floor carried it into a corner of the room near one of the <b>windows,</b> <b>lifted</b> the candle from it and {{returned}} to the empty fireplace before which he had been sitting.|$|R
50|$|With the {{increased}} use of low current switching within automobiles, silicone rubber keypads are being used extensively as switch mechanisms for various function buttons such as <b>window</b> <b>lifts</b> and steering wheel mounted controls. With the availability of low resistance pills such as SC pills (produced by Abatek)and Gold pills, short-stroke metal dome contacts (produced by Shin-Etsu Polymer) application of keypad in automotive market has increased significantly.|$|R
50|$|Changes {{from the}} X120 {{generation}} include {{the elimination of}} the exhaust outlet diffuser, 6-speed automatic for AWD models and a return to the hinge design trunk instead of <b>lift</b> <b>support.</b>|$|R

50|$|A minor face {{lift and}} small trim {{variations}} {{were the main}} Cadillac styling news in 1951. Miniature eggcrate grilles were set into the out-board grille extension panels below the headlights. Larger, bullet shaped style bumper guards were used. Jump seats were used in both the seven-passenger sedan and Imperial limousine. Hydramatic automatic transmission was optional and hydraulic <b>window</b> <b>lifts</b> were standard. Business sedans were built in limited numbers on a special order basis.|$|R
5000|$|As {{advertised in}} The Times, Friday, 2 October 1959: The {{cylinder}} block and heads are cast in aluminum alloy and hydraulic tappets operate the overhead valves. The engine has a compression ratio of 8 to 1 and is fitted with twin carburetors with automatic choke.Other features available include fully automatic transmission, power-assisted steering, electrically operated ride control, redesigned and more flexible air conditioning, electric rear window demisters and press button <b>window</b> <b>lifts.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1992, while off {{the coast}} off Italy, the CH-46s of HMM-266 (Rein) made {{worldwide}} news. They provided heavy <b>lift</b> <b>support</b> when Mount Etna erupted and lava flow threatened {{to wipe out the}} town of Zafferana, Sicily.|$|R
60|$|There {{was then}} a {{profound}} silence, as if the thunder had withdrawn into itself. People {{had just begun to}} eat again, when a gust of cold air came through the open <b>windows,</b> <b>lifting</b> tablecloths and skirts, a light flashed, and was instantly followed by a clap of thunder right over the hotel. The rain swished with it, and immediately there were all those sounds of windows being shut and doors slamming violently which accompany a storm.|$|R
50|$|The Trend & Fun {{specification}} {{offers a}} maximum approach angle of 18 degrees.

50|$|The {{two main}} {{aerodynamic}} forces acting on any aircraft are <b>lift</b> <b>supporting</b> {{it in the}} air and drag opposing its motion. Control surfaces or other techniques may also be used to affect these forces directly, without inducing any rotation.|$|R
5000|$|Currently the {{squadron}} operates Bell UH-1N Huey helicopters {{acquired in the}} early 1970s. [...] Air Force Space Command also operates the UH-1N and has proposed the Common Vertical <b>Lift</b> <b>Support</b> Platform (CVLSP) program to seek a replacement to their UH-1Ns.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the 150 series, Two-Tens {{were always}} {{available}} {{with the same}} luxury options as the Bel Air, including the Powerglide automatic transmission, power <b>window</b> <b>lifts</b> and seat adjuster. The Two-Ten Townsman was the top station wagon model offered in 1953, but the Townsman was moved up to the Bel Air series for 1954, only {{to return to the}} Two-Ten for 1955. The lower-priced Handyman station wagon, a four-door model in 1953-54, became a two-door for 1955-57. Both were joined by a nine-passenger Beauville four-door wagon in 1956-57.|$|R

50|$|Hayes did {{not give}} up, however, and {{continued}} his passionate internal marketing of the project. As prototypes started to emerge, dealers were invited to test drive sessions, and this increased the enthusiasm for the new car. In addition, Ford took some radical measures to reduce the price on the car. As an example, the car was only offered in three exterior colours (black, white and moonstone blue) and one interior colour (grey). There were also just two equipment options: with or without central locking and electric <b>window</b> <b>lifts.</b>|$|R

6000|$|At a {{sign from}} the Count de Harcourt, Sir Eric led Richard forward, {{and put his}} hand into the King's. Louis took him to the <b>window,</b> <b>lifted</b> him upon the sill, and stood there with his arm round him, upon which the shout, [...] "Long live Richard, our little Duke!" [...] arose again. Meantime, the two Centevilles looked in wonder at the old Harcourt, who shook his head and muttered in his own tongue, [...] "I will do all I may, but our force is small, and the King has the best of it. We must not yet bring a war on ourselves." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a hardware/software co-design approach where different specification languages {{can be used}} in parallel, allowing effective system co-modeling. The proposed methodology introduces a process model that extends the traditional spiral model so as to reflect the design needs of modern embedded systems. The methodology is supported by an advanced toolset that allows co-modeling and co-simulation using SDL, Statecharts and MATRIXX, and interactive hardware/software partition-ing. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is exhibited through two application examples: the design of a car <b>window</b> <b>lift</b> mechanism, and the design of a MAC layer protocol for wireless ATM networks...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he led her}} to the <b>window,</b> and <b>lifted</b> {{her onto}} the sill. It was not high from the ground and two pairs of willing arms were there ready to help her down.|$|R

50|$|Initial {{production}} model, {{used by the}} USAF, USN, and USMC. Over {{the years}} the primary operators, the USMC has developed a number of upgrades for the aircraft including improved avionics, defenses, and a FLIR turret. The USAF planned to replace their UH-1Ns with the Common Vertical <b>Lift</b> <b>Support</b> Platform to support the service's ICBM activities, but is now examining a life extension for their current fleet.|$|R
25|$|Because {{they are}} {{relatively}} easy to measure, the wing-tip trajectories have been reported more frequently. For example, selecting only flight sequences that produced enough <b>lift</b> to <b>support</b> a weight, will show that the wing tip follows an elliptical shape. Noncrossing shapes were also reported for other insects. Regardless of their exact shapes, the plugging-down motion indicates that insects may use aerodynamic drag in addition to <b>lift</b> to <b>support</b> its weight.|$|R
