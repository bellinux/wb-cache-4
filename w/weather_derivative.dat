40|$|Introduction <b>Weather</b> <b>derivatives</b> are {{different}} from most other derivatives in that the underlying weather cannot be traded. Furthermore, the <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives</b> market is relatively illiquid. This means that <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives</b> cannot be cost-efficiently replicated with other <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives,</b> ie, for most locations the bid [...] ask spread is too large to make it economical to hedge a position. One {{of the consequences of}} this is that valuation of <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives</b> is closer to insurance pricing than to derivatives pricing (arbitrage pricing). For this reason it is important to base valuation on reliable historical data, {{and to be able to}} model the underlying indexes accurately. In the future, the <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives</b> market may become more liquid, and at that point it may be possible to use other <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives</b> for hedging and thereby derive prices from the market for at least some contracts. However, the main purpose of this chapter is to review how <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives</b> are pri...|$|R
40|$|Background: As {{a result}} of the {{financial}} markets ever ongoing product innovation a new derivative was introduced in the USA in 1997. A derivative that derived it's value, not from the price of an underlying asset, but instead from a climate factor. It's been {{known for a long time}} that revenue in certain industries are affected by weather conditions. The suppliers of <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives</b> claim that these weather sensitive businesses can user <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives</b> in order to lessen weather risk. Purpose: To do a critical evaluation of how <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives</b> can be used by companies as a risk management tool. Results & Realization: The usefulness of <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives</b> have been evaluated by studies of the effect on the revenue of constructed example businesses in different situations andby using different types of <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives.</b> A collection of problems related to <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives</b> have been collected from the existing theoretical framework on <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives.</b> This thesis offers an in dept description of how different types of <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives</b> function and how they can be used by business in order to reduce weather risk. We conclude that <b>weather</b> <b>derivatives</b> do perform a function as a risk management tool.

25|$|The first <b>weather</b> <b>derivative</b> {{deal was}} in July 1996 when Aquila Energy {{structured}} a dual-commodity hedge for Consolidated Edison (ConEd). The transaction involved ConEd's purchase of electric power from Aquila {{for the month}} of August. The price of the power was agreed, and a weather clause was embedded into the contract. This clause stipulated that Aquila would pay ConEd a rebate if August turned out to be cooler than expected. The measurement of this was referenced to Cooling Degree Days (CDDs) measured at New York City's Central Park weather station. If total CDDs were from 0 to 10% below the expected 320, the company received no discount to the power price, but if total CDDs were 11 to 20% below normal, ConEd would receive a $16,000 discount. Other discounted levels were worked in for even greater departures from normal.|$|E
