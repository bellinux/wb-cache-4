40|$|A {{method of}} {{attaching}} crystalline LiF windows to glass lamps has been developed. The resulting seals have good vacuum properties {{and can be}} cooled to cryogenic temperatures while maintaining their vacuum integrity. The technique uses dual, indium O rings to provide a vacuum seal for a LiF window on a resonance lamp. It is appropriate for resonance lamps that produce line spectra. LiF crystals must be cooled to transmit Lyman‐β radiation that can optically pump atomic hydrogen. This indium seal has other applications such as windows for VUV lasers.

40|$|Our {{efforts have}} been {{directed}} to the solution of problems concerned in the manu-facture of good ceramic-to-metal brazes. An essential objective of this project is the fabrication of a magnetron having all-ceramic insulation, in order that the metal may be made as nearly gas-free as possible by high temperature processing. The titanium hydride process was selected as having the maximum advantage, at least for experi-mental work, and for several months gave eminently satisfactory results. More recently we have found {{it increasingly difficult to}} make a good <b>window</b> <b>seal</b> that will withstand our test pressure of 110 lbs/inch 2 and will test vacuum-tight on the helium leak detector. Since the seal is made {{on the edge of a}} circular piece of aluminum oxide 0. 080 inch thick and 2. 500 inches in diameter, nondestructive examination is not possible. Although superficial examination always shows good solder flow through the seal area, very small leaks appear at one or more points along the periphery. Stripping the metal away from the ceramic usually shows a poor bond. In the course of experimentation about sixteen such seals have been made in the search for the culprit factors. Occasional test seals appear to be sound and the indica-tions are that a temperature well in excess of the melting point of the BT (Cu-Ag eutec-tic) solder used, must be attained. We have found that it is possible to have titanium hydride which does not behave well; that is, wetting of the surface is sporadic and takes place very slowly. Other factors of importance are the kind of film of hydride laid on the surface, whether too thick or too thin; the particle size of the hydride, which affects its quality as a paint; and finally, the handling of the completed and dry film. Among the test seals made in this period was a mockup window made entirely from kovar and welded to a kovar baseplate fitted for attachment to the tube processing vacuum system. Although the seal had a small leak, it successfully withstood the fol-lowing processing schedule...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of vinyl nail-on {{windows in the}} North American new home construction market has prompted ASTM International to write ASTM E 2112 - 01 "Standard Practice for Installation of Exterior Windows, Doors and Skylights". This thesis focuses on the window jamb flashing recommendation in ASTM E 2112 - 01 for vinyl nail-on windows by asking {{the question of whether}} a vinyl window's integral nail-on flange is by itself an adequate jamb flashing. To answer this question, the Jamb Drip Test was designed and completed on fourteen (14) window/wall details. The answer to the question depends on the window/wall construction sequence. When the weather resistant barrier (WRB) is installed prior to the window, it isn't. When the WRB is installed after the window, the nail-on fin is by itself an adequate jamb flashing. Based on this Jamb Drip Test study, a recommended window/wall construction sequence of sheathing- flashing (sill, jamb and head) - vinyl nail-on window - WRB - siding option is proposed. This sequence recognizes that while the nail-on fin may be an adequate jamb flashing, without flashing, the designer cannot take full advantage of the symbiotic relationship between the nail-on flange and the space it creates between the adjoining building elements (e. g. sheathing and the WRB). In this capacity, jamb flashing is added to the construction sequence to protect the sheathing from wetting and aid in directing incidental water to the exterior. Based on this proposed construction sequence, effort was focused on improving the present state of the art window/wall weatherproofing detail. An alternative to the use of high performance sealant to create the seal between the flashing and the window's nail-on flange is proposed. The present recommendation uses a(cont.) one-piece folded sheet that envelops the window flange, WRB {{and at the same time}} incorporates the window flashing function. This novel, dual function (<b>window</b> <b>seal</b> + window flashing system) product is called w-Flashing. The thesis ends with a description of w-Flashing's performance attributes, prototype design and recommended installation sequence around a vinyl nail-on window. by Austin Parsons. Thesis (S. M.)

50|$|The {{most common}} use, however, is {{probably}} in vehicles. It {{is used in}} door <b>seals,</b> <b>window</b> <b>seals,</b> trunk seals, and sometimes hood seals. Frequently, these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to movement of the door against the car body and the resulting friction between the EPDM rubber and the mating surface (painted sheet metal or glass). This can be alleviated using specialty coatings that are applied at the time of manufacture of the weather seal. Such coatings can also greatly increase the chemical resistance of EPDM rubber. Some vehicle manufacturers also recommend a light application of silicone dielectric grease to weatherstripping to reduce noise. Other uses in vehicles include cooling system circuit hoses where water pumps, thermostats, EGR valves, EGR coolers, heaters, oil coolers, radiators, and degas bottles are connected with EPDM hoses, as well as charge air tubing on turbocharged engines to connect the cold side of the charge air cooler (intercooler) to the intake manifold.|$|R
