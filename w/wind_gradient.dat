5|$|Soaring {{related to}} wind shear, also called dynamic soaring, is a {{technique}} used by soaring birds like albatrosses, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. If the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can climb into the <b>wind</b> <b>gradient,</b> trading ground speed for height, while maintaining airspeed. By then turning downwind, and diving through the <b>wind</b> <b>gradient,</b> they can also gain energy. It has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions.|$|E
5|$|When landing, {{wind shear}} {{is also a}} hazard, {{particularly}} when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the <b>wind</b> <b>gradient</b> on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the <b>wind</b> <b>gradient</b> and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E
5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational hang gliding, hot air ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. <b>Wind</b> <b>gradient</b> can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the <b>wind</b> <b>gradient</b> is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the <b>wind</b> <b>gradient</b> on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the <b>wind</b> <b>gradient</b> and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{transverse}} sound propagation, <b>wind</b> <b>gradients</b> do not sensibly modify sound propagation relative to the windless condition; the gradient effect appears to be important only in upwind and downwind configurations.|$|R
30|$|HRDI zonally {{averaged}} daytime {{temperatures are}} used to compute the <b>gradient</b> <b>wind</b> in the 65 – 105 km range. Results are compared with independently measured HRDI zonal mean zonal <b>winds.</b> The <b>gradient</b> <b>wind</b> captures the essential features of the observed wind field in the summertime midlatitudes, including the stratospheric easterly (westward) jet and the reversal to westerly (eastward) winds in the lower thermosphere. The consistency between HRDI and <b>gradient</b> <b>winds</b> diminishes at tropical latitudes, due to substantial tidal contamination of daytime temperatures used to compute the <b>gradient</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|R
5|$|Storm petrels use {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to aid flight. Most species will occasionally feed by surface pattering, holding and moving their feet on the water's surface while holding steady above the water. They remain stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the wind to anchor themselves in place. This method of feeding flight is more commonly used by Oceanitidae storm petrels however. Northern storm petrels also use dynamic soaring, gliding across wave fronts gaining energy from the vertical <b>wind</b> <b>gradient.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upper-level jet streams. Associated with {{upper level}} jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear connected to the <b>wind</b> <b>gradient</b> {{at the edge of}} the jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the anticyclonic shear side of the jet, usually next to or just below the axis of the jet.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear, {{sometimes}} referred to as windshear or <b>wind</b> <b>gradient,</b> is a difference in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere. Wind shear can be broken down into vertical and horizontal components, with horizontal wind shear seen across weather fronts and near the coast, and vertical shear typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.|$|E
50|$|Micrometeorology is {{significant}} in that sound waves can be refracted by <b>wind</b> <b>gradients</b> or thermoclines, effectively dismissing {{the effect of}} some noise barriers or terrain intervention. Geometry of area structures is an important input, since the presence of buildings or walls can block sound under certain circumstances, but reflective properties can augment sound energy at other locations.|$|R
5|$|Wind shear or <b>wind</b> <b>gradients</b> are {{a threat}} to parachutists, {{particularly}} to BASE jumping and wingsuit flying. Skydivers have been pushed off of their course by sudden shifts in wind direction and speed, and have collided with bridges, cliffsides, trees, other skydivers, the ground, and other obstacles. Skydivers routinely make adjustments {{to the position of}} their open canopies to compensate for changes in direction while making landings to prevent accidents such as canopy collisions and canopy inversion.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{parametric}} wind {{model for}} {{estimation of the}} <b>gradient</b> <b>wind</b> speed of tropical cyclone is developed. The model {{is based on the}} <b>gradient</b> <b>wind</b> model and the Jesnianki’s pressure model. The model parameters are the pressure of the storm center, the pressure of environment and the radius of maximum wind speed. The case study is typhoon Vamei (2001). Results from the model show that the <b>gradient</b> <b>wind</b> speed of tropical cyclone has good accuracy...|$|R
5|$|The {{technique}} of flight among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared {{to an average}} bird, all procellariids have a high aspect ratio (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy wing loading. Therefore, they must maintain a high speed {{in order to remain}} in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical <b>wind</b> <b>gradient</b> and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water. Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must make more use of flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a subtropical cyclone, Olga maintained well-defined outflow, and located to the southeast of a strong ridge over the western Atlantic Ocean, the cyclone tracked west-southwestward. The storm strengthened slightly while paralleling the north coast of Puerto Rico, and after an increase in convection near the center, Olga made landfall near Punta Cana, Dominican Republic at 1800UTC on December 11. A Hurricane Hunters flight into the storm reported a tighter <b>wind</b> <b>gradient</b> and peak winds of 60mph (95km/h), and at 0000UTC on December 12 the National Hurricane Center reclassified Olga as a tropical cyclone {{while it was still}} inland. Convection rapidly weakened as the storm crossed central Hispaniola, and upon reaching the Caribbean Sea the system lacked the convection required for the classification of a tropical cyclone; rainbands well to its northeast maintained stronger winds, though the center became ill-defined with dry air and strong wind shear. Late on December 12, convection increased slightly over the center, though by that time the cyclone weakened to tropical depression status. As significant convection failed to persist, the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Olga earlier on December 13 while located about 80miles (130km) northwest of Kingston.|$|E

40|$|Charts {{based on}} {{variables}} selected from data {{available on the}} preceding evening are developed for forecasting radiation fog at Elkins, W. Va., for autumn and winter months. The variables found useful in forecasting this fog include <b>gradient</b> <b>wind</b> velocity, surface temperature, and dew point depression. One of the interesting findings is that on relatively clear nights easterly <b>gradient</b> <b>winds</b> are more favorable {{for the formation of}} radiation fog than are westerly <b>gradient</b> <b>winds.</b> This and other physical aspects of the formation of the fog are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The mast head {{instruments}} {{indication of}} apparent wind speed and direction {{is different from}} what the sailor sees and feels near the surface. Sailmakers may introduce sail twist {{in the design of}} the sail, where the head of the sail is set at a different angle of attack from the foot of the sail in order to change the lift distribution with height. The effect of <b>wind</b> <b>gradient</b> can be factored into the selection of twist in the sail design, but this can be difficult to predict since the <b>wind</b> <b>gradient</b> may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for <b>wind</b> <b>gradient,</b> for example using a boom vang.|$|E

30|$|In general, {{parametric}} {{wind field}} models {{consist of a}} <b>gradient</b> <b>wind</b> model and a planetary boundary layer (PBL) model (FEMA 2012). The <b>gradient</b> <b>wind</b> can be simulated with observed TC parameters, such as location, intensity, size, moving direction, and speed, which are usually available or {{can be derived from}} the TC track dataset. The PBL model converts <b>gradient</b> <b>winds</b> to surface winds at a height of 10  m by considering the effects of local terrain and surface roughness and therefore helps improve the spatial heterogeneity modeling of wind speed, which is of great importance to wind hazard assessments.|$|R
25|$|The <b>wind</b> <b>gradient</b> and the {{temperature}} gradient can also have complex interactions. For example, a foghorn can be audible at a place near the source, and a distant place, {{but not in a}} sound shadow between them.|$|E
25|$|In kitesurfing, the <b>wind</b> <b>gradient</b> is {{even more}} important, because the power kite is flown on 20-30m lines, and the kitesurfer can use the kite to jump off the water, {{bringing}} the kite to even greater heights above the sea surface.|$|E
25|$|Scientists have {{understood}} {{the effect of}} <b>wind</b> <b>gradient</b> upon refraction of sound since the mid-1900s; however, {{with the advent of}} the U.S. Noise Control Act, the application of this refractive phenomena became applied widely beginning in the early 1970s, chiefly in the application to noise propagation from highways and resultant design of transportation facilities.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{inspired}} by the way birds such as albatrosses are able to exploit <b>wind</b> <b>gradients</b> at {{the surface of the}} ocean for staying aloft for very long periods while minimizing their energy expenditure. The corresponding behaviour has been partially reproduced here via a set of Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy rules controlling a simulated glider. First, the rules were hand-designed. Then, they were optimized with an evolutionary algorithm that improved their efficiency at coping with challenging conditions. Finally, the robustness properties of the controller generated were assessed with a view to its applicability to a real platform...|$|R

40|$|Brightness {{temperatures}} {{from the}} five-frequency dual-polarized scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR) on Nimbus 7 {{have been used}} to obtain surface wind fields over the ocean. The satellite-derived wind field for 1200 Z, Feb. 19, 1979, in the eastern North Pacific has been compared with an operationally generated surface-wind analysis field. Previous point comparisons at selected locations have indicated that satellite winds are accurate to 3 m/sec. The results, although of a preliminary nature, indicate that SMMR-derived winds may be used to determine large-scale wind fields over the ocean, particularly in areas of strong <b>wind</b> <b>gradients</b> such as found in cyclonic systems...|$|R
25|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>gradient</b> {{can have}} a {{pronounced}} effect upon sound propagation in the lower atmosphere. This effect is important in understanding sound propagation from distant sources, such as foghorns, thunder, sonic booms, gunshots or other phenomena like mistpouffers. It is also important in studying noise pollution, for example from roadway noise and aircraft noise, and {{must be considered in}} the design of noise barriers.|$|E
25|$|A {{wind speed}} {{gradient}} of 4 (m/s)/km can produce refraction equal to a typical {{temperature lapse rate}} of 7.5°C/km. Higher values of <b>wind</b> <b>gradient</b> will refract sound downward toward the surface in the downwind direction, eliminating the acoustic shadow on the downwind side. This will increase the audibility of sounds downwind. This downwind refraction effect occurs {{because there is a}} wind gradient; the sound is not being carried along by the wind.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>gradient</b> is also {{a hazard}} for {{aircraft}} making steep turns near the ground. It is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan, which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident. The rolling moment generated by the different airflow over each wing can exceed the aileron control authority, causing the glider to continue rolling into a steeper bank angle.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe noise {{produced}} by wind turbines is inherently time varying. This amplitude modulation is normally {{due to the}} directivity of the dominant trailing edge noise sources combined with the changing position and orientation of the rotating blades. In some circumstances the level and character of the amplitude modulation is altered and this paper outlines results from a Renewable UK funded research programme into the possible causes. Besides the variability of the normal trailing edge noise mechanism, other factors investigated include the possibility of blade stall or increased levels of inflow turbulence under some wind conditions combined with various propagation {{factors such as the}} effect of <b>wind</b> <b>gradients</b> and atmospheric absorption...|$|R

Both broadband and narrowband data are presented and are compared with calculations and with similar data from other machines. Predicted broadband spectra {{are in good}} agreement with measurements at high power and underestimate them at low power. Discrete frequency rotational noise components are present in all measurements and are believed due to terrain induced <b>wind</b> <b>gradients.</b> Predictions are in general agreement with measurements upwind and downwind but underestimate them in the crosswind direction...|$|R
