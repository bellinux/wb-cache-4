5|$|By 1903 {{the synagogue}} was well {{established}} on Rivington Street, and, {{due to its}} capacity and prominence, was often the site of significant or mass meetings. In April 1903 a service to honor the memory of Reform rabbi and Zionist leader Gustav Gottheil was held there, and a similar service was held for Theodore Herzl the following year. At the latter service, which was boycotted by Orthodox rabbis, Herzl was not eulogized, nor <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> mentioned.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} works by the bard Iolo Goch was based on Tudur Hen; Iolo may have studied at the Bangor Priory. Tudur Hen's most significant legacy <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> The naming practice {{of the time in}} Wales was to attach the father's name to the new first name, thus his son was named Goronwy ap Tudur Hen. Goronwy had children, one of whom was named Tudur, becoming another Tudur ap Goronwy. The younger Tudur was noticed by King Edward III of England and was made a knight in his service, and he was the grandfather (through Maredudd ap Tudur) of Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur. Owain anglicised his name to become Owen Tudor, and was the grandfather of King Henry VII of England, the founder of the Royal House of Tudor.|$|E

25|$|In the X-Men film series, Magneto {{is portrayed}} by Ian McKellen (original iteration) and by Michael Fassbender (younger self). His {{character}} {{development in the}} films is directly influenced by the African American human rights leader Malcolm X. The character's pre-teen versions were portrayed by Brett Morris (in X-Men) and by Bill Milner (in X-Men: First Class). His real name is Erik Magnus Lehnsherr, {{which at the time}} <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> in the comics, and was a holocaust survivor. Though he was good friends with Charles Xavier, his objective to ensure mutant prosperity but only so long as he remains in control of it. In the X-Men films, Magneto's resistance to mental attack does not stem from his own natural powers but from his helmet which is made of a psychic shielding component. Having taken the helmet from Shaw, Magneto is rendered immune to any form of telepathy and mind control as seen in the first two film entries. His powers are much more limited when compared to his depiction in comics. Whereas he's displayed controlling magnetism to an almost unlimited degree in the comics, he is generally restricted to manipulating metal within the films. Throughout the films, despite being at odds with Xavier, Magneto displays great care towards his old friend while acknowledging his contributions to mutant kind. Magneto appears in seven of the nine X-Men films up to 2016.|$|E

The courts of first instance and appeal decided that they didn't constituted an incitement to hatred towards the Catholics. The Supreme Court of Appeal held that the first court of appeal had made a procedural error, and referred the matter back to another court which confirmed the absence of conviction decided by the lower courts and considered that mockery of the Catholic religion, the faiths, the symbols and the rites of the religious practice had not caused any state of mind for incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence and was no justification to restrict the liberty of the press.|$|E

500|$|According to the Gesta Hungarorum, Álmos {{was born}} to Emese, a {{daughter}} of [...] "Prince Eunedubelian". However, Kristó writes that her name, containing the old Hungarian word for mother (em), may have been invented by Anonymus. The name of Álmos's father is likewise uncertain because the Hungarian chronicles preserved it in two variants. Anonymus states that Ügyek <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> but the 14th-century Illuminated Chronicle says that Elődhimself the son of Ügyekwas Álmos's father. Kristó says that both names {{may have been the}} chroniclers' inventions, since Ügyek's name derives from the ancient Hungarian ügy ("saint, holy") word, and Előd's name simply refers to an ancestor. Anonymus writes that Ügyek married Emese in 819. If this date is correct, Álmos was born around 820.|$|E
500|$|Adrienne {{was able}} to go to Paris, and {{attempted}} to secure her husband's repatriation, flattering Bonaparte, who had returned to France after more victories. After Bonaparte's coup d'état of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799), Lafayette used the confusion caused by the change of regime to slip into France with a passport in the name of [...] "Motier". Bonaparte expressed rage, but Adrienne was convinced he was simply posing, and proposed to him that Lafayette would pledge his support, then would retire from public life to a property she had reclaimed, La Grange. France's new ruler allowed Lafayette to remain, though originally without citizenship and subject to summary arrest if he engaged in politics, with the promise of eventual restoration of civil rights. Lafayette remained quietly at La Grange, and when Bonaparte held a memorial service in Paris for Washington, who had died in December 1799, Lafayette was not invited, nor <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> mentioned.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{from the}} first, Yiddish theater drew {{a level of}} theater {{criticism}} comparable to any other European theater of its time. For example, Bercovici cites a [...] "brochure" [...] by one G. Abramski, published in 1877, that described and gave critiques of all of Goldfaden's plays of that year. Abramski speculated that the present day might be for Yiddish theater a moment comparable to the Elizabethan era for English theater. He discussed what a Yiddish theater ought to be, noted its many sources (ranging from Purim plays to circus pantomime), and praised its incorporation of strong female roles. He also criticized where he saw weaknesses, noting how unconvincingly a male actor played the mother in Shmendrik, or remarking of the play Di shtume kale (The Mute Bride) — a work that Goldfaden apparently wrote to accommodate a pretty, young actress who in the performance was too nervous to deliver her lines — that the only evidence of Goldfaden's authorship <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{name has}} been {{rendered}} in the Slavic languages as Bož ( [...] , transliterated as Bozh). One theory is that it derives from the Slavic word bog, [...] "God", interpreted as [...] "God's". Polish linguist Stanisław Urbańczyk (1909–2000) mentioned *Božь (divine), *Vo(d)žь (chief), and *Bosь (barefooted) as possibilites. Polish linguist Stanisław Rospond (1906–1982) concluded that Bos, [...] "barefooted", <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> and that the other etymologies put forward by Urbańczyk were less probable; he supported this by connecting Boz with Bus (...) of The Tale of Igor's Campaign, as Omeljan Ohonovskyj (1833–1894) had first done in 1876. Ukrainian scholar Mykhailo Hrushevsky (1866–1934) speculated that his name was [...] "perhaps Bozhko, Bozhydar, Bohdan". Ukrainian Bohdan Struminsky stressed that as the first palatalizations (gь > žь, etc.) had not yet occurred in Slavic {{at the time of}} Boz, *Božь was unconvincing and *Vo(d)žь [...] "even less acceptable". Although supporting the connection with Bus, he assumed that it was Gothic, as *Bōs, found in similar variants as West Gothic Bōsō, of uncertain date, [...] "probably meaning 'Sorcerer'", and Anglo-Saxon Bōsa, from the 7th century.|$|E
