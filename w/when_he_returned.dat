The National Institute's Director Sir Henry Dale gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>returned</b> and felt that the experience would make Burnet—whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist—better equipped to expand operations <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>returned</b> to Melbourne.
