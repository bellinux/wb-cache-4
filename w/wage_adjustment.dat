2500|$|The {{most intense}} strike for the railway workers {{occurred}} in two stages between 1918 and 1919. World War I caused great inflation in prices in Los Angeles. Streetcar crews worked over ten hour shifts and the pay increases averaged only 50 percent {{over a period}} when {{the cost of living}} had risen nearly 75 percent. [...] The vice-president of the Amalgamated Association of Street Railway Employees, Ben Bowbeer, began to unionize workers with strong support from federal government <b>wage</b> <b>adjustment</b> bureaus in 1918. Labor leaders fueled with renewed energy pulled their efforts together to create the Amalgamated Division 835. The union applied to the National War Labor Board (NWLB) in the fall of 1918 for an increase in wages and an eight-hour workday. The eight-hour workday was granted, but Huntington kept from its implementation. Once again, streetcar workers went on strike. This time, the US naval commander sent armed sailors on the Red Cars to threaten the streetcar conductors. The city also served injunctions declaring that workers had agreed to open shop policies upon their employment and that their demands to unionize were illegal.|$|E

Therefore, using annual average values do not accurately reflects changes before or after minimum <b>wage</b> <b>adjustments.</b> We solve this issue in two ways.

50|$|The {{importance}} of the Taylor contract is that it introduces nominal rigidity into the economy. In macroeconomics if all wages and prices are perfectly flexible, then money is neutral and the classical dichotomy holds. In previous Keynesian models, such as the IS-LM model it had simply been assumed that wages and/or prices were fixed in the short-run so that money could affect GDP and employment. John Taylor saw that by introducing staggered or overlapping contracts, he could allow some wages to respond to current shocks immediately, {{but the fact that}} some were set one period ago was enough to introduce a dynamics into wages (and prices). Even if there was a one off shock to the money supply,with Taylor contracts it will set of a process of <b>wage</b> <b>adjustment</b> that will take time to react during which output (GDP) and employment can differ from the long-run equilibrium.|$|E

5000|$|Flassbeck {{sees the}} need for a {{coordination}} of monetary policy, wage policy and fiscal policy. He assigns monetary policy an outstanding impact on growth and employment and refuses its shortening on retaining price stability. He declares Monetarism to control inflation through money supply failed. It had been practised in the 1980s by some federal banks in response to the oil crisis and the stagflation going along with it in the 1970s. But it had led to drop of investments and high unemployment and therefore had been abandoned in the 1990s at latest. Flassbeck thereby emphasises the speciality of the German and European monetary policy, which, on the contrary to the majority of central banks, had kept a monetarism agenda. Flassbeck cites that the monetary policy of the German Bundesbank and the European Central Bank (ECB) at controlling the money supply ever had geared to the potential output of the past. If economic growth would exceed money supply respectively Gross National Product the estimated potential output, the ECB, today as in past, would swivel in the Bundesbank already in advance to a restriction course, without a noteworthy endangering of price stability existing in the shape of exceedance of the target inflation rate. One could never set a potential output beforehand. Flassbeck also considers the target inflation rate of the ECB too low and refers to the height at other major central banks. According to Flassbeck, wage policy should work towards a macroeconomic [...] "distribution neutral" [...] <b>wage</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The optimal rate of wage increases would result from the addition of inflation rate and rise of labour productivity. Flassbeck views the labour agreement on national area as solution best compatible with market economy. This mechanism would accomplish the Law of one price, means the law of same prices for same goods, against the labour market's imperfections and information asymmetries.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{inflation}} on wage changes made by firms in a unique thirty-seven-year panel of occupations and employers drawn from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Community Salary Survey (CSS). Our analysis first identifies two relative prices embedded in wage changes and, second, draws inferences about {{the costs and benefits}} of inflation from the adjustments in these relative prices. Typically, firms manage employer-wide <b>wage</b> <b>adjustments</b> (controlling for occupational wage changes) separately from their interoccupational wage changes (controlling for employer wage hikes). Consistent with this observation, we identify large independent employer and occupational components of wage changes in the CSS. Although there is no a priori reason why these adjustments should be altered by inflation (when the average change is subtracted out), we find that variation in both of these terms rises as inflation grows. Guided by institutional wage-setting procedures, we view employers' mean wage hikes as subject to intra-market variations in the speed of adjustment to inflation and forecasting errors. In contrast, we argue that occupational wage movements include a higher concentration of inter-market relative price adjustments. This simple dichotomy, whose robustness we attempt to test, yields two policy-oriented results. First, higher inflation and labor productivity appear to increase the rate of occupational <b>wage</b> <b>adjustments</b> ("grease"), although these potential benefits taper off after inflation rises to about 4 percent (assuming 1. 5 percent average growth of labor productivity.) Second, potentially inefficient variations in employer <b>wage</b> <b>adjustments</b> ("sand") continue to mount until inflation reaches rates of 7 to 10 percent (again assuming productivity growth of 1. 5 percent).
