50|$|Knob-and-tube wiring (sometimes {{abbreviated}} K&T) is {{an early}} standardized method of electrical wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s. It consisted of single-insulated copper conductors run within wall or ceiling cavities, passing through joist and stud drill-holes via protective porcelain insulating tubes, and supported along their length on nailed-down porcelain knob insulators. Where conductors entered a <b>wiring</b> <b>device</b> such as a lamp or switch, or were pulled into a wall, they were protected by flexible cloth insulating sleeving called loom. The first insulation was asphalt-saturated cotton cloth, then rubber became common. Wire splices in such installations were twisted together for good mechanical strength, then soldered and wrapped with rubber insulating tape and friction tape (asphalt saturated cloth), or made inside metal junction boxes.|$|E

40|$|The centrosome, {{because of}} 9 -fold-symmetry of its orthogonalcentrioles and their {{circumferential}} polarity (nonequivalence {{of the nine}} centriolarblades,each one molecularly distinguishable), constitutes a biological discrete interface, composed of two orthogonal macromolecular protractors, capable of recognizing and decoding morphogenetic instructions, translating them and delivering targeted molecular complexes into their expected 3 D real location in the cell: like an interface or a <b>wiring</b> <b>device,</b> the centrosome recognizes each targeting sequence, matches it with the corresponding receptor, soconnectingit with the correctly-oriented microtubule, directed and targeted towards the desired definite cortical compartment. Morphogenetic geometric instructions (DNA coded) are translated by the centrosome into actual locations in cells, and, as a consequence, macromolecules, labeled by DNA geometric signals, can be correctly delivered into their programmed cell locations. In addition, the centrosome (the most chiral and enantiomorphous cell structure) plays a geometric key role in left-right patterning: axial centriole circumferential polarity, if reversely oriented, constitutes a likely molecular base for bilateral symmetry...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the advantages, disadvantages, and {{applications}} of some innovative technologies in the classroom. I have chosen to concentrate on one such technology in this paper. This technology is the use of computer based laboratory experiments in lieu of or to supplement hands-on laboratory experiments. I will focus on computer based lab experiments. The driving force behind this technology is to speed up student progress on laboratory experiments and make the learning experience in the lab more efficient. I choose the electrical field to concentrate my discussion because my background is in electronics and I have significant experience teaching electrical courses with accompanying labs. I will first give some background information to you so that you may better understand the motivation behind searching for an improved method of conducting electronics laboratory classes. In what I call the beginning, before computer based learning and other computer based tools in the classroom, lab experiments were performed as hands-on experiments with actual parts. These parts were hand wired usually using a proto-board or some similar type of hand <b>wiring</b> <b>device.</b> This method was sound and gave students good first hand practical knowledge of how to wire circuits, and how different electronic circuits worked.

40|$|Silicon interposers with through silicon vias (TSVs) {{have become}} {{important}} {{key components of}} 3 D architectures. They are used as intermediate carrier and <b>wiring</b> <b>device</b> for IC components like logics, memories and sensors. Due to custom specific front and back side wiring interposers enable to adapt the fine pitch IO terminals of the mounted ICs to the IO geometries of the package level. High density copper filled TSVs with high aspect ratio as well as high density multi layer wiring using electro plated copper as conductive material and low loss dielectrics enable high performance signal transmission at interposer level without serious losses by parasitic effects. This paper presents the fabrication steps for wafer level processing of silicon interposers with copper filled TSVs {{as well as their}} wafer level assembly with IC components. Special focus is drawn on the TSV formation process including via etching, isolation and filling as well as front side high density wiring and subsequent backside processing of the thin TSV wafers. In this context, also temporary wafer to wafer bonding which is required for backside processing of thin TSV wafers is discussed. The final interposers which carry one or more IC components have lateral dimensions up to several square centimeters and thicknesses between 50 - 100 m. They include up to several thousands of TSVs per device with a single electrical resistance between 4. 9 - 5. 7 mOhms. All processes were run using production equipment at 200 mm wafers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract An Investigation was {{conducted}} to determine electrical behavior when a dc-to-frame ground fault occurs on the secondary side of au AC/DC shuffle car which utilizes an auto-transformer fed SCR package and an SCR drive for the traction motors. Ten different ground <b>wire</b> <b>devices</b> from five manufacturers and eight sizes of neutral ground resistors were used during testing. Fault voltage and current data were recorded at low and high tramming speeds and at locked rotor. Harmonic analysis of the fault signals revealed that the 180 Hz signal of the SCR drive produced the major portion of the fault current and voltage drop across the ground <b>wire</b> <b>device.</b> A simplified equivalent circuit describing the electrical fault was derived. A series L-C circuit (notch fi 1 ter), resonant at 180 Hz was fabricated and placed across each of the ground <b>wire</b> <b>devices</b> {{to determine if the}} filter would simultaneously reduce frame-to-ground fault voltage and increase the total current flow to enhance ground fault detection capabilities.
