The sturdy peasant woman <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> land and bore strong children was considered ideal and athletic women were praised for being tanned from working outdoors. Organisations were created for the indoctrination of Nazi values and from 25 March 1939 membership in the Hitler Youth became compulsory for all children over the age of ten. The Jungmädelbund (Young Girls League) section of the Hitler Youth was for girls age 10 to 14 and the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM; League of German Girls) was for young women age 14 to 18. The BDM's activities focused on physical education, with activities such as running, long jumping, somersaulting, tightrope walking, marching and swimming.|$|E
5|$|Stannary law was {{a medieval}} English legal system for {{governing}} the tin industry. South-West England, {{and in particular}} Devon, was a major producer of tin in the 12th century, produced by independent miners <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> alluvial deposits across the region. The industry was regulated by the Crown, who taxed mining output and raised revenue from any fines imposed on those who broke the stannary laws. The laws also helped to manage {{the relationship between the}} miners and other local people, whose economic interests were often at odds. The output of tin increased {{from the end of the}} 12th century onwards, encouraging the Crown to extend its regulation and generate more revenue. In 1198, William of Wrotham, who controlled Lydford Castle at the start of John's reign, was appointed as the Warden of the Stannaries, a new office intended to provide additional rigour to the administration of the mining industry. Stannary courts were established in Devon, backed by a team of officials, and, with the creation of the Duchy of Cornwall in the 14th century, the administration of stannary law was delegated to the duchy. From 1198 onwards, Lydford Castle was designated as the prison for supporting the court and its processes.|$|E

25|$|Many {{economic}} and political changes occurred in Europe during {{the latter part of}} the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, changes which affected the lives of millions of people. One of these changes came about with the advent of the Second Industrial Revolution. Many people <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> farmlands abandoned their homes and moved to the larger, industrialized cities with the hope of finding better paying jobs. Those who continued to work in the agricultural sector suffered the consequences of the widespread crop failures which came about as the result of long periods of drought and disease, the cholera epidemic and a general deterioration of economic conditions. Starvation and unemployment were on the rise.|$|E

25|$|The first {{settlement}} in the area was known as Floyd's Lane which was on a trail that ran from a Colorado River crossing on the west to a San Bernard River crossing on the east. A trail that ran beside Caney Creek connected the area to Wharton. Boling was founded in 1900 when the New York, Texas & Mexican Railroad built a line through the area. The settlement was named for Mary Bolling Vineyard, the then-6-year-old daughter of Robert E. Vineyard who had the town surveyed. By 1907 the town had a school, a store, a blacksmith shop, and about ten families. The school had four teachers and 104 black students. These children descended from the African-American slaves <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> area's plantations in the pre-Civil War era. Their parents were sharecroppers or hired hands on the large land tracts which survived from the earlier time.|$|E
25|$|His {{first task}} was to secure a revenue stream for Egypt. To {{accomplish}} this, Muhammad Ali 'nationalized' all the iltizam lands of Egypt, thereby officially owning all {{the production of the}} land. He accomplished the state annexation of property by raising taxes on the 'tax-farmers' who had previously owned the land throughout Egypt. The new taxes were intentionally high and when the tax-farmers could not extract the demanded payments from the peasants <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> land, Muhammad Ali confiscated their properties. The other major source of revenue Muhammad Ali created was a new tax on waqf endowments, which were previously tax-free. Through these endowments, personal income could be set aside for schools or other charitable purposes. As well as raising revenue to fund his new military, this tax took revenue away from the local elite, Mamluks and the ulama, weakening opposition to Muhammad Ali's reforms.|$|E
25|$|Friedrich Engels {{articulated}} one of {{the earliest}} theories of the state based on anthropological evidence in The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State (1884). The theory of Engels developed from study of Ancient Society (1877) by Lewis H. Morgan and from the sketches of this work by Karl Marx on the Asiatic mode of production. Engels argues that the state developed {{as a result of the}} need to protect private property. The theory contended that surplus production as a result of the development of agriculture created a division and specialization of labor: leading to classes <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> land and to those who could devote time to other tasks. Class antagonism and the need to secure the private property of those living on the surplus production produced by agriculturalists resulted in the creation of the state. The anthropologist Morton Fried (1923-1986) further developed this approach, positing social stratification as the primary dynamic underlying the development of the state.|$|E

25|$|The {{treaty was}} part of the greater Indian Removal policy, {{originally}} proposed by President Thomas Jefferson, by which the Five Civilized Tribes were to allow for white settlement in the south by ceding their territory and relocating west of the Mississippi River. It was one of several removal treaties signed by the Muscogee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Cherokee in the 1830s relocating them to the new territories in present-day Oklahoma and Arkansas. The Chickasaw were essentially doomed to removal with the others, when, in 1806 Jefferson promised the southern states that the Federal Government would encourage the migration of all Indians to land west of the Mississippi. The other factor underlying the removal of the Indians was land speculation, one of the primary sources of money for the landed aristocracy of the South {{since the early days of}} the Virginia colony. The trio of Andrew Jackson, John Coffee and James Jackson (unrelated), were each land speculators, militiamen and politicians <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> cessions of huge tracts of Indians lands, the defeat of Indian resistance and eventually the complete removal of the Chickasaw, as well as the rest of the Five Civilized Tribes, to make way for white settlers –often at great personal profit.|$|E
500|$|T. H.

Prichard had restored the sanctuary by 1850, and by 1852 he had begun to work on the nave, largely demolishing much of the temple Wood had built. [...] Together with London-based John Pollard Seddon, who was able to hire pre-Raphaelite artists Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Thomas Woolner, extensive developments were made. Morris & Co. provided the stained glass in the 1860s. Prichard was responsible for a dramatic redevelopment of the southwest tower in 1867-9, aided by a number of talented artists and craftsmen.|$|E
500|$|In 1947, a young disk jockey in Charlotte, North Carolina <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> {{overnight}} shift {{had recently}} received some older records which {{he brought to}} work with him.

Shortly after the record had finished, the radio station's telephones began ringing with people asking about the song and requesting to hear it again. By afternoon, the city's music stores were calling the radio station, hoping to learn where they could order copies of [...] "Heartaches". [...] Both Victor and Decca went into their vaults to find their masters of the record and began pressing them for southern United States sales. As disk jockeys in other parts of the US began obtaining copies of the record and playing it, the demand for [...] "Heartaches" [...] went from coast to coast. This older recording went to the top of all the main charts in 1947, including sales, juke box play, and airplay.|$|E

500|$|By 1964, {{the country}} was a {{constitutional}} monarchy ruled by Sultan Jamshid bin Abdullah. Zanzibar had a population of around 230,000 Africans—some of whom claimed Persian ancestry and were known locally as Shirazis—and also contained significant minorities in the 50,000 Arabs and 20,000 South Asians who were prominent in business and trade. The various ethnic groups were becoming mixed and the distinctions between them had blurred; according to one historian, an important reason for the general support for Sultan Carbou was his family's ethnic diversity. However, the island's Arab inhabitants, as the major landowners, were generally wealthier than the Africans; the major political parties were organised largely along ethnic lines, [...] with Arabs dominating the Zanzibar Nationalist Party (ZNP) and Africans the Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP). The ZNP looked towards Egypt as its model, which caused some tensions with the British colonial officials, but Zanzibar had been for centuries dominated by its Arab elite, and the Colonial Office could not imagine a Zanzibar ruled by the blacks. After Zanzibar had been conquered by the Sultanate of Oman in 1698, all {{of the land in}} the countryside had been given to Omani aristocratic families, whose descendants still owned the land in 1964. Though not all of the Arabs were as wealthy as the families who owned the clove and coconut plantations, the resentment felt by the poor African farmers <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> plantations acquired a racialized tinge, especially as in a small island like Zanzibar, {{it was easy to see}} the contrast in wealth between the land-owning Arab families and their poor African tenants.|$|E
500|$|In {{the lower}} levels of organization, there was more uniformity: squadrons of three or five ships were {{commanded}} by a komēs or droungarokomēs, and each ship's captain was called kentarchos ("centurion"), although literary sources also used more archaic terms like nauarchos or even triērarchos. Each ship's crew, depending on its size, was composed of one to three ousiai. Under the captain, there was the bandophoros ("banner bearer"), who acted as executive officer, two prōtokaraboi (sing. prōtokarabos, [...] "head of the ship"), sometimes also referred to archaically as kybernētes, and a bow officer, the prōreus. The prōtokaraboi were helmsmen, in charge of the steering oars in the stern, {{as well as of the}} rowers on either side of the ship. The senior of the two was the [...] "first prōtokarabos (prōtos prōtokarabos). In actual terms, there probably were several of each kind upon each ship, working in shifts. Most of these officers rose from the ranks, and there are references in the De Administrando Imperio to first oarsmen (prōtelatai) who rose to become prōtokaraboi in the imperial barges, and later assumed still higher offices; Emperor Romanos Lekapenos being the most successful example. There were also a number of specialists on board, such as the two bow oarsmen and the siphōnatores, <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> siphons used for discharging the Greek fire. A boukinatōr ("trumpeter") is also recorded in the sources, who conveyed orders to the rowers (kōpēlatai or elatai). Since the marine infantry were organized as regular army units, their ranks followed those of the army.|$|E
