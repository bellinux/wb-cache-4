F. rubiginosa itself can endure cooler climates than other members of the genus.|$|E
5|$|After the Congress of Vienna {{there was}} a degree of {{commercial}} cooperation between the various German states resulting {{in the setting of}} the German Customs Union (Zollverein). There were however still many barriers to trade until Bavaria took the lead in establishing the General German Commercial Code in 1856. As part of the code the Zollverein introduce the Zollpfund (Customs Pound) which was defined to be exactly 500g and <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> split into 30'lot'. This unit was used for inter-state movement of goods, but was not applied in all states for internal use.|$|E

On the whole, he viewed the country as a backwater, and earnestly wished to return to Europe to fight against Napoleon. Brock mistrusted the Canadian colonists, many of whom he {{suspected}} of being American sympathizers, and he was reluctant to arm them indiscriminately to help defend the colonies. He favoured expansion of volunteer forces <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> trained and supervised, as well as the use of British regulars and Tecumseh's warriors.|$|E

For her new role she was given a third refit. Her passenger accommodation was increased from 360 to 730, and her sail-plan altered to a traditional three-masted, square-rigged pattern. She was fitted with a removable propeller, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> hauled up on deck by chains to reduce drag when under sail power alone.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the losses it had suffered, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had ceased to be an {{effective}} fighting force. Following a series of raids on the Japanese shipyard at Kure, Japan, the only major warships in fighting order were six aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and one battleship, none of <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> fueled adequately. Although 19destroyers and 38submarines were still operational, their use was limited by the lack of fuel.|$|E
