5|$|A further fire {{broke out}} during the early morning of 14 December. Firefighters were of the view that {{extinguishing}} it would leave the risk of petroleum vapour re-igniting or exploding, so it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to allow the fire, which was well contained, to burn itself out. Hertfordshire Fire Service's deputy chief Mark Yates stated that escaping petroleum vapour was the most likely cause of the original explosion and fire.|$|E

Macha Hernandez was re-written to become Tasha Yar to better suit Crosby.|$|E

5|$|This was in {{contrast}} to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void. Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire. By ignoring the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling Soviet government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.|$|E

The album was released only {{months after the}} breakup of Uncle Tupelo, an alternative country band that was the predecessor of Wilco. Prior to its release, there was debate about whether the album <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> than the debut album of Son Volt, the new band of former Uncle Tupelo lead singer Jay Farrar.|$|E
5|$|By 1959 the United States was {{concerned}} that the militarization of the Kola Peninsula would become the prime source of a Soviet attack on North America. A new discussion about location arose, with Alta and Kautokeino as the main alternatives. Banak was estimated to cost NOK4.9 million, NOK2.8 million less than Alta, had better instrument landing and weather conditions and allowed a longer runway. The main advantage of Alta was that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> suited for civilian traffic. The government and Parliament approved construction of Banak in 1959 on condition that it receive NATO funding.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira and it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> not to press the issue. Even so, three key members of the MCC were aware of the reality of the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.|$|E

5|$|Despite its title, {{the novel}} does {{not so much}} deal with the crime and its formal punishment, as with Raskolnikov's {{internal}} struggle (the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law). Believing society <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> for it, Raskolnikov commits murder {{with the idea that}} he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, , but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.|$|E
5|$|Frank Chance {{joined the}} Chicago Cubs in 1898 as a reserve catcher, backing up Tim Donahue and Johnny Kling. Frank Selee, the Cubs' manager, decided that Chance <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> suited {{as a first}} baseman. Chance at first opposed the move and even {{threatened}} to quit, but ultimately obliged. Joe Tinker was a third baseman in minor league baseball, but in 1902 made the Cubs as a shortstop, replacing Barry McCormick. Johnny Evers made his major league debut with the Cubs on September 1 at shortstop, with Selee moving Tinker from shortstop to third base. Three days later, Selee returned Tinker to shortstop and assigned Evers to second base to back up Bobby Lowe.|$|E
5|$|Gates McFadden {{returned}} {{to the role of}} Doctor Beverly Crusher in the third season, the character had been written out for season two and replaced with Diana Muldaur playing Doctor Katherine Pulaski. Roddenberry had ensured that Crusher was not written out permanently to allow for her return in the future. Keith DeCandido blamed her departure on Maurice Hurley. After he left the series, McFadden returned. Fans started a letter-writing campaign to reinstate McFadden throughout the second season. Both Roddenberry and Berman decided that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to bring back McFadden than to look for a third doctor in three years as they agreed that the Pulaski character was not working.|$|E

5|$|In 1892, Stone was {{convinced}} {{to sit for}} a portrait in sculpture, rendered by Anne Whitney, sculptor and poet.

Stone finally yielded to pressure from Frances Willard, the New England Women's Club and some of her friends and neighbors in the Boston area, and sat while Whitney produced a bust. In February 1893, Stone invited her brother Frank and his wife Sarah to come see the bust, before it was shipped to Chicago for display at the upcoming World's Columbian Exposition.|$|E

With domestic matters escalating out of control in Poland, Wojciech Jaruzelski imposed a state of war, the Polish version of martial law, on 12 December 1981.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, county {{officials}} admitted {{that it was}} likely that the $7million appropriated would not be enough, and instead it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> spent on improving other nearby parkways.

The county {{would have had to}} spend $8million of its own money as well. The parkway was instead shortened from Bronxville to Elmsford.|$|E
