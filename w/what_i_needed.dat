500|$|In {{order to}} ensure his story would be chosen to air, Gordon decided to play up the {{elements}} of anti-Semitism. Originally, however, the script called for both the protagonists and the antagonists to be African Americans, and the main protagonist to be a [...] "Louis Farrakhan-like" [...] character. Gordon later rewrote the script because he realized [...] "black anti-Semitism is a very subtle and difficult subject and not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> in my dramatic structure." [...] To {{create the kind of}} hate propaganda that Brunjes and his printshop made in the episode, Gordon contacted the Anti-Defamation League and requested samples.

500|$|The lead {{character}} of Casino Royale is James Bond, {{an agent of}} the Secret Service. Fleming initially named the character James Secretan before he appropriated the name of James Bond, author of the ornithology guide, Birds of the West Indies. Fleming explained to the ornithologist's wife [...] "that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed,</b> and so a second James Bond was born". He further explained that [...] "When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [...] is the dullest name I ever heard." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 February 1952, Ian Fleming started writing what would become his first book, Casino Royale, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. He typed out 2,000 words in the morning, {{directly}} from his own experiences and imagination and finished work on the manuscript in just over a month, completing it on 18 March 1952. Fleming took the name for his character {{from that of the}} American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies; Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that [...] "It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed,</b> and so a second James Bond was born".|$|E
500|$|The novel centres on the {{exploits}} of James Bond, {{an officer in the}} Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a commander in the Royal Naval Reserve. Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, an expert on Caribbean birds and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, himself a keen birdwatcher, had a copy of Bond's guide, and later told the ornithologist's wife, [...] "that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed,</b> and so a second James Bond was born". In a 1962 interview in The New Yorker, he further explained: [...] "When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [...] is the dullest name I ever heard." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 2014, Stefani {{released}} her first solo single in six years, [...] "Baby Don't Lie", and following its moderate impact and reception, a new single, [...] "Spark the Fire", {{was released in}} December of the same year. However, both singles underperformed on the charts, prompting the album to be postponed for a 2015 release. After months with no updates on the album, Stefani revealed in an interview for Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the entire album in favor of starting over, since she did not feel fulfilled and totally involved with the previous project. Stefani started writing new material in June 2015, and following her divorce from Gavin Rossdale a month later, she felt very inspired. In the same interview, Stefani claimed: [...] "I needed to go through <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to go through to write the record that I needed to write. [...] These songs are really natural — they’re from not worrying about what happened or what’s going to happen but about living in the moment, from trying to be present and trying to feel." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E

He oversaw Stamkos' {{off-season}} workouts north of Toronto in Roberts' in-house gym, which is a quick drive from Stamkos' family home in Unionville. Stamkos spoke highly regarding the workouts: [...] "It helped me a lot," [...] Stamkos said. [...] "I {{learned a lot about}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to improve on.

2500|$|According to Wainwright, Poses grew thematically out of {{its title}} track, which was {{inspired}} by his residency at New York City's infamous Chelsea Hotel.

I thought if I could {{look at it as}} a series of poses and extract from it <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> for my songs, then I would survive." [...] Describing his writing process, Wainwright stated he typically comes up with a melody line and starts singing phonetically, from which words often appear. To promote the album prior to its release, Wainwright embarked on a tour throughout the United States and Canada.|$|E

However, plans for the single fell through as the Timbaland-produced track was scrapped in favor of a new record: [...] "Talk About Our Love," [...] produced by rapper Kanye West. Both, the single and album cut [...] "Where You Wanna Be," [...] were eleventh-hour additions to the album, commissioned by West's manager Geroid Roberson, one of the executive producers on Afrodisiac, who encouraged Norwood to attempt further studio sessions with West.

2500|$|Ward {{said that}} {{although}} Burton is a talented actress and {{has done a great}} job with the character, she did not feel she had to get to know her in order to proceed with the drawings. [...] "It was the character I was drawing for and I learned <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to from the show and the scripts," [...] she stated. In describing the process of drawing for a particular episode, she said she would mostly get input from Robbie Beck, the props master for the show. [...] "Schwahn always knew exactly what he wanted and it would be described in the script. So Robbie would send me the info and I would initially do some quick sketches," [...] stated Ward.

2500|$|Taylor had {{thoughts}} of retiring {{by the time}} he played the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro in January 1985. He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in Brazil at the time, buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians, and musically energized by the sounds and nature of Brazilian music. [...] "I had... sort of bottomed-out in a drug habit, my marriage with Carly had dissolved, and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while," [...] he recalled in 1995. [...] "I sort of hit a low spot. I was asked to go down to Rio de Janeiro to play in this festival down there. We put the band together and went down and it was just an amazing response. I played to 300,000 people. They not only knew my music, they knew things about it and were interested in aspects of it that to that point had only interested me. To have that kind of validation right about then was really <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed.</b> It helped get me back on track." [...] The song [...] "Only a Dream in Rio" [...] was written in tribute to that night, with lines like I was there that very day and my heart came back alive. The October 1985 album, That's Why I'm Here, from which that song came, started a series of studio recordings that, while spaced further apart than his previous records, showed a more consistent level of quality and fewer covers, most notably the Buddy Holly song [...] "Everyday", released as a single reached No. 61. On the album track [...] "Only You," [...] the backing vocals were performed by an all star duo of Joni Mitchell and Don Henley.|$|E
