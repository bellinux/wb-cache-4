5|$|According to Twain, {{she became}} {{depressed}} and lost {{her desire to}} live after the divorce. As a distraction, she began to write a memoir, titled From This Moment On after the 1998 song of the same name. She then re-evaluated her life and noted a pattern of withholding emotions, which affected her voice for both speaking and singing. She explained {{the loss of her}} voice resulted from the cumulative stress of experiencing domestic violence in her childhood, the death of her parents, stress from her musical career, and the divorce. As a result, the singer developed dysphonia, an impairment in the ability to produce sound because of tightened muscles enveloping her voice box. In order to recover, Twain embarked on a documented journey with the series <b>Why</b> <b>Not?</b> with Shania Twain. Twain's wanted go outside her comfort zone and perform once again, while inspiring viewers to be proactive about their own problems.|$|E
