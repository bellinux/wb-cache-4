5|$|With {{the spiders}} distracted, Finn and Jake {{try to escape}} from the web, but to no avail. Ed later returns with a flaming sword, which he {{presents}} to Barb. However, she gets angry, arguing that he picked the gift because he liked, not because she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> Angered, Ed cuts the web, releasing Finn and Jake; he claims that Barb is dependent on him for food, as she cannot spin her own webs due to some unknown dysfunction. Barb attacks Ed, noting that she will have to eat him instead. Finn tries to help, but is pinned to a wall by Barb, who suddenly beings to moan as if in pain. Just then, an enormous egg sack emerges from her epigyne. The sack bursts, giving birth to thousands of tiny spiders, who proceed to bury Finn and Jake.|$|E
25|$|Her novel, Spring Riot, was {{published}} in 1948 and got mixed reviews. Her next effort was a play, which she sent to producer Bob Whitehead. Because he had produced Member of the Wedding, she thought he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> since her play was also about a child, but the play came back from Whitehead's office rejected. Allen waited {{for a couple of}} months and sent it back, rightly figuring that some reader had rejected it instead of Whitehead himself. This time Whitehead read the play and instantly optioned it, but due to casting problems her play was never produced on stage. The reader who had initially rejected her play was Lewis M. Allen, whom she would later marry.|$|E
25|$|A third {{mainstream}} {{theory of}} ageing, the Disposable soma theory, proposed in 1977 by Thomas Kirkwood, presumes {{that the body}} must budget {{the amount of energy}} available to it. The body uses food energy for metabolism, for reproduction, and for repair and maintenance. With a finite supply of food, the body must compromise, and do none of these things quite as well as it <b>would</b> <b>like.</b> <b>It</b> is the compromise in allocating energy to the repair function that causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age. A caveat to the disposable soma theory suggests that time, rather than energy, is a limiting resource that may be critical to an organism. The concept is that each organism must reproduce in an optimal period in order to ensure the greatest chance of success for the offspring. This optimal period is dictated by the ecological niche of the organism but in essence, it limits the time that any given organism can devote to growth and development prior to bearing offspring. Thus, developmental rate and gestational rate are subject to evolutionary pressure. The need to accelerate gestation limits the time allocated to damage repair at the cellular level, resulting in an accumulation of damage and a decreased lifespan relative to organisms with longer gestation. This concept stems from a comparative analysis of genomic stability in mammalian cells.|$|E

500|$|According to author Amy Dempsey, {{during the}} Cold War, Rockwell's images affirmed {{traditional}} American values, depicting Americans as prosperous and free. Rockwell's work {{came to be}} categorized within art movements and styles such as Regionalism and American scene painting.

500|$|At {{the time}} the {{compilation}} was released, Madonna was riding a wave of publicity {{as a result of}} the film Evita and her pregnancy with daughter Lourdes.

500|$|The Four Freedoms {{are perhaps}} Rockwell's most famous work. Some {{have said that}} Rockwell's Four Freedoms lack artistic maturity. [...] Others have pointed to the {{universality}} of the Freedom of Religion as disconcerting to practitioners of particular faiths. [...] Others complained that he idealized American life because by depicting wholesome, healthy, and happy sentiments, Rockwell depicted the good that was remembered or wished for, but by avoiding misery, poverty, and social unrest, he failed to demonstrate command of {{the bad and the}} ugly parts of American life. Rockwell's response to this criticism was, [...] "I paint life as I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> to be." [...] Rockwell made it known that he hoped these would be his masterpieces, but was disappointed. Nonetheless, he was satisfied with the public acceptance of the series and that the series was able to serve such a patriotic purpose. Laura Claridge feels he might have achieved his ambition if he had pursued the [...] "quiet small scenes" [...] he later became known for.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} Naga Hex, the Naga Hex v2 {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with the major}} criticism being its button arrangement. Amanda Yeo of the website Gizmodo {{said that if the}} reader liked the Naga Hex, the Naga Hex v2 is a definite upgrade. She noted that newer users might be thrown off by the button configuration. Marshall Honorof's biggest criticism of the mouse was that [...] "most people won't need one", though he continued to say that for those who do, it would work exactly as expected. He said that at first, the button arrangement threw him off. Michael Crider of Digital Trends said that once the user gets used to the button layout, the actions are [...] "quick and responsive." [...] Matthew Buzzi of PC Magazine also believed that the user <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> if they play MOBAs, but if not, another mouse might be a better option.

500|$|Still underground, Picard discovers a {{computer}} terminal, which he activates, causing a hologram of the salesman to appear and explain they are witnessing {{a demonstration of}} an intelligent weapon system which is able to upgrade in response to any enemy threat. Picard surmises that the Minosians and the Drake were destroyed by the weapons. He unsuccessfully attempts to coerce the hologram to end the demonstration. Data is able to locate Picard, and determines that while the sentries could be set to destroy their own power source, the resulting explosion would probably take out the whole area, including the away-team. Picard finally tells the salesman he will buy the system, causing the salesman to disappear and the probes on the planet to shut down. Meanwhile, La Forge uses the planet's atmosphere to reveal {{the location of the}} space-born probe and destroys it.

500|$|Ultimately, Lee {{spent over}} {{two and a}} half years writing To Kill a Mockingbird. The book was {{published}} on July 11, 1960. After rejecting the [...] "Watchman" [...] title, it was initially re-titled Atticus, but Lee renamed it [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird" [...] to reflect that the story went beyond just a character portrait. The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies. In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said, [...] "I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.'...I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected." [...] Instead of a [...] "quick and merciful death", Reader's Digest Condensed Books chose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately. Since the original publication, the book has never been out of print.|$|E
500|$|Just {{days before}} the episodes were set to {{transmit}} Channel 4 {{announced that it was}} axing the storyline, due in part to Fergus's reaction to the storyline. Whilst Walton had previously claimed the storyline was about three twelve-year-old girls, Channel 4 admitted the similarities between the story and the Bulger case. [...] "This particular storyline was not based on any real life case and was not intended to recreate actual events. However, after conversations with Denise Fergus we have agreed to amend certain aspects of the storyline." [...] Amber Hodgkiss, who was cast to play Chrissy, expressed her disappointment over the decision to axe the plot all together saying, [...] "The storyline has been completely cut. I am not so happy about it. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> to go ahead, but I don't have that decision. It wasn't based on Jamie Bulger, but people portrayed it that way. It was quite a big storyline that could affect people, but it happens." [...] Fergus said she was grateful that the plot was axed saying, [...] "I'm grateful that they are respecting my wishes. I made it clear that I did not want those scenes broadcast and I'm pleased to say they clearly understood my feelings." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Empire State of Mind" [...] {{was created}} by singer-songwriter-producer Angela Hunte, a native of Brooklyn, along with writing partner Jane't [...] "Jnay" [...] Sewell-Ulepic. Hunte {{grew up in the}} same {{building}} where rapper and hip hop artist Jay-Z lived—560 State Street, an address which is mentioned in the song. The track's creation was inspired during an overseas trip Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic made to London in February 2009 when they were both feeling homesick. Hunte was ill during that summer, while Sewell-Ulepic's mother was ill. Hunte recalls, [...] "We said to ourselves, 'we complain so much about New York—about the busy streets, about the crowds and the pushing, about the subway system—but I would trade that for anything right now.' Before we left the hotel that night, we knew we would write a song about our city." [...] Although they wrote the song as a simple way to voice their feelings for their hometown, they sent it to the Roc Nation music label the following month in hope that Jay-Z <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> and record it. When they received negative reviews about the track they were convinced it would never be recorded. However, in the summer of the same year, EMI Music Publishing's (EMI) Jon [...] "Big Jon" [...] Platt heard the track at a barbecue {{and fell in love with}} it, believing that [...] "it would be perfect for Jay-Z".|$|E
