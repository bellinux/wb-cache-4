Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for Suntory whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that he might never be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he {{would never be able to}} film his stories.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Columbia Pictures {{president}} Peter Schlessel began <b>working</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> studio {{system to}} produce a Halo film adaptation. Alex Garland wrote the first script, which was then pitched to studios by couriers dressed as Master Chief. Microsoft's terms required $10 million against 15percent of gross; most studios passed, citing the lack of risk for Microsoft compared to their large share of potential profits. 20th Century Fox and Universal Studios decided to partner to produce the film, paying Microsoft $5 million to option the film and 10percent of grosses. Peter Jackson was slated to be the executive producer, with Neill Blomkamp as director. Before Blomkamp signed on, Guillermo del Toro was in negotiations to direct.|$|E

25|$|During the 20th century, {{the most}} {{significant}} global shift in women's paid employment came from the spread of global travel {{and the development of}} a large migrant workforce of women domestic workers seeking jobs outside of their native country. The Philippines is a major source of female domestic workers. Before the 1990s, the majority of Filipinos <b>working</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Philippines were male, but by 2012, an estimated 63% of Filipinos working overseas were female.|$|E

In 1873, Caillebotte entered the École des Beaux-Arts, but apparently did not spend much time there. He inherited his father's fortune in 1874 and the surviving sons divided the family fortune after their mother's death in 1878. Around 1874, Caillebotte met and befriended several artists <b>working</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Académie des Beaux-Arts, including Edgar Degas and Giuseppe de Nittis, and he attended (but did not participate in) the first Impressionist exhibition of 1874.|$|E

25|$|When a person’s {{capabilities}} are lowered, {{they are in}} some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise. An old, ill man cannot earn {{as much as a}} healthy young man; gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or <b>working</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> home. There may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic, or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from going to work for fear of their lives. As a result, income and economic inequality increases, and it becomes more difficult to reduce the gap without additional aid. To prevent such inequality, this approach believes it’s important to have political freedom, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security to ensure that people aren’t denied their functionings, capabilities, and agency and can thus work towards a better relevant income.|$|E
25|$|When men {{left their}} factory jobs to fight overseas, women {{stepped up to}} fill their {{positions}} in mass. These jobs became essential during the war when munitions supplies became vital to the war effort. Women excelled in these historically male-dominated roles. Some conservative protesters, rallied against women leaving the home as they argued this would hurt the traditional family ideals. This was especially true in Quebec, where the strong-arm of the Catholic Church kept many women from <b>working</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> home. The government supported this new essential workforce by creating the first government run daycares. Though women shined in these positions and were even recruited in industrial communities, the jobs remained extremely gendered and women were expected to leave the factories when veterans returned home. Women’s work in factory during the second war {{is the most important}} role played by women on the home front.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, John W. Campbell became editor of Astounding Science Fiction, and a {{critical}} mass of new writers emerged in New York City in a group called the Futurians, including Isaac Asimov, Damon Knight, Donald A. Wollheim, Frederik Pohl, James Blish, Judith Merril, and others. Other important writers during this period include E.E. (Doc) Smith, Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, Olaf Stapledon, and A. E. van Vogt. <b>Working</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Campbell influence were Ray Bradbury and Stanisław Lem. Campbell's tenure at Astounding is considered to be the beginning of the Golden Age of science fiction, characterized by hard SF stories celebrating scientific achievement and progress. This lasted until post-war technological advances, new magazines such as Galaxy, edited by H. L. Gold, and a new generation of writers began writing stories with less emphasis on the hard sciences and more on the social sciences.|$|E

25|$|The {{confined}} {{gender roles}} for females allow {{the strength of}} characters such as Grace and Blanche to remain hidden. They're manipulation, sneaking, and hiding from the law is only successful because they are women. Both are believed by the other characters in the novel to be too submissive, shallow, and dim-witted {{to get away with}} their goals. Blanche soon discovers that she can unravel more of Grace and Everett's treacherous plot to inherit Mumsfield's money because she is in the house, whereas Nate, as a man, is <b>working</b> <b>outside.</b> <b>The</b> biggest twist, that Grace is the mass murderer and plotter of cheating her family out of their fortune, exposes the sexist notions that the readers themselves have rooted into their culture. Throughout the plot, Everett seems to be the most likely suspect to the murders and manipulation of the will, all the while making it easier for Grace to get away with mass murdering anyone in her path. Even though, the heroine and the villain of this novel evoke different emotions from the readers, there is a larger feminist theme in play that is made possible by taking advantage of the cloak of invisibility that society has placed over women.|$|E
25|$|In post-Roman times {{political}} {{problems in the}} Wadi El Natrun area disrupted the supply of natron so alternatives had to be developed. Eastern glassmakers reverted to using sodium-rich plant ash {{and for a while}} supplied southern Europe, using existing Roman trade routes, however, the Venetian glassmakers, who had inherited the Roman glassmaking skills, monopolised the trade in plant ash and banned craftsmen from <b>working</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> city. The rest of Europe, north of the Alps, had to find another way of producing glass. The former and stabiliser components of glass occur in all regions as sand or quartz and as lime of various forms. The northern Europeans experimented with using ash from wood, ferns, and bracken as a source of the alkali flux. At its height the Roman glass industry was producing high quality, thin, colourless, and clear glass of consistent composition. The earlier surviving Forest glass vessels are characterised by a wide variety of compositions and lower quality, often being greenish to brownish in colour, thick-walled, and with inclusions and bubbles in the fabric. This suggests that using wood-ash was not just a case of changing the raw material, but necessitated a whole new technology with attendant development problems.|$|E

500|$|The miners {{found that}} the row of cottages that served as their homes had been devastated {{and some of their}} {{families}} killed, seemingly at random. One found his family alive and safe in a makeshift hospital, but another emerged to discover his wife and four children had died. Fifteen-year-old Lillian Clark, working a late shift that night in the town's boarding house, had been given permission to stay overnight for the first time. She was the only member of her family to survive. [...] Her father was <b>working</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> mine when the slide hit, while her mother and six siblings were buried in their home. [...] All 12 men living at the CPR work camp were killed, but 128 more who were scheduled to move into the camp the day before the slide had not arrived—the train that was supposed to take them there from Morrissey, British Columbia, failed to pick them up. The Spokane Flyer, a passenger train heading west from Lethbridge, was saved by CPR brakeman Sid Choquette, one of two men who rushed across the rock-strewn ground to warn the train that the track had been buried under the slide. Through falling rocks and a dust cloud that impaired his visibility, Choquette ran for [...] to warn the oncoming locomotive of the danger. The CPR gave him a letter of commendation and a $25 cheque in recognition of his heroism.|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, Keef {{was dropped}} by Interscope Records, but {{confirmed}} via Twitter that every project he had planned, including {{the release of}} the long-awaited Bang 3 would still be released, as he planned. Young Chop criticized Interscope's decision to drop Keef. Despite being set for a Christmas 2014 release, Bang 3 did not materialize. Keef's mixtapes, Mansion Musick, which was set for a November 28 release, and Thot Breakers, which was set to release on February 14, 2015, were also noted to not release as scheduled. However, Keef was successful in releasing Big Gucci Sosa, a 12-track collaborative mixtape, with Gucci Mane, as well as Back From the Dead 2, which was made available for digital download from iTunes. Keef experimented with the production of his own tracks, self-producing 16 of the 20 songs on the mixtape. David Drake of Pitchfork Media, stated, [...] "For his first steps into rapper-producer territory, he shows promise—though it's tough to imagine most of these beats <b>working</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> context of a Chief Keef album, as they are primed to frame his vocals." [...] Rolling Stone ranked the mixtape 25th on its list of the 40 best rap albums of 2014, with the publication commenting, [...] "The bleak world from which he came still shapes his sound; it's a bleak and lonely record, with few guests and a darkly psychedelic shape formed by drugs and likely PTSD. Yet he finds a gleeful humanity inside the world's rotten core, with bluntly potent, economical rapping that gets strong mileage per word." [...] In November, Keef announced Nobody, a [...] "Glo Producer album" [...] that featured guest vocals from Kanye West and Tadoe. The album was set to be released on December 2, but was ultimately released on December 16. The album's title track was noted for being one of Keef's more emotionally driven outputs, with Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound writing, [...] "the track itself feels like the apex of a night spent binge-drinking." [...] Additionally, the album was awarded a 7.0/10 score by Pitchfork Medias Meaghan Garvey.|$|E
