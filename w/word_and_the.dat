5|$|Hatoful Boyfriend is an {{interactive}} text-based visual novel that follows a branching plot line, with the player's decisions determining {{which of the}} game's multiple endings they receive. The title is a pun on the wasei-eigo <b>word</b> , <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Japanese word , as the game features pigeons and other birds as major characters. The game {{is set in a}} version of Earth populated by sapient birds, and its main story follows the player character and protagonist—the only human attending St. PigeoNation's Institute, an elite school for birds—as she finds love among her avian acquaintances.|$|E
5|$|After the action, {{one of the}} English privateers quarrelled {{with one}} of his French shipmates and stabbed him in the back, killing him. Before a riot between the French and English sailors could begin, Morgan arrested the English sailor, and promised the French sailors that the man would be hanged on his return to Port Royal. Morgan kept his <b>word</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sailor was hanged. After {{dividing}} the spoils of the conquest of Puerto Principe, Morgan announced a plan to attack Porto Bello (now in modern-day Panama). The city was the third largest and strongest on the Spanish Main, and on one of the main routes of trade between the Spanish territories and Spain. Because {{of the value of the}} goods passing through its port, Porto Bello was protected by two castles in the harbour and another in the town. The 200 French privateers, unhappy with the division of the treasure and the murder of their countryman, left Morgan's service and returned to Tortuga. Morgan and his ships briefly landed at Port Royal before leaving for Porto Bello.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius {{listed the}} Gospel of the Hebrews in his Antilegomena {{as one of}} the disputed {{writings}} of the early Church. Despite this, the Church Fathers occasionally used it, with reservations, as a source to support their exegetical arguments. Eusebius reports that the 2nd century Church Father Hegesippus used the gospel as a source for writing his Hypomneumata ("Memoranda") in Rome (c.175–180). The Alexandrian Fathers – Clement, Origen, and Didymus the Blind – relied directly on the gospel to provide prooftexts as a supplement to the canonical gospels. Clement quoted from the gospel as part of a discourse on divine Wisdom. Origen used it to compare differing views {{of the relationship between the}} <b>Word</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit. Jerome claimed to have used the gospel as a prooftext, although he may have relied in part on excerpts from the commentaries of Origen. He quoted from it as a proof from prophecy based on Isaiah11.2 to explain how Jesus was the fulfillment of messianic expectations. The Gospel of the Hebrews was excluded from the canon by the Catholic Church with the closing of the New Testament canon at the end of the 4th century, and was no longer cited as a source in Church literature.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{describing how}} brand names with English in Indonesian products are created. To {{analyze the data}} found the researchers applied English word formation in English morphology. This is a descriptive research. The data were brand names using English found in Indonesian product which were taken from three supermarkets in Solo namely Hypermart Solo Grand Mall, Hypermart Gorro Assalam, and Carefur from February up to April 2010. The research found that the brand names with English in Indonesian products can be created by applying word formation such as compounding, blending, affixation, reduplication, onomatopoeia, abbreviation, acronym <b>and</b> clipping. <b>The</b> process of compounding consists of pure compounding <b>and</b> modification compounding, <b>The</b> process of blending includes the first syllable of <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first syllable of the second words, the first syllable of <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second syllable {{from the front of}} the second <b>words.,</b> <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> last syllables of the second <b>words,</b> <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> <b>and</b> two syllables {{from the front of the}} second words, two syllables from the front of <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second <b>words,</b> two syllables from the front of <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first syllable of the second <b>words,</b> <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two last syllables from the back of <b>the</b> second <b>words,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first syllables of the second words. The affixation process covers prefixes pro-, -bio and suffixes –y, - er, -ness, -ish, <b>and</b> –s. <b>The</b> process of reduplication includes pure modification, modification with intensifier meaning and reduplication with sound change. The process of abbreviation found is pure abbreviation <b>and</b> acronym. <b>The</b> process of clipping includes the clipping of letter and syllables...|$|R

25|$|The {{emphasis}} (italic) sign marks emphatic formatting, {{equivalent to}} printed italic, bold, underlined, and small-capital text. A single italic sign emphasizes the entire word (or number). For {{two or three}} emphasized words, each takes a separate marker. For longer texts, a doubled marker is placed before the first <b>word,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> end of the emphasis is indicated by marking the final emphasized word with a single italic sign.|$|E
25|$|The {{inferential}} view of TOTs {{claims that}} TOTs arise from {{clues about the}} target that the rememberer can piece together. This {{is to say that}} the rememberer infers their knowledge of the target <b>word,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> imminence of retrieval depends upon the information that they are able to access about the target word from their memory. These views disregard the presence of the target word in memory as having an effect on creating tip of the tongue states.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} that blockers act more like retrieval cues is mainly {{supported by the}} idea of phonological similarities between the target <b>word</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> blocker word. Phonological blockers are words that sound similar to the target word. According to Bown & Harley, “phonological neighbours (of blockers) usually act as support in lexical retrieval rather than as a hindrance”. In contrast, there is also an argument that phonological blockers hinder the ability to retrieve the target word causing a tip of the tongue state.|$|E

25|$|This runestone {{is located}} in Berga and is {{classified}} as being carved in runestone style Fp. It was carved by the same runemaster as the Ingvar runestone Vs 19. Similar to the inscription on U 194, the runic text has an example where a single rune was used for two consecutive letters with one {{at the end of}} one <b>word</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other at the start of a second word. The runemaster on both Vs 18 and Vs 19 used the same runes trekuþan which were transliterated to show two letters and separate words as trek| |kuþan. Vs 18 and Vs 19 were also sponsored by the same person, Gunnvaldr.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{initiation}} ceremony the candidate, often a ploughboy, {{was told to}} come to the barn where the ceremonial procedures were to take place, normally held between 11pm and 1 am. Once at the door he was blindfolded and taken before the master of ceremonies, who was often an elder ploughman. As in Masonic rituals there was then a prearranged and established exchange of questions and answers that was to be given. In the case of the Horseman's <b>Word</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Miller's Word this exchange was often a parody of catechism. After this was completed the inductee was then asked to seal the pact and shake hands with the devil, which would often be a branch or pole covered in animal fur.|$|E
25|$|To {{look more}} closely at this issue, Saffran Aslin and Newport {{conducted}} another study in which infants underwent the same training with the artificial grammar but then were presented with either words or part-words rather than words or nonwords. The part-words were syllable sequences composed of the last syllable from one <b>word</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first two syllables from another (such as kupado). Because the part-words had been heard during the time when children were listening to the artificial grammar, preferential listening to these part-words would indicate that children were learning not only serial-order information, but also the statistical likelihood of hearing particular syllable sequences. Again, infants showed greater listening times to the novel (part-) words, indicating that 8-month-old infants were able to extract these statistical regularities from a continuous speech stream.|$|E
25|$|This secluded runestone {{is located}} in a grove near Väsby, Uppland, Sweden. It was raised by a Viking in {{commemoration}} of his receiving one danegeld in England. It is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr3 and, together with U 344, it has been said to be the earliest example of an Urnes style inscription in Uppland. The runic text follows a common rule to only carve a single rune for two consecutive letters, even when the letters were {{at the end of one}} <b>word</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> beginning of a second word. When the text shown as Latin characters, the transliterated runes are doubled and separate words are shown. For U 194 has three examples where this occurred, þinoftiʀ is transliterated as þino| |oftiʀ, tuknuts as tuk| |knuts, and anklanti as a| |anklanti.|$|E
