5000|$|On September 8, 2014 {{an appeal}} by the Barbra Schlifer Clinic to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to rule that <b>the</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-restricted {{firearms}} <b>registration</b> requirement was unconstitutional was denied. The applicants sought {{to show that}} <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> requirement denied women their rights under <b>the</b> Charter <b>of</b> Rights and Freedoms to: [...] "life, liberty and security <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person". In its judgment {{the court ruled that}} there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> non-restricted firearms had been of any measurable benefit to women and that statistically rates of firearms-related violence had been following a trend downward before the requirement was introduced and had not changed after the requirement had been withdrawn.|$|R
50|$|One {{disadvantage}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Madrid {{system is}} that any refusal, <b>withdrawal</b> or cancellation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basic application or basic registration within five years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international <b>registration</b> {{will lead to the}} refusal, <b>withdrawal</b> or cancellation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international <b>registration</b> to <b>the</b> same extent. For example, if a basic application covers 'clothing, headgear and footwear,' and 'headgear' is then deleted from the basic application (for whatever reason), 'headgear' will also be deleted from the international application. Therefore, the protection afforded by <b>the</b> international <b>registration</b> in each designated member jurisdiction will only extend to 'clothing and footwear.' If the basic application is rejected as a whole, <b>the</b> international <b>registration</b> would also be totally refused.|$|R

40|$|Pruritus {{can be a}} {{distressing}} symptom seen {{in various}} cholestatic disorders. It is treated with medications like bile acid sequestrants.

40|$|With the {{advancement}} {{in the digital}} camera technology, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> high resolution images and videos has been widespread in the modern society. In particular, image and video frame registration is frequently applied in computer graphics and film production. However, <b>the</b> conventional <b>registration</b> approaches usually require long computational time for high quality images and video frames. This hinders <b>the</b> applications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> approaches in <b>the</b> modern industries. In this work, we propose a novel approach called TRIM to accelerate <b>the</b> computations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> by triangulating <b>the</b> images. More specifically, given a high resolution image or video frame, we compute an optimal coarse triangulation which captures <b>the</b> important features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image. Then, <b>the</b> computation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> can be simplified with <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coarse triangulation. Experimental results suggest that <b>the</b> computational time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> is significantly reduced using our triangulation-based approach, meanwhile <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> is well retained {{when compared with the}} conventional grid-based approach...|$|R
