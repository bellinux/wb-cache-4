500|$|The American {{release of}} Modern Life Is Rubbish {{features}} an altered track listing. Blur's American label SBK Records preferred the group's original demo of [...] "Chemical World", and included {{it on the}} album instead of the Stephen Street-produced version. According to Select magazine, this [...] "defeated the object of recording a heavy rock song in the first place". SBK inserted [...] "Popscene" [...] between [...] "Turn It Up" [...] and [...] "Resigned"; Blur had refused to include [...] "Popscene" [...] on the British version of Modern Life, disappointed by the tepid response it received when it was released as a single. [...] "We thought, If you didn’t fucking <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the first place," [...] Coxon told Select, [...] "you’re {{not going to get}} it now". The American version also features several tracks with a few seconds of silence (tracks 18 to 67 on the CD), followed by two [...] "For Tomorrow" [...] B-sides ("When the Cows Come Home" [...] and [...] "Peach") as hidden tracks 68 and 69.|$|E

[...] "You would think that I wouldn't be the one who was embarrassed; I was extremely embarrassed. I really didn't even <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> there. I offered Todd's assistant {{a lot of money to}} convince him to take it out of the movie. I did. But it made it in there." ...|$|E

One intrepid team of ladies takes a stand and fights for their right to party by competing in a quirky 80's-themed talent show.

2500|$|Album of the Year was {{released}} in 1997 and featured yet another new guitarist, Jon Hudson, who was a former roommate of Billy Gould. The album debuted much higher than expected in some countries (for example, in Germany, the album debuted at No.2 and stayed in the chart for 5 months). In Australia, Album of the Year went to No.1 and was certified Platinum. The album charted in many countries in Europe. To date, Album of the Year has sold around 2 million copies worldwide. [...] The singles [...] "Ashes to Ashes" [...] and [...] "Last Cup of Sorrow" [...] had minimal success (notably, the music video for [...] "Last Cup of Sorrow", which featured actress Jennifer Jason Leigh, {{was inspired by the}} Alfred Hitchcock film Vertigo). [...] "Stripsearch" [...] {{was released}} as a single in various countries (excluding the US and UK). The album received largely negative reviews from US-based critics at the time. Rolling Stone magazine wrote in their original review [...] " [...] are floundering around desperately, groping for a sense of identity and direction in a decade that clearly finds them irrelevant", while Pitchfork Media stated [...] "Album Of The Year leaves one feeling like waking up and finding last night's used condom -- sure, the ride was fun while it lasted, but what remains is just plain icky. And you definitely don't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> your CD player." ...|$|E
