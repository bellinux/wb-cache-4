5|$|Wilson had a combative {{streak and}} {{sometimes}} initiated fights with opposing players and fans. On June 22, 1928, a near-riot {{broke out in}} the ninth inning at Wrigley Field against the St. Louis Cardinals when Wilson jumped into the box seats to attack a heckling fan. An estimated 5,000 spectators swarmed the field before police could separate the combatants and restore order. The fan sued Wilson for $20,000, but a jury ruled in his favor. The following year he took offense at a remark by Cincinnati Reds pitcher Ray Kolp, and – upon reaching first base after hitting a single – he charged into the Reds dugout, punching Kolp several times before they could be separated. Later that evening at the train station, Wilson exchanged words and blows with Cincinnati player Pete Donohue. In late 1929 he signed a contract to fight Art Shires of the Chicago White Sox in a boxing match, but reneged after Cubs president William Veeck, Sr. enlisted Hack's wife Virginia to dissuade him, and then Shires lost a fight to George Trafton of the Chicago Bears. There was nothing to gain, <b>Wilson</b> <b>said,</b> by fighting a defeated boxer.|$|E
25|$|At the Committee of Imperial Defence meeting {{after the}} Agadir Crisis the First Sea Lord Admiral Arthur <b>Wilson</b> <b>said</b> {{that in the}} event of war the Navy planned to land the Army on the Baltic Coast. Nicholson asked Wilson whether the Admiralty had maps of German {{strategic}} railways (to show how the Germans could rush reinforcements to invasion spots), and when <b>Wilson</b> <b>said</b> it was not the Admiralty’s business to have such maps, Nicholson openly rebuked him and said that if the Navy “meddled” in military matters they needed not just to have such maps but to have studied them. Prime Minister H.H. Asquith ordered the Navy to fall in with the Army’s plans to deploy an Expeditionary Force to France.|$|E

25|$|In {{the midst}} of a tight race, Carnahan died in an {{airplane}} crash two weeks prior to the election. Ashcroft suspended all campaigning after the plane crash. Because of Missouri state election laws and the short time to election, Carnahan's name remained on the ballot. Lieutenant Governor Roger Wilson became governor upon Carnahan's death. <b>Wilson</b> <b>said</b> that should Carnahan be elected, he wanted to appoint his widow, Jean Carnahan, to serve in her husband's place; Mrs. Carnahan announced that, in accordance with her late husband's goal, she would serve in the Senate if voters elected his name. Following these developments, Ashcroft resumed campaigning.|$|E
25|$|Rebuffed by Congress, Wilson {{announced}} on April 30, 1980, Statehood Day in Louisiana, {{that he would}} challenge Leach in the 1980 nonpartisan blanket primary. A Shreveport Journal poll showed Wilson with a slim lead {{at the time in}} a potential re-run of a race against Leach. There was, however, a large bloc of uncommitted voters. <b>Wilson</b> <b>said</b> that he expected to raise and spend $500,000 for the second race because national Republicans had again targeted the Fourth District as one of 35 in the nation where the GOP stood a chance of winning a Democratic seat.|$|E
25|$|Claiming {{continental}} European solidarity, de Gaulle again rejected British entry {{when they}} next applied {{to join the}} community in December 1967 under the Labour leadership of Harold Wilson. During negotiations, de Gaulle chided Britain for relying {{too much on the}} Americans, saying that sooner or later they would always do what was in their best interests. <b>Wilson</b> <b>said</b> he then gently raised the spectre of the threat of a newly powerful Germany {{as a result of the}} EEC, which de Gaulle agreed was a risk. After de Gaulle left office the United Kingdom applied again and finally became a member of the EEC in January 1973.|$|E

25|$|After {{losing the}} World Series the Astros {{prepared}} for the offseason by signing Preston Wilson and moving Lance Berkman to first base, ending the long tenure by Jeff Bagwell. The Astros resigned pitcher Roger Clemens and traded two minor league prospects to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for left-handed hitter Aubrey Huff and cash. In August 2006, Preston <b>Wilson</b> <b>said</b> that he wasn't getting enough playing time since Luke Scott returned from AAA ball with the Round Rock Express. In response the Astros released Wilson and the division rival Cardinals signed him {{for the rest of}} the season. After a dramatic last two weeks of the season, including a four-game sweep of the Cardinals, the Astros did not get to the playoffs losing their last game to the Braves, 3–1. The Astros had managed to win 10 of their last 12 games of the season, and all but erased what had been an 8½ game lead by the front running St. Louis Cardinals. The Astros were within a ½ game of the Cardinals on Thursday September 28, but that is as close as the 2005 NL Champions would get.|$|E
