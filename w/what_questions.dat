25|$|After {{returning}} from World War I, Crosby attended Harvard {{in the spring}} of 1919 under an accelerated program for veterans. He took 19 courses, six in French (which he read and spoke fluently) and six in English literature. The remainder of his courses were in fine arts, music, Spanish, and social ethics. Taking his studies very lightly, he {{thought he was going to}} fail, and paid a knowledgeable man who was familiar with <b>what</b> <b>questions</b> would be asked on the exams to tutor him. He graduated with a BA in 1921.|$|E
25|$|Grand jury {{proceedings}} (without {{defense counsel}} {{and without a}} judge present) in Santa Barbara, starting in March 2004, led to Jackson's indictment on April 21, 2004. The grand jury had nineteen jurors; the indictment required the votes of at least twelve jurors. Prosecution witnesses testified without defense cross-examination. The judge ruled that witnesses {{before the grand jury}} could talk to defense attorneys about their knowledge of the case as long as the witnesses did not tell what they saw in the grand jury room or <b>what</b> <b>questions</b> they were asked and their answers. Many grand jury witnesses were sneaked into the building where the grand jury was meeting, sometimes covered in blankets to hide their identities. In February 2005 The Smoking Gun published the Grand Jury transcripts (1903 pages).|$|E
2500|$|Garson was {{subsequently}} indicted and arrested in April 2003 {{outside of his}} Upper East Side apartment. He was charged with having accepted cash and other gifts from Siminovsky, as payment for preferential treatment. The treatment included Judge Garson privately coaching Siminovsky as to <b>what</b> <b>questions</b> he should ask, and what arguments he should use. [...] Garson would then rule in Siminovsky's favor. This violated the rules of judicial conduct, which prohibit a judge from speaking privately with an attorney who has a case pending, without the presence or permission of the opposing attorney.|$|E

2500|$|New Jersey Democratic {{political}} leaders lambasted Christie and the lane closings. Sokolich called them [...] "a petty political vendetta," [...] while Barbara Buono contended that {{a culture of}} intimidation and retribution engendered by Christie and his staff hampered funding of a challenger even though the state was mostly Democratic. The Democratic National Committee released a video in December 2013 that raised questions if [...] "Christie's political payback" [...] was behind the toll lane closures. It released a satirical video, timed {{to coincide with the}} January Assembly hearing, about <b>what</b> <b>questions</b> still needed to be answered. At the beginning of February, it released an online video ad with a Super Bowl 48-inspired, football game theme. It was followed soon after by a video that parodied Facebook's popular [...] "Look Back" [...] videos.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kuhn, the {{scientific}} paradigms preceding and succeeding {{a paradigm shift}} are so different that their theories are incommensurable [...] the new paradigm cannot be proven or disproven {{by the rules of}} the old paradigm, and vice versa. (A later interpretation by Kuhn of 'commensurable' versus 'incommensurable' was as a distinction between languages, namely, that statements in commensurable languages were translatable fully from one to the other, while in incommensurable languages, strict translation is not possible.) The paradigm shift does not merely involve the revision or transformation of an individual theory, it changes the way terminology is defined, how the scientists in that field view their subject, and, perhaps most significantly, <b>what</b> <b>questions</b> are regarded as valid, and what rules are used to determine the truth of a particular theory. The new theories were not, as the scientists had previously thought, just extensions of old theories, but were instead completely new world views.|$|E
2500|$|Once formed, first {{impressions}} {{tend to be}} stable. A {{review of the literature}} on the accuracy and impact of {{first impressions}} on rater-based assessments found that raters' first impressions are highly correlated with later scores, but it is unclear exactly why. One study tested stability by asking participants to form impressions people based purely on photographs. Participants' opinions of the people in photographs did not significantly differ after interacting with that person a month later. One potential reason for this stability is that one's first impressions could serve as a guide for his/her next steps, such as <b>what</b> <b>questions</b> are asked and how raters go about scoring. More research needs to be done on the stability of first impressions to fully understand how first impressions guide subsequent treatment, self-fulfilling prophecies, and the halo effect. Assessment tools can influence impressions too, for example if a question provides only a dichotomous [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no" [...] response or if a rater uses a scale (ratio). Although this study was conducted with the intention of improving rating methods in medical education, the literature review was sufficiently broad enough to generalize.|$|E

2500|$|Count 1 of {{the charges}} was {{conspiracy}} to commit child abduction, false imprisonment, and extortion. Janet Arvizo claimed {{she and her family}} had been held captive at Neverland as well as at a couple of hotels when traveling with Jackson. She expressed her mistrust of [...] "the Germans," [...] Dieter Weisner and Ron Konitzer. She testified that they pretended to want to protect her, telling her the rebuttal video [...] "would appease the killers," [...] but that [...] "Michael, Ronald, Dieter, Frank, and Vinnie...ended up being the killers." [...] At one point, Janet testified that she'd known <b>what</b> <b>questions</b> she'd be asked in the rebuttal video, that Frank [...] "went over" [...] them with her on the phone beforehand and told her to praise Michael. [...] On another day of her testimony, she claimed [...] "the Germans" [...] had scripted every word of the video, even the hand-holding, laughing, and the outtakes when they appear to think the camera isn't on, and the Germans had [...] "worked with [...] daily, numerous times" [...] to learn it all. House manager Jesus Salas testified that the accuser's mother was at no time held at Neverland against her will and that she had never complained of her children being taken advantage of at Neverland. Other staff testified that the idea that the family were prisoners of Neverland was ludicrous, that there was no fence surrounding the property and that the guards did not carry weapons. [...] During their alleged captivity, the Arvizos took shopping trips into town, billing $3,312.05 worth of purchases to Michael Jackson. They also met with their lawyer and visited a Federal building during this time, making phone calls to various people, though never the police. [...] Janet testified that she was dropping hints [...] "in code" [...] about her kidnapping during the calls, and explained that she never openly asked anyone for help because of the death threats Jackson's co-conspirators allegedly made toward her parents. Janet and Star claimed that Jackson was preventing them from knowing times or dates. When Mesereau pointed out that there were clocks visible [...] "almost everywhere" [...] in Neverland, including a giant [...] "flower clock" [...] on a prominent hill, Star admitted that he was surrounded by clocks but claimed that they had the wrong times. Janet's claims included that she was restricted to [...] "one meal per day," [...] and that Jackson's associates had threatened to make her children [...] "disappear" [...] via hot-air balloon. The Arvizos [...] "escaped" [...] Neverland three times (in Rolls-Royces and limos) but were [...] "convinced" [...] to return each time. When the prosecution presented a complicated chart of phone calls between Jackson's [...] "unindicted co-conspirators" [...] trying to show that they were scheming about the Arvizos' captivity, they accidentally proved that Jackson was not even at Neverland for several of the days during the 2 1/2-week time frame given for the alleged molestation and may have been in Miami the day the molestation and conspiracy were alleged to have started.|$|E
