In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E

500|$|T. R. Knight {{signed on}} for the pilot as O'Malley, expecting that the role might be short-lived, because he liked that the {{character}} was multi-faceted.

500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like {{we could go to}} New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's {{part of the reason that}} when <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> it, we said, 'You know what? This season let's stay in L.A.' Because so much of L.A. still looks like it did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something we had talked about in the middle of the first season... we realized that not only was it a good idea for the storytelling, but also...it's much easier for us to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E

The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled. My dad {{had to take care of}} my mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn't understand why we weren't there. You ask yourself maybe we could have stopped it. But you can't really answer the question. There's always gonna be that question of why."

[...] This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour, which according to Gaga was [...] "another level from where we were with the Fame Ball. [...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to." [...] Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that {{she did not want to}} use any of the things that they had designed together.

On May 12, 2016, the pilot was passed on by ABC, with Lee's successor Channing Dungey explaining that Most Wanted [...] "did not feel as strong as some of the other pilots that we shot. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> it with Marvel and we all came to an agreement that we want {{to figure out what the}} next show is that we do together, is something that we all feel is as creatively strong as it can be." [...] However, Dungey said that ABC was open to the series being shopped to another network if Marvel found [...] "another home" [...] for it.

500|$|While {{planning}} the fourth season, Marvel {{suggested that the}} series introduce Ghost Rider, after the character's film rights had returned to Marvel from Sony in May 2013. Loeb felt that this made the season unquestionably [...] "the series' biggest" [...] with the [...] "most ambitious story yet". He added that [...] "one {{of the things that}} <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> is, S.H.I.E.L.D. always looked out for the weird, the unusual, the things that were and could be a problem for the public," [...] and Marvel realized that Ghost Rider's abilities, which are more mystical than anything seen in the series to date, opened up [...] "a quarter of the universe that we haven't really {{spent a lot of time}} exploring ... what happens if our very real, our very grounded agents who are very much a family have to take on something that is as bizarre and powerful and unique as Ghost Rider." [...] Bell added that the producers would have been willing to give an entire season of the show to a Ghost Rider arc if the season was 13 episodes or less, but 22 episodes seemed too long to [...] "feel like one flavor".|$|E
