500|$|On September 3, 2013, after debuting several tracks from Artpop at the festival, Gaga polled {{her fans}} {{about how to}} promote the album, asking: [...] "OK MONSTERS! Now that you've seen some of ARTPOP Live, what <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>YOUR</b> pick for 2nd Single?" [...] Fans could choose between [...] "Aura", [...] "Manicure" [...] and [...] "Sexxx Dreams". At one point, the latter was in the lead by nearly 10,000 votes. However, the song was never {{selected}} as an official single.|$|E
500|$|Rediff.com stated: [...] "Sporting a new, rugged look, 'Prince' Mahesh Babu {{has stolen}} the show. He carries the film on his shoulders, {{consolidating}} his winning streak after last year's Athadu. Another {{highlight of the}} film is its well-choreographed action sequences (if you can digest the violence), which give it a slick look." [...] IndiaGlitz gave a positive review stating: [...] "In Pokiri, the hero is introduced to us a ruthless baddie, part of the huge underbelly of mafia. By the time we come to the denouement, there is much twist and turn. If you like some racy action, fun, glamour and love, then Pokiri <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> kind of film." ...|$|E

"From 1975 to 1979through execution, starvation, disease, {{and forced}} laborthe Khmer Rouge {{systematically}} killed an estimated two million Cambodians, almost {{a fourth of}} the country's population.

2500|$|Senator Kerry, after 9/11... {{it seemed}} to me that the country came {{together}} as I've never seen it come together since World War II. But some of that seems to have melted away. I think it's fair to say we've become pretty polarized, perhaps because of the political season. But if you were elected president, or whoever is elected president, will you set a priority in trying to bring the nation back together? Or what <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> attitude on that? ...|$|E

Despite this, Parkinson has since asserted that then as now, [...] "...there was just as much plugging in the seventies as at any time later. To suggest otherwise is to misunderstand the reason people come on to talk shows." [...] In particular, he cites Bette Davis as being the guest who [...] "more than anyone, made it clear she was there to plug a product, not because she was, or ever <b>would</b> <b>be,</b> <b>your</b> buddy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{need not}} <b>be</b> temptation. It <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> if <b>your</b> mind <b>were</b> full of <b>your</b> work--it <b>would</b> only <b>be</b> refreshment. I don't want my boy to turn stern, and dry, and ungenial. That <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> like <b>your</b> Rector." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{we should}} wish {{you to do}} {{whatever}} you thought <b>was</b> for <b>your</b> happiness, Ellen. We can't believe it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> for <b>your</b> good; but if it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> for <b>your</b> happiness, we <b>are</b> willing. Or, if you don't think it's for your happiness, but only for his, and you wish to do it, still we shall be willing, {{and you know that}} as far as your father and I are concerned, there will never be a word of reproach--not a whisper." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That did he, child, and at {{no small}} risk to his own: Then do I {{understand}} {{that such a}} marriage <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to <b>your</b> liking?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{know that}} they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> sort," [...] the {{landlord}} said, doubtfully. [...] "There's the clergyman--and the doctor----" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ben!" [...] exclaimed the other, [...] "you don't {{know what}} you are talking about! Captain Bonnet <b>would</b> <b>be</b> seized and tried as a pirate. His blood <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on <b>your</b> head, Ben!" ...|$|R

6000|$|Havill had {{recovered}} some coolness. 'You could {{not use it}} upon me,' he said sardonically, watching Dare. 'It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> risking <b>your</b> neck for too little an object.' ...|$|R
