5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his Test position, and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media figured this out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the whole season. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they <b>were</b> <b>blind.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the team}} was not {{announced}} at the scheduled time due to the delay caused by the veto. Journalists deduced the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks, missing all the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as {{to the nature of}} his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship regarding Barnes's behaviour was deposited in the NSWCA library. It accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by cupping his hands over his eyes and showing dissent by implying that they <b>were</b> <b>blind.</b>|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the teachers’ opinions about inclusion {{of children who are}} blind; the factors which may influence their opinions and what they think can be done to include children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in primary schools. It was a qualitative study which purposely involved five teachers from two primary schools. Data was collected through interviews. The centre of interest in the study was on the acceptance of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> by the teachers; participation of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in classroom and outdoor activities, benefits of placing children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in mainstream primary schools, the challenges of including children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in the mainstream and what teachers think ca be done to overcome such challenges. The study findings revealed that the nature of attitudes the teachers had towards children who <b>are</b> <b>blind,</b> additional disability and class size determined the teachers’ acceptance of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind.</b> The teachers also believed that children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> can <b>be</b> helped to participate in school activities through classroom and physical environmental modifications; curriculum modifications and provision of specialised equipment. Teachers felt that placement of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in the mainstream can make them achieve social benefits; academic benefits and acquire special skills. The study findings also revealed that for successful inclusion of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind,</b> teachers needed support in the provision of special specialised equipment; collaboration with other professionals; construction and equipping the resource rooms where remedial support for children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> can <b>be</b> exercised. The following challenges were expressed by the teachers: Lack of skills and competence, large class sizes and lack of specialised equipment. In order to overcome these challenges, teachers used various methods of teaching for example peer teaching, cooperative learning and team teaching. It is suggested that training and re-training of teachers in the filed of Special Needs Education, provision of specialised equipment, recruitment of more teachers and awareness seminars may help in the inclusion of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind...</b>|$|R

5|$|The most {{noticeable}} feature was the cranial crest, which protruded {{from the rear}} of the head and was made up of the premaxilla and nasal bones. William Parks, who named the genus, hypothesized that a ligament ran from the crest to the notch to support the head, and cited the presence of possibly pathological notch as evidence. Although this idea seems unlikely, Parasaurolophus is sometimes restored with a skin flap from the crest to the neck. The crest was hollow, with distinct tubes leading from each nostril to the end of the crest before reversing direction and heading back down the crest and into the skull. The tubes were simplest in P. walkeri, and more complex in P. tubicen, where some tubes <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> and others met and separated. While P. walkeri and P. tubicen had long crests with only slight curvature, P. cyrtocristatus had a short crest with a more circular profile.|$|E

25|$|There was a {{pandemic}} of rubella between 1962 and 1965, starting in Europe and spreading to the United States. In the years 1964–65, the United States had an estimated 12.5 million rubella cases. This led to 11,000 miscarriages or therapeutic abortions and 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome. Of these, 2,100 died as neonates, 12,000 were deaf, 3,580 <b>were</b> <b>blind,</b> and 1,800 were mentally retarded. In New York alone, CRS affected 1% of all births.|$|E
25|$|Herzen drew {{criticism}} from both liberals who were against violence and from radicals who thought Herzen was too soft. Liberals led by Boris Chicherin and Konstantin Kavelin believed individual freedom would {{be achieved through}} the rationalisation of social relations. Their etatist variety of liberalism was opposed by Herzen as it supposed that Russian society would evolve to an ideal state based on a Hegelian view of reason. They believed the revolutionaries would merely postpone {{the establishment of the}} ideal state, while Herzen thought that, on the contrary, they <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> to historical reality.|$|E

25|$|In African-American music, gospel quartets {{developed}} an a cappella style following the earlier {{success of the}} Fisk Jubilee Singers. The 1930s saw the Fairfield Four, the Dixie Hummingbirds, the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, the Five Blind Boys of Alabama, The Soul Stirrers, the Swan Silvertones, the Charioteers, and the Golden Gate Quartet. Racism divided the nation, and this division did not skip the church. If during slavery blacks were treated as inferior inside the white churches, after emancipation they formed their own separate churches. The gospel groups which were very popular within the black community, were virtually unknown to the white community, though some in the white community began to follow them. In addition to these high-profile quartets, there were many black gospel musicians performing in the 1920s and 30s, usually playing the guitar and singing {{in the streets of}} Southern cities. Famous among them <b>were</b> <b>Blind</b> Willie Johnson, Blind Joe Taggart and others.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} {{leadership of the}} British Army during the World War I was frequently condemned as poor by historians and politicians for decades after the war ended. Common charges were that the generals commanding the army <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> {{to the realities of}} trench warfare, ignorant of the conditions of their men and were unable to learn from their mistakes, thus causing enormous numbers of casualties ('lions led by donkeys'). However, during the 1960s historians such as John Terraine began to challenge this interpretation. In recent years as new documents have come forth and the passage of time has allowed for more objective analysis, historians such as Gary D. Sheffield and Richard Holmes observe that the {{military leadership}} of the British Army on the Western Front had to cope with many problems that they could not control such as a lack of adequate military communications, which was not known before. Furthermore, military leadership improved throughout the war culminating in the Hundred Days Offensive advance to victory in 1918. Some historians, even revisionists, still criticise the British High Command severely, but they are less inclined to portray the war in a simplistic manner with brave troops being led by foolish officers.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{expected}} to be eventually reimbursed, Waters Smith {{had to pay for}} the care of the Africans from his own pocket. (In the end, Smith was reimbursed for only part of what he had spent, and he had to mortgage his home to cover the rest.) To partially cover his expenses, he hired the Africans out to plantation owners at two dollars per month each. Boys too young for field work were placed as servants in private homes. Several of the men <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> or sick, and could not be put to work. At this point the condition of the Africans rescued from Guerrero was indistinguishable from slavery. The Africans were in a legal limbo. There were laws covering Africans seized while being illegally imported into the United States, but they did not apply to Africans who entered the country accidentally. In April 1828 President John Quincy Adams requested Congress to pass a supplementary law dealing with the Guerrero Africans, but it failed to act. A year later, in March 1829, Congress appropriated funds to reimburse Waters Smith and transport the Guerrero Africans to Liberia.|$|E

500|$|Balzac {{believed}} that the July Monarchy had brought a wave of poor leadership, and that people of quality and integrity were scorned {{in the name of}} cronyism.

Those in power <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> to the valuable minds being lost in their midst, as the students discover early in the story: [...] ("we were amazed at the brutal indifference of the authorities to everything connected with intellect, thought, and poetry"). Marcas' personal woes– and his tales of life within the corridors of power– strongly reinforce this view.|$|E
500|$|Initially Kertész took on {{commissioned}} work for several European magazines, gaining {{publication of his}} work in Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain. Soon after arriving in Paris, Kertész changed his first name to André, which he kept {{for the rest of}} his life. In Paris he found critical and commercial success. [...] In 1927 Kertész was the first photographer to have a one-man exhibition; Jan Slivinsky presented 30 of his photographs at the [...] "Sacre du Printemps Gallery". Kertész had become connected with members of the growing Dada movement. Paul Dermée dubbed him [...] "Brother Seer" [...] and [...] "Brother Seeing Eye" [...] during his first solo exhibit, alluding to a medieval monastery where all the monks <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> bar one. Over the next years, Kertész was featured in both solo exhibits and group shows.

Ellen Willis was particularly outspoken in her criticism of WAP and other feminist anti-pornography campaigns. Opposition to the kind of feminist anti-pornography politics espoused by WAP led to the rise of an opposing movement within feminism known as [...] "pro-sex feminism" [...] (a term coined by Willis).

40|$|Studies of how {{children}} who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> acquire and use language have focused less on cognitive compensations {{and more on}} delays in development. Vision {{is important in the}} establishment of early communicative patterns, and sighted children regularly use contextual visual information, such as a speaker's gestures and eye gaze, to make sense of speech that is directed at them (Mills, 1988). Some researchers have argued that, in the absence of vision, children may be expected to have more difficulty understanding concepts and the relationships between them and in acquiring generalizations about language and the way it works (Andersen, Dunlea, & Kekelis, 1993). In contrast, {{it has been argued that}} linguistic experience may be more important for children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> than for sighted children and that children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> may pay more attention to language (Chomsky, 1990; Perez-Pereira & Castro, 1997).
