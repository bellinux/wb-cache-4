5|$|Following {{his return}} to Norway Magnus led campaigns into Dalsland and Västergötland in Sweden, {{claiming}} an ancient border with the country. After two unsuccessful invasions {{and a number of}} skirmishes Danish king Eric Evergood initiated peace talks among the three Scandinavian monarchs, fearing that the conflict <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand. Magnus concluded peace with the Swedes in 1101 by agreeing to marry Margaret, daughter of the Swedish king Inge Stenkilsson. In return, Magnus gained Dalsland as part of her dowry. He set out on his final western campaign in 1102, and may have sought to conquer Ireland. Magnus entered into an alliance with Irish king Muirchertach Ua Briain of Munster, who recognised Magnus' control of Dublin. Under unclear circumstances, while obtaining food supplies for {{his return to}} Norway, Magnus was killed in an ambush by the Ulaid the next year; territorial advances characterising his reign ended with his death.|$|E
500|$|On June 29, Jiyuan reappeared in Beijing, telling reporters, [...] "I came to Beijing {{in search}} of help." [...] He {{said that he had}} made two {{unsuccessful}} attempts to flee from custody before succeeding on his third try. While his official monitors were on the phone, Jiyuan fled to a friend's home, where he remained for two days. He removed the sim card and battery from his cell phone to prevent being tracked. [...] "I did not sleep or get any new clothes, I could not risk being arrested," [...] he recalled. They rented a car and drove to Beijing, and Jiyuan recalled that [...] "I assumed there would be government people at the train station." [...] Whenever they neared police officers, he <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the car and walk to prevent being spotted.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Alonso Ruizpalacios, at the Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City, gathering 300 fans who responded to an invitation posted by Lafourcade in social networks. The singer asked her fans to send a thought inspired by the song or a personal story derived from their identification with [...] "Hasta la Raíz". [...] "I thought that we would get few answers, but received almost 800 responses immediately, and later {{it turned into a}} riot and we did not know if they <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control, but nothing happened, my fans are super cool," [...] Lafourcade told Variety Latino. In the video, shot in black and white, Lafourcade is surrounded by several people who lead her to a stage to perform {{the last part of the}} song, in the meantime, Lafourcade throws flowers in the air, kisses a guy and plays a guitar. According to Milly Contreras of Latin Post the video [...] "shows off the singer's individuality and simplicity" [...] and included it at number 7 in the list for the [...] "10 Best Latin Music Videos of 2015".|$|E

2500|$|A fan {{and season}} ticket holder of the Pitt men's {{basketball}} team, Paul Hipp entertained crowds {{from the late}} 1980s through the early 1990s. [...] During intermissions and time-outs, Panther Paul <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his seat and lead the crowd in cheers with a fist pumping motion. [...] His exuberant nature combined with short stature and portly appearance made him a fan favorite.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{government}} {{tried to stop the}} sermons, Falsafi did not stop his sermons until the end of Ramadan. [...] Throughout the 1950s the clergy continued to initiate the repression of the Bahá'í community; however, their efforts were checked by government ministers who, while they were sympathetic to the anti-Bahá'í sentiment, feared that the violence <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control and cause international criticism.|$|E
2500|$|Until 1970, when a train {{paused at}} a red block signal, the train {{operator}} was allowed to pass the red signal using a procedure called [...] "keying by." [...] The train operator would pause at the red signal, and then the operator <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cab, descend to the trackside, and crank down the track trip with a key-like device. After a series of accidents, in which train operators keyed by and crashed into trains in front, the procedure was made against the rules, unless permission was granted by the train dispatchers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{north side}} of the Snake had better water and grass than the south. The trail from Three Island Crossing to Old Fort Boise was about [...] long. The usually lush Boise River Valley was a welcome relief. The next {{crossing}} of the Snake River was near Old Fort Boise. This last crossing of the Snake could be done on bull boats while swimming the stock across. Others would chain a large string of wagons and teams together. The theory was that the front teams, usually oxen, <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> water first and with good footing help pull the whole string of wagons and teams across. How well this worked in practice is not stated. Often young Indian boys were hired to drive and ride the stock across the river—they knew how to swim, unlike many pioneers. Today's Idaho Interstate 84 roughly follows the Oregon Trail until it leaves the Snake River near Burley. From there Interstate 86 to Pocatello roughly approximates the trail. Highway 30 roughly follows the path of the Oregon Trail from there to Montpelier.|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} Rome on May 18, 1958. The script was still unfinished when cinematography began, so that Wyler had only {{read the first}} 10 to 12 pages of it. Shooting lasted for 12 to 14 hours a day, six days a week. On Sundays, Wyler would meet with Fry and Zimbalist for story conferences. The pace of the film was so grueling that a doctor was brought onto the set to give a vitamin B complex injection to anyone who requested it (shots which Wyler and his family later suspected may have contained amphetamines). Wyler was unhappy with Heston's performances, feeling they did not make Judah Ben-Hur a plausible character. Wyler shot 16 takes of Heston saying, [...] "I'm a Jew!" [...] By November 1958, the production was becoming bogged down. In part, {{this was due to}} the extras. More than 85 percent of the extras had no telephone and no permanent address, so contacting them required using word-of-mouth. It could take several days before all the extras were informed they would be needed. An experienced extra was put in charge of about 30 inexperienced extras, moving them in and out of make-up and wardrobe. On days when there were thousands of extras, individuals would begin getting into costume at 5 A.M., while the last extras <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> costume around 10 P.M. To speed things up, Wyler often kept principal actors on stand-by, in full costume and make-up, so that he could shoot pick-up scenes if the first unit slowed down. Actresses Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell spent almost the entire month of November 1958 in full leprosy make-up and costumes so that Wyler could shoot [...] "leper scenes" [...] when other shots didn't go well. Shooting took nine months, which included three months for the chariot race scene alone.|$|E
