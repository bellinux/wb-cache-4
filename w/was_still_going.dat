Mussolini and Petacci spent the rest of the night and most of the following day there.|$|E
5|$|Though Colbert's real-life presidential {{campaign}} had ended, Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Joe Quesada established {{in an interview}} on The Colbert Report that Colbert's campaign <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> strong in the fictional Marvel Universe, citing the cover art of a then-recent issue of The Amazing Spider-Man which featured a Colbert campaign billboard in the background. Background appearances of Colbert campaign ads continued to appear in Marvel Comics publications, as late as August 2008's Secret Invasion No. 5 (which also features a cameo of an alien Skrull posing as Colbert). In October 2008, Colbert made an extended 8-page appearance webslinging with Spider-Man in The Amazing Spider-Man issue No. 573. Colbert voiced the president of the U.S. in the 2009 film Monsters vs. Aliens.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Pittston {{still felt}} {{the strain of}} {{providing}} benefits, with the cost per miner increasing by $3,746 from the 1979 amount. The company <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> into debt and having a difficult time paying for the miners' benefits. To avoid losing more money, Pittston doubled health deductibles, lowered the coverage from 100% to 80%, and discontinued benefits to miners who retired before 1974. This change {{in the health care}} plan was still not enough for the company to gain a profit, so they decided to keep the mines running 24hours a day and seven days a week, with no overtime for the workers. Pittston also did away with successorship clauses, which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold. Miners were now working longer hours with more expensive health care plans, while the mine was losing no production time because it was never closed.|$|E

5|$|Precautions {{were taken}} to prevent secrets from the season finale being revealed; only certain staff members were {{provided}} with copies of the episode, which were given on watermarked DVDs and distributed to secret hiding places. The writers wanted Michael {{to have a big}} plan to get Holly back, but to realize throughout {{the course of the day}} that his relationship with Holly was something special and that he did not want to disrupt it; they felt it showed that Michael had become more mature, calm and confident about this relationship than that of Jan Levinson and others in his past. The first scene with Michael and Holly discussing their sketch possibilities in a secluded area was filmed with three cameras: one focusing on each side of the two actors, and one from the front of both of them to establish that the picnic <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> on behind them. Due to space limitations, the latter angle was filmed through a mirror (with the actors appearing to be opposite sides) and then the image was reversed and undistorted in post-production.|$|E
5|$|The {{conservatism}} of the Liberal and Country League did {{not keep}} up with the expectations of a modern-day society. There was dissatisfaction with the restrictive drinking laws; environmentalists campaigned for more natural parks and more 'green' practices; police powers stood strong, 'no loitering' legislation remained in place; gambling was almost completely restricted. The constituents who loudly demanded changes were mostly immigrants and their offspring, used to more libertine conditions in their countries of origin. Their homes, usually built by the Housing Trust, sprawled into 'rural' electoral districts that were controlled by the League. Labor pledged to introduce social legislation to meet their demands; Playford, who did not drink, smoke or gamble, had no interest in doing so. His own candidates knew that the 1965 election would be unwinnable if Playford did not budge. The economy <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> strong and incomes were still increasing, so the Premier did not change his position on social reform.|$|E

25|$|On September 25, when Hitler <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> {{to proceed}} to Lithuania, the Soviet Union {{proposed}} to renegotiate the spheres of interest. On September 28, 1939 in Moscow Molotov and Ribbentrop signed the German-Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty, determining the boundary of their respective national interests in {{the territory of the}} former Polish state. In a secret supplementary protocol to the treaty the spheres of interest outside Poland were renegotiated, and in exchange for some already captured portions of the Polish territory Germany acknowledged still independent Lithuania part of the Soviet zone.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd George {{wanted to}} make the {{destruction}} of Turkey a major British war aim, and two days after taking office told Robertson that he wanted a major victory, preferably the capture of Jerusalem, to impress British public opinion. Robertson thought the capture of Beersheba should suffice as more divisions were needed to allow Haig to take over more line in France, although he told Murray (31 January 1917) he wanted him to launch a Palestine Offensive, to sustain public morale, in autumn and winter 1917, if the war <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> on then.|$|E

The objective of the two-pronged invasion was the capture of the royal capital of Luang Prabang and of the Plain of Jars. In November 9 the Pathet Lao began its conflict with the Kingdom of Laos thus beginning {{the civil war and}} technically the Second Indochina War while the First Indochina War <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>going.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the search}} lights were knocked out making it {{increasingly}} hard to find suitable targets both for artillery and small arms. The Chinese {{managed to get a}} footing on the position under the pressure of repeated attack on a very narrow front. Despite heroic counter-attacks by the Black Watch they were forced back by sheer weight of numbers. Rose called on a counter-attack with a search and clearance operation using Centurion tanks of the B Squadron, 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoons; one tank was knocked out but the Black Watch started to clear the Hook of the Chinese and the fighting <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> on at dawn.|$|E
25|$|The Kokutai Genri-ha {{had long}} {{supported}} a violent uprising against the government. The decision to finally act in February 1936 {{was caused by}} two factors. The first was the decision announced in December 1935 to transfer the 1st Division, to {{which most of the}} Kokutai Genri-ha's officers belonged, to Manchuria in the spring. This meant that if the officers did not strike before then, any possible action would be delayed by years. The second was Aizawa's trial. The impact of his actions had impressed the officers, and they believed that by acting while his trial <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> on, they could take advantage of the favorable public opinion it was engendering.|$|E

25|$|Gershwin's all-black opera {{was also}} unpopular with some celebrated black artists. Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was to see that it was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not.

By May 23, Kanju, Matta and the Takhtaband bridge had been secured by the military, but fighting <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> on in Takhtaband itself and the Buner and Dir districts, where nine more militants were killed.

25|$|Like {{some other}} parts of Britain Cornwall derived much of its Christianity from post-Patrician Irish missions. Saint Ia of Cornwall and her companions, and Saint Piran, Saint Sennen, Saint Petroc, {{and the rest of}} the saints who came to Cornwall in the late 5th century and early 6th century found there a {{population}} which had perhaps relapsed into paganism under the pagan King Teudar. When these saints introduced, or reintroduced, Christianity, they probably brought with them whatever rites they were accustomed to, and Cornwall certainly had its own separate ecclesiastical quarrel with Wessex in the days of Saint Aldhelm, which, as appears by a statement in the Leofric Missal, <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> on in the early 10th century, though the details of it are not specified.|$|E

Instead of {{running in the}} newly redrawn district, Pataki decided to challenge seven-term incumbent Republican State Senator Mary B.
