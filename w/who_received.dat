A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children <b>who</b> <b>received</b> such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers <b>who</b> <b>received</b> intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
