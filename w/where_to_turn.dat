5|$|Bok asked a {{man with}} a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari. The man, a Muslim named Abdah, agreed to help him. Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to {{transport}} Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein {{in the back of his}} truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. When he could not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum, Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok. Francis Bok arrived in Khartoum with no money, no place to go, and did not know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn.</b> Fortunately for Francis, another stranger helped him find his way to his fellow Dinka tribespeople in Khartoum in the Jabarona settlement.|$|E

Cali's approach uses several radio beacons to guide pilots around the mountains and canyons that surround the city.

500|$|The {{writing and}} {{story of the}} game were {{especially}} praised by reviewers. Kieron Gillen of Rock, Paper, Shotgun said that after playing it, he [...] " [...] {{think of a better}} love story in the Western medium", and that the terse and minimalist prose worked well to create clearly defined characters. A reviewer from The Economist called the story [...] "engaging", saying that it provided a [...] "memorable and thought-provoking experience". In an analysis of the game's story, Emily Short of Gamasutra called the decision to leave the protagonist blank rather than writing a viewpoint character [...] "brilliant", saying that it made the entire game work much better than it otherwise would. A reviewer from The A.V. Club, grading the game as an [...] "A", called the story [...] "moving". The majority of the criticism for the game was in regards to the interface used to navigate the online world; while The Economist found it quirky and realistic, Gillen felt that it made it easy for the player to miss a key message, leaving the player stuck with no direction as to <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the music}} Tippett {{composed}} following the opera's completion reflected its lyrical style. Among these works was the Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli (1953) for string orchestra, written to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the composer Arcangelo Corelli's [...] birth. The Fantasia would eventually become one of Tippett's most popular works, though The Timess critic lamented the [...] "excessive complexity of the contrapuntal writing... {{there was so much}} going on that the perplexed ear knew not <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> or fasten itself". Such comments helped to foster a view that Tippett was a [...] "difficult" [...] composer, or even that his music was amateurish and poorly prepared. These perceptions were strengthened by controversies around several of his works in the late 1950s. The Piano Concerto (1955) was declared unplayable by its scheduled soloist, Julius Katchen, who had to be replaced before the première by Louis Kentner. The Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble, for whom Tippett had written the Sonata for Four Horns (1955), complained that the work was in too high a key and required it to be transposed down. When the Second Symphony was premièred by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Boult, in a live broadcast from the Royal Festival Hall on 5 February 1958, the work broke down after a few minutes and had to be restarted by the apologetic conductor: [...] "Entirely my mistake, ladies and gentlemen". The BBC's Controller of Music defended the orchestra in The Times, writing that it [...] "is equal to all reasonable demands", a wording that implied the fault was the composer's.|$|E

Reeve said, [...] "When somebody is first injured or as a disease progresses into paralysis, people don't know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn.</b> Dana and I wanted a facility that could give support and information to people.

2500|$|Three of {{her more}} notable works {{are from a}} much later period, during the 1970s: [...] She {{constructed}} two collages, and one painting. Her first collage is simply entitled, “The Holocaust”. [...] Jewish life, Jewish culture, and Jewish communities are burned to ash and destroyed. Two hands hold the word “Yiskor”, which means, “Do not forget. Remember.” One can also see the prayer for the dead. It {{is not hard to}} see the various atrocities that occurred – how all life was ruined. The second collage with a large Jewish star in the middle is called, “The Rebirth of Israel”. This collage {{is a testament to the}} elements that pushed towards the climax of returning to the Jewish homeland – the living Bible, the Balfour Declaration, overwhelming support for Israel, the shofar, and winning the 1967 War when Jerusalem was reunited. The third work, a painting, is of a fish in murky waters. For her, this represents the loneliness she felt after the war – a single fish in murky water with no vision of <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> next.|$|E
2500|$|Eliot did not {{understate}} {{the urgency}} of the task of educational reform. [...] "As a people," [...] he proclaimed, [...] "we do not apply to mental activities the principle of division of labor; and we have but a halting faith in special training for high professional employments. The vulgar conceit that a Yankee can turn his hand to anything we insensibly carry into high places, where it is preposterous and criminal. We are accustomed to seeing men leap from farm or shop to court-room or pulpit, and we half believe that common men can safely use the seven-league boots of genius. What amount of knowledge and experience do we habitually demand of our lawgivers? [...] What special training do we ordinarily think necessary for our diplomatists? -- although in great emergencies the nation has known <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn.</b> Only after years of the bitterest experience did we come to believe the professional training of a soldier to be of value in war. This lack of faith in the prophecy of a natural bent, and in the value of a discipline concentrated upon a single object, amounts to a national danger." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{spokesperson}} for the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers, noted that Gosnell had been rejected for membership following inspection, because his clinics did not meet appropriate standards of care, but that [...] "they’d cleaned the place up and hired an RN [...] for our visit. We only saw first-trimester procedures." [...] She adding that [...] "Unfortunately, some women don't know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn.</b> You sometimes have substandard providers preying on low-income women who don't know {{that they do have}} other (safe) options." [...] A {{spokesperson for}} Planned Parenthood in Southeastern Pennsylvania, condemned Gosnell, saying, [...] "We would condemn any physician who does not follow the law or endangers anyone’s health... All women should have access to high-quality care when they are vulnerable and facing difficult decisions." [...] Dayle Steinberg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, says she knew that Gosnell had provided abortions in Philadelphia for many years, but says she hadn't heard of any problems at his clinic until the allegations surfaced. She has been quoted as stating that [...] "when Gosnell was in practice, women would sometimes come to Planned Parenthood for services after first visiting Gosnell's West Philadelphia clinic, and would complain to staff about the conditions there. We would always encourage them to report it to the Department of Health." [...] She clarified that [...] "when Gosnell was arrested, I asked our staff if anyone had ever heard of him, and clinic staff members reported that a few women over the years said they were concerned about the uncleanliness of his facility and came to Planned Parenthood instead... if we had heard anything remotely like the conditions that have since come to light about Gosnell's facility, of course we would have alerted the state and other authorities".|$|E
