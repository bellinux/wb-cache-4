50|$|A <b>Wheel</b> <b>Slide</b> <b>Protection</b> (<b>WSP)</b> {{system was}} {{retrofitted}} {{due to the}} fleet suffering an epidemic problem of wheel flats. This was largely due to an excessive number of emergency brake applications caused during the ATO/ATP testing phases.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} the whole Networker fleet, <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> (<b>WSP)</b> {{operates}} on every axle. Under braking conditions a blowdown valve releases air from the brake cylinder of any axle if the rotational speed varies significantly from the average axle speed on the train.|$|E
40|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>Slide</b> <b>Protection</b> Systems (<b>WSP</b> Systems) or Anti-Skid Devices {{for rail}} {{vehicles}} {{have to go}} through a series of Dynamometer tests before test runs with equipped rail vehicles are permitted. The simulation tests are performed on <b>Wheel</b> <b>Slide</b> <b>Protection</b> Dynamometers (WSPD). The WSPD used for the tests in this thesis is placed in the laboratory of DB Systemtechnik in Germany. The function of a WSPD and possible improvements, which have been suggested by the UIC Report 2 of the task group B 164, are discussed within the thesis. One of the improvements is the implementation of adhesion curves in the simulation that are dependent of the wheel slip velocity. The implementation of this improvement in the named WSPD algorithm is explained as well the findings of a before and after test. The conclusion show that adhesion dependent wheel slip curves in the simulation algorithm of a WSPD are necessary to test a WSP Systems ability of finding the maximum adhesion during the braking process...|$|R
50|$|Bearingless speed sensors may {{be found}} in almost every {{wheelset}} of a rail vehicle. They are principally used for <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> and usually supplied by the manufacturer of the <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> system. These sensors require a sufficiently small air gap and need to be particularly reliable.One special feature of rotary speed sensors that are used for <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> is their integrated monitoring functions. Two-wire sensors with a current output of 7 mA/14 mA are used to detect broken cables. Other designs provide for an output voltage of around 7 V as soon as the signal frequency drops below 1 Hz. Another method used is to detect a 50 MHz output signal from the sensor when the power supply is periodically modulated at 50 MHz. It is also common for two-channel sensors to have electrically isolated channels. Occasionally it is necessary to take off the <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> signal at the traction motor, and the output frequency is then often too high for the <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> electronics. For this application a speed sensor with an integrated frequency divider or encoder can be utilized.|$|R

50|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>Slide</b> <b>Protection</b> (<b>WSP)</b> {{equipment}} is generally fitted to passenger trains {{to manage the}} behaviour of wheel sets in “low adhesion” (reduced wheel/rail friction) conditions. It is used when braking, and may be considered analogous to anti-lock braking (ABS) for cars. The system {{can also be used}} to control (or provide an input to) the traction system to control wheel spin when applying power in low adhesion conditions.|$|E
5000|$|... 313s have {{rheostatic braking}} (which was {{disabled}} on London Overground) {{in addition to}} conventional three-step air-operated disc braking. During braking if wheelslide is detected by the <b>Wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> (<b>WSP),</b> rheostatic braking is disabled and disc-braking only is used. Great Northern units have sanding equipment. Unlike some other DMU/EMU classes, additional brake force is not available when the emergency brake application is initiated and is the equivalent force of a step 3/full service application. WSP is still active when making an emergency application.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>{{protection}}</b> and <b>wheel</b> slip protection are railway terms used {{to describe}} automatic systems used to detect and prevent wheel-slide during braking or wheel-slip during acceleration. This is analogous to ABS and traction control systems used on motor vehicles. It is particularly important in slippery rail conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{emergency}} brake applies considerably more braking force {{than the standard}} full-service brake. The engine driver or motorman will only use the {{emergency brake}} as a last resort, since it may cause damage; even with modern <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection,</b> a train may develop wheel-flats, and the rails themselves can suffer profile damage.|$|R
30|$|The brake {{performance}} test concerns the emergency and service braking at several initial speeds, considering the different working and operating {{conditions of the}} braking system (direct electro-pneumatic, indirect electro-pneumatic, pneumatic, etc.). The test runs were finished in normal adhesion condition, where the <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> (<b>WSP)</b> system did not work. The test runs were performed on a complete V 250 unit, coaches of which had passed all the single-coach tests, with a fully working braking system (all other subsystems involved in the braking functionality).|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} measure small {{longitudinal}} forces in degraded adhesion tests, brakes or the auxiliary shaft in Fig.  2 {{is equipped with}} sensors to measure applied braking torques. In this way, {{it is possible to}} accurately estimate the total force of X exchanged between both wheels and rails. For low adhesion tests that are usually performed on straight lines, these kinds of results/measurements of the total X force are valuable. In particular, degraded adhesion tests are often performed to verify performances of <b>Wheel</b> <b>Slide</b> <b>Protection</b> (<b>WSP)</b> systems installed on passenger coaches [11].|$|E
40|$|International audienceRailway {{standard}} EN 50129 clarifies {{the safety}} acceptance conditions of safety-related electronic systems for signalling. It requires using a structured argumentation, named Safety Case, {{to present the}} fulfilment of these conditions. As guidance for building the Safety Case, this standard provides the structure of high-level safety objectives and the recommendations of development techniques according to different Safety Integrity Levels (SIL). Nevertheless, the rationale connecting these techniques to the high-level safety objectives is not explicit. The proposed techniques stem from experts belief in the effectiveness and efficiency of these techniques to achieve the underlying safety objectives. So, how should one formalize and assess this belief? And as a result how much confidence can {{we have in the}} safety of railway systems when these standards are used? To deal with these questions, the paper successively addresses two aspects: 1) making explicit the safety assurance rationale by modelling the Safety Case with GSN (Goal Structuring Notation) according to EN 5012 x standards; 2) proposing a quantitative framework based on Dempster-Shafer theory to formalize and assessing the confidence in the Safety Case. A survey amongst safety experts is carried out to estimate the confidence parameters. With these results, an application guidance of this framework is provided based on the <b>Wheel</b> <b>Slide</b> <b>Protection</b> (<b>WSP)</b> system...|$|E
50|$|From {{one to four}} {{channels}} can be implemented, each channel {{having a}} photosensor that scans one of at most two signal tracks on a slotted disk. Experience shows that the possible number of channels achievable by this technique is still not enough. A number of subsystems therefore {{have to make do}} with looped-through signals from the <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> electronics and are therefore forced to accept, for instance, the available number of pulses, although a separate speed signal might well have some advantages.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{subsystems}} in a rail vehicle, such as {{a locomotive}} or multiple unit, depend on a reliable and precise rotary speed signal, in some cases {{as a measure of}} the speed or changes in the speed. This applies in particular to traction control, but also to <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection,</b> registration, train control, door control and so on. These tasks are performed by a number of rotary speed sensors that may be found {{in various parts of the}} vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{traction}} is {{good for}} the powered bogies the concept has the same problem as other light railcars with the brakes on the non-powered axles having lower grip than traditional railcars. This has led to actual restrictions when leafs are on the rails as the <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> can not fully compensate the effect. The central power module has limits with heat dissipation as well which can lead into situations where the power output needs to be limited which is automatically done in this construction concept.|$|R
50|$|Sanding is {{one method}} of {{reducing}} <b>wheel</b> slip or <b>slide.</b> Locomotives and Multiple units have sandboxes which can deliver dry sand to the rails {{in front of}} the wheels. This may be initiated automatically when the <b>Wheel</b> <b>Slide</b> <b>Protection</b> system senses loss of adhesion, or the driver can operate it manually. Sanding may be connected to a computer system that determines the train's direction and where the sand should be applied: either forward or aft of the trucks. In older locomotives there was a manual lever attached to a valve that had three positions: Off, Forward, and Aft.|$|R
50|$|During braking, the {{traction}} motor connections are altered {{to turn them}} into electrical generators. The motor fields are connected across the main traction generator (MG) and the motor armatures are connected across the load. The MG now excites the motor fields. The rolling locomotive or multiple unit wheels turn the motor armatures, and the motors act as generators, either sending the generated current through onboard resistors (dynamic braking) or back into the supply (regenerative braking). Compared to electro-pneumatic friction brakes, braking with the {{traction motor}}s can be regulated faster improving the performance of <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|R
50|$|In April 2013 it was {{announced}} that the South West Trains units would be fitted with new traction equipment provided by Vossloh Kiepe. As part of the re-powering of the fleet, the air operated camshaft and electrical resistance grids will be removed, as well as the EE507 traction motors. The new equipment will consist of DC to AC inverters of the IGBT type. This is needed as the replacement traction motors are AC rather than DC. As the new control equipment allows for regenerative braking, the <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> system (on both powered and unpowered bogies) is also upgraded.|$|R
30|$|Wheel–track {{interaction}} {{is actually a}} very complicated phenomenon and several methods {{have been used to}} compute the normal and friction forces on wheels in the literature [13, 14]. Kalker’s linear creep theory offers an easy solution to incorporate creep forces into the rail vehicle model {{as a function of the}} speed of the rail vehicle. Therefore, Kalker’s theory is an essential ingredient of many of dynamic rail vehicle models in the present literature. Comparison of different wheel–track interaction models has been well studied; however, most of the models ignore the fact that wheel slip phenomena had been reduced significantly with the recent improvements in traction and brake technologies. Therefore, wheel slip can be observed for modern rapid transit rail vehicles depending on the wheel–track adhesion conditions, but at normal conditions <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> systems avoid <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> during acceleration and braking.|$|R
5000|$|... 8110/8310 and 8136/8336 were {{withdrawn}} {{after suffering}} serious damage {{in a fire}} at Fairview depot in July 2001. All of the remaining units returned to service in 2007 and 2008 following refurbishment by Siemens. This included the installation of modified marker lights, removal of some seats to add more standing space giving all coaches 64 seats and space for a wheelchair, installation of an electronic passenger information system, new <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> equipment and digital traction control to replace the outdated analog system and installation of a door closing warning beeper. It was also supposedly intended to allow the units to operate in 8-car sets, the original units being limited to six cars, but some unmodified LHB sets had operated in 8-car formations during 2007.|$|R
50|$|The loss of {{friction}} between wheels and rail results in loss of tractive force — the wheels begin to spin, {{and in some}} instances the train is unable to move. In braking, substantial loss {{of friction}} results in reduced braking force. Braking distances are considerably longer, and in extreme cases the wheels may even lock up, causing the train to slide. Modern locomotives and multiple units are equipped with <b>Wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> to counter slippery rail conditions. Locked wheels can self-grind flat spots on the steel tyres, especially if the <b>wheels</b> are still <b>sliding</b> when arriving at a non-greasy section of rail, e.g. one that has previously been sanded. This causes the wheels to go out of profile (known colloquially as 'wheel flats'), which subsequently leads to severe vibration and the need for the wheels to be re-profiled or re-tyred at great expense.|$|R
40|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> devices (WSPD) {{are destined}} to avoid {{important}} <b>sliding</b> of <b>wheels</b> during braking actions in case of temporarily impaired wheel-rail adhesion by correspondent reductions of air pressure in brake cylinders. Accordingly, longer braking distances and higher longitudinal in-train forces occur, potentially affecting the traffic safety and the passengers comfort. A general analyse and evaluation of these effects are the main targets of the present study. The theoretical considerations are sustained by simulations of braking process, considering situations of normal, respectively diminished wheel-rail adhesion determining random actuations of WSPD. The air pressure evolution in brake cylinders of was experimentally determined on a computerized brake system test stand and adequately used as input in simulations. The results indicate an increase of in-train forces and a more complex evolution of the longitudinal dynamic actions between the vehicles {{in the case of}} degraded wheel-rail adhesion, when the random actuation of WSPD have major influence in the whole braking process...|$|R
40|$|In modern railway Automatic Train Protection and Automatic Train Control systems, odometry is {{a safety}} {{relevant}} on-board subsystem which estimates the instantaneous speed and the travelled {{distance of the}} train; a high reliability of the odometry estimate is fundamental, since an error on the train position {{may lead to a}} potentially dangerous overestimation of the distance available for braking. To improve the odometry estimate accuracy, data fusion of different inputs coming from a redundant sensor layout may be used. Simplified two-dimensional models of railway vehicles have been usually used for Hardware in the Loop test rig testing of conventional odometry algorithms and of on-board safety relevant subsystems (like the <b>Wheel</b> <b>Slide</b> <b>Protection</b> braking system) in which the train speed is estimated from the measures of the wheel angular speed. Two-dimensional models are not suitable to develop solutions like the inertial type localisation algorithms (using 3 D accelerometers and 3 D gyroscopes) and the introduction of Global Positioning System (or similar) or the magnetometer. In order to test these algorithms correctly and increase odometry performances, a three-dimensional multibody model of a railway vehicle has been developed, using Matlab-Simulink™, including an efficient contact model which can simulate degraded adhesion conditions (the development and prototyping of odometry algorithms involve the simulation of realistic environmental conditions). In this paper, the authors show how a 3 D railway vehicle model, able to simulate the complex interactions arising between different on-board subsystems, can be useful to evaluate the odometry algorithm and safety relevant to on-board subsystem performances...|$|R
500|$|Front {{brakes on}} many {{inexpensive}} bikes are {{not strong enough}} so, on the road, they are the limiting factor.
