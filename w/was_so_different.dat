This album was a success, partly because it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from the mainstream Cantopop music, but—ironically—a couple of very traditional romantic songs topped the charts.|$|E
25|$|Tocqueville's {{penetrating}} analysis {{sought to}} understand the peculiar nature of US political life. In describing the US, he agreed with thinkers such as Aristotle and Montesquieu that the balance of property determined the balance of political power, but his conclusions after that differed radically from those of his predecessors. Tocqueville tried {{to understand why the}} US <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from Europe in the last throes of aristocracy. The US, in contrast to the aristocratic ethic, was a society where hard work and money-making was the dominant ethic, where the common man enjoyed a level of dignity which was unprecedented, where commoners never deferred to elites, and where what he described as crass individualism and market capitalism had taken root to an extraordinary degree.|$|E
25|$|The 1975 season saw the {{introduction}} of the Astros' new uniforms. Many teams were going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception. The uniforms had multishade stripes of orange, red and yellow in front and in back behind a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same stripes ran down the pant legs. Players numbers not only appeared {{on the back of the}} jersey, but also on the pant leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a fiery trail like a rocket sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were panned by critics, but the public liked them and versions started appearing at the high school and little league level. The uniform <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from what other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road until 1980.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E
500|$|Audiogram {{finished}} La Llorona {{in early}} 1997 with Desrosiers producing, arranging and accompanying. The Spanish-language album mixed 1930s and 1940s-era Latin American songs with original songs; it was {{strongly influenced by}} Mexican music but also by klezmer, torch songs, gypsy jazz and Middle Eastern music. Even though she did not consider herself fluent in Spanish, Lhasa said that she enjoyed singing in the language because it came from [...] "a deeper place". Wolff said that he expected the album to be marketed to people other than Spanish speakers because it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from contemporary Hispanic music.|$|E

Every one of Philips's voice {{recording}} takes <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> that Nate Cash, one of the series' creative directors, had to piece together disparate recordings to make the final composition. The episode also contains the short song [...] "These Lumps", sung by Lumpy Space Princess. Ward himself {{had a difficult time}} singing this song was because he was trying to both sing the song on pitch and retain Lumpy Space Princess's accent.|$|E

500|$|The songwriting session—held at Absolute's studio {{located on}} Tagg's Island near Chertsey—did {{not seem to}} go well at the beginning, as the duo was heavily into R music at the time, while the group {{according}} to Wilson was [...] "always very poptastic". After two sessions the duo phoned their managers {{and told them that}} the musical association between them and the group was not working. At this point, the duo heard [...] "Wannabe" [...] for the first time, Wilson remembers: [...] "We listen to it, and we didn't get it at all. It <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> to what we were doing. We thought, 'How's this gonna work? We're not the right people to be doing this band.'" [...] For the next session the group wanted to write something uptempo and a bit more fun. A full-on disco backing track came up, and [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] evolved from there. Wilson commented about that session: ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Wirkola {{announced}} {{that he would not be}} returning to direct the sequel: “I have been lately attached to a few more things, it’s just a matter of time and priorities. I did Dead Snow, then Hansel & Gretel, and then [...] I want to do something a little bit different now and not just do sequels. I did write the script and I hope to be involved in it. But yeah, I won’t be directing it.” He said [...] "the first film was a learning curve for me working in the studio system and the script I wrote for the original <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> [...] We ended up taking a lot out and altering stuff that first time. I tried taking what I learned and still delivered a sequel script that’s an R-rated action film." [...] Cinema Blend reported Renner said that despite his busy schedule he agreed to reprise the role of Hansel because the first film [...] "was a lot of fun doing the movie," [...] but without Wirkola directing again he might be less likely to return for the sequel.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{noted that}} Half-Blood Prince {{contained}} a darker tone {{than the previous}} Potter novels. The Christian Science Monitor reviewer Yvonne Zipp considered the first half to contain a lighter tone to soften the unhappy ending. The Boston Globe reviewer Liz Rosenberg wrote, [...] "lightness [...] slimmer than ever in this darkening series... a new charge of gloom and darkness. I felt depressed by the time I was {{two-thirds of the way}} through". She also compared the setting to Charles Dickens's depictions of London, as it was [...] "brooding, broken, gold-lit, as living character as any other". Christopher Paolini called the darker tone [...] "disquieting" [...] because it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from the earlier books. Liesl Schillinger, a contributor to The New York Times book review, also noted that Half-Blood Prince was [...] "far darker" [...] but [...] "leavened with humor, romance and snappy dialogue". She suggested a connection to the 11 September attacks, as the later, darker novels were written after that event. David Kipen, a critic of the San Francisco Chronicle considered the [...] "darkness as a sign of our paranoid times" [...] and singled out curfews and searches that were part of the tightened security at Hogwarts, as a resemblance to our world.|$|E

500|$|Phantasmagoria {{took more}} than two years to develop. Sierra {{officials}} said this was because it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from anything that had been done previously, in both the Hollywood or computer game industries, and the new challenges led to complexities. Roberta Williams said: [...] "It took a full year just to get people to understand what I wanted to do." [...] The game experienced multiple delays before it was ultimately released. It was originally planned that the game would be in stores by late 1993 or early 1994, with Sierra saying it would come out no later than the fall of 1994. The game was previewed at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1994, where it was announced the release date had been pushed back to October 1994 and that the game would be made available on two discs. The game ultimately required seven discs. The shipping date was later changed again to Christmas 1994, and then February 1995, before Sierra said it would be delayed yet again as the company continued to refine the technology of live-action video. It was announced the game would be ready in June 1995, but when Sierra organized road shows that month to market 18 of its new games, Phantasmagoria was not among them because it was not ready yet.|$|E
500|$|The Cure {{released}} {{their debut}} album Three Imaginary Boys in May 1979. Because of the band's inexperience in the studio, Parry and engineer Mike Hedges {{took control of}} the recording. The band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album; in a 1987 interview, he admitted, [...] "a lot of it was very superficial – I didn't even like it at the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and I thought they were justified. Even when we'd made it, I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it". The band's second single, [...] "Boys Don't Cry", was released in June. The Cure then embarked as the support band for Siouxsie and the Banshees' Join Hands promotional tour of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales between August and October. The tour saw Smith pull double duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when John McKay quit the group in Aberdeen. That musical experience had a strong impact on him: [...] "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello; the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Production on Genealogy of the Holy War {{began after}} the {{completion}} of [...] in 1994. Returning staff included series creator Shouzou Kaga, who acted as director, designer and scenario writer; composer Yuka Tsujiyoko, who had handled all previous entries in the series; and Nintendo producer Gunpei Yokoi. Genealogy of the Holy War would be the last game produced by Yokoi. Character design was handled primarily by Katsuyoshi Koya, who had previously worked on Mystery of the Emblem: it would be Koya's last work on the series, as both he and Kaga were unsatisfied with the quality of his illustrations. Additional work was done by Mayumi Hirota. This was later blamed upon severe time constraints when compared to the development of Mystery of the Emblem. In contrast, Kaga was enthusiastic about Hirota's work, praising how she managed to capture his visions for the characters. The overall development was turbulent due to a general staff changeover between Mystery of the Emblem and Genealogy of the Holy War, in addition to most of the production team moving offices. According to future series producer Masahiro Higuchi, the initial concept for Genealogy of the Holy War <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>different</b> from the typical Fire Emblem game that it was instead dubbed [...] "Holy Sword Emblem Kaiser". This name had to be dropped due to space limitations and other unspecified issues, and as its content was coming more in line with the Fire Emblem series, its title was changed to [...] "Sword Emblem". It was eventually given the Fire Emblem title when its mechanics settled into their current form.|$|E

2500|$|AMM {{released}} {{their first}} recording, AMMusic 1966, on Elektra Records UK in 1966. It had some initial similarities to free jazz, {{due in part}} to Gare's saxophone. One critic has written, however, that the resemblance was rather slight: [...] "the overall sound of the group, even in 1966, <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>different,</b> so idiosyncratic, that it's not at all surprising that both new jazz and contemporary classical audiences were baffled, if not horrified." [...] Percussionist Christopher Hobbs (born in 1950 and a student of Cardew) also played with AMM in the late 1960s.|$|E
