5|$|Carla {{has brought}} Isabella to the hospital, and {{everyone}} is cooing over the new baby, when Elliot comes in and announces happily that she just bought a new house. Turk exits with Isabella, and Elliot expresses concern that J.D. thinks he's moving into the house with her. Carla has decided to take one year parental leave, and Laverne, Ted, and The Worthless Peons <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> they can go on at the hospital without Carla's help ("Gonna Miss You, Carla"). Carla begins {{to realize that she}} does not want to separate herself from her work for so long.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the {{development}} team chose Tokyo as the main setting was that its turbulent history, going through multiple phases of development and often suffering severe damage in wars or due to natural disasters, made it comparable with the fantasy settings of other games at the time. In a later interview, an Atlus staff member stated that this setting and style made it the antithesis of traditional fantasy RPGs, adding that this resulted in the game developing a punk spirit. Because of the post-apocalyptic setting of Megami Tensei II, the development team wanted to depict a time before the apocalypse. The decision to set the game in Tokyo was made by Suzuki and Kaneko, and was influenced by manga such as Violence Jack, Devilman, and Fist of the North Star. Kichijōji was decided to be the game's starting point due to Kaneko, Suzuki, and Ito all having lived in or near the area, or having visited it often. The abandoned Terminal Echo building there fascinated them, making them <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> a building in such a prime location could remain unoccupied; Ito described it as two floors of arcade cabinets, {{with the rest of the}} building feeling like a ghost town. This fascination led to it being included as a dungeon in the game. While designing the maps, Kaneko wanted to use wire-frame models, but the Super Famicom's limited capacities meant this idea was scrapped.|$|E

60|$|And {{then when}} he looks back, he is {{astonished}} at himself. He <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> he could dare so much; <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> he could endure so much; <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> the right thought came into {{his head at the}} right moment. He hardly knows himself again. It seems to him, when he thinks over it all, like a grand and awful dream. And the world is astonished at him likewise. They cry, 'Who would have thought there was so much in this man? who would have expected such things of him?' And they call him a hero--and so he is.|$|R

25|$|Pali {{sources say}} that beings in Maitreya's time will be much bigger than {{during the time of}} Sakyamuni. In one prophecy his disciples are contemptuous of Mahakasyapa, whose head is no larger than an insect to them. Buddhas robe barely covers two fingers making them <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> tiny Buddha was. Mahākāśyapa is said to be small enough in {{comparison}} to cremate in the palm of Maitreya's hand.|$|E
25|$|In late March 2012, Hamas began {{offering}} carpools {{for people to}} use Hamas state vehicles to get to work. Many Gazans began to <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> these vehicles have fuel themselves, as diesel was completely unavailable in Gaza, ambulances {{could no longer be}} used, but Hamas government officials still had fuel for their own cars. Many Gazans said that Hamas confiscated the fuel it needed from petrol stations and used it exclusively for their own purposes.|$|E
25|$|And it is {{occasionally}} visionary, as when Ludlow, {{decades before}} Albert Einstein {{would do the}} same, abandons {{the idea of the}} æther and muses that “e might be allowed to... assert that because our only cognitions of matter are cognitions of force, matter in the scientific sense is force.” He does not elaborate, and evidently the article was altered and cut for publication substantially, so we are left to <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> far he pursued this idea of the equivalency of matter and energy.|$|E

25|$|Ms Frizzle's {{class is}} going {{with her on}} the most boring field trip, to the waterworks. At least that is what they think until they {{discover}} how interesting things always happen on Ms Frizzle's trips. After going through a tunnel, all the children find themselves in scuba diving outfits. On the top of a bridge the bus rises {{up in the air and}} into a cloud. Once in the cloud, the class finds that water droplets are growing, and they are shrinking. The class rains and lands in the water purification system. Eventually it takes them back to Walkerville Elementary, where they come out of the faucet in the girls' bathroom. Later, they see the bus outside and <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> it returned from the cloud.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the narrator's {{unreliability}} is made immediately evident. For instance, a {{story may}} open with the narrator making a plainly false or delusional claim or admitting to being severely mentally ill, or {{the story itself}} may have a frame in which the narrator appears as a character, with clues to the character's unreliability. A more dramatic use of the device delays the revelation until near the story's end. In some cases, the reader discovers that in the foregoing narrative, the narrator had concealed or greatly misrepresented vital pieces of information. Such a twist ending forces readers to reconsider {{their point of view}} and experience of the story. In some cases the narrator's unreliability is never fully revealed but only hinted at, leaving readers to <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> much the narrator should be trusted and how the story should be interpreted.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasonable}} suspicion {{test has}} {{the intention of}} protecting public confidence, but Leo and Chen <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> accurately this test actually reflects the public's view. The test as formulated in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin requires that the reasonable man be sitting in court and in the know of all the relevant facts. However, this is usually not the case. Most of the public only receives information in bits and pieces, and thus even if a case passes the reasonable suspicion test, the public may not be satisfied {{that there was no}} possibility of bias. Thus the concept that the reasonable suspicion test reflects the public's perspective is overstated. The practical reality is that when the reasonable man is imbued with all the relevant facts, he will essentially be in the same position as the court. Therefore, the suggested approach is that the court, in personifying the reasonable man, should take into account all relevant circumstances and determine if there is the suspicion or possibility of the appearance of bias whilst being mindful to exclude considerations stemming from the individual judge's personal preferences, special knowledge and legal sophistication.|$|E

25|$|In 1535 {{the abbey}} was valued in the Valor Ecclesiasticus {{as having an}} income of £540, a very {{comfortable}} sum, which leads one to <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> many of the abbey's financial problems were due to bad management. This figure meant that Vale Royal escaped being dissolved {{under the terms of}} the First Suppression Act, King Henry VIII's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last abbot was John Hareware (elected 1535), who had previously been abbot of Hulton Abbey. He pursued a two-pronged policy of attempting to ensure the survival of his abbey and, should that fail, the security of himself and his brethren thereafter. He bribed courtiers, influential nobles and in particular chief minister Thomas Cromwell with money and property in the hope of gaining respite; he also leased out most of the abbey lands to friends and associates of the monastery to keep them out of royal hands should the abbey fall (many of these leases had a clause which stated that they should be void if the abbey survived). He began to realise the other assets such as livestock and timber for cash.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, 2008, Zach is in {{the process}} of looking for Kendall buried under rubble due to a tornado having just struck Pine Valley. He finds Bianca instead, and is {{surprised}} to see that she is pregnant. He later finds an unconscious Kendall. As an ambulance arrives for her, it is stated that there is not enough room for Bianca and Zach to ride along to the hospital. There is, however, enough room for Zach and Kendall's children to ride in the front seat of the ambulance. Zach and Bianca stay behind and discuss Kendall's fate. They also discuss Bianca's secret that she is pregnant with Zach's child via sperm donation, and Bianca's new lover named Reese. Zach had agreed to father Bianca's child for the couple, but did not know that she had gone through with the procedure of artificial insemination, until now. The two <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> Kendall, who is unaware of this pregnancy, will react to the news when they tell her. As Zach and Bianca continue to talk, Bianca goes into labor. Zach helps deliver the new child into the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrangement}} of Matt Dennis's Everything Happens To Me (June Christy, vocal) {{was not done}} under Kenton's aegis but with Christy's later to be husband Bob Cooper as the leader just after the second AFM recording ban. This {{is added to the}} CD and shows the continuity of Graettinger's writing and recorded works for Capitol; the chart had originally been done for the full Kenton instrumentation but was never recorded. The small 11 piece group (to include violin and cello) provides some real insight to the inner workings of Graettinger's writing. The aesture nature of his arrangement and use of pantonality (one might call it atonality in spots) makes one <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> June Christy is able to pick off the 9th of the F minor chord {{at the top of the}} tune; there is basically no clue given by Graettinger as to what pitch is coming for the singer (the glue that holds this together is the Bb pedal point at the bottom). Interestingly, after first stating the entire tune there is a tutti ensemble section that gives way to the 'last 'A' of the form'. Also, his harmonic transitions between sections are key in their departure from the tune compared to the established harmony while June Christy sings.|$|E

Reese Williams comes to Pine Valley, not long after the tornado with Miranda. She proposes marriage to Bianca and she accepts. Reese and Bianca have their share of obstacles to overcome as a couple, mainly Bianca's suspicions of Reese's sexuality and friendship with Zach, but they exchange wedding vows on February 13, 2009.|$|E
500|$|Later in the film, Barton places {{into the}} frame a small picture of Charlie, dressed in a fine suit and holding a briefcase. The {{juxtaposition}} of his neighbor in the uniform of an insurance salesman and the escapist image of {{the woman on the}} beach leads to a confusion of reality and fantasy for Barton. Critic Michael Dunne notes: [...] "iewers can only <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> 'real' Charlie is.... In the film's final shot... viewers must <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> 'real' [...] is. The question leads to others: How real is Fink? Lipnick? Audrey? Mayhew? How real are films anyway?" ...|$|E

500|$|Harvey's attacking style {{often led}} to {{criticism}} that his batting was risky, with England captain Len Hutton {{feeling that he}} played and missed too much, while dour all-rounder Trevor Bailey quipped [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> many runs Harvey would make if he decided to stop playing strokes with an element of risk about them". Harvey was nevertheless happy to continue his flamboyant strokeplay. However, as Harvey progressed in seniority, he eschewed his hook shot and played more conservatively for his team's sake. He typically evaded bouncers by tilting his head, rather than ducking the ball.|$|E

[...] In addition, she feared the ongoing low-level emissions from Sellafield: [...] "I started to <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> safe it was for [...] to play on the beach or to swim in the sea or even to eat fish." [...] In the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks, she also viewed the plant as vulnerable to terrorists.|$|E

George finds a sword in the cavern he lands in, which he uses to slay the dragon and save the world.
