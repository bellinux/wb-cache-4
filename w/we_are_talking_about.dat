[...] The song [...] "Suelta Los Amarres" [...] from Ideas Nuevas discourages listeners from using violence to advance a political cause. However, the lyrics on La Dulzura place more emphasis on interpersonal relationships and love. Silva notes that the group refrains from writing [...] "romantic" [...] lyrics, noting that [...] "romanticism has a connotation of suffering for love. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the love that elevates and purifies your soul.

2500|$|It can be {{seen that}} the {{momentum}} spectrum is continuous, and one can conclude that for energy state described by the [...] wavenumber, the momentum can, when measured, attain also other values than , although these are the most likely momentum values (the momentum wavefunction attains its greatest values at these momentum values). Hence one also sees that since the energy is [...] (since <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the n:th energy eigenstate) the relation [...] does not necessarily hold; here p is the measured momentum (since the energy eigenstate [...] is not a momentum eigenstate, and actually not even a superposition of two momentum eigenstates, as one could imagine from equation (...) above, it has no well-defined momentum before measurement).|$|E
2500|$|A {{memorandum}} {{from the}} President's Special Assistant, Walt Rostow, to President Johnson said: [...] "What's on the Arab Ambassadors' minds {{boils down to}} one big question: Will we make good on our pledge to support the territorial integrity of all states in the Middle East? Our best answer is that we stand by that pledge, {{but the only way}} to make good on it is to have a genuine peace. The tough question is whether we'd force Israel back to 4 June borders if the Arabs accepted terms that amounted to an honest peace settlement. Secretary Rusk told the Yugoslav Foreign Minister: 'The US had no problem with frontiers as they existed before the outbreak of hostilities. If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> national frontiers--in a state of peace--then we will work toward restoring them.' But we all know that could lead to a tangle with the Israelis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{international}} {{criticism has}} {{centered around the}} government of Karzai in early 2009 for failing to secure the country from Taliban attacks, systemic governmental corruption, and widespread claims of electoral fraud in the 2009 Afghan presidential election. Karzai staunchly defended the election balloting, stating that some statements criticizing the balloting and vote count were [...] "totally fabricated." [...] He told the media that, [...] "There were instances of fraud, no doubt... There were irregularities... But the election {{as a whole was}} good and free and democratic." [...] He further went on to say that, [...] "Afghanistan has its separate problems and we have to handle them as Afghanistan finds it feasible... This country was completely destroyed...

2500|$|A simpler {{statement}} of the theorem uses graph theory. The set of regions of a map can be represented more abstractly as an undirected graph that has a vertex for each region and an edge for every pair of regions that share a boundary segment. This graph is planar (it {{is important to note}} that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the graphs that have some limitations according to the map they are transformed from only): it can be drawn in the plane without crossings by placing each vertex at an arbitrarily chosen location within the region to which it corresponds, and by drawing the edges as curves that lead without crossing within each region from the vertex location to each shared boundary point of the region. Conversely any planar graph can be formed from a map in this way. In graph-theoretic terminology, the four-color theorem states that the vertices of every planar graph can be colored with at most four colors so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color, or for short, [...] "every planar graph is four-colorable" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Stevenson gave a {{presentation}} at an emergency {{session of the}} Security Council. In his presentation, which attracted national television coverage, he forcefully asked Soviet UN representative Valerian Zorin if his country was installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, and when Zorin appeared reluctant to reply, Stevenson punctuated with the demand [...] "Don't wait for the translation, answer 'yes' or 'no'!" [...] When Zorin replied that [...] "I am not in an American court of law, and therefore do not answer a question put {{to me in the}} manner of a prosecuting counsel...you will have your answer in due course", Stevenson retorted, [...] "I am prepared to wait for my answer until Hell freezes over." [...] Stevenson then showed photographs taken by a U-2 spy plane which proved the existence of nuclear missiles in Cuba, just after Zorin had implied they did not exist. Stevenson also attended several meetings of the EXCOMM at the White House during the Missile Crisis, where he boldly proposed to make an exchange with the Soviets: if they would remove their missiles from Cuba, the United States would agree to remove its obsolete Jupiter missiles from Turkey. However, he faced strong opposition from some other EXCOMM members, who regarded such an exchange as a sign of weakness. According to Kennedy adviser and Stevenson friend George W. Ball, who was present, these members [...] "intemperately upbraided Stevenson... outraged and shrill." [...] However, President Kennedy remarked [...] "You have to admire Adlai, he sticks to his position even when everyone is jumping on him", and Robert Kennedy wrote that [...] "Stevenson has since been criticized for the position he took at the meeting...although I disagreed strongly with his recommendations, I thought he was courageous to make them, and I might add that they made as much sense as some others considered during that period of time." [...] Stevenson remarked [...] "I know that most of those fellows will consider me a coward for the rest of my life for what I said today, but perhaps we need a coward in the room when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> nuclear war." [...] In fact, the Kennedy Administration did remove the Jupiter-class MRBMs from Italy and Turkey some six months after the Cuban Missile Crisis ended, and there is evidence that President Kennedy privately agreed that, if the Soviets would remove their missiles from Cuba, he would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey and Italy at a later date. [...] The deal was kept a secret for many years, however, and Stevenson was thus given no credit for his original suggestion.|$|E
