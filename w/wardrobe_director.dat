His voice changed, due to puberty, during the filming of The Lion, the Witch and the <b>Wardrobe,</b> so the <b>director</b> used his sister Soumaya to voice some of his lines in the movie.|$|R

5000|$|Mandy: Derrick's love {{interest}} and former WB giftshop employee, Mandy {{was fired after}} she insisted that men would not buy underwear that said Smallville across the front (though Will immediately insists that he would buy ones that said Everwood). Mandy moved to Hollywood {{to live with her}} previous boyfriend, {{who turned out to be}} an abusive carjacker, and had been living there a month when she was hired by Will and Derrick. Will met her while she was soaking wet after being caught in the lawn sprinklers and sobbing; he dubs her 'wet girl' and immediately hires her out pity. She then goes to the WB wardrobe department to get dry clothes, where Jeff Tucker has the <b>wardrobe</b> <b>director</b> dress her in revealing clothing. This revealing clothing attracts Derrick's attention, and instead of being mad at Will for hiring her, he lets her stay and begins to harbor a crush on her. Jill dislikes Mandy because Mandy claims that she has had to work hard at life and Jill makes it clear later that Mandy's stunning face and body has made life a lot easier for her. It is revealed in the third act of the pilot episode that Mandy is actually an actress planted within the reality show to create more sex appeal, though her story about the abusive boyfriend is true. It is also implied that, over the last year, Mandy has had extensive makeovers and plastic surgery to improve her previous look (which was so ugly, it provoked a [...] "yikes!" [...] out of Ingold). Despite this, Mandy finds she really does have feelings for Derrick, but the network execs push her to kiss Will because he is better looking. It is revealed in the pilot's epilogue, that Mandy and Derrick kiss in the studio bathroom in what would have been the second episode.|$|E
5000|$|According to Aljean Harmetz, {{when the}} {{wardrobe}} department {{was looking for}} a coat for Frank Morgan, they decided that they wanted a once-elegant coat that had [...] "gone to seed". They went to a second-hand shop and purchased a whole rack of coats, from which Morgan, the head of the <b>wardrobe</b> department, and <b>director</b> Fleming chose one they thought had the perfect appearance of shabby gentility. One day, while he was on set wearing the coat, Morgan allegedly turned out one of the pockets and discovered a label indicating that the coat had once belonged to Oz author L. Frank Baum. Mary Mayer, a unit publicist for the film, contacted the tailor and Baum's widow, who both verified that the coat had indeed once belonged to the writer. After filming was completed, the coat was presented to Mrs. Baum. Baum biographer Michael Patrick Hearn disbelieves the story, it having been refuted by members of the Baum family, who never saw the coat or knew of the story, as well as by Margaret Hamilton, who considered it a concocted studio rumor.|$|R
500|$|... "Sardines" [...] {{was written}} {{so that a}} feeling of {{claustrophobia}} would develop as the story progressed; Pemberton said that [...] "our first consideration was, 'Can we get 12 people in a wardrobe?' So when we did the script read-through, the designer bought a wardrobe off eBay and we checked whether we could all get in it and shut the door". Writers for Broadcast described seeing the assortment of actors [...] "crammed inside an imposing wardrobe" [...] during filming as [...] "an arresting spectacle". The story is filmed from within a single bedroom, with much of it taking place inside the wardrobe. Filming presented a particular challenge, as {{the aim was to}} give the impression that the viewer was in the wardrobe with the characters, and not to [...] "cheat" [...] by giving the impression that the viewer was outside the wardrobe looking in. The episode was filmed with two wardrobes; one complete one, and one [...] "faked" [...] one. The complete prop was used to film the characters entering the wardrobe, while the other was in a different room for close-up shots from [...] "within" [...] the <b>wardrobe.</b> For <b>director</b> David Kerr, the difficulty was sustaining the illusion that everything was happening in a single place, ideally without viewers even realising that there was a technical challenge involved. The episode was filmed mostly in sequence, meaning more actors arrived as the filming continued, reflecting the fact that more characters arrive as the episode progresses. Kerr aimed for a particularly [...] "immersive" [...] filming style on the episode, with extensive use of wide angle shots. He aimed to avoid [...] "leading" [...] the audience with regards to the more important characters, by, for instance, [...] "not giving [...] coverage" [...] earlier in the episode.|$|R
40|$|As {{the world}} press {{disseminates}} {{images of the}} Duke and Duchess of Cambridge touring Australia, {{the concept of a}} carefully presented working royal wardrobe feels like a familiar one, ensuring that both sartorial and cultural expectations are realised and logistical considerations managed. It was not always thus, but {{during the second half of}} the 19 th century and into the first decade of the 20 th century, one celebrated figure successfully negotiated the realities of nomadic royalty. Alexandra, Princess of Wales and from 1901, Queen Consort to Edward VII arguably rescued the British monarchy from the brink of crisis following Queen Victoria’s retreat from public life. A young and vivacious Danish Princess, she married Edward Prince of Wales in 1863 and was launched into British society to become the public face of royalty. Her popularity was enormous and this was in no small part due to her shrewd sartorial decisions. This paper will consider how Alexandra made her wardrobe work in her favour when travelling both in Britain and abroad, promoting the royal family in a recognisably modern fashion. The management of her appearance was a carefully crafted affair and relied upon the skill of those who have been largely hidden from the historical record – the dressers and <b>wardrobe</b> maids, the <b>directors</b> of travel, messengers, dressmakers, tailors and hairdressers – who all ensured that the public persona of the Princess of Wales exceeded the expectations of the many thousands of British subjects who inevitably flocked to see her. Based on recently completed PhD research, I will consider how Alexandra managed the complexities of dressing and changing garments whilst travelling. Using evidence from surviving garments, diaries, letters and photographs, it reveals Alexandra’s recognition that with an increasingly sophisticated media machine her managed appearance was a powerful contributor to positive public perceptions...|$|R
