5|$|After Simpson's {{decision}} {{to focus on}} Fightstar, the band entered Criterion Studios in London with producer Mark Williams to begin work on their first EP, They Liked You Better When You <b>Were</b> <b>Dead.</b> It was released as a mini-album, containing nine tracks written during the six months Simpson and Westaway lived together. Recording sessions were often interrupted, since Simpson {{was in the midst}} of a sold-out series of Wembley shows with Busted.|$|E

5|$|Civilian {{return to}} the town was slow, with shops still {{shuttered}} on 16 December. Civilian casualty reports were conflicting: one resident claimed 15 dead bodies lay in a single street and another that his family <b>were</b> <b>dead</b> under rubble. The coalition rejected such claims, admitting only that two children had been injured, and possibly killed, when a car driving at high speeds towards ISAF troops during the battle overturned when the driver was shot dead.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Maratha gunners who had feigned death when the British {{advanced}} over their position re-manned their guns {{and began to}} pour cannon fire into {{the rear of the}} 74th and Madras infantry. Wellesley ordered his four sepoy battalions to re-form and ward off any threat from the Maratha infantry and cavalry while the 78th were sent back to retake the Maratha gun line. Wellesley, meanwhile, galloped back to 7th Madras Native Cavalry, which had been held back in reserve to the east, and led a cavalry charge from the opposite direction. The gunners again stood their ground but were eventually driven from their guns and this time it was ensured that all those who remained <b>were</b> <b>dead.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{quarter of}} the homes in Cihuatlán, Jalisco, were totally destroyed, leaving many homeless. In Manzanillo, Colima, 40 percent of all homes were destroyed, and four ships in the harbor were sunk. Large {{portions}} of Colima and Jalisco were isolated by flooding. Hundreds of people were stranded. Minatitlán, Colima, suffered especially, as 800people out of its population of 1000 <b>were</b> <b>dead</b> or missing, according to a message sent to President Adolfo López Mateos. In Colima, all coconut plantations were blown down {{and thousands of people}} were left out of work. That state's economy was damaged enough that officials thought it would take years to recover.|$|E

5|$|By the 1030s Malcolm's sons, {{if he had}} any, <b>were</b> <b>dead.</b> The only {{evidence}} that {{he did have a}} son or sons is in Rodulfus Glaber's chronicle where Cnut is said to have stood as godfather to a son of Malcolm. His grandson Thorfinn would have been unlikely to be accepted as king by the Scots, and he chose the sons of his other daughter, Bethóc, who was married to Crínán, lay abbot of Dunkeld, and perhaps Mormaer of Atholl. It may be no more than coincidence, but in 1027 the Irish annals had reported the burning of Dunkeld, although no mention is made of the circumstances. Malcolm's chosen heir, and the first tánaise ríg certainly known in Scotland, was Duncan.|$|E
5|$|Fightstar are a British post-hardcore {{band from}} London, England that formed in 2003. The band is {{composed}} of lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and co-vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Fightstar are known to incorporate metal, alternative rock, emo and other genres into their general post-hardcore sound. During the band's early days, they were viewed sceptically by critics because of Simpson's former pop career with Busted. Their live shows got a more positive reaction, and their 2005 debut EP, They Liked You Better When You <b>Were</b> <b>Dead,</b> was a critical success.|$|E
5|$|For a {{while it}} seemed that Franklin would also be burnt, but her crew were able {{to put out the}} fires. With Brueys killed aboard Orient, Du Chayla now became commander. Both he and Captain Gillet had been seriously wounded and taken below, but he {{continued}} to order the attack. The brief quiet that had resulted from the explosion of the Orient was broken by Franklins guns, and the battle resumed. She fought for another hour, but by then she had lost her main and mizzenmasts, nearly all of her cannons had been knocked out, and over half her crew <b>were</b> <b>dead</b> or wounded. She finally struck her colours.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to pleas from Travis, James Fannin started from Goliad with 320 men, supplies and armaments, yet had to abort {{a day later}} due to a wagon breakdown. Final reinforcements were able to enter the Alamo during March 1–4, most of them from Gonzales which had become a recruitment camp. Others who had left intending to return were unable to re-enter. At 5:30a.m. on March 6, the Mexican army began the final siege. An hour later, all combatants inside the Alamo <b>were</b> <b>dead.</b> The bodies, {{with the exception of}} Gregorio Esparza's, were cremated on pyres and abandoned. Esparza's brother Francisco was a soldier in the Mexican army and received permission from Santa Anna for a Christian burial.|$|E
5|$|Lashed together, Temeraire and Fougueux {{exchanged}} fire, Temeraire initially {{clearing the}} French ship's upper deck with small arms fire. The French rallied, but the greater {{height of the}} three-decked Temeraire compared to the two-decked Fougueux thwarted their attempts to board. Instead Harvey dispatched his own boarding party, led by First-Lieutenant Thomas Fortescue Kennedy, which entered Fougueux via her main deck ports and chains. The French tried to defend the decks port by port, but were steadily overwhelmed. Fougueuxs captain, Louis Alexis Baudoin, had suffered a fatal wound earlier in the fighting, leaving Commander François Bazin in charge. When he learned that {{nearly all of the}} officers <b>were</b> <b>dead</b> or wounded and that most of the guns were out of action, Bazin surrendered the ship to the boarders.|$|E

Jesse doubts this, believing {{it will be too}} much trouble for Gus to find another drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus understand the situation: neither can kill the other, so Gus might as well make them wish they <b>were</b> <b>dead.</b> The episode ends with police investigating Gale's apartment with the camera focusing on his lab notes which have yet to be discovered.|$|E

5|$|Little {{was done}} to either secure or {{indicate}} how his succession was to take place; the Julians and their supporters had fallen to the wrath of Sejanus, and his own sons and immediate family <b>were</b> <b>dead.</b> Two of the candidates were either Caligula, the sole surviving son of Germanicus, or his own grandson, Tiberius Gemellus. However, only a half-hearted attempt {{at the end of}} Tiberius' life was made to make Caligula a quaestor, and thus give him some credibility as a possible successor, while Gemellus himself was still only a teenager and thus completely unsuitable for some years to come.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1945, Soviet-controlled Hungarian radio {{announced}} that Wallenberg and his driver {{had been murdered}} {{on their way to}} Debrecen, suggesting that they had been killed by the Arrow Cross Party or the Gestapo. Sweden's foreign minister, Östen Undén, and its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Staffan Söderblom, wrongly assumed that they <b>were</b> <b>dead.</b> In April 1945, W. Averell Harriman, then of the U.S. State Department, offered the Swedish government help in inquiring about Wallenberg's fate, but the offer was declined. Söderblom met with Vyacheslav Molotov and Stalin in Moscow on 15 June 1946. Söderblom, still believing Wallenberg to be dead, ignored talk of an exchange for Russian defectors in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The Limbourg brothers's ornate Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry perhaps marks {{both the}} {{beginning}} and a highpoint of Netherlandish illumination. Later the Master of the Legend of Saint Lucy explored the same mix of illusionism and realism. The Limbourgs' career ended just as van Eyck's began – by 1416 all the brothers (none of whom had reached 30) and their patron Jean, Duke of Berry <b>were</b> <b>dead,</b> most likely from plague. Van Eyck {{is thought to have}} contributed several of the more acclaimed miniatures of the Turin-Milan Hours as the anonymous artist known as Hand G.
