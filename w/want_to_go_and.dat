25|$|In June 1846, Frémont and Carson both {{participated in}} a California {{uprising}} against Mexico called the Bear Flag Revolt. Mexico ordered all Americans to leave California. They did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> declared California an independent republic. American settlers in California wanted {{to be free of}} the Mexican government. The Americans found courage to oppose Mexico because they had Frémont and his troops behind them. Frémont wrote an oath of allegiance. He and his men were able to give some protection to the Americans. He ordered Carson to execute an old Mexican man named Jose De La Reyes Berryessa and his two adult nephews. These three were captured when they stepped ashore at San Francisco Bay. They were executed to keep them from taking reports to Mexico about the uprising.|$|E
500|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 25,000 tickets, {{with the remaining}} 25,000 being sent out to other clubs. 17,500 of those tickets were available to Southampton season ticket holders. Seat prices for the final exceeded £80, with the cheapest tickets available at £25. Southampton was given the South Stand, which was the larger end of the stadium, whereas Arsenal was situated at the opposite end. Although Southampton supporters were disappointed at the allocation share, chairman Rupert Lowe refused to criticise the FA's decision, by saying: [...] "The reality is that too many people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> there are never enough tickets." [...] In the lead up to the final, the South Wales Echo reported that many tickets were being sold on the black market, for [...] "20 times" [...] the face-value price.|$|E
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Time Out Sydney {{felt that}} the album is unfortunately Brian Eno's new album rather than U2's: [...] "for all that's new, there's no way that you'll mistake it for another band." [...] Pitchfork Media reviewer Ryan Dombal gave a score of 4.2 out of 10, stating, [...] "the album's ballyhooed experimentation is either terribly misguided or hidden underneath a wash of shameless U2-isms." [...] Kaj Roth of Melodic magazine described it as [...] "more electronic and less rock" [...] and stating {{that part of the}} album [...] "reminds just too much of their early 90's records". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun gave a rating of three and a half stars, comparing it to the 1990s albums Zooropa, Pop, and Original Soundtracks 1 while stating [...] "This is no blockbuster... It's the least immediate U2 album in years, but one that diehard fans will enjoy living with". Madeleine Chong of MTV Asia wrote that, [...] "Although U2 should be lauded for their efforts at constant reinvention and pushing the envelope in the rock genre, [...] possesses neither the iconic qualities of The Joshua Tree or the radical yet relevant magnetism of Achtung Baby." [...] Toronto Star music critic Ben Rayner called the songs boring, adding that the ambience introduced by Eno and Lanois was [...] "often all these vague, hook-deficient songs have going for them." [...] Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice gave the album a mixed review and wrote that its songs [...] "will remind you of other, much better songs, but in a way that only makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> listen to those other songs instead." [...] Time magazine also gave it an unfavourable review, calling the effort [...] "unsatisfied" [...] and [...] "mostly restless, tentative and confused." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Peniston herself {{seemed to}} be not worried about losing her audience, when interviewed {{at the time of}} I'm Movin' On release by Billboard: [...] "When you're first coming out as an artist, many times label {{executives}} have their own vision for you. But as you move forward, it's only fair that you begin determining your own direction. People will make the change with you as long as you’re honest about your craft and display a comfort for what it is that you’re doing," [...] two years later Peniston actually confirmed her doubts, after being questioned by the magazine: [...] "I can speak about this firsthand, believe me. Sometimes doing what you feel isn’t always accepted by the public. You’ve got to choose where you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> be consistent," [...] (said by the artist at the 5th annual Billboard Dance Music Summit that urged members of the dance music community to work together toward greater credibility, visibility and sales for the genre, held July 8–10 in 1998).|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{his history}} of {{drinking}} and fighting, York attended church regularly and often led the hymn singing. A revival meeting {{at the end of}} 1914 led him to a conversion experience on January 1, 1915. His congregation was the Church of Christ in Christian Union, a Protestant denomination that shunned secular politics and disputes between Christian denominations. This church had no specific doctrine of pacifism but it had been formed in reaction to the Methodist Episcopal Church, South's support of slavery, including armed conflict during the American Civil War, and it opposed all forms of violence. In a lecture later in life, he reported his reaction to the outbreak of World War I: [...] "I was worried clean through. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> kill. I believed in my Bible." [...] On June 5, 1917, at the age of 29, Alvin York registered for the draft as all men between 21 and 31 years of age were required to do on that day. When he registered for the draft, he answered the question [...] "Do you claim exemption from draft (specify grounds)?" [...] by writing [...] "Yes. Don't Want To Fight." [...] When his initial claim for conscientious objector status was denied, he appealed.|$|E
2500|$|Wong {{received}} {{an invitation to}} appear in Game of Death (死亡遊戲), but declined. He was scheduled to attend a screen test {{on the set of}} Enter the Dragon after Bruce Lee had finished shooting the film and was working on dubbing. Lee returned to Hong Kong from his last trip to the United States of America in late May 1973. Thus, Wong would have attended the screen test sometime in June 1973. Wong recalled, [...] "About two months before he (Bruce Lee) died he gave me a phone call ... After this he left Hong Kong to settle his film business. When he came back, he called me up and wanted me to participate in the making of Game of Death. He had also invited me to the studio to attend a screen test. I did not promise to act in the film, yet I still went to attend the screen test to please him." [...] In a 1986 interview, Wong said, [...] "I told him (Bruce Lee) that I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> die in my first movie! ... I wasn't in dire financial straits at the time, so I didn't have to do the film (just) to make money." [...] The role of Lee's final opponent was thus played by basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. In another interview, Wong said, [...] "It was for Game of Death, but I declined because I thought that the moves of Wing Chun style wouldn’t look good on film. I think the Wing Chun method is ugly for movies but very good and very logical for real fighting." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think that when you get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand up on the back of your neck and so we realized that we needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained. They decided to postpone the album's release until June and then August to continue recording.|$|E
