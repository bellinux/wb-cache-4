In this paper, soil, bark and bark-ash washing was tested on four different metal polluted soil and bark samples from hotspots at former industrial sites. Six different leaching agents; HCl, NR 4 Cl, lactic acid, EDDS and two acidic process waters from solid waste incineration, were tested, discussed and evaluated. For the soil washing processes, the final pH in the leachate strongly influences the metal leachability. The results show that a pH 99 % purity) could be recovered. After a single leaching step, the metal contents of the soil residues still exceed the maximum limits according to the Swedish guidelines.

40|$|Abstract. Geo-technological {{extraction}} methods recently {{are widely}} used in the mining industry. Removing the metals from underground ore deposits is carried out by injecting chemicals (solvents, oxidants, reducing agents) into wells drilled in them, and the subsequent extraction of metals from saturated solutions. Particularly, this method utilized for the extraction of uranium from flooded sediments and copper from poor (substandard) ores, {{as well as some}} non-ferrous and rare metals from waste dumps and tailings of substandard ore mines and processing enterprises. The paper discusses methods developed for prediction of moisture content (water saturation) in rocks under filtration of liquid with incomplete saturation of pores while changing the concentration of the metal in the liquid phase (in an ore body), as well as problems of dissolution and desorption of metal salts on the surface cracks or pores on ore body based on molecular diffusion equation of metal salts.

Inhibition is due to disulfiram, per se, and not to its reduction product, diethyldithiocarbamate, a powerful chelator.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{half of the}} samples were {{subjected}} to thermo-mechanical cycling, and the results demonstrated that this significantly reduced the flexural bond strength values for the gold alloy specimens, whereas, for the Co-Cr specimens, it decreased the flexural bond strength values, but without statistically significant differences. These results for the gold alloy group corroborate the results of other studies [14, 16, 17], which used the same conditions of thermo-mechanical cycling. Moreover, de Vasconcellos, et al. (2010) [13] examined the influence of temperature firing of the opaque layer and thermo-mechanical cycling on flexural bond strength between a ceramic and a Co-Cr alloy, and observed that the thermo-mechanical cycling did not significantly influence the bond strength between the ceramic and the basic alloy. Similar results were found by Tróia et al. (2003) [13, 21]. The Co-Cr alloy was not significantly influenced by both {{the effect of the}} presence or absence of the Wash Opaque bonding agent, and {{the presence or absence of}} thermo-mechanical cycling. One possible explanation for this phenomenon may be the difference between the opaque layer firing temperature when the ceramic (Vita VM 13) is applied to a basic <b>metal</b> (<b>Wash</b> Opaque at 940 °C and opaque ceramic at 920 °C) and when the same ceramic is applied to noble <b>metals</b> (<b>Wash</b> Opaque at 890 °C and opaque ceramic at 890 °C). In addition, previous studies [13, 28] evaluating the effect of increasing the firing temperature of the opaque layer on the bond strength between metal and ceramics have found that increasing this temperature improved the strength between metal and ceramic. The technique of increasing this temperature is based on the hypothesis that there is an increase in electron transference between the glass and metal oxides [29]. On the other hand, Vojdani et al. (2012) [23] evaluates in a recent study the effect of thermo-mechanical cycling (TMC) on the bond strength of a ceramic to three cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) and two nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) alloys, and they observed the thermo-mechanical fatigue condition decreases the bond strength of Ni-Cr and Co-Cr alloys to the ceramic. However, the authors affirmed the tested metal-ceramic systems still show sufficient bond strength for clinical performance of the restorations and the effect of thermo-mechanical cycling was relatively the same for all the tested base metal-ceramic systems.|$|R

This was done to obtain six levels of poly (DMAEM) —rice straw graft copolymers (PDMAEMRS) having different graft yields (expressed as N%) with increasing order and designated as (PDMAEMRS 1 to PDMAEMRS 6). The latter copolymers were dispersed in aqueous solution of heavy metal ions Cu (II) ions and filtered to form rice straw co-polymer—metal ions complex. Different factors affecting the heavy metal ions removal such as pH, extent of grafting, treatment time and rice straw dose were studied in detail. It was found from the obtained results that; the residual metal ions removal from their aqueous solutions increased with 1) increasing the extent of grafting of PDMAEMRS i. e. from PDMAEMRS 1 to PDMAEMRS 6; 2) increasing the pH of the metal ions solution complex from 1 to 8; 3) increasing the rice straw dosage from 0. 50 to 2. 0 g, then leveled off thereafter; 4) increasing the time of the reaction up to 20 minute then leveled off after that.

The morphology of the precipitated crystals evolved from platelet-like and needle-like shape to rod-like shape when the temperature was increased from 25 to 70 degrees C. An increase in the agglomeration of calcium sulfate was found with increasing lime concentration. Metal ions markedly retard the rate of crystallization of calcium sulfate dihydrate.
