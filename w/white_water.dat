5|$|There is {{evidence}} of occupation of the area by people from Mesolithic times onward. In the Neolithic period, people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunters and as gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make metal tools, weapons, containers and ornaments started in the late Neolithic, and continued into the bronze and Iron Ages. An earthen ring at Parracombe {{is believed to be}} a Neolithic henge dating from 5000–4000BC, and Cow Castle, which is where <b>White</b> <b>Water</b> meets the River Barle, is an Iron Age fort {{at the top of a}} conical hill.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, Tierco shifted its {{strategic}} direction to amusement parks. It sold {{much of its}} property in the late 1980s, generating capital to reinvest in Frontier City.

By 1991, Tierco opened <b>White</b> <b>Water</b> waterpark in Oklahoma City (the name later became <b>White</b> <b>Water</b> Bay).

50|$|Black and <b>white</b> <b>waters</b> differ {{significantly}} in their ionic composition, {{as shown in}} Table 1. Black waters are more acidic, resulting in an aluminum concentration {{greater than that of}} the more neutral <b>white</b> <b>waters.</b> The major difference is the concentrations of sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium; these are very low in black waters. This has ecological implications. Some animals need more calcium than is available in blackwaters, so for example, snails, which need much calcium to build shells, are not abundant in blackwaters. The lack of dissolved ions in black waters results in a low conductivity, similar to that of rainwater.|$|R
