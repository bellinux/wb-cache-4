500|$|Although Either/Or was Kierkegaard's {{first major}} book, {{it was one}} of his last books to be {{translated}} into English, as late as 1944. Frederick DeW. Bolman, Jr. insisted that reviewers consider the book in this way: [...] "In general, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to discover, if we can, the meaning of a work as comprehensive as Either/Or, considering it upon its own merits and not reducing the meaning so as to fit into the author's later perspective. It occurred to me that this was a service to understanding Kierkegaard, whose esthetic and ethical insights have been much slighted by those enamored of his religion of renunciation and transcendence. ... Kierkegaard's brilliance {{seems to me to be}} showing that while goodness, truth, and beauty can not speculatively be derived one from another, yet these three are integrally related in the dynamics of a healthy character structure".|$|E
500|$|Some 35 of the signers {{met at the}} St. Charles Hotel in Washington, D.C. on December 19, 1984, to {{determine}} a course of action. The meeting included 18 nuns of the Vatican 24. They said the Vatican, in its stern reaction, [...] "seeks to stifle {{freedom of speech and}} public discussion in the Roman Catholic Church and create the appearance of a consensus where none exists." [...] The group issed a statement describing the current Church stance as not {{in the spirit of the}} Vatican II which said, [...] "Let there be unity in what is necessary, freedom in what is unsettled and charity in any case." [...] Sister Donna Quinn, a past president of the National Coalition of American Nuns, said, [...] "We believe <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to speak out when we have a differing opinion, and this is something European men do not understand." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2008, it was {{announced}} that the Neumünster Zoo in northern Germany, which owns Knut's father, was suing the Berlin Zoo for the profits from Knut's success. [...] Although the Berlin Zoo conceded Neumünster's ownership of Knut due to a previous agreement, it contended that the other zoo has no right to its proceeds. Neumünster had previously tried to negotiate with Berlin Zoo, but later sought a court ruling in their favor. Peter Drüwa, the zoo director at Neumünster, stated that they [...] "do not want to remove Knut from his environment, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to our request for money." [...] Shortly before Knut's second birthday, reports began circulating that the bear would have to be relocated to another zoo because he was becoming too large for his enclosure. The zoo later released statements that they wish to keep Knut, and the mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, also declared he wanted the still-adolescent cub to stay in the capital.|$|E

60|$|It {{appeared}} with the suddenness of a pantomimic trick, stayed longer than <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to expect, and was as rapidly succeeded by high wind, bitter cold, and winter snow, over hill and dale.|$|R
2500|$|... "We {{are really}} asking the Court two things," [...] he continued. The first {{was to take}} the {{presumption}} that illegal use was intended in that kind of marketing, or at least take judicial notice. The second was in regard to the appeals court's concern about targeting certain lifestyles. [...] "I can't make the argument strong enough that I think under the rational interest of the community and the state <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to legislate against lifestyles, such as homicidal maniacs, burglars, and drug abusers ... We don't like his lifestyle in Hoffman Estates, and I don't think anywhere else in the country do they care for that lifestyle, and I believe <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to legislate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Palin has {{declared}} herself {{in favor of}} capital punishment. She has stated: [...] "If the legislature passed a death penalty law, I would sign it. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to know that someone who rapes and murders a child or kills an innocent person in a drive-by shooting {{will never be able}} to do that again." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Constitution {{does not}} {{guarantee}} us only {{the right to be}} correct, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to be honest and in error. And the views that I have expressed in this pamphlet I expressed honestly. I believe they were right. The future will show whether or not I was correct, but under the laws, as I understand it, and under the Constitution, as I understand it, every citizen in this country has the right to express himself ... on public questions.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{will never}} forgive them for putting irons on us," [...] O'Sullivan said passionately. [...] "If they had shot us at once, it was, I suppose, what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to expect; {{but to be}} treated like murderers, or ruffians of the worst kind, is too bad." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1718, {{the poet}} Alexander Pope, a renowned dog lover, also criticized Hales' work. In {{conversation}} with his friend, Joseph Spence, Pope reportedly said of Hale: [...] "He commits {{most of these}} barbarities {{with the thought of}} its being of use to man. But {{how do we know that}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to kill creatures that we are so little above as dogs, for our curiosity, or even for some use to us?". Pope, however was also a close friend of Hales [...] and considered him the model of the man who loves his God.|$|E
2500|$|On March 21, 2017, {{a lawsuit}} was {{filed against the}} {{district}} and Superintendent Richard H. Faidley {{on behalf of a}} student at Boyertown Area High School identified as [...] "Joel Doe," [...] alleging that his Fourteenth Amendment privacy rights were violated when a biological female self-identifying as a male was allowed to share the boys' locker room. The suit alleges the student's [...] "right was first violated without any notice or consent in a place traditionally--and by state statute--reserved for persons of one biological sex. Attorney Randall Wenger of the Independence Law Center said, [...] "Students shouldn’t be forced into situations where their personal privacy is violated. We, in society, have long recognized that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to our bodily privacy {{when it comes to a}} person of the opposite sex." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 13 May Powell {{said the}} task force was sent [...] "to repossess the Falkland Islands, to restore British {{administration}} of the islands {{and to ensure that}} the decisive factor in the future of the islands should be the wishes of the inhabitants" [...] but the Foreign Secretary (Francis Pym) desired an [...] "interim agreement": [...] "So far as I understand that interim agreement, it is in breach, if not in contradiction, of each of the three objects with which {{the task force}} was dispatched to the South Atlantic. There was to be a complete and supervised withdrawal of Argentine forces... matched by corresponding withdrawal of British forces. There is no withdrawal of British force that 'corresponds' to the withdrawal from the territory of the islands of those who have unlawfully occupied them. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to be there; those are our waters, the territory is ours and {{we have the right to}} sail the oceans with our fleets whenever we think fit. So the whole notion of a 'corresponding withdrawal', a withdrawal of the only force which can possibly restore the position, which can possibly ensure any of the objectives which have been talked about on either side of the House, is in contradiction of the determination to repossess the Falklands".|$|E
6000|$|J. M.—None—none. It was inevitable. I {{have never}} doubted. That [...] {{does not prevent}} lamentation that it was inevitable. It is the old [...] story.

6000|$|... 'Indeed, I {{know you}} could not; and {{it is better to}} have you now than even at the time. It is a new, fresh pleasure, when I can enjoy it better.

60|$|Thus it was I journeyed on, {{one moment}} buoyant with hope, {{and the next}} cast down by fear of what the future might have in store for us who called {{ourselves}} Minute Boys, hoping the day might come when {{we would be able}} to give good proof that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to such <b>a</b> title.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said March, thoughtfully, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> {{to expect}} {{anything}} else. Fulkerson's standards are low; they're merely business standards, {{and the good}} that's in him is incidental and something quite apart from his morals and methods.

Ere an hour elapsed I was at her side, watching her sew, gathering her sweet smiles and her merry words, which fell for me abundantly. We sat, as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to sit, side by side; my arm rested on her chair; I was near enough to count the stitches of her work, and to discern the eye of her needle.

50|$|Hicks {{rejected}} of {{the notion}} of an outward Devil as the source of evil, but rather emphasized that it was the human 'passions' or 'propensities'. Hicks stressed that basic urges, including all sexual passions, were neither implanted by an external evil, but all were aspects of human nature as created by God. Hicks claimed, in his sermon Let Brotherly Love Continue at the Byberry Friends Meeting in 1824 that:'He gave us passions—if we may call them passions—in order that we might seek after those things which we need, and which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to experience and know'.|$|R
