40|$|AbstractObjectivePoststernotomy mediastinitis, {{although}} infrequent, is {{a potentially}} life-threatening complication of cardiac surgery {{that continues to}} have a significant morbidity and mortality despite aggressive therapy. Vacuum-assisted closure uses controlled suction to provide evacuation of wound fluid, decrease bacterial colonization, stimulate granulation tissue, and reduce the need for dressing changes. MethodsOne hundred two patients from Duke University Hospital, The Durham Veterans Administration Hospital, and referring institutions underwent vacuum-assisted closure treatment. There were 63 men and 39 women, {{with a mean age of}} 67. The infection was noticed between postoperative days 8 and 34, at which time the wounds were opened and debrided. ResultsNinety-six of the 102 patients received vacuum-assisted therapy while the remaining 6 underwent daily multiple dressing changes without vacuum-assisted therapy. Fifty-three of the 96 patients required only sternal debridement, followed by <b>wound</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>therapy</b> and closure by secondary intention, while the remaining 43 had an additional procedure. Of these, 33 patients underwent omental transposition and 10 patients had a pectoralis flap. The length of stay for all patients was 27 ± 12 days. This was related in part to intravenous antibiotics. Hospital mortality for all patients was 3. 7 % (4 patients). Two of these patients underwent vascular flap and succumbed to multisystemic organ failure, while the other 2 received only <b>wound</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>therapy</b> following debridement and succumbed to overwhelming sepsis. ConclusionVacuum-assisted drainage is an effective therapy for mediastinitis following debribement or before placement of a vascularized tissue flap...|$|E
40|$|Background: Acute lower {{extremity}} compartment syndrome (CS) {{is a condition}} that untreated causes irreversible nerve and muscle ischemia. Treatment by decompression fasciotomy without delay prevents permanent disability. The use of intracompartmental pressure (iCP) measurement in uncertain situations aids in diagnosis of severe leg pain. As an infrequent complication of {{lower extremity}} trauma, consequences of CS include chronic pain, nerve injury, and contractures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to observe the clinical and functional outcomes for patients with lower extremity CS after fasciotomy. Methods: Retrospective chart analysis for patients with a discharge diagnosis of CS was performed. Physical demographics, employment status, activity at time of injury, injury severity score, fracture types, pain scores, hours to fasciotomy, iCP, serum creatine kinase levels, wound treatment regimen, length of hospital stay, and discharge facility were collected. Lower extremity neurologic examination, pain scores, orthopedic complications, and employment status at 30 days and 12 months after discharge were noted. Results: One hundred twenty‑four patients were enrolled in this study. One hundred and eight patients were assessed at 12 months. Eighty‑one percent were male. Motorized vehicles caused 51 % of injuries in males. Forty‑one percent of injuries were tibia fractures. Acute kidney injury occurred in 2. 4 %. Mean peak serum creatine kinase levels were 58, 600 units/ml. Gauze dressing was used in 78. 9 % of nonfracture patients and negative pressure <b>wound</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>therapy</b> in 78. 2 % of fracture patients. About 21. 6 % of patients with CS had prior surgery. Nearly 12. 9 % of patients required leg amputation. Around 81. 8 % of amputees were male. Sixty‑seven percent of amputees had associated vascular injuries. Foot numbness occurred in 20. 5 % of patients and drop foot palsy in 18. 2 %. Osteomyelitis developed in 10. 2 % of patients and fracture nonunion in 6. 8 %. About 14. 7 % of patients underwent further orthopedic surgery. At long‑term follow‑up, 10. 2 % of patients reported moderate lower extremity pain and 69. 2 % had returned to work. Conclusion: Escalation in leg pain and changes in sensation are the cardinal signs for CS rather than reliance on assessing for firm compartments and pressures. The severity of nerve injury worsens with the delay in performing fasciotomy. Standardized diagnostic protocols and wound treatment strategies will result in improved outcomes from this complication...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Acute {{and chronic}} wound defects {{of the lower}} {{extremities}} occurs in 15 – 25 % of patients with diabetes mellitus, serving as the direct cause of frequent amputations of lower extremities in 12 % of patients. One of the current and promising directions of <b>wound</b> healing is <b>vacuum</b> <b>therapy.</b> Objective. To study the effect of <b>vacuum</b> <b>therapy</b> on the course of acute and chronic wound process in patients with diabetic foot syndrome, depending on the pathogenic form of the injury, and {{on the basis of}} the findings to improve the outcomes of surgical treatment of the above-mentioned pathology. Materials and methods. The study involved 239 patients with complicated forms of diabetic foot syndrome. Monitoring of the wound progress is complemented by clinical, cytological, microbiological and morphological criteria. In the treatment of patients, we have used <b>vacuum</b> <b>therapy</b> device by Agat-Dnepr company. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>therapy</b> of <b>wounds</b> was carried out in the modes of negative pressure within 80 – 125 mmHg.

40|$|Background: Deep sternal wound {{infection}} (DSWI) is a {{life threatening}} complication of a median sternotomy. This {{study was conducted in}} Zagazig University Hospital in the period from Marsh 2014 to September 2016, to evaluate use of vacuum (VAC) in treatment of DSWI. Methods: Twelve patients with DSWI out of 840 median sternotomy procedures for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement, valve repair, adult congenital heart disease and mediastinal tumors which needed median sternotomy were collected; Radical debridement of the wounds was performed; sterile foam with drain was placed in the wound which was covered with sterile OPSITE dressing; the drain being connected to a suction unit maintaining − 100  mmHg pressure except wounds in which the cardiac surface directly touches the device we used minimum low negative pressure of − 50  mmHg because of the fear of hemorrhage and impairment of cardiac function. Follow up for 3 – 6 months after <b>vacuum</b> <b>therapy</b> was done to detect any morbidity or recurrence. Results: Patients with DSWI in our study were managed with this therapy. They were twelve patients. 7 were males and 5 females. Mean age was 66  years. Excellent wound healing occurred in eleven patients (91. 7 %), with no mortality while one patient (8. 3 %) had relapse (multiple sinuses appeared). This patient had multiple risk factors. The organisms isolated from his wound were Staphylococcus epidermis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. This patient required omental flap to fill the defect after radical debridement of the wound combined with a VAC therapy system and intravenous antifungal therapy, these led to this patient's favorable outcome. Conclusions: The incidence of DSWI was similar in our center to that in other cardiothoracic centers. Various risk factors were found to be associated with DSWI. The DSWI pathogens in our center are similar to those in other reports most of our patients were treated successfully with this technique with excellent <b>wound</b> healing.

40|$|The use of {{negative}} pressure <b>wound</b> <b>therapy</b> (<b>vacuum</b> dressings) is increasing in surgical incisions {{where there is}} a high risk of dehiscence, seroma, and other wound healing complications. In response to the growing use of various vacuum dressings in the prophylactic treatment of surgical incisions, a product evaluation of three products was undertaken in a hospital in Queensland, Australia. In this evaluation, the three aspects of product usability were considered in a specified context of use: 1) effectiveness; 2) efficiency; and 3) satisfaction. The perspectives of the treating medical officers, nursing staff and patients were elicited. Prior to the commencement, a two-week product-specific education program was implemented. Fifteen patients were recruited, with five patients for each dressing product. The evaluation was completed in its entirety for 13 / 15 (86. 6 %) of the dressing products. The majority of surgeons and ward nurses, who used the negative pressure dressing products, recommended them. Overall, surgeons preferred the Prevena頷hile nurses and patients preferenced the PICO頰roduct. The products evaluated here have individual features that make them appropriate to be used for certain incisional wounds. Product selection should be based on the type of surgery, the amount of wound ooze anticipated, and the level of risk associated with the incision.

30|$|Anastomotic leakage (AL) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and serious {{complications}} following visceral surgery. AL arising early postoperative are amenable to surgical revision, but those occurring later on are difficult to treat. In such cases, surgical revision is often not possible or only possible with major collateral damage due to the presence of intra-abdominal adhesions. In recent years, endoluminal <b>vacuum</b> <b>therapy</b> has been used for late occurring and not surgically amenable AL of the upper gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach). In this procedure, an endosponge is used to treat a perforation in the esophagus or an AL without surgical revision [1, 2].

30|$|Introduction of endoluminal <b>vacuum</b> <b>therapy</b> for AL {{located in}} the upper {{gastrointestinal}} tract has expanded the available therapeutic options for AL patients and greatly improved their prognosis. To date, however, this technique has been limited to AL that are easily accessible by endoscopy. The modified rendezvous technique described here enables effective treatment even in patients with endoscopically difficult or impossible to reach AL. Often, small intestinal leaks or insufficiencies of the duodenal stump are only detected when {{they are no longer}} amenable to surgical treatment. To the best of our knowledge, the literature contains only one report of a similar combined internal/external procedure and a few cases of application in the small intestine [3 – 5]. In that case, the defect was also successfully treated. Endoluminal <b>vacuum</b> <b>therapy</b> is superior to external drains such as “Robinson” or “Jackson Pratt” drains in this section of the intestine because it can continuously remove the high daily volume of bile, pancreatic fluid, and intestinal fluid passing through, leading to faster healing. It may also lessen the risk of developing an undrained “abscess.” The major limitation of this technique is the need to admit the patient to the ICU ward during the procedure as leaking or technical errors in the system must be detected rapidly to avoid compromising the therapeutic goal. A second disadvantage is that the pullback string by its nature creates a fistula between the abdominal wall and jejunum. But by the time, the leakage site had healed to a small channel of approximately 3  mm in diameter, comparable to the fistula left after removal of a jejunal feeding tube and finally closed spontaneously after completing the endoluminal <b>vacuum</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|R

30|$|In recent years, two new {{techniques}} {{are now available}} that enlarge the possibilities of defect closure: endoscopic <b>vacuum</b> <b>therapy</b> (EVT), and over-the-scope clip (OTSC).

OTSCs are loaded on a transparent cap which is mounted on the tip of a standard endoscope. By bringing the edges of the perforation into the cap, by suction or by dedicated devices, such as anchor or twin grasper, the OTSC can be placed to close the perforation.
