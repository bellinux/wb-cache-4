25|$|The 2007 Stanley Cup Final pitted the Ducks {{against the}} Ottawa Senators. Ottawa was making their first {{appearance}} in the Finals. The Ducks fell behind 2–1 in Game 1 at home, but in the third period, Ryan Getzlaf tied the game and with few minutes remaining, Rob Niedermayer fed Travis Moen in the slot for the game <b>winner.</b> <b>Game</b> 2 was a low-scoring but exciting game. The only goal came off the stick of Samuel Pahlsson to give the Ducks a two-game series lead. Game 3 saw the Ducks lose 5–3 on a controversial goal by Daniel Alfredsson; it appeared on replays Alfredsson kicked the puck into the net, but the officials ruled it a goal. Once again, however, Chris Pronger was suspended one game, this time for an elbow {{to the head of}} Dean McAmmond. Game 4 was tied {{at the end of the}} second period when more controversy arose—Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson appeared to shoot the puck intentionally at Scott Niedermayer, which set off a brawl at the end of the period. In the third period, Dustin Penner scored a goal from a Selanne pass to score the eventual game-winner in a 3–2 victory. On June 6, the Ducks defeated the Senators 6–2 at Honda Center to claim their first-ever Stanley Cup in franchise history. Scott Niedermayer was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, the second Duck to win the award after Giguere did so in 2003. After their championship victory, the Ducks became the first Californian team, and the first West Coast team since the 1925 Victoria Cougars, to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} an optimal single-winner preferential voting system, called the “GT method ” {{because of its}} use of symmetric two-person zero-sum game theory to determine the <b>winner.</b> <b>Game</b> theory is used not to describe voting as a multi-player game between voters, but rather to define when one voting system is better than another one. The cast ballots determine the payoff matrix, and optimal play corresponds to picking winners optimally. The GT method is a special case of the “maximal lottery methods ” proposed by Fishburn [14], when the preference strength between two candidates is measured by just the margin between them. We suggest that such methods have been somewhat underappreciated and deserve further study. The GT system, essentially by definition, is optimal: no other preferential voting system can produce election outcomes that are preferred more by the voters, on the average, {{to those of the}} GT system. We also look at whether the GT system has several standard properties, such as monotonicity, Condorcet consistency, etc. We also briefly discuss a deterministic variant of GT, which we call GTD. We present empirical data comparing GT and GTD against other voting systems on simulated data. The GT system is not only theoretically interesting and optimal, but simple to use in practice. We feel that it can be recommended for practical use. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} optimal single-winner {{preferential}} voting system, called the “GT method ” {{because of its}} interesting use of symmetric two-person zero-sum game theory to determine the <b>winner.</b> <b>Game</b> theory is not used to describe voting as a multi-player game between voters, but rather to define when one voting system is better than another one. The cast ballots determine the payoff matrix, and optimal play corresponds to picking winners optimally. The GT method is quite simple and elegant, and works as follows: • Voters cast ballots listing their rank-order preferences of the alternatives. • The margin matrix M is computed so that for each pair (x, y) of alternatives, the pairwise margin M(x, y) {{is the number of}} voters preferring x over y, minus the number of voters preferring y over x. • A symmetric two-person zero-sum game G is defined where the payoff matrix is M. Each player picks an alternative and wins M(x, y) points when he picks x and the opponent picks y. • An optimal mixed strategy p ∗ is computed, where p ∗ (x) is the probability that a player picks x under optimal play. If the optimal mixed strategy is not unique, we use the “most balanced” one. This optimal strategy is the same for both players, since the game is symmetric. ∗ Version April 8, 2010 • The election winner is determined by a randomized method, based for example on the use of ten-sided dice, that picks outcome x with probability p ∗ (x). If there is a Condorcet winner x, then p ∗ (x) = 1, and no dice are needed. We also briefly discuss a deterministic variant of GT, which we call GTD. The GT system, essentially by definition, is optimal: no other voting system can produce election outcomes that are liked better by the voters, on the average, than those of the GT system. We also look at whether the GT system has several standard properties, such as monotonicity, consistency, etc. The GT system is not only theoretically interesting and optimal, but simple to use in practice; it is probably easier to implement than, say, IRV. We feel that it can be recommended for practical use...|$|E
