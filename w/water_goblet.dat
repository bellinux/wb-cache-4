5000|$|The themes {{during this}} period {{included}} [...] "balustrade" [...] designs for <b>water</b> <b>goblets</b> and candlesticks, footed bowls and serving pieces. Decorative forms included wildlife pieces representing owls, penguins and other birds in smooth stylistic forms. Some pieces, such as the Ram's Head Candy Dish, playfully included clean lines crowned by an ornate design (a ram's head, complete with a ruff) on the lid as an homage to its classic earlier pieces.|$|R
25|$|The <b>waters</b> of the <b>goblet,</b> though, {{can be seen}} as a civilizing influence. The {{inhabitants}} of the goblet have a Utopian existence, pleasure boating on the tranquil waters and living among the temples and leafy woods. Where the waters spill onto the landscape below—where the two worlds interact—signs of life appear. In the background, far from the influence of the <b>goblet's</b> <b>waters,</b> the mountains are desolate and rocky. A similar depiction of civilization by the waterside can be seen in Cole's An Evening in Arcady (1843).|$|R
50|$|In histology, an {{intestinal}} gland (also crypt of Lieberkühn and intestinal crypt) is a gland {{found in}} the intestinal epithelium lining of the small intestine and large intestine (colon). The glands and intestinal villi are covered by epithelium which contains multiple types of cells: enterocytes (absorbing <b>water</b> and electrolytes), <b>goblet</b> cells (secreting mucus), enteroendocrine cells (secreting hormones), cup cells, tuft cells and, {{at the base of}} the gland, Paneth cells (secreting anti-microbial peptides) and stem cells. These cells are not all present in the colon.|$|R

A short time ago I had the {{happiness}} to lead to the altar this lady, your mistress, and not until now have we been able to give any public flourish to the event in Weatherbury. That it may be thoroughly well done, and that every man may go happy to bed, I have ordered to be brought here some bottles of brandy and kettles of hot <b>water.</b> A treble-strong <b>goblet</b> will he handed round to each guest." ...|$|R
25|$|The four House dormitories have secret entrances, {{generally}} {{known only}} to members of that house and require a password (Gryffindor & Slytherin), riddle answer (Ravenclaw) or ritual (Hufflepuff) {{in order to gain}} entrance. Inside is the common room, which contains armchairs and sofas for the pupils and tables for studying and homework. There are fireplaces to keep the rooms warm, and students either relax here in the evenings or else complete their homework, but may complete their work in the bedroom. There are notice boards in each common room and at other strategic points throughout the school. The students sleep in their House dormitories, which branch off from the common rooms. Each dormitory gets at least two rooms; one for boys and one for girls (an enchantment prevents boys from entering the girls' area, although there is no spell to prevent the reverse from occurring). Each student sleeps in a large four-poster bed with bed covers and heavy curtains in the House colours, and thick white pillows. There is a bedside table for each bed, and each dormitory has a jug of <b>water</b> and <b>goblets</b> on a tray.|$|R
2500|$|Cole's {{drawings}} {{from his}} trip to Europe or shortly thereafter also appear to prefigure the Goblet. They show his interest in fountains and basins and are influenced by those he saw during the Italian leg of his voyage, in Florence, Rome, and Tivoli. In one drawing, a series of huge basins adorned with vegetation descends to the sea. Another depicts a single, mossy-rimmed basin of normal size, but the ground-level view makes it appear monumental. Cole's drawings of the Italian volcanic lakes Nemi and Albano are also reminiscent of the <b>goblet's</b> <b>waters</b> and rim, insofar as they suggest that a [...] "basic visual analogy was at work in Cole's thoughts, an analogy between [...] actual landscapes he had observed and {{the shape of the}} water vessels and basins he imagined." ...|$|R
2500|$|On June 1, 1896, Pennoyer {{was elected}} {{the mayor of}} Portland. Previously, while governor, he had opposed the Bull Run Water Project, {{and at one point}} he vetoed a request for a $500,000 bond to finance its construction, {{claiming}} the water, because it originated in glaciers, would [...] "cause goiter to the fair sex of Portland." [...] The legislature came within one vote of overriding this veto, but it stood, and Judge Matthew Deady—who had drafted it—was so put out that he called the governor [...] "Sylpester Annoyer." [...] Ironically, during Pennoyer's term as mayor it fell to him to take the ceremonial first sip at the new water system's dedication ceremony. He took his drink of Bull Run <b>water,</b> set the <b>goblet</b> down and said, [...] "No flavor. No body. Give me the old Willamette." ...|$|R

There appears to be a good relationship between the school and the village, and the students get on well with the locals. Favourite places in Hogsmeade include Honeydukes Sweetshop, Zonko's Joke Shop, clothing stores such as Gladrags Wizardwear, the Shrieking Shack (regarded as the most haunted building in Britain), the pubs The Three Broomsticks and The Hog's Head, and Madam Puddifoot's coffee shop.|$|R
50|$|Taken from {{an early}} Russian folk tale retold in English by Arthur Ransome and is also {{inspired}} by Godfather Death. A soldier returns home after 20 years of war, with three biscuits in his knapsack. On his way he meets three beggars to whom he gives the biscuits; in return one gives him a ruby whistle, one the jolliest dance, and the final man, who gets the last biscuit despite the soldier being hungry himself, in return gives him a pack of magic playing cards and a musty sack that {{has the power to}} trap anything ordered into it. Using the sack, the soldier manages to trap a flock of geese, and so manages to feed himself. Upon arriving at an abandoned castle overrun with small devils, he plays them in a game of cards, winning 40 barrels of gold, and when they try to kill him, he captures them in the sack only letting them go when they promise to never return. He makes one of them swear to serve him and keeps its foot as leverage. Quickly becoming rich and famous because he removed the devils from a palace that is owned by the Tzar, his luck runs short when his son becomes deathly ill. Calling upon the devil, the soldier is given a glass goblet that allows the owner to see Death. If Death is {{at the foot of the}} person's bed (as was the case with his son), he or she will recover if sprinkled with <b>water</b> from the <b>goblet.</b> If Death is at the head of the bed, nothing can be done. Then the Tzar becomes ill and the soldier, seeing Death at the head of his bed, makes a bargain with Death: his life in exchange for the Tzar's. Death takes his offer and gives the illness to the soldier, curing the Tzar. Lying in his death bed, he summons Death into his sack and stops death from happening everywhere. But as time goes on, he sees people everywhere who are waiting for death that will not come. So he frees Death, who fears the soldier and his sack so much that he refuses to take the soldier's life. The soldier, old and weary of life, seeks out a way to die. He travels down to the underworld, forcing the devils at the gates (the same ones from before) to give him two hundred souls and a map to heaven. Terrified of the sack, the devils agree to his demands. Upon reaching the gates of heaven, he asks to be let in with the souls while begging for forgiveness from God, but he is denied by the gatekeeper. He gives the sack to one of the souls, asking the soul to summon him into the sack when he has passed through the gates. But since there is no memory in heaven, the soul forgets and the soldier is condemned to live forever upon the Earth. In closing, the storyteller remarks (with a smile) that the soldier is still probably about his business. As the Storyteller tosses the bag aside, a devil emerges from the bag unnoticed by the Storyteller but noticed by the dog who dismisses it as his imagination.|$|R
