5|$|Nobody except Leslie {{really cares}} about the trip: Ron (Nick Offerman) just wants to fish, Ben (Adam Scott) failed to bring a tent, and Tom (Aziz Ansari) just wants to relax in his huge tent filled with luxury {{electronic}} items. Tom expresses confusion as to why Ben, a state auditor who had been helping with Pawnee's financial problems, has not returned to his old job at Indianapolis; Ben does not explain his reasons, but it is hinted he harbors romantic feelings for Leslie. Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) sets up a romantic tent for April (Aubrey Plaza) in the wrong campsite miles away, forcing him to trek through the wilderness to find everyone and leaving April miserable on the campsite without Andy. During brainstorming sessions, nobody produces any good ideas because they assume Leslie <b>will</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> one. However, she worriedly confides to Ann and Ben she cannot think of anything {{on the same level}} of the harvest festival.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} shyness is a largely ego-driven fear of what other people <b>will</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a person's behavior. This results in a person becoming scared of doing or saying {{what they want to}} out of fear of negative reactions, being laughed at, humiliated or patronised, criticism or rejection. A shy person may simply opt to avoid social situations instead.|$|E
25|$|By using CBT people record {{how much}} food they eat and periods of {{vomiting}} {{with the purpose}} of identifying and avoiding emotional fluctuations that bring on episodes of bulimia on a regular basis. Barker (2003) states that research has found 40–60% of people using cognitive behaviour therapy to become symptom free. He states in order for the therapy to work, all parties must work together to discuss, record and develop coping strategies. Barker (2003) claims by making people aware of their actions they <b>will</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> alternatives. People undergoing CBT who exhibit early behavioral changes are most likely to achieve the best treatment outcomes in the long run. Researchers have also reported some positive outcomes for interpersonal psychotherapy and dialectical behavior therapy.|$|E

I was thinking about her all the time, and by and by she became real to me. You see, it was making believe, and I knew it all the time, and then again I did n't. Whenever I <b>'d</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the men, and the work, and the hard life, I 'd know it was make-believe; but when I <b>'d</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her, it was n't.

25|$|In the Torah the Israelites are {{commanded}} to dye one of {{the threads}} of their tallit (prayer shawl) with tekhelet; {{when they look at}} this dye they <b>will</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the blue sky, and of the God above them in Heaven. Tekhelet corresponds to the color of the divine revelation (Midrash Numbers Rabbah xv.) Blue in Judaism has thus had an important significance throughout the history of Jewish culture up to the present. Blue was also associated with the ten commandments. When Moses and the elders went up the mount Sinai, they saw God standing on a Sapphire pavement (Blue) and the tables of the law were made of THE stone (i.e. Sapphire) and thus the blue on their garments was to be a permanent reminder of the law of God.|$|E
500|$|The Joker's {{controlling}} and abusive relationship with Harley Quinn has been analysed {{as a means}} of the Joker reinforcing his own belief in his power in a world where he may be killed or neutralized by another villain or Batman. Joker mirrors his identity through Harley in her appearance, and even though he may ignore or act indifferent towards her, he continues to try and subject her to his control. When Harley successfully defeats Batman in [...] (1994), the Joker, emasculated by his own failure, severely injures her out of fear of what the other villains <b>will</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him. However, while Harley recovers, the Joker sends her flowers which she accepts, reasserting his control over her.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Stieg Larsson's novel created Hollywood {{interest}} in adapting the book, as became apparent in 2009, when Lynton and Pascal pursued {{the idea of}} developing an [...] "American" [...] version unrelated to the Swedish film adaptation released that year. By December, two major developments occurred for the project: Steven Zaillian, who had recently completed the script for Moneyball (2011), became the screenwriter, while producer Scott Rudin finalized a partnership allocating full copyrights to Sony. Zaillian, who was unfamiliar with the novel, got a copy from Rudin. The screenwriter recalled, [...] "They sent {{it to me and}} said, 'We want to do this. [...] We <b>will</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as one thing for now. It's possible that it can be two and three, but let's concentrate on this one.'" [...] After reading the book, the screenwriter did no research on the subject.|$|E

500|$|Trumble {{was known}} for his cleverness on the field. C. B. Fry said of him, [...] "He is the most long-headed, observant and acute judge of the game, a perfect master of the whole art of placing fieldsmen and {{changing}} bowlers." [...] On one occasion when captaining his state side, Victoria, he deliberately bowled two wides that his fieldsmen allowed to roll to the boundary to score four runs for his opponents. This was done to save his tired bowlers from having to bowl again immediately, as his opponents would have been required to follow-on (bat twice in a row), at the time compulsory. When questioned by an onlooker about the dubious sportsmanship of the action, he replied, [...] "I had to do it, old chap, but I wonder what my father <b>will</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it?" [...] Trumble was respected by his teammates and opponents; New Zealand cricketer, Dan Reese, who played against and alongside Trumble said, [...] "His subtle humour, his fund of cricket stories, his kindness, and, above all, his judgment, made him a man of exceptional character." ...|$|E
500|$|Calling {{the show}} a [...] "theatrical {{multimedia}} spectacular", Madonna wanted a huge stage {{with a central}} platform from which {{a flight of stairs}} descended. The central [...] platform was flanked by two lower platforms, which housed the band and the musicians. A large video screen was suspended above the stairs, which descended during the show. Two projectors were situated {{at the front of the}} stage, which projected images of The Pope and President Ronald Reagan during the show. Patrick Leonard, who had produced True Blue, joined as the musical director for the shows. Instead of following every note on the records, Leonard encouraged the musicians to come up with new ideas for the songs. Hence a number of the old songs were rearranged, including introducing a medley of [...] "Dress You Up", [...] "Material Girl" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin"—which contained a sample from the Four Tops song [...] "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)". American choreographer Shabba Doo was signed to choreograph the show. 13-year-old Christopher Finch was signed to play the part of the small boy from the [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] video, since Felix Howard, who played the original part, did not get a working license, and hence could not join the tour. Madonna wanted three backup singers, a team of male dancers and a succession of costume changes. She took inputs from her then husband, actor Sean Penn saying, [...] "I really respect Sean's opinion. He has great taste and is a very brilliant man. When I was putting my tour together, it was always in the back of my mind: 'I wonder what Sean <b>will</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> this?' He's extremely opinionated and has really high standards, and that sometimes pushed me into making decisions I wouldn't have otherwise made." [...] The title [...] "Who's That Girl Tour" [...] came to Madonna's mind during rehearsals one-day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself, projected on a screen on the stage. She commented, ...|$|E

Cay goes to visit Vivian {{at the hotel}} and overcomes Vivian's resistance to making love with her, and they start a relationship. With the impending finalization of Vivian's divorce, the two must sort out {{the future of their}} relationship. Vivian is afraid of what people in her academic circle <b>will</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her being in a relationship with another woman, and Cay is unsure of what she would ever do in New York City. At Silver's wedding, Vivian and Cay are in attendance, Frances and Cay are brought back together, and Cay admits to Frances that Vivian has [...] "reached in and put a string of lights around my heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1999, al-Shehhi, Atta, Ziad Jarrah, Said Bahaji, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh {{decided to}} travel to Chechnya {{to fight against the}} Russians, but were {{convinced}} by Khalid al-Masri and Mohamedou Ould Slahi at the last minute to change their plans. They instead traveled to Afghanistan to meet with Osama bin Laden and train for terrorist attacks. Immediately afterwards, Atta, al-Shehhi, and Jarrah reported their passports stolen, possibly to erase travel visas to Afghanistan. After their training, the hijackers began to attempt to hide their radicalism. al-Shehhi shaved his beard and seemed to his old friends like he had become less religious. After the attacks, a librarian in Hamburg reported that al-Shehhi boasted to her [...] "There will be thousands of dead. You <b>will</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me ...

2500|$|On April 10, 1961, Combs {{appropriated}} $50,000 {{from the}} governor's contingency fund {{to construct the}} clock on the lawn of the state capitol. Combs had seen a similar clock in Edinburgh, Scotland, and believed it would be a colorful addition to the capitol grounds. When construction was completed on the clock, some ridiculed it as [...] "Combs' Folly" [...] or [...] "Big Bert" [...] (an allusion to London's Big Ben). Combs' political foe, A. B. [...] "Happy" [...] Chandler, was particularly critical, declaring [...] "It's amazing what some people <b>will</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> when they have nothing better to do." [...] In a subsequent gubernatorial campaign, Chandler mocked the clock, declaring [...] "Well, they don't say it's half past 2 in Frankfort anymore. They say it's two petunias past the jimson weed." [...] Chandler's derision became the minority view in time, however; according to journalist John Ed Pearce, the clock {{became one of the most}} talked-about and visited tourist attractions in the state and the most visited place in Frankfort.|$|E
