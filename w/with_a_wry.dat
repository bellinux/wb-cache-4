5|$|As he {{continues}} his investigations, Craven is visited by Emma's ghost. The fingerprints on the getaway car used by Emma's killer match that of Lowe, a man Craven arrested ten years previously. Meanwhile, Pendleton takes Craven {{to meet his}} colleague, Harcourt (Ian McNeice), who informs him that Emma {{was a member of}} a subversive anti-nuclear group called GAIA. A team of six GAIA members, led by Emma, had broken into a low level radioactive waste facility at Northmoor; all are now either dead or missing. After Craven makes a televised appeal for information about Emma's killer, he is contacted by CIA agent Darius Jedburgh (Joe Don Baker), an associate of Harcourt and Pendleton. Jedburgh shows Craven the CIA's file on Emma's activities: GAIA had become suspicious of Northmoor when a nearby reservoir had become contaminated with radioactive material, an occurrence that had also alerted the CIA, leading them to believe Northmoor was illegally storing plutonium. Jedburgh is played as a hard-bitten professional <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> sense of humour and a passion for ballroom dancing. Along with Harcourt and Pendleton, he is keen to find the source and purpose of the plutonium.|$|E

According to Stauffer, [...] "the disarming deflation of the passage {{goes a long way}} toward redeeming it, and is typical of the winning contradictions of the narrator's style". Tom Pocock in Rider Haggard and the Lost Empire has also highlighted the [...] "literary framework" [...] that Haggard constructs throughout much of the narrative, referencing Keats, Shakespeare, and Classical literature to imbue the story with a [...] "Gothic sensibility". Yet as Stauffer notes, [...] "Ultimately, however, one thinks of Haggard's plots, episodes, and images as the source of his lasting reputation and influence.|$|E

500|$|Despite Hawks's work in {{a variety}} of Hollywood genres, he still {{retained}} an independent sensibility. Film critic David Thomson wrote of Hawks: [...] "Far from being the meek purveyor of Hollywood forms, he always chose to turn them upside down. To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep, ostensibly an adventure and a thriller, are really love stories. Rio Bravo, apparently a Western – everyone wears a cowboy hat – is a comedy conversation piece. The ostensible comedies are shot through with exposed emotions, with the subtlest views of the sex war, and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> acknowledgment of the incompatibility of men and women." [...] David Boxwell argues that the filmmaker's body of work [...] "has been accused of a historical and adolescent escapism, but Hawks's fans rejoice in his oeuvre's remarkable avoidance of Hollywood's religiosity, bathos, flag-waving, and sentimentality.|$|E
500|$|For the 1986 Tour, LeMond was a co-leader of the La Vie Claire team {{alongside}} Hinault. Hinault's support {{seemed less}} certain the closer the race approached. An unspoken condition {{was that his}} help would be contingent upon LeMond demonstrating that he was clearly the better rider. Hinault was in superb form, and {{had the chance to}} win an unprecedented sixth Tour. Hinault chose to let the Stage 9 individual time trial be the decider for which rider would receive the full support of team La Vie Claire. Hinault won the Stage 9 time trial, finishing 44 seconds in front of LeMond. LeMond had bad luck during the stage, having suffered a punctured tire requiring a wheel change, and later in the stage a bicycle change was required when he broke a wheel. He was frustrated with the outcome and the impact it would have on how the team would function {{for the remainder of the}} race. In Stage 12, the first mountain stage of the race in the Pyrenees, Hinault attacked the lead group and built up an overall lead. By the end of Stage 12, Hinault had a five-minute lead over LeMond and the other top riders. He claimed he was trying to draw out LeMond's rivals, but none of these attacks were planned with LeMond. He was clearly willing to ride aggressively and take advantage of the opportunities presented. LeMond was never placed in difficulty, except by his own teammate. The following day Hinault broke away again early but was caught and then dropped by LeMond on the final climb of Stage 13, allowing LeMond to gain back four and a half minutes. The next three stages brought the Tour to the Alps. On Stage 17 LeMond and Urs Zimmermann dropped Hinault from the leading group, and the end of the day saw LeMond pulling on the yellow jersey of race leader, the first time it had ever been worn by a rider from the United States. The following day in the Alps saw Hinault attack again early on the first climb, but he was pulled back. Attempting an escape on the descent, he was unable to separate himself from LeMond. The La Vie Claire team leaders were both excellent descenders. As they ascended up the next col they continued to pull away from the field, and maintained the gap as they reached the base of the final climb, the vaunted Alpe d'Huez. They pressed on through the crowd, ascending the twenty-one switchbacks of Alpe d'Huez and reaching the summit together. LeMond put an arm around Hinault and gave him a smile and the stage win in a show of unity, but the infighting was not over. Hinault attacked again on Stage 19 and had to be brought back by teammates Andrew Hampsten and Steve Bauer. Commenting on the team situation prior to the final individual time trial at Stage 20, LeMond offered the following <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> smile: [...] "He's attacked me from the beginning of the Tour De France. He's never helped me once, and I don't feel confident at all with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Wise, whose film The Sand Pebbles {{had been}} postponed, read Lehman's first draft, was {{impressed}} by what he read, and agreed to direct the film. Wise joined the picture in October 1963, and flew to Salzburg with associate producer Saul Chaplin and members of his production team to scout filming locations, including many that Wyler had identified. When he returned, Wise began working on the script. Wise shared Lehman's vision of the film being centered on the music, and the changes he made {{were consistent with the}} writer's approach—mainly reducing the amount of sweetness and sentimentality found in the stage musical. He had reservations about Lehman's opening aerial sequence because they'd used a similar opening in West Side Story, but decided to keep it. Other changes included replacing [...] "An Ordinary Couple" [...] with a more romantic number, and a new song for Maria's departure from the abbey—Rodgers provided [...] "Something Good" [...] and [...] "I Have Confidence" [...] especially for the film. Lehman completed the second draft on December 20, 1963, but additional changes would be made based on input from Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer about the character of the Captain. Plummer especially helped transform a character lacking substance into a stronger, more forceful complex figure <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> sense of humor and a darker edge. Lehman completed his final draft on March 20, 1964.|$|E

2500|$|Little Broken Hearts {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69 based on 27 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic rated the album three-and-a-half stars {{out of five}} and found that Jones and Burton are [...] "well matched" [...] and added: [...] "Norah Jones may be pouring her heart out but it's been given an elegantly detailed sculpture that camouflages her pain. Listen closely and its evident, but it takes effort to ignore the alluring haze and hear the songs that lie beneath." [...] American Songwriters review was positive about the album, calling it [...] "the most dramatic and rewarding departure she's [...] made in her career" [...] and said: [...] "Little Broken Hearts is her most commanding and compelling role yet." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave a positive review to the album and rated it four-stars-out-of-five, writing: [...] "It might be dark, but this stunning collection of anguish is the brightest she's shined in a long time." [...] Marcus J. Moore of BBC Music also gave a positive review to the album, mentioned she [...] "never sounds too depressed on this set", and further expanded: [...] "She keeps the mood fairly moderate amongst Burton's fluid soundtrack, setting the pace <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> bravado that makes this album a dynamic listen." [...] Maerz of Entertainment Weekly gave a B grade to the album and wrote: [...] "With Brian Burton (a.k.a. Danger Mouse) producing, the heavy-lidded-vixen thing works for her here." [...] Consequence of Sound critic Adam Kivel went in-depth on his review of the album, finally giving it three-and-a-half stars out of five and concluded: [...] "This is a serious indie pop album. Jones and Burton have created something that should fit in the record collection of any Feist-loving indie kid just as easily as that of those soccer moms she won over years ago." ...|$|E
