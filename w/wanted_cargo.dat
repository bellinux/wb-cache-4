6000|$|The other {{looked hard}} at him, {{but his face}} was inscrutable and he went on: [...] "Well, I don't <b>want</b> the <b>cargo,</b> and {{may be forced to}} heave much of it {{overboard}} in order to lighten the hull. However, if we find stuff worth saving, we'll put it on the beach and I'll take a third-part of the value, and you can send out an agent to tally the goods." ...|$|R
50|$|Winklespruit {{is a small}} {{seaside resort}} north of {{the mouth of the}} Illovo River in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It forms part of eThekwini. On May 10, 1875 the {{schooner}} Tonga which was carrying wares for Durban was wrecked here. The sailors not <b>wanting</b> the <b>cargo</b> to go to waste set up a store on the river bank and sold the water damaged goods. The store was known by the Afrikaans as winkel (shop).|$|R

The plan is good, I buy more cart and get rich quick. Vaya! The cart {{is on the}} mole, two good mule in front. Comes the locomotura, pushing the concrete block. Mal rayo! The driver not look, and the mule is in the sea. I am no more commerciante; I am anarchist!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Marston nodded. [...] "I've been pondering this. They {{could put}} {{three or four}} platoons of cazadores on board the old gunboat and land them where they are <b>wanted</b> in the <b>cargo</b> lighters. In fact, if it was fine weather, the Government's tug could tow them all the way. That's why Larrinaga brought the pilot over. The {{question}} is: what ought we to do about it? Do you mean to warn the Bat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose the}} {{authorities}} {{will want to}} keep the prisoners, but of course you will report them on your arrival; and can give them one of the boats, to land across the bay, if they are not wanted. If the governor wants to buy the cargo for the garrison, let him have it, at once. Don't stand out for exorbitant terms, but take a fair price. It is just as well to be on good terms with the authorities. We might have to put in to refit, and want spars, etc., from the naval yard. If the governor doesn't <b>want</b> the <b>cargo,</b> don't sell it to anyone else till we return. There is no fear of prices going down. The longer we keep it, the more we shall get for it." ...|$|R
50|$|One of the crewers {{is killed}} in an {{accident}} a few hours later, {{and a series of}} other bizarre occurrences leads McKell to believe that they have a saboteur aboard; he begins keeping a wary eye on the crew. He stops as planned on Xathru to pick up Ixil and contact Brother John, who gives him a reluctant go-ahead to carry on with the voyage. While on Xathru, he is assaulted by a pair of strange aliens who say they <b>want</b> the Icarus <b>cargo.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a single air-cargo carrier, which <b>wants</b> to allocate <b>cargo</b> capacity to multiple forwarders before a booking horizon starts. A contribution that the carrier earns from each forwarder {{is based on}} the actual allotment usage {{at the end of the}} horizon. The airline's problem is to choose the allotments that maximize the expected total contribution. We derive a probability distribution of the actual usage by using a discrete Markov chain and solve the problem by using a dynamic programming method. Two heuristics for a large-scale allocation problem are also proposed, and their performances are tested via numerical experiments. Air-cargo Capacity management Stochastic model applications...|$|R
50|$|There is a {{proposal}} of starting cargo facility from this airport. International cargo facility {{is vital for}} Pune as many airlines <b>want</b> to start <b>cargo</b> flights to/from Pune. This project will enable foreign cargo operators to operate to Pune. Pune was declared as customs airport on 17 January 1997, primary for exporting perishable agricultural products, i.e. flowers, fruits, vegetable and processed food. This project will also help to attract of foreign airlines to operate to Pune. For instance Silk Air {{a subsidiary of the}} Singapore Airlines wants to operate non-stop from Singapore to Pune. This 600 square metre terminal will be located adjacent to the new arrival terminal.|$|R
50|$|After {{finding the}} shell of an Ohmu while {{collecting}} spores in the Toxic Forest, Nausicaä rescues Master Yupa from an Ohmu that she pacifies. Lord Yupa gives Nausicaa a fox squirrel she names Teto. Upon returning to the Valley of the Wind, Obaba tells {{the legend of the}} Blue Clad One, who will walk in a field of gold and renew the lost link with the Earth. The next night, a Tolmekian airship is attacked by insects and crashes in the Valley of the Wind and Nausicaä hears the last words of Lastel, a princess of the city of Pejite who <b>wants</b> the ship's <b>cargo</b> to be destroyed. When the people of the Valley of the Wind try to destroy the airborne spores of the Toxic Jungle, they note that a wounded insect that Nausicaä reassured retreated back to the Toxic Jungle.|$|R
5000|$|San Diego-based trio Blink-182, {{formed in}} 1992, first {{promoted}} itself by recording low-fi demos to distribute to local record stores and at concerts. The three eventually were playing concerts at local venues such as SOMA, which alerted local independent record label Cargo Music. Cargo {{was at the}} heart of San Diego's music scene, which wasn't particularly thriving but still produced several skate punk acts. [...] Pat Secor, who funded the trio's demo Buddha and was the former boss of Hoppus, pulled for Blink's move to Cargo through a roommate who knew Cargo executives. O, guitarist of local Cargo Music-signed act Fluf, saw potential in the young band and pushed them from the beginning. Eric Goodis, president of <b>Cargo,</b> <b>wanted</b> to diversify the label by incorporating different styles of music. His son, Brahm Goodis, thought Blink and their style of Southern California punk fit the bill and encouraged his father to listen to a tape. Together, O and Brahm Goodis convinced Eric Goodis to attend a live performance of the band.|$|R
60|$|The weather still {{continued}} clouded and menacing. Betts was of opinion, therefore, that {{it might}} be well to stow the provisions and water they intended to use in the pinnace, while she was on the stocks, as they could work round her so much the more easily then than afterwards. Accordingly, the breakers were got out, on board the ship, and filled with fresh water. They were then stuck into the raft. A barrel of beef, and one of pork followed, with a quantity of bread. At two trips the raft carried all the provisions and stores that were <b>wanted,</b> and the <b>cargoes</b> were landed, rolled up {{to the side of the}} pinnace, hoisted on board of her, by means of the throat-halliard, and properly stowed. Two grapnels, or rather one grapnel, and a small kedge, were found among the pinnace's materials, everything belonging to her having been stowed in the same part of the ship. These, too, were carried round to the ship-yard, got on board, and their hawsers bent. In a word, every preparation was made that might be necessary to make sail on the pinnace, and to proceed to sea in her, at once.|$|R
60|$|I pass swiftly {{over those}} twelve or fifteen months {{in which we}} {{continued}} to keep the sea in the North Atlantic, getting our food and water from the ships we over-hauled, and doing on the whole a pretty fortunate business. Sure, no one could wish to read anything so ungenteel as the memoirs of a pirate, even an unwilling one like me! Things went extremely better with our designs, and Ballantrae kept his lead, to my admiration, from that day forth. I would be tempted to suppose that a gentleman must everywhere be first, even aboard a rover: but my birth is every whit {{as good as any}} Scottish lord's, and I am not ashamed to confess that I stayed Crowding Pat until the end, and was not much better than the crew's buffoon. Indeed, it was no scene to bring out my merits. My health suffered from a variety of reasons; I was more at home to the last on a horse's back than a ship's deck; and, to be ingenuous, the fear of the sea was constantly in my mind, battling with the fear of my companions. I need not cry myself up for courage; I have done well on many fields under the eyes of famous generals, and earned my late advancement by an act of the most distinguished valour before many witnesses. But when we must proceed on one of our abordages, the heart of Francis Burke was in his boots; the little eggshell skiff in which we must set forth, the horrible heaving of the vast billows, the height of the ship that we must scale, the thought of how many might be there in garrison upon their legitimate defence, the scowling heavens which (in that climate) so often looked darkly down upon our exploits, and the mere crying of the wind in my ears, were all considerations most unpalatable to my valour. Besides which, as I was always a creature of the nicest sensibility, the scenes that must follow on our success tempted me as little as the chances of defeat. Twice we found women on board; and though I have seen towns sacked, and of late days in France some very horrid public tumults, there was something in the smallness of the numbers engaged, and the bleak dangerous sea-surroundings, that made these acts of piracy far the most revolting. I confess ingenuously I could never proceed unless I was three parts drunk; it was the same even with the crew; Teach himself was fit for no enterprise till he was full of rum; {{and it was one of}} the most difficult parts of Ballantrae's performance, to serve us with liquor in the proper quantities. Even this he did to admiration; being upon the whole the most capable man I ever met with, and the one of the most natural genius. He did not even scrape favour with the crew, as I did, by continual buffoonery made upon a very anxious heart; but preserved on most occasions a great deal of gravity and distance; so that he was like a parent among a family of young children, or a schoolmaster with his boys. What made his part the harder to perform, the men were most inveterate grumblers; Ballantrae's discipline, little as it was, was yet irksome to their love of licence; and what was worse, being kept sober they had time to think. Some of them accordingly would fall to repenting their abominable crimes; one in particular, who was a good Catholic, and with whom I would sometimes steal apart for prayer; above all in bad weather, fogs, lashing rain and the like, when we would be the less observed; and I am sure no two criminals in the cart have ever performed their devotions with more anxious sincerity. But the rest, having no such grounds of hope, fell to another pastime, that of computation. All day long they would he telling up their shares or grooming over the result. I have said we were pretty fortunate. But an observation fails to be made: that in this world, in no business that I have tried, do the profits rise to a man's expectations. We found many ships and took many; yet few of them contained much money, their goods were usually nothing to our purpose - what did we <b>want</b> with a <b>cargo</b> of ploughs, or even of tobacco? - and it is quite a painful reflection how many whole crews we have made to walk the plank for no more than a stock of biscuit or an anker or two of spirit.|$|R
