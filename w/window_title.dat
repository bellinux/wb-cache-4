5000|$|From System 1 through Mac OS 7.6, {{the default}} system fonts for Mac OS were Chicago for menus and <b>window</b> <b>titles</b> and Geneva for Finder icons, {{and they could}} not be customized. Actually, the fonts for Finder icons became {{customizable}} starting in System 7. It is accessible in the [...] "Views" [...] control panel. In Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9, the default system font was changed to Charcoal menus and <b>window</b> <b>titles,</b> but it could be customized in Preferences.|$|R

For example, to change {{the title of the}} current document (visible in its <b>window's</b> <b>title</b> bar) to its URL, the following bookmarklet may seem to work.javascript:document.title=location.href;However, as the assignment statement returns a value (the URL itself), many browsers actually create a new page to display this value.|$|R
5000|$|Horizontally {{across the}} top left half is the menu bar, which shows the {{application}} name and <b>window</b> <b>title,</b> and gives access to the application's menu (which contains the typical file, edit, view, tools, etc., menus and sub-menus).|$|E
5000|$|A {{single window}} button by default, Close, instead of three (configurable).

Shaston was described in Apple IIGS technote #41 as [...] "a modified Helvetica", but the similarities are not striking. The fonts of the original Macintosh were also available for the GS.|$|R
50|$|Some {{applications}} customize {{the system}} menu, typically through the GetSystemMenu WinAPI function. The Win32 console, used e.g. by the Command Prompt (cmd.exe), {{is an example}} of this and offers the user an ability to change its preferences through its system menu (other applications typically offer the user to change their preferences through the normal menu below their <b>window's</b> <b>title</b> bar).|$|R

50|$|Some window {{managers}} {{display a}} small icon in the titlebar that may {{vary according to}} the application on which it appears. The titlebar icon may behave like a menu button, or may provide a context menu facility. OS X applications commonly have a proxy icon next to the <b>window</b> <b>title</b> that functions the same as the document's icon in the file manager.|$|E
50|$|The Microwindows API {{tries to}} be {{compliant}} with the Microsoft Win32 and WinCE GDI standard. Currently, there is support for most of the graphics drawing and clipping routines, as well as automatic <b>window</b> <b>title</b> bar drawing and dragging windows for movement. The Microwindows API is message-based, and allows programs to be written without regard to the eventual window management policies implemented by the system. The Microwindows API is not currently client/server, and will be discussed in more detail in section 4.|$|E

5000|$|WindowShade was {{a control}} panel {{extension}} for the classic Mac OS that allowed a user to double-click a <b>window's</b> <b>title</b> bar to [...] "roll up" [...] the window like a windowshade. When {{the window was}} [...] "rolled up", only the title bar of the window was visible; the window's content area disappeared, allowing easier manipulation of the windows on the screen.|$|R
5000|$|In some {{graphical}} {{user interfaces}} an asterisk is pre- or appended to the current working document name shown in a <b>window's</b> <b>title</b> bar to indicate that unsaved changes exist. In many computing and Internet applications an asterisk, or another character, is displayed to indicate that a character of a password or other confidential information has been entered, without the risk of displaying the actual character.|$|R
5000|$|Technically, a reparenting {{window manager}} {{registers}} with the X server {{to be notified}} when a top-level window is mapped (attempts to become visible). When such an event is generated, the window manager creates a frame window, {{and in most cases}} also a title bar window. The frame window then becomes the parent of both the main window and the title bar window. Other forms of decoration, such as buttons, <b>window</b> <b>title,</b> etc., may also be created; these would normally be parented by the title bar window.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to titlebars, windows {{can also have}} toolbars with separate buttons. Up to Leopard, toolbars were visually separated from the titlebar and had the same background as the window frame or were pin-striped. Leopard introduced a unified style that extended the metal-like background of the titlebar to the toolbar, making it appear as one whole. Optionally, a separator could be placed between the titlebar and the toolbar to mimic the previous style. OS X Yosemite brought a compacter version of the toolbar that fused the titlebar and toolbar together, made it shorter and removed the <b>window</b> <b>title</b> (for example, in Safari 8 and later).|$|E

RISC OS {{refers to the}} three buttons (from left to right) as , [...] and [...] [...] functions {{in the same way}} as the “Primary” mouse button in other operating systems. [...] will bring up a context-sensitive menu appropriate for the position of the pointer, and this often provides the only means of activating this menu. This menu in most applications equates to the “Application Menu” found at the top of the screen in Mac OS, and underneath the <b>window</b> <b>title</b> under Microsoft Windows. [...] serves for selecting multiple items in the “Filer” desktop, and for altering parameters of objects within applicationsalthough its exact function usually depends on the programmer.|$|E
50|$|Cogs is {{a puzzle}} video game {{released}} in 2009 by Lazy 8 Studios, originally released as a Microsoft <b>Windows</b> <b>title,</b> but receiving subsequent ports to other operating systems, mobile platforms, and game consoles. The game requires the player to manipulate a three-dimensional object's sides as sliding block puzzles as to complete specific goals, such as meshing gears {{to complete a}} clockwork mechanism or routing gas flow through pipes to a balloon.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{having been}} {{superseded}} by the XPM format, XBM is still {{used by some}} modern but lightweight window managers like Openbox to define simple button images in a <b>window's</b> <b>title</b> bar, such as the iconify/minimize, restore, and maximize buttons. XBM is also used in embedded processing (microControllers) to display Icons used in GUIs.. To convert an image from or to xbm, {{you can use the}} ImageMagick tool or GIMP.|$|R

5000|$|When Brontok {{is first}} run, it copies {{itself to the}} user's {{application}} data directory. It then sets itself to start up with Windows, by creating a registry entry in the [...] registry key. It disables the Windows Registry Editor (regedit.exe) and modifies Windows Explorer settings. It removes the option of [...] "Folder Options" [...] in the Tools menu so that the hidden files, where it is concealed, are not easily accessible to the user. It also turns off Windows firewall. In some variants, when a window is found containing certain strings (such as [...] "application data") in the <b>window</b> <b>title,</b> the computer reboots. User frustration also occurs when an address typed into Windows Explorer is blanked out before completion. Using its own mailing engine, it sends itself to email addresses it finds on the computer, even faking the own user's email address as the sender.|$|E

5000|$|In OS X Yosemite, {{many of the}} Aqua {{elements}} and icons were simplified and flattened, following a similar design change in iOS 7. Apple incorporated the same saturated frosted-glass effect, called [...] "Vibrancy", across the system. Examples include: the Dock, the menubar, sidebars, Notification Center and Mission Control. A similar effect was applied to toolbars, but they maintained their gray appearance. Toolbar buttons became white and Apple introduced a compacter type of toolbar that removed the <b>window</b> <b>title,</b> but retained the toolbar buttons (for example, Safari). Certain controls, such as checkboxes and radio buttons, gained animations, whereas animations in other places were removed, such as the [...] "poof" [...] animation when removing an icon from the Dock and the [...] "cube" [...] animation when fast-switching to another user account. Apple changed the system typeface into Helvetica Neue. Yosemite also added a 'dark theme' you can turn on in the settings which makes the dock and toolbar black ...|$|E
