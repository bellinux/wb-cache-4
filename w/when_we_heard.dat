The crew of the USS Bainbridge, the Arleigh Burke–class guided-missile destroyer that participated in the rescue of Richard Phillips from Maersk Alabama, contacted the South Park creators to commend them on the episode. Ensign Jonathan Sieg, the Bainbridge public relations officer, wrote, [...] "Pretty much everyone onboard our ship—from Captain to seaman—is {{a huge fan of}} South Park, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> about the episode 'Fatbeard', as you can imagine, we were thrilled and very interested to watch." ...|$|E

What happened with the song 'Talk' is that it was all going great and then someone said 'That should be the first single' and we all just freaked out and scrapped it all. [...] We’ve just mixed it and it sounds great. I think we’ve had such pain getting to that place, I’m not sure anyone quite knows {{what to do with it}} anymore. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> it mixed properly, it sounded mega." ...|$|E

I think the Smithsonian tried to do it right. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the concerns, we asked the community to come together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time {{in a situation like this}} to pause, and for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, what are you going to do about it? And, you remember, the United States never signed the UNESCO treaty.” ...|$|E

500|$|After {{recording}} the song at Cosmos Studios and Kinglet Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, the band felt relieved {{to have a}} song that they were happy to release as their debut single. Band member Liam Payne called the song [...] "perfect", and Harry Styles said, [...] "When we were recording in the studio we knew instantly that we wanted this track to be our first single." [...] Styles spoke to MTV News, [...] "I think for us we wanted to release something that wasn't cheesy but it was fun. It kind of represented us, I think {{it took us a}} while to find it but I think we found the right song." [...] Payne added, [...] "We always wanted [...] to be something that people didn't expect and then <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> it, it wasn't what we expected either so it kind of fitted perfectly." ...|$|E

[...] Sieg requested copies of the episode because the streaming online video was difficult to watch on the ship, and the South Park staff in return sent them a care package including several copies of the episode. On the official South Park Studios FAQ, they wrote back, [...] "No, sir, thank you. We were honored to read that, and making an episode about you kicking pirate booty was our pleasure." ...|$|E
500|$|In late October 1960, The Beatles left Koschmider's club {{to work at}} the Top Ten Club, as Eckhorn {{offered the}} group more money, a better PA (with reverb and echo) and a {{slightly}} better place to sleep (above the club itself) although by doing so the group broke their contract with Koschmider. Koschmider then reported Harrison for working under the legal age limit (even though he had been working at Koschmider's club) and Harrison was deported on 21 November 1960. When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to get their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney and Best found a condom in their luggage, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set fire to it. There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. McCartney: [...] "One evening we were just walking down the Reeperbahn, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> this 'ta-ti-ti-ta', and then 'Komm mit mir!' ('Come with me!')".|$|E

500|$|The {{news of the}} landsknechts' defeat reached Cardona's {{troops at}} about the same time that it had reached Enghien; the Imperial column turned and retreated back towards its {{original}} position. Enghien followed closely with the remainder of his cavalry; he was soon reinforced by a company of Italian mounted arquebusiers, which had been stationed at Racconigi and had started towards the battlefield after hearing the initial artillery exchange. These arquebusiers, dismounting to fire and then remounting, were able to harass the Imperial column sufficiently to slow its retreat. Meanwhile, the French and Swiss infantry of the center, having reached Ceresole, had turned about and returned to the battlefield; Montluc, who was with them, writes: <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> at Ceresole that M. d'Enghien wanted us, both the Swiss and we Gascons turned toward him—I never saw two battalions form up so quick—we got into rank again actually as we ran along, side by side. [...] The enemy was going off at quick march, firing salvos of arquebuses, and keeping off our horse, when we saw them. [...] And when they descried us only 400 paces away, and our cavalry making ready to charge, they threw down their pikes and surrendered to the horsemen. You might see fifteen or twenty of them round a man-at-arms, pressing about him and asking for quarter, for fear of us of the infantry, who were wanting to cut all their throats. Perhaps as many as half of the Imperial infantry were killed as they were attempting to surrender; the remainder, about 3,150 men, were taken prisoner. A few, including the Baron of Seisneck, who had commanded the German infantry contingents, managed to escape.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Los Gatos {{released}} {{their first}} single, [...] "La balsa", backed with [...] "Ayer nomás". The song catapulted the burgeoning [...] "rock nacional" [...] scene in Buenos Aires, establishing the commercial viability of rock music sung in Spanish, and turning what originally was an underground scene into a widespread youth culture phenomenon. [...] "La balsa" [...] sold over 250,000 copies, an impressive number for that time, {{especially for a}} song with Spanish lyrics that differed from the cheerful and shallow efforts of the contemporary nueva ola movement. Spinetta stated: [...] "We were with Emilio [...] {{in front of the}} television, a Saturday afternoon, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> [...] "La balsa". Then we said, [...] "but these kids are awesome... let's be hippies from tomorrow!" [...] After a Los Gatos concert, Spinetta met producer Ricardo Kleiman and invited him to the band's rehearsals. When Kleiman heard the band play he signed them to RCA Records, and in November 1968 Almendra released their first single: [...] "Tema de Pototo", backed with [...] "El mundo entre las manos". Almendra began playing live, with performances during the summer of 1969 in Mar del Plata and an appearance at the Ancón Festival in Peru. Their Buenos Aires debut was at the Di Tella Institute as part of Three Beat Shows, where they introduced [...] "Fermín", [...] "Ana no duerme" [...] and [...] "Que el viento borró tus manos", songs which would appear on their first studio album. Almendra released a second single, [...] "Hoy todo el hielo en la ciudad" [...] backed with [...] "Campos verdes"; it was also released in Peru, where it was more successful than it was in Argentina. Between April and September 1969, the band recorded their first LP at TNT Studios, Buenos Aires, while a third single ("Tema de Pototo", backed with [...] "Final") was released. At the time of Almendras release, the influence of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones had overshadowed the success of the nueva ola, exemplified by the popular teen pop music TV show, El Club del Clan.|$|E

2500|$|Buchanan {{explained}} the song's concept and lyrical interpretation during a track by track {{analysis of the}} album on the group's official website, saying: [...] "This song is about reacting to the press when they slag you off, about how they judge you. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the song we loved it. To be honest, any publicity is good publicity whether it's positive or negative, and it's taken us {{a while to get}} that. When the press write something negative and something that's untrue, it's hard to look at that in a positive way. We could really relate to the song." ...|$|E
