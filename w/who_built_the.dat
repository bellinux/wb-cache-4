5|$|After {{the turn}} of the 19th century, {{architecture}} developed into the late Baroque style. Among the major proponents were Johan Conrad Ernst <b>who</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> Chancery Building or Kancellibygningen (1721) on Slotsholmen and Lauritz de Thurah who designed the Eremitage Palace (1734) in Dyrehaven, just north of Copenhagen. Even more ambitious was de Thurah's work at Ledreborg near Roskilde, where he succeeded in working the components into a well-balanced and cohesive Baroque palace.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} there were about forty Jesuit colleges (secondary schools) {{scattered}} throughout the Commonwealth. They were educating mostly szlachta, burgher sons to a lesser degree. Jan Zamoyski, Chancellor of the Crown, <b>who</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> town of Zamość, established an academy there in 1594; it had functioned as a gymnasium only after Zamoyski's death. The first two Vasa kings were well known for patronizing both the arts and sciences. After that the Commonwealth's science experienced general decline, which paralleled the wartime decline of the burgher class.|$|E

5|$|Kingston Russell Stone Circle, {{also known}} as the Gorwell Circle, is a stone circle located between the villages of Abbotsbury and Littlebredy in the {{south-western}} English county of Dorset. Archaeologists believe that it was likely erected during the Bronze Age. The Kingston Russell ring is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, over a period between 3,300 and 900 BCE. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that they were likely religious sites, with the stones perhaps having supernatural associations for those <b>who</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> circles.|$|E

5|$|The castle was {{outdated}} {{but remained}} {{vital to the}} defense of Kamianets and nearby trade routes; as a result, the voivode of Kraków, Spytek of Melsztyn, began modernizing the complex {{at the turn of the}} 15th century.

A century and a half later, the castle was updated again, this time by military engineer and architect , <b>who</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> New Western and Eastern Towers, the castle's eastern wall and an underground gallery, as well as the Full Gates and housing for the town's starosta community.|$|E
5|$|The first {{satellite}} to use SvalSat was Landsat 7, which was launched on 15 April 1999. It was followed up by three other EOS satellites: Terra, Aqua and QuikSCAT. To ensure a sustainable financing of operations, NSC started negotiating with other potential customers. However, {{the project was}} rejected by the Indian Space Research Organisation. Instead, a cooperation was made with Kongsberg Aerospace and Defence and Lockheed Martin, <b>who</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> second antenna as a joint venture. In 2001, a German research group applied for permission to establish a ground station in Ny-Ålesund. NSC feared that the competition could undermine the financial capabilities of SvalSat. However, no facility in Ny-Ålesund was built.|$|E

5|$|Withypool Stone Circle, {{also known}} as Withypool Hill Stone Circle, is a stone circle located near {{to the village of}} Withypool in the {{south-western}} English county of Somerset.

5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony for}} the new city hall was held on July 29, 2004, and construction began {{under the direction of}} contractor Lease Crutcher Lewis, <b>who</b> <b>built</b> <b>the</b> original city hall, the following month. During construction, inaccuracies and omissions in the design and problems with demolishing parts of the building led to delays and an over-run of $19.6 million, bringing the final budget to $121 million. The new city hall opened on February 21, 2006, and received praise for its use of wood panels and the concourse's terrazzo flooring. The city hall's lower two floors, including the concourse, service desks, and the city council chamber, are open to the public; the remaining five floors house offices for city services. The city hall was granted an American Institute of Architects Honor Award by the Seattle chapter, as well as an Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star award for energy efficiency. The landscaped plaza was also recognized by the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects with a National Merit Award in 2008.|$|E
