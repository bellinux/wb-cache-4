During Bobby and Pam's second wedding, Ray mentioned that Jenna was pregnant <b>with</b> <b>Bobby's</b> child. This caused problems between Ray and Bobby, especially after Jenna and Charlie moved in with Ray. In 1987, Jenna gave birth to Bobby's son, Lucas, named after her father. Jenna later married Bobby's half-brother Ray Krebbs. Ray adopted Lucas and raised him <b>with</b> Jenna despite <b>Bobby</b> being the father.

The rivalry continued until One Night Stand, where Lashley challenged Vince to a match {{where there is no}} disqualifications or countouts, dubbed a Street Fight. Lashley won the match and the ECW World Championship, and their rivalry ended.|$|E

5|$|In January 1971, <b>with</b> <b>Bobby</b> Moore, Brian Dear and Clyde Best, Greaves was {{involved}} in late-night drinking, against the wishes of manager Ron Greenwood, prior to an FA Cup tie away to Blackpool. On arriving in Blackpool, Greaves and his teammates had been informed {{by members of the}} press that the game, the following day, was unlikely to go ahead due to a frozen pitch and the likelihood of frost that night. Believing {{that there would be no}} game the following day, Greaves drank 12 lagers in a club owned by Brian London and did not return to the team hotel until 1.45am. In fact, the match went ahead and West Ham lost 4–0. Greaves claimed the defeat was not a result of the late night, the drinking or the frozen pitch, but because the West Ham team in which he was playing was not good enough. As a result, the players were fined and dropped by the club.|$|E
5|$|Mido {{stated in}} March 2004 {{that he may}} leave Marseille {{at the end of}} the 2003–04 season. An English club and several Spanish clubs were {{believed}} to be interested in signing Mido, who had been overshadowed at Marseille by Didier Drogba. Atlético Madrid, Zaragoza, Osasuna and former club Celta Vigo were all rumoured to be interested in signing Mido, with Atlético's interest being confirmed by their Technical Director Toni Muñoz. Meanwhile, Mido was caught speeding on the way to Marseille's game against AS Monaco, which resulted in a court hearing. Reports suggested Roma were ready to sign Mido for a fee of €9million even though Mido would be out injured for the rest of the French football season. Turkish side Beşiktaş revealed they wanted to sign him, and Mido said he was to have talks <b>with</b> <b>Bobby</b> Robson about a possible move to Newcastle United.|$|E
5|$|The Lafayette Afro Rock Band {{was formed}} as the Bobby Boyd Congress in 1970, in homage to their {{original}} vocalist Bobby Boyd. Upon deciding that the funk scene in the United States was too saturated for them to viably compete in, they relocated to France in 1971; <b>with</b> <b>Bobby</b> Boyd splitting from the group to pursue a musical career in America, they renamed themselves 'Soul Congress', then 'Ice'. After regular performances in Paris' Barbès district—an area made up primarily of North African immigrants—they {{caught the eye of}} producer Pierre Jaubert and became the house session band at his Parisound studio. The influence of their surroundings led Ice to increasingly weave African rhyme schemes, textures, and beat tendencies in their original funk style, and as such they changed their name to Lafayette Afro Rock Band following the 1972 release of the poorly produced Each Man Makes His Own Destiny.|$|E

5|$|At the season-opening Daytona 500, Robinson {{qualified}} in 36th place {{making her}} the second woman {{to start the}} race; she finished 24th despite spinning into the track's infield, and avoided a pit road collision <b>with</b> <b>Bobby</b> Labonte. After the event, Sharp left BAM Racing, and car chief Teddy Brown became Robinson's new crew chief. She struggled during her rookie season, {{and was unable to}} attend most races due to sponsorship issues along with her team hiring new drivers which limited her on track experience. Her rival competitors said it was due to Robinson driving an noncompetitive car rather than her driving skill. Robinson made no further appearances for BAM Racing after the second race at Daytona International Speedway, and was later released by the team. She ended the season 52nd in the Drivers' Championship, and was fourth in the Rookie of the Year standings. Outside racing, Robinson spoke for Women in Sports, and attended meetings of several associations and business groups while taking the time to be with her children. She separated from Jeff Clark in early 2002, but both remained on good terms.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Orton {{signed a}} deal with the then World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and was sent to its {{developmental}} territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued his training. During his time in OVW, Orton wrestled the likes of Rico Constantino and The Prototype and teamed <b>with</b> <b>Bobby</b> Eaton during a tag team title tournament. He won the OVW Hardcore Championship twice by defeating Mr. Black on February 14, 2001, and Flash Flanagan on May 5, 2001, respectively. On several occasions he faced Rico Constantino on combined WWF/OVW events, and also lost to The Prototype (John Cena) in a tag match on July 28 in Jacksonville, Indiana. He also began appearing on several WWF house shows that were unaffiliated with OVW, the first being on May 1, 2001 when he faced Billy Gunn. After taking the mic and promising to beat Gunn, Orton was defeated. That fall he began appearing regularly on WWF house shows and dark matches, facing Chuck Palumbo, Steven Richards, and Shawn Stasiak, but mostly wrestling in tag team matches.|$|E
5|$|Over a year {{passed before}} The Beast won another championship. In {{the summer of}} 1973, Sweetan was holding the ESA Tag Team Championship with Kurt von Steiger when The Beast teamed <b>with</b> <b>Bobby</b> Kay, {{the only one of}} his {{brothers}} with whom he had not held a tag team championship, and regained the trophy. Once again, however, Sweetan won the title back on July 31 along with partner Mr. X. During the ESA off-season, The Beast returned to Texas and reformed his tag team partnership with brother Leo Burke. In January 1974, the brothers defeated Don Fargo and Hank James to win the NWA Western States Tag Team Championship. Within two months, however, they lost the title to long-time rival Romero and his partner Dory Funk, Jr. Returning to the ESA, The Beast and Bobby Kay defeated Sweetan and Dubois to win the vacant Tag Team Championship. The reign lasted for less than one week before Sweetan and Dubois won the trophy in a rematch. The following month, The Beast had another short reign with the IWA North American Heavyweight Championship, winning the title and losing it back to Great Kuma in less than two weeks. He followed this with a victory for the Tag Team Championship with Burke on July 13, once again winning the title from Sweetan and Dubois. By early August, the brothers had dropped the title to Kuma and Geto Mongol.|$|E

Approximately 3,600 people were in attendance for the event, which was 900 people less than the maximum capacity of the Compuware Sports Arena. All three of TNA's active championships {{at the time were}} defended at the event. All three championships changed hands at the event, making this event the only time in TNA history that all have changed hands in one night. The main event on the card was Jeff Jarrett defending the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Sting in a Title vs. Career match with Kurt Angle as the Special Outside Enforcer; Sting won the encounter to become the new champion. The TNA X Division Championship was also defended by Senshi against Chris Sabin, which Sabin won to win the title. The last championship match was a Six Sides of Steel cage match for the NWA World Tag Team Championship, in which A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels lost the championship to Homicide and Hernandez of The Latin American Exchange; the ring was surrounded by a steel cage in this match. There were several matches featured on the event's undercard: an 8 Mile Street Fight resulting in a victory for Christian Cage over Rhino; and Samoa Joe defeating Brother Runt, Raven, and Abyss, who was accompanied by James Mitchell, in a Monster's Ball match with Jake Roberts as the Special Guest Referee.|$|E
