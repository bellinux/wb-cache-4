5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen a new website opening on the internet, with the site videos appearing in people's dreams. The videos would have gone worldwide and end up trapping little kids in their own 'dream-world'. These 'dream-worlds' would have created a 'fantasy' beyond the universe for infant children. Sarah Jane, Clyde, Rani and Luke would have been also trapped in dream-world, and would be faced with an 'internet creature' <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> them in their former adventures. This story was cancelled for various reasons, one of them being that the plot being similar to The Nightmare Man.|$|E

25|$|Churels {{are most}} often {{reported}} in and around graveyards, cemeteries, tombs, and abandoned battlefields, thresholds of houses, crossroads, toilets and squalid places. If the Churel was one who died due to ill-treatment by family members, she avenges her early death by going for the males of her family, starting with the youngest. She would drain him of blood until he is shriveled up into an old man and then go for the next male. When all the males in her family are done, she moves on to other people. Any person <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> a Churel can also be attacked by a deadly disease and those who answer to her night calls can end up dead.|$|E
25|$|In prehistoric times, chert {{was often}} used as a raw {{material}} {{for the construction of}} stone tools. Like obsidian, as well as some rhyolites, felsites, quartzites, and other tool stones used in lithic reduction, chert fractures in a Hertzian cone when struck with sufficient force. This results in conchoidal fractures, a characteristic of all minerals with no cleavage planes. In this kind of fracture, a cone of force propagates through the material from the point of impact, eventually removing a full or partial cone; this result is familiar to anyone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> what happens to a plate-glass window when struck by a small object, such as an air gun projectile. The partial Hertzian cones produced during lithic reduction are called flakes, and exhibit features characteristic of this sort of breakage, including striking platforms, bulbs of force, and occasionally eraillures, which are small secondary flakes detached from the flake's bulb of force.|$|E

Nicolae Iorga, a major historian of the 20th century, celebrated Kogălniceanu as [...] "the founder of modern Romanian culture, the thinker <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> in clarity the free and complete Romania , the redeemer of peasants thrown into serfdom , the person understanding all the many, secretive, and indissoluble connections linking the life of a people to the moral quality and the energy of its soul".|$|E

500|$|Another song {{first issued}} on Capitol's Yesterday and Today, [...] "And Your Bird Can Sing" [...] was written {{primarily}} by Lennon, with McCartney {{claiming to have}} helped on the lyric and estimating the song as [...] "80–20" [...] to Lennon. Harrison and McCartney played dual lead-guitar parts on the recording, including an ascending riff that Riley terms [...] "magnetic... everything sticks to it". Riley describes the composition as a [...] "shaded putdown" [...] {{in the style of}} Dylan's [...] "Positively 4th Street", whereby Lennon sings to someone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> [...] "seven wonders" [...] yet is unable to empathise with him and his feelings of isolation. According to Gould, the song was directed at Frank Sinatra after Lennon had read a hagiographic article on the singer, in Esquire magazine, in which Sinatra was lauded as [...] "the fully emancipated male... the man who can have anything he wants".|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 22, 1910. It states: [...] "Maud, the beautiful queen of Rumania, is deposed {{through the efforts of}} her wicked cousin, Rupert, who seizes the throne. He tries to make love to Maud, but when she spurns him he has her thrown into prison. Through the efforts of her faithful lady-in-waiting, and the kindly priest, the young queen escapes. While on a steamer, her cousin's spy locates her and decides to give her poison, but his attempt is detected by Jack Walton, wealthy young American <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> the queen and fallen in love with her without knowing anything as to her history. A number of noblemen urge the queen to make an effort to regain the throne, and when Jack joins his plea to theirs, she consents. But the queen is only in her country a few hours when she is arrested during the absence of Jack on a mission." ...|$|E
500|$|Even {{though the}} woods in each cab were {{arranged}} in four basic patterns, all the elevator cabs used a unique combination of woods. One writer stated that [...] "if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [...] certainly are. Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences {{on the design of}} the entire building." [...] The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also [...] customized to the cab. Hidden behind these plates were ceiling fans. Curcio writes that these elevators [...] "are among the most beautiful small enclosed spaces in New York, and {{it is fair to say}} that no one <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> or been in them has forgotten them". Curcio also compares the elevators to the curtains of a Ziegfeld production, noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in the middle and slopes down on either side. The decoration of the cabs' interiors was also a nod to the Chrysler Corporation's vehicles: cars built during the building's early years had dashboards with wooden moldings. Both the doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary marquetry.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. {{executive}} producer Jeffrey Bell stated {{that in order}} to meet production demands and avoid having to air repeat episodes, ABC would likely air a Marvel special in place of a regular installment {{at some point during the}} first ten episodes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s second season. In October, the special was revealed to be Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!, which was hosted by Emily VanCamp, who portrays Agent 13 in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and aired on November 4, 2014. The special features behind the scenes footage from Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man, as well as footage from the Agent Carter television series previously screened at New York Comic-Con. Brian Lowry of Variety felt an hour for the special did not [...] "do the topic justice" [...] adding, [...] "For anyone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> more than one Marvel movie but would shrug perplexedly at the mention of Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko, Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp To Pop! should probably be required viewing. Fun, fast-paced and encompassing many of the company's highlights along with a few lowlights, it's a solid primer on Marvel's history, while weaving in inevitable self-promotion and synergistic plugs." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN also wished the special had been longer, adding, [...] "Understandably, the more you already know about Marvel, the less you'll be surprised by Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!, but it's important to remember who this special is really made for – a mainstream audience who have embraced the Marvel characters, via the hugely successful movies, in a way no one could have imagined." ...|$|E
