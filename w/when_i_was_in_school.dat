5000|$|Bangla Bhai gave an {{interview}} to national and local journalist. This interview would be {{a significant source of}} information about his life. His father was Nazir Hossain Pramanik of Kannipara village in Gabtoli upazila in Bogra. He claimed to have graduated from Rajshahi University in 1995 with a master's in Bangla. The Daily Star reporter contacted the university to verify his claims. The university claimed there was no student with the Azizur Rahman at the Bangla Department in 1995. When the Daily Star reported pointed out this contradiction Bangla Bhai replied: [...] "I studied Bangla at Azizul Haq University College affiliated with Rajshahi University. Bangla Bhai remained private and guarded about his education and background. His senior officer in the organization Amir Maulana Abdur Rahman who was also present during the interview reported that Bangla Bhai studied at Tarafsartaj Senior Fazil Madrasa. Bangla Bhai said regarding his alias [...] "I was a Bangla teacher at two top coaching centres in Dhaka. As my students did well in Bangla, the authorities of coaching centres called me Bangla Bhai,"he did not name the coaching centres or their exact locations. Bangla Bhai also denied certain reports that he was aligned with Bangladesh Chhatra League. [...] "I supported it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>school.</b> As a college student, I joined Islami Chhatra Shibir (an Islamist student organisation allied with Jamaat-e-Islami). When I finished my study in 1995, I quit Shibir because Jamaat accepted female leadership although it said it considered female leadership sacrilege." [...] He joined JMJB(Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh) and rose to the rank of administrator of military affairs and an acting member of the Majlis-e-Sura, its main decision making board of trustees. Bangla Bhai got to be notorious for the torment and intimidation of the rivals of JMJB and minorities. On August 17, 2005, JMJB, under Islam's administration, dispatched an across the nation assault by blasting 500 bombs. Alongside Shaykh Abdur Rahman, Islam is affirmed to have engineered the bombings. In late 2005, a progression of suicide bomb assaults shook Bangladesh. JMJB and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh have asserted obligation of these assaults.|$|E
5000|$|The 1938 Convention {{adopted the}} six-degree {{membership}} structure {{to honor the}} six Founders, especially {{as a tribute to}} Founder Brooks, who had died only a few weeks earlier. The first professional manager of the Fraternity was hired that same year, marking still another organizational response to growing needs in a critical period. For the hardships of World War I and the Great Depression were scarcely overcome when World War II arrived. The extraordinary efforts by which the Fraternity survived are another and longer story; the important fact is that Phi Sig did survive. The 1948 Convention in Boston marked the 75th anniversary of the founding. There were 52 active chapters; the Phi Sigma Kappa Foundation had been established, primarily to reward good scholarship among brothers; and The Signet was guaranteed to all members for life under a plan that had few parallels in the Greek world at that time. D. R. (Spec) Collins of Iowa, one of the Fraternity's most dynamic leaders of the post-World War II years, reaffirmed the heritage in more modern terms:"The Founders very wisely developed the ritual and philosophy of the fraternity on the basis of service to its members. The Cardinal Principles of Phi Sigma Kappa are the development of brotherhood, scholarship and character [...] [...] [...] There is nothing in our Cardinal Principles about prestige, the most beautiful house, the best social program, being 'number one on campus' in intramurals, activities, etc. These are all frosting on the cake. A fraternity chapter which truly serves its purpose helps its members in their own personal development. Thus I do not believe a chapter, which pledges students who are already top scholars and which wins a scholarship cup year-in and year-out, performs any distinctive service. That chapter which pledges average students, however, and encourages them in developing their own academic capabilities to the utmost, deserves the scholarship cup. The same is true of character. If we pledge only the most polished and mature individuals, there is little left for the chapter to do for these people. The fraternity can and should take average college students and help them develop their own character, and help them learn to live together in brotherhood.""My fraternity did something for me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>school.</b> It helped me to learn to live with others and to develop my own personal, moral, and social attributes, so that I could fit better into the society which I found when I left the University.

30|$|It can {{be noticed}} that the values of m(i) are {{influenced}} by the position of i in the topology. In particular, nodes that are close to the periphery will have larger values compared to nodes that <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the center of the topology. This can be explained noting that <b>when</b> <b>i</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the periphery of the network, its average distance from the other nodes <b>is</b> larger than <b>when</b> <b>i</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the center, so m(i) is higher on the periphery. It is also easy to see that in this simple topology, if we compute t(i) excluding the packets that <b>are</b> generated by <b>i</b> itself, t(i) <b>is</b> constant. This would make the ratio t(i)/m(i) decrease for nodes close to the extreme ends of the network. In the figure, instead, we plot t(i) including also the packets generated by node i, which increases the values of t(i) on the periphery. This takes into account that in our scenario, each node is a gateway for its own subnet, so the first hop <b>is</b> counted <b>in</b> its own subnet. Even in this case, t(i)/m(i) is still larger for nodes that <b>are</b> central <b>in</b> the topology.|$|R
