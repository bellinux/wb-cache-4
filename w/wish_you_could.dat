500|$|The smoking lamp was re-lit on 18 April, {{with the}} three days of {{prohibition}} having taken a noticeable toll on crew morale. Rather than passing the word in a traditional manner, Captain Beach demonstrated {{the lifting of the}} ban by walking though the ship smoking a cigar, blowing smoke in people's faces, and asking, [...] "Don't you <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do this?" [...] He recorded in his log that [...] "it took some 37seconds for the word to get around." [...] On 20 April 1960, the Triton crossed the Prime Meridian, and on 24 April, the sealed atmosphere experiment was terminated.|$|E
500|$|The Times {{gave the}} game four stars {{out of five}} {{and said it was}} [...] "more for 24 fans, who will {{instantly}} love it — so long as they don’t mind another TV addiction to feed." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five, stating, [...] "Newcomers to the trials and tribulations of Jack Bauer are unlikely to be impressed by this game's generic shooting and driving action. But fans of 24 will be quaking, thanks to the authentic atmosphere and gripping story, set between season two and three of the TV series." [...] However, The A.V. Club gave it a C and stated that [...] "For once, you'll <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> skip the action to get to the cutscenes." [...] Detroit Free Press gave it a similar score of two stars out of four and said: [...] "The controls are just too unpolished to make it worthwhile, though. Movements are flaky, and aiming is far too loose. Sometimes, I got into a tight firefight where I couldn't hit a terrorist a few feet in front of me. And the driving missions are worse." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pink Matter" [...] is a bluesy lament with {{themes of}} sex and betrayal, as its narrator struggles between {{pleasure}} and universal meaning. Its lyrics allude to philosophical conundrums, extraterrestrial life, Japanese manga comics, and cotton candy. The playful [...] "Forrest Gump" [...] likens the titular film character to an adolescent crush, with homoerotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, and allusions to scenes in the film. It has a bright, Motown-inspired chorus, a simple rhythmic cadence, gently strummed guitar, wistful vocals, and a perkily whistled coda. The skit [...] "End" [...] depicts an exchange between Ocean and a woman as they make love {{in the backseat of}} a car with his 2012 song [...] "Voodoo" [...] playing over the stereo. She says to him, [...] "You're special. I <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see what I see", repurposing a line from the 2006 film ATL, and Ocean leaves the car in response, walks home through the rain, and sets his keys down with a sigh. The lighthearted, lovelorn [...] "Golden Girl" [...] has up-tempo synths, gradual fades, and Tyler, The Creator rapping in a low-pitched, demonic voice. It is about a girl that provides salvation and peace of mind for the narrator, who likens her to an island.|$|E

500|$|Deja Entendus first single, [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows", {{impacted}} radio airplay in July 2003, a {{month after}} the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or, as Lacey stated, [...] "how there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't overlooked in the first place, you can kind of get through it." [...] The song's music video chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it [...] "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that you kind of look back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and all the things you <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> change". They also made a music video for the second single, [...] "Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades," [...] where Lacey acts like a human voodoo doll; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. [...] "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," [...] he said, [...] "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." [...] Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where Your Favorite Weapon went [...] "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding [...] "constant" [...] airplay on MTV and the band making its live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Furthermore, both singles entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows" [...] peaked at number 37 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.|$|E
500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that." ...|$|E

In 1966, the Seekers released the Simon-penned [...] "Someday One Day", which reached [...] "No.4" [...] in Australia and [...] "No.11" [...] in the U.K. Their version was Simon's first U.K. success as a songwriter, and his first solo major hit as a composer outside of his work with Art Garfunkel.

2500|$|While in the UK, Simon co-wrote several {{songs with}} Bruce Woodley of the Australian pop group the Seekers, {{including}} [...] "I <b>Wish</b> <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> Be Here," [...] "Cloudy," [...] and [...] "Red Rubber Ball." [...] Woodley's co-author credit was omitted from [...] "Cloudy" [...] on the Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme album. The American group the Cyrkle recorded {{a cover of}} [...] "Red Rubber Ball" [...] that reached No. 2 in the U.S. Simon {{also contributed to the}} Seekers catalogue with [...] "Someday One Day," [...] which was released in March 1966, charting around the same time as Simon and Garfunkel's [...] "Homeward Bound." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some reviewers {{cited the}} film as groundbreaking. Pauline Kael called the film [...] "one of the most gruesomely terrifying movies ever made – and {{when you leave the}} theatre you may <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> forget the whole horrible experience.... The film's grainy, banal {{seriousness}} works for it – gives it a crude realism". A Film Daily critic commented, [...] "This is a pearl of a horror picture that exhibits all the earmarks of a sleeper." [...] While Roger Ebert criticized the matinée screening, he admitted that he [...] "admires the movie itself". Critic Rex Reed wrote, [...] "If you want to see what turns a B movie into a classic [...] don't miss Night of the Living Dead. It is unthinkable for anyone seriously interested in horror movies not to see it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{show was}} pitched in early 1996 to ABC {{president}} Ted Harbert, {{and although it}} would not be ready to hit the air for the 1996-1997 season, it remained in development. [...] Tim Curry was aboard and wanted {{the relationship between the two}} leads to be loosely based on his relationship with friend and next door neighbor Annie Potts, to whom he said, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do this with me!" [...] Potts was starring in the TV spin-off of the popular film Dangerous Minds at the time, so it did not seem as though a reunion was imminent (the two had previously co-starred together as husband and wife in the film Pass the Ammo). [...] Three days before they were ready to shoot the pilot for Over the Top, Dangerous Minds was canceled, and although Potts was heartbroken over the cancellation of that series, she jumped at the chance to work with Curry again.|$|E
2500|$|Anime website GoBoiano listed [...] "Sharp Shooter Sinon" [...] {{as one of}} the {{positive}} aspects of Sword Art Online II, noting her intelligence and strength, as well as Kirito not knowing her outside of gaming allowing the two to bond in a way different to the other girls in the franchise. She also made a list of their [...] "14 Anime Marksmen That You Can't Hide From", where she ranked 14th, as well as the [...] "15 Anime Characters You <b>Wish</b> <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> Waifu", with author Aaron Magulick adding [...] "Sinon is calm and cool, but she'll snipe you right in the heart. Once you get past her cold exterior, you'll find a loving person that'll protect you from afar. Which works when you're stuck in a gun-based mmo." [...] A Newtype character poll had Sinon placed first in female characters, notably edging out fellow Sword Art Online character Asuna. In a fan contest where respondents chose between 41 options for the next Sword Art Online figurine, Sinon placed fourth (Gun Gale Online version) and ninth (ALfheim Online version).|$|E
2500|$|On July 29, 2007, Ichiro {{collected}} his 1,500th U.S. hit, {{the third}} fastest {{to reach the}} MLB milestone behind Al Simmons and George Sisler. Ichiro had 213 hits in 2008, his eighth straight 200-hit season. This tied the 107-year-old record set by Wee Willie Keeler. Typically, Ichiro was among baseball's leaders in reaching base on an error (14 times in 2008, {{more than any other}} batter in the AL), and in infield hits (his 56 were the most in the majors). Ichiro has amassed more than 450 infield hits in his U.S. career. Detroit third baseman Brandon Inge told the New York Times, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> put a camera at third base to see how he hits the ball and see the way it deceives you. You can call some guys’ infield hits cheap, but not his. He has amazing technique." [...] In May 2008, Ichiro stole two bases, giving him a career total of 292, surpassing the previous Seattle Mariners team record of 290 set by second baseman Julio Cruz. Cruz, who now does Spanish-language broadcasts of Mariners games, was watching from the broadcast booth as Ichiro broke his record.|$|E
