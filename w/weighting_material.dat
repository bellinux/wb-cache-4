40|$|Mechanical {{testing of}} the elastic and {{viscoelastic}} response of an advanced thermoplastic polyimide (LaRC-SI) with known variations in molecular weight was performed over a range of temperatures below the glass transition temperature. The notched tensile strength was {{shown to be a}} strong function of both molecular weight and temperature, whereas stiffness was only a strong function of temperature. A critical molecular weight was observed to occur at a weight average molecular weight of M, approx. 22, 000 g/mol below which, the notched tensile strength decreases rapidly. This critical molecular weight transition is temperature-independent. Low, molecular <b>weight</b> <b>materials</b> tended to fail in a brittle manner, whereas high molecular <b>weight</b> <b>materials</b> exhibited ductile failure. Furthermore, low molecular <b>weight</b> <b>materials</b> have increased creep compliance and creep compliance rate, and are more sensitive to temperature than the high molecular <b>weight</b> <b>materials.</b> At long timescales (less than 1100 hours) physical aging serves to significantly decrease the creep compliance and creep rate of all the materials tested.

Pulling power of locomotives can be increased by use of traction tires, or adding weight, but, due to the limited internal space available, it is vital that the <b>weighting</b> <b>material</b> have as high a density as possible; tungsten powder (used in metal golf club driver heads) and lead are popular choices.|$|E
50|$|In 1931, Max B. Miller {{devised a}} {{drilling}} mud using a white clay as a <b>weighting</b> <b>material.</b> To market the new mud, he formed The Milwhite Company in Texas. In the mid-1930s, the company mined barites {{in conjunction with}} the Magnet Cove Barium Corporation (later called Magcobar). After a hiatus during World War II, the company resumed grinding operations using barite from a mine in Missouri and conducted mud sales through independent distributors. After 1956 Milwhite Mud Sales Company built its own sales network. In 1963 the company acquired the Aquaness chemical company, and in 1964 the combination became Milchem Incorporated. In 1971, Baker Oil Tools acquired Milchem. In 1985, Baker International acquired the drilling fluids division of Newpark Resources and merged it with Milchem's mud division to form Milpark. Meanwhile, in 1942, Oil Base Drilling Company was founded by George Miller, and made its first application of oil base mud. The company was acquired by Hughes Tool Company in 1979, and renamed Hughes Drilling Fluids in 1982. In 1987, when Baker Hughes was formed, Hughes Drilling Fluids was merged into Milpark, and in 1993, Milpark became a product line within Baker Hughes INTEQ. Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids was established as a stand-alone division in 2004.|$|E

Currently, in the petroleum industry, barite (commercial name for barium sulphate) is the standard <b>weighting</b> <b>material</b> used to elevate mud weight to a predetermined value. The supply of quality barite may fall short {{in the foreseeable future}} due to the increase in drilling activities and depleting reserves of quality barite.

The experimental results revealed that for a given mud density, mud sample with higher percentage of hematite produced higher yield point and gel strength. Nevertheless, it produced little differences in plastic viscosity. The significant advantage realized in utilizing hematite was it gave a lower solid content. The experimental study also revealed that hematite was found to be more abrasive than barite. The abrasiveness rate was found increase proportionally with the well angles (from horizontal). Based on this preliminary study, it is concluded that Malaysia hematite has the potential to be used as <b>weighting</b> <b>material</b> in drilling mud. ...|$|E

40|$|Drilling mud {{plays an}} {{important}} role when drilling an oilwell, where it produces sufficient hydrostatic pressure that could prevent the influx of formation fluids into the wellbore. Barium sulphate, which is more commonly known as barite in the petroleum industry, is the principle <b>weighting</b> <b>material</b> used to increase mud weight. With the expected increase drilling activities and dwindling reserves, quality barite supply may fall short in the foreseeable future. Ilmenite, an iron-based mineral, is being investigated by the Drilling Fluid Research team of UTM of itâ€™s potential to be used as an alternative <b>weighting</b> <b>material.</b> The study involved of laboratory experiments and amongst the parameters studied were mud mud weight/ density, rheological properties of drilling mud with all weighting materials, and the abrasiveness effect.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the prospect of}} utilising Malaysia ilmenite as <b>weighting</b> <b>material</b> in drilling mud. The discussion was based on laboratory experiments. The performance of local ilmenite was compared to barite in a lignosulphonate mud system. The results showed that for a given mud density, ilmenite gave a lower solid content. Compared with barite, ilmenite gave a much higher yield point and gel strength, but there were little differences in apparent viscosity and plastic viscosity. Ilmenite was also found to give a higher API fluid loss than barite. In contrast, the fluid loss produced by ilmenite sample via the HPHT filter press {{was found to be}} much lower compared to the barite sample. The higher yield point and gel strength of the mud which utilised local ilmenite as <b>weighting</b> <b>material</b> could be lowered by increasing the concentration of lignosulphonate in the mud. There was no indication of incompatibility of lignosulphonate in the mud system.

40|$|Usage {{of light}} <b>weight</b> <b>materials</b> has gained {{momentum}} in the marine market {{in the last few}} decades. This rise has lead to some ships using parts fabricated out of materials like glass and carbon fibre. A major advantage of the usage of light <b>weight</b> <b>materials</b> in shipping is that it either increases the cargo carrying capacity of the vessel or reduces the fuel consumption or both. Different kinds of problems and issues need to be addressed when using new and innovative materials. These problems range from issues of both technical and non-technical nature. Technical problems are generally related to structural strength, fire safety and joining materials of different kinds. Non-technical issues would include maintenance and most importantly getting a good idea about the economics and pay back time of using light <b>weight</b> <b>materials.</b> This thesis discusses the possibility of using light <b>weight</b> <b>materials</b> like glass and carbon fibre as a super structure on board the 88 m long Stena Carisma catamaran. Sandwich construction is the recommended method of employing light weight construction. Different concepts have been generated using the spacing of pillars and the materials used. Analytical structural analysis for each concept is performed. The concept that has the lightest weight is further evaluated using the finite element (FE) method. Thus both analytical calculations and FE analyses have been used to confirm the feasibility of having a sandwich superstructure for the vessel. Both static and dynamic analysis are conducted {{for the study of the}} superstructure. Classification society regulations are used as the base to do the structural calculations. Considering the various criteria of the society, a structural optimisation is also performed. Based on the results obtained from the analysis performed, it is shown that a conventional aluminium superstructure for such a vessel can be replaced by innovative light <b>weight</b> <b>materials.</b> This replacement would be accompanied by a reduction in the weight of the vessel as well as by reduced maintenance requirement. Thus there is a two fold benefit from application of light <b>weight</b> <b>materials.</b> This work includes the structural analysis of the superstructure made of composite materials and also about the interaction of the two materials namely aluminium and the composites. FE analysis has been done to understand the structural behaviour of the structure. This analysis is carried out in ANSYS...|$|R

40|$|Ilmenite (FeTiO_(3)), {{with a mean}} {{particle}} size of 30 - 45 ?m, was first introduced into the oil industry as <b>weighting</b> <b>material</b> in 1976. However, its use was limited mainly because of its abrasiveness to drilling equipment. Recently, a superfine ilmenite (5 ?m) was introduced to address shortcomings of the traditional weighting materials. The objective {{of this study is}} to discuss the performance of oil-based drilling fluids using ilmenite as a <b>weighting</b> <b>material</b> for HPHT applications. Oil-based drilling fluids with a density of 1. 92 SG containing API standard barite and ilmenite were compared. HPHT filtration tests under static and dynamic conditions were conducted at 300 ?F and 300 psi. Indiana limestone cores with an average porosity of 23 vol% and an average permeability of 100 md were used in the filtration tests. The rheological properties, sag tendency, the volume of filtrate, and the filter cake thickness of the oil-based drilling fluids were determined before and after heating at 400 ?F for 16 hours. Results showed that ilmenite-based drilling fluids had a sag factor of < 0. 3 and a plastic viscosity of 25 - 30 cp, which was much lower than those of barite. HTHP filtration tests showed that under static conditions, the filter cake had a thickness of 0. 18 in. and 2. 9 cm 3 of filtrate volume; while under dynamic conditions, the filter cake thickness was 0. 15 in. and the filtrate volume was 2. 2 cm 3. The rheological properties of oil-based drilling fluids were constant after heating at 400 ?F for 16 hours. The filter cake thickness and sag factor were small even after 16 hours of heating.
