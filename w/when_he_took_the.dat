5|$|CharlesII, {{unmarried}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> throne, persuaded his Treasury {{to pay for}} a christening font and basin. His {{marriage to}} Catherine of Braganza produced no heir, but the font may have been used to baptise some of his 13 illegitimate children. It was last used in 1796, while the basin found a new role as an altar dish in the 19thcentury and is on display with the altar plate at the Tower of London.|$|E
5|$|From the Second Age on, Quenya {{was also}} used ceremonially by the Men of Númenór and their {{descendants}} in Gondor and Arnor for the official names of kings and queens; this practice was resumed by Aragorn <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> crown as Elessar Telcontar. Quenya in the Third Age had almost the same status as the Latin language had in medieval Europe, and was called Elven-latin by Tolkien.|$|E
5|$|After Arghun's death, he was {{followed}} {{in rapid succession}} by two brief and fairly ineffective leaders, one of whom only held power for a few months. Stability was restored when Arghun's son Ghazan took power in 1295, though to secure cooperation from other influential Mongols, he made a public conversion to Islam <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> throne, marking a major {{turning point in the}} state religion of the Ilkhanate. Despite being an official Muslim, however, Ghazan remained tolerant of multiple religions, and worked to maintain good relations with his Christian vassal states such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia.|$|E

5|$|The {{park was}} {{established}} by Henry VIII in 1536 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> land from Westminster Abbey and {{used it as a}} hunting ground. It opened to the public in 1637 and quickly became popular, particularly for May Day parades. Major improvements occurred in the early 18th century under the direction of Queen Caroline. Several duels took place in Hyde Park during this time, often involving members of the nobility. The Great Exhibition of 1851 was held in the park, for which the Crystal Palace, designed by Joseph Paxton, was erected.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from boxing, a decision forced on {{him by his}} ailing knee, Dyer focused on his theatre appearances. His voice though, was not as it once was, and he strained to reach the higher notes of his range and bookings began to dry up. Dyer then refocussed on boxing, but this time as a manager. In the 1920s he moved to London, where he set himself up as a physical culture expert and ran a small stable of fighters. The three fighters training under him were Bristolians George Rose and Reggie Hobbs and most notably Bert Kirby from Birmingham. Kirby {{went on to become}} the British flyweight champion <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> title from Jackie Brown in 1930. Dyer also ran a gym for gentleman on the Strand, which was used by fighters such as Bantamweight champion Teddy Baldock and American Packey McFarland who Dyer faced when the two men were boxing instructors in the US Army. The gym was later demolished to make way for a new hotel and Dyer was forced to find a new location.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nothing is}} known of any other claimants to the throne, {{it is likely that}} there were other {{surviving}} descendants of Cerdic (the supposed progenitor of all the kings of Wessex) who might have contended for the kingdom. Ecgberht died in 839, and his will, according to the account of it found in the will of his grandson, Alfred the Great, left land only to male members of his family, so that the estates should not be lost to the royal house through marriage. Ecgberht's wealth, acquired through conquest, was no doubt one reason for his ability to purchase the support of the southeastern church establishment; the thriftiness of his will indicates he understood the importance of personal wealth to a king. The kingship of Wessex had been frequently contested among different branches of the royal line, and it is a noteworthy achievement of Ecgberht's {{that he was able to}} ensure Æthelwulf's untroubled succession. In addition, Æthelwulf's experience of kingship, in the subkingdom formed from Ecgberht's southeastern conquests, would have been valuable to him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> throne.|$|E

5|$|Since the Restoration, {{there have}} been many {{additions}} and alterations to the regalia. A new set of regalia was commissioned in 1685 for Mary of Modena, the first queen consort to be crowned since the Restoration, CharlesII having been unmarried <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> throne. Another, more elaborate set had to be made four years later when MaryII was crowned as joint sovereign with her husband WilliamIII. After the Acts of Union 1707 joined England and Scotland together, the Scottish Crown Jewels were locked away in a chest, and the English Crown Jewels continued to be used by British monarchs. Starting with Queen Anne, gemstones were hired for coronations and replaced with paste and crystals for display in the Jewel House, a practice which continued until the early 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The only bowler to {{have taken}} three career hat-tricks is Lasith Malinga of Sri Lanka, while three other bowlers (Wasim Akram, Saqlain Mushtaq and Chaminda Vaas) have taken two hat-tricks. Hat-tricks are {{dominated}} by fast bowlers with Pakistan's Saqlain Mushtaq, Bangladesh's Abdur Razzak and Taijul Islam, Zimbabwe's Prosper Utseya, South Africa's JP Duminy, Sri Lanka's Wanidu Hasaranga and India's Kuldeep Yadav, the only seven spinners {{to have taken}} an ODI hat-trick. Vaas of Sri Lanka became the only bowler to claim a hat-trick {{in the first three}} balls of any form of international cricket <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> first three wickets off the opening three balls of their match against Bangladesh during the 2003 World Cup. Lasith Malinga is also the only player to claim 4 consecutive wickets in 4 balls, a feat he achieved against South Africa. Three players have taken a hat-trick on their ODI debut: Taijul Islam from Bangladesh in a match against Zimbabwe, Kagiso Rabada from South Africa against Bangladesh, and Wanidu Hasaranga from Sri Lanka against Zimbabwe. Eight hat-tricks have occurred in World Cup matches.|$|E
5|$|In late 1945 {{and early}} 1946 Gielgud toured for ENSA in the Middle and Far East with Hamlet and Coward's Blithe Spirit. During this tour he played Hamlet on {{stage for the}} last time. He was Raskolnikoff in a stage version of Crime and Punishment, in the West End in 1946 and on Broadway the {{following}} year. Agate thought it the best thing Gielgud had done so far, other than Hamlet. Between these two engagements Gielgud toured North America in The Importance of Being Earnest and Love for Love. Edith Evans was tired {{of the role of}} Lady Bracknell, and refused to join him; Margaret Rutherford played the part to great acclaim. Gielgud was in demand as a director, with six productions in 1948–49. They included The Heiress in 1949, when he was brought in at the last moment to direct Richardson and Ashcroft, saving what seemed a doomed production; it ran for 644 performances. His last big hit of the 1940s was as Thomas Mendip in The Lady's Not for Burning, which he also directed. The London cast included the young Claire Bloom and Richard Burton, who went with Gielgud <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> piece to the US the following year.|$|E

5|$|To dispel {{concerns}} {{about his age}} (74), failing eyesight, and heart problems, Barkley arrived in Chicago for the 1952 Democratic National Convention and briskly walked seven blocks from the bus station to his campaign headquarters. The attempt was rendered moot on July 20 {{when a group of}} labor leaders, including United Automobile Workers President Walter Reuther, issued a statement calling Barkley too old and requesting that Democrats nominate someone younger like Stevenson. At a meeting with labor leaders the next morning, Barkley failed to persuade them to retract the statement, which caused delegations from large industrial states like Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania to waver on their commitments to Barkley. On July 21, he announced his withdrawal from the race. Invited to make a farewell address on July 22, he received a 35-minute ovation <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> podium and 45-minute one at the speech's end. In a show of respect, a Missouri delegate nominated Barkley for president and House Majority Leader McCormack seconded it, but Stevenson was easily nominated. A month after the convention, Barkley hosted a Stevenson picnic and campaign rally at his home in Paducah and later introduced him at a rally in Louisville. Despite Barkley's predictions of a Democratic victory, Stevenson lost in overwhelming fashion to Republican Dwight Eisenhower.|$|E
