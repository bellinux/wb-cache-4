5|$|According to an {{official}} government press agency dispatch, {{about half of}} the candidates (approx. 360) were PZPR members. A majority of the remainder belonged to PZPR allies (Democratic Party (SD), United People's Party (ZSL)). There was no opposition party in Poland since all political groupings had to support the program of the PZPR. As a result, no real opposition candidates <b>were</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> run in the elections, but in theory the Polish voters could have stripped the communists from their claimed legitimacy by abstaining from voting. Another means of preventing the PZPR from obtaining a political victory would have occurred if all of the PZPR candidates were struck out, leaving only 100 to be elected.|$|E

5|$|By 1945, Roane-Anderson was {{divesting}} {{itself of}} many of its tasks. American Industrial Transit took over the transport system, and Southern Bell the telephone system. Tri-State Homes began managing housing. In 1946, tenants <b>were</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> paint their houses in different colors from the wartime olive drab. Comprehensive medical insurance, originally instituted for security reasons, was replaced with policies from the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company. Health care had been provided by the Army. As Army doctors were separated from the service they were replaced with civilian doctors employed by Roane-Anderson. The dental service was transferred to civilians in February 1946, and private medical practices were permitted at Oak Ridge from 1 March 1946 on.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{security}} regulations {{put in place}} by the Olympic organizers, no spectators <b>were</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> stand roadside along the course. This decision proved to be controversial: several prominent figures in cycling, including UCI president Pat McQuaid and riders Stuart O'Grady and Cadel Evans (both Australia), spoke out against it. McQuaid and O'Grady both felt that the absence of people along the course deprived the race of the atmosphere present at other cycling events, and said that it failed to take supporters' wishes into consideration. Cycling Australia's reaction to the cyclists' complaints was to request that security restrictions be eased for the time trial to follow, but they were not.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{application}} by the British colony of Southern Rhodesia to the International Olympic Committee, {{the country was}} allowed to compete as an independent nation for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

Southern Rhodesia, as it was known at the time, competed under the name of Rhodesia. Two athletes from Southern Rhodesia were selected to compete in the 1928 games, both in boxing; Cecil Bissett in the lightweight and Leonard Hall in the welterweight weight division.

The Spirit Fruit Society, unlike most other communitarian groups of that time, did not seek to convert or recruit others to the group.
