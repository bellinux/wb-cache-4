50|$|The <b>Westamaran</b> had {{asymmetrical}} hulls, {{where the}} insides was essentially flat, forming a tunnel between the hulls that were rectangular in shape. The profiles {{were in fact}} quite like a Storm class torpedo boat cut in two, {{and the construction of}} the <b>Westamaran</b> built heavily on the experience gained from the Storm class.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Westamaran</b> is {{a pioneer}} type of {{passenger}} transport high speed catamarans developed by Westermoen Hydrofoil in 1973. The craft was highly successful, and {{introduced a new}} era of passenger transport along the Norwegian coast and elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} <b>Westamaran</b> catamarans {{were not as}} quick as the competing hydrofoils, but their capacity was larger, maintenance easier, and they were more comfortable. The second generation catamarans, with symmetrical hulls, matched the hydrofoils in speed, reaching 35-40 knots.|$|E
50|$|The company Kystekspressen runs <b>westamaran</b> {{services}} from Trondheim and Kristiansund. The 5610 m long undersea tunnel called the Hitratunnelen connects Hitra {{to the mainland}} {{to the south and}} the 5305 m long Frøya Tunnel connects Hitra to Frøya to the north.|$|E
50|$|After this, {{development}} of a new class of high speed vessel, the catamaran, began. The <b>Westamaran</b> type, constructed by commander Harald Henriksen and introduced in 1973, was very successful, and a new era of high speed craft in Norway and elsewhere was begun.|$|E
50|$|In {{the period}} 1965 to 1970, Westermoen Hydrofoil built 6 Storm class patrol boats. The Storm class we {{used as the}} basis for the <b>Westamaran</b> catamaran, which was {{essentially}} a Storm-class hull divided in the middle and separated to form a much wider catamaran, suited for passenger transport.|$|E
50|$|The 1970s saw the {{introduction}} of catamarans as a high-speed ferrys, as pioneered by Westermoen Hydrofoil in Mandal, Norway, which launched the <b>Westamaran</b> design in 1973. The Stena Voyager {{was an example of}} a large, fast ferry, typically traveling at a speed of 46 mph, although it was capable of doing over 70 mph.|$|E
5000|$|On the Bergen to Stavanger route, {{there was}} already a high speed service by hydrofoil, {{introduced}} early in the 1960s. The initial <b>Westamaran</b> models were somewhat slower than the hydrofoils, but passenger comfort, {{both in terms of}} spaciousness but especially foul weather handling, was better in the Westamanarans, so they were better liked by the public.|$|E
