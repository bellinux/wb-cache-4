2500|$|In the past, [...] "girl games" [...] have {{frequently}} {{been created by}} adapting girl-oriented material in other media like The Baby-sitters Club, Barbie, and Nancy Drew while leaving male-targeted genres such as sport and driving sims, role playing games, and first person shooters to the boys.

Creating games designed with regard to sociological, psychological, and cognitive research into girls' cultural interests, such companies hope to awaken a female-only market emphasizing fundamental differences between what girls want and what boys want in gaming. The movement to expand the existing market to include females through the development of gender-neutral games has also had a number of advocates.

Zichermann believes the intense mental engagement of video games is tied to the dopamine released in game participants as the players receive rewards in game.

He also posits that gamification could be taken to online banking, charitable organizations, or any other industry. A system of rewards could encourage members of a gym to attend regularly.|$|E
