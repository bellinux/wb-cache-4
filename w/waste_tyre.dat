40|$|Abstract—Waste tyres have {{accumulated}} at landfills in South Africa, some are illegally dumped in open spaces or sold. This work discusses the <b>waste</b> <b>tyre</b> problem in South Africa {{as well as}} the environmental and economic benefits of <b>waste</b> <b>tyre</b> utilization for green fuels. The perceptions of government, industry and community on <b>waste</b> <b>tyre</b> management were investigated. To achieve the objectives a triangulation procedure was followed. This included personnel interviews, questionnaires and literature analysis. The research has shown that lack of knowledge particularly in the informal sector contributed to the <b>waste</b> <b>tyre</b> management problem. The lack of clear and focused legislation guiding the disposal and recycling of waste tyres remains a challenge. Pyrolysis was found to have the potential to address the <b>waste</b> <b>tyre</b> problem with the potential to reduce environmental impact and also contribute towards a green economy.

The attempts of reusing <b>waste</b> <b>tyres</b> {{in many different ways}} is a common challenge in various branches of the modern research and technology in Europe. However, based on a recent study realised by the European Tyre Recycling Association (ETRA), a relevant fraction (nearly 23 %) is still landfilled. During the last two decades, several solutions have been investigated with the aim to recycle and reuse <b>waste</b> <b>tyres.</b> One of them consists of partially replacing “natural” constituents of concrete (i. e. aggregates and fibers) with recycled ones (e. g., rubber particles in rubberised concretes and recycled steel reinforcements), in view of the twofold objectives of reducing both the demand of raw materials and the amount of waste to be disposed in landfills. Within this contest a research study is proposed herein to investigate the mechanical behaviour of concrete reinforced with recycled steel fibers recovered from <b>waste</b> <b>tyres.</b> Particularly, the results of an experimental activity carried out on Fiber-Reinforced Concrete (FRC) obtained by mixing industrial and recycled steel fibers are briefly presented. Five mixes have been considered including plain concrete as a reference and FRC with 0 : 5 % of fiber volume fractions. The structural behaviour of FRC beams in bending has been evaluated in terms of traction-separation law and the possible synergy/substitutability of both fiber types has been investigated. A non-linear cracked hinge model is also presented through an appropriate fracture-based formulation, with the aim of simulating the crack-bridging mechanisms of steel fibers. Then, comparisons between experimental results and numerical predictions are discussed.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Waste</b> <b>tyres</b> {{which are}} mainly {{generated}} from automotive industries {{have become a}} major environmental problem to the local authorities, the tyre industries and tyre dealer. When tyres are no longer usable due to worn-out, defect or service failure they are usually dumped in the landfill sites. Pyrolysis {{is a process of}} the thermal decomposition of <b>waste</b> <b>tyres</b> in the absence of air and the oxygen. Pyrolysis may be an environmentally friendly process to transforms used tyres into gas, oil, steel and carbon black waste. The rate of recovery is 45 wt % for fuel, 30 wt % for carbon black and 10 wt % for steel wires for each end-of-life tyres. In this paper, the potential use of pyrolised carbon black generated from pyrolysis process of <b>waste</b> <b>tyres</b> is investigated. From the physical analysis of this carbon black waste, it was observed that there is various refraction particles sizes from the sieve test and different morphologies gathered from SEM analysis. Moreover, X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and TGA/DTG analysis on the carbon black waste showed high content of inorganic additives such as Silica (Si), Calcium (Ca) and Iron (Fe) which contaminate the sample. The carbon black waste started to decompose at a lower temperature of 480 oC to 680 oC compared to standard black at 500 oC to 740 oC. The test results gathered in this paper will act as a base-line towards alternative material or to replace the commercial carbon black available in the market...|$|R
40|$|Waste tyres are {{currently}} being stockpiled in large quantities around the world causing adverse environmental impact. Significant research is currently underway to investigate possible options for the reuse of <b>waste</b> <b>tyre,</b> particularly in civil engineering applications. One such option is to utilise <b>waste</b> <b>tyre</b> (in the form of tyre shreds) and sand mixture as a lightweight fill material in infrastructure constructions. Utilising <b>waste</b> <b>tyre</b> in civil engineering projects has multiple benefits, including effective recycling of the <b>waste</b> <b>tyre</b> easing the strain on natural fills, reducing material costs and enhancing the geotechnical properties of the soil.

The {{results of the investigation}} of mass loss kinetic and heat flows of <b>waste</b> <b>tyre</b> pyrolysis were applied to aid the design of <b>waste</b> <b>tyre</b> pyrolysis process. Two types of waste tyres were provided for this study by a commercial company. The first part of this study investigated the mass loss kinetic and heat flows of <b>waste</b> <b>tyre</b> pyrolysis at uniform heating rates. Results of thermogravimetric analysis at heating rates 2, 5, 10 and 20 ℃/min were modeled for the understanding of mass loss kinetic.

The goal {{of this paper is to}} study the effect of particle size in <b>waste</b> <b>tyre</b> pyrolysis under different heating approaches and to use optimization techniques to determine the optimized particle size for each scenario. In this paper, the size of the <b>waste</b> <b>tyre</b> particle is considered as a major factor in determining the magnitude of the overall energy used as well as the completion time of the pyrolysis reaction. Simulations were conducted to compare the effects of the particle size on the completion time and the overall energy usage under different heating rates and operational strategies. Shredding energy needed to reduce <b>waste</b> <b>tyre</b> particles was also included into the calculation of the overall energy consumption. Optimisation of the particle size was conducted under a number of specified maximum completion times and heating rates. This study confirms the trade-off between the overall energy used and the completion time.

5000|$|Tire {{recycling}} or rubber {{recycling is}} the process of recycling vehicles tyres that are no longer suitable for use on vehicles. These tyres are among the largest and most problematic sources of waste, due to the large volume produced and their durability. Those same characteristics which make <b>waste</b> <b>tyres</b> such a problem also make them one of the most re-used waste materials, as the rubber is very resilient and can be reused in other products. In the United States, approximately one tyre is discarded per person per year. However, material recovered from <b>waste</b> <b>tyres,</b> known as [...] "crumb" [...] is generally only a cheap [...] "filler" [...] material and is rarely used in high volumes. Tyre recycling is also fairly common. Used tires can be added to asphalt for producing road surfaces or to make rubber mulch used on playgrounds, basketball courts and new shoe products. They are also often used as the insulation and heat absorbing/releasing material in specially constructed homes known as earthships. It is arguable that tire crumb in applications such as basketball courts could be better described as [...] "reused" [...] rubber rather than [...] "recycled".|$|R

The objective of the present research study is to investigate whether use of rubberised backfills benefits the seismic response of Integral Abutment Bridges (IABs) by enhancing soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects. Numerical models including typical integral abutments on surface foundation with nonlinear conventional backfill material and its alternative form as soil-rubber mixtures are analysed and their response parameters are compared. The research is conducted on the basis of parametric analysis, which aims to evaluate the influence of different rubber-soil mixtures on the dynamic response of the abutment-backfill system under various seismic excitations, accounting for dynamic soil-abutment interaction. The results provide evidence that the use of rubberised backfill leads to reductions in the backfill settlements, the horizontal displacements of the bridge deck, the residual horizontal displacements of the top of the abutment and the pressures acting on the abutment, up to 55 %, 18 %, 43 % and 47 % respectively, with respect to a conventional backfill comprising of clean sand. Considerable amount of decrease in bending moments and shear forces on the abutment wall is also observed. Therefore, rubberised backfills offer promising solution to mitigate the earthquake risk, towards economic design with minimal damage objectives for the resilience of transportation networks...|$|R
