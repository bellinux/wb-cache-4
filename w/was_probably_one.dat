5|$|Day's {{origins and}} the events of his early life remain obscure. Scholars have assumed that Day {{was born and raised}} in Dunwich, but there is no direct {{evidence}} that proves this claim. He may have been in London by 1540, as his name is mentioned in a city deposition as being a former servant of the printer and physician Thomas Raynalde. In 1546, he <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> of twenty men who were granted the freedom of the city by redemption to work for the Stringers' Company of London.|$|E
5|$|Dimetrodon <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> of {{the apex}} predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, {{including}} reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species {{may have had}} different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon {{may have been used}} to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from the body, and was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{material}} from the Bronze Age and earlier has been recovered and excavations have shown that there was unsustained late-Neolithic and Bronze Age human activity in the vicinity. The earliest known permanent settlement dates from the Iron Age and began where a track running northwards from Bourne crossed the River Slea. Although only sparse pottery evidence has been found for the middle Iron Age period, 4,290 pellet mould fragments, likely used for minting and dated to 50BC–AD 50, have been uncovered south east of the modern town centre, south of a crossing of the River Slea and near Mareham Lane in Old Sleaford. The largest {{of its kind in}} Europe, the deposit has led archaeologists to consider that the site in Old Sleaford <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> of the largest Corieltauvian settlements during this period and may have been a tribal centre.|$|E
5|$|Pure carbon has {{extremely}} low toxicity to humans {{and can be}} handled and even ingested safely {{in the form of}} graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract. Consequently, once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. Carbon black <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> of the first pigments to be used for tattooing, and Ötzi the Iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200years after his death. Inhalation of coal dust or soot (carbon black) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease, coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Diamond dust used as an abrasive can be harmful if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs. In these examples, the harm may result from contaminants (e.g., organic chemicals, heavy metals) rather than from the carbon itself.|$|E
5|$|Robert <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> of {{the sons}} of Gilbert de Gant, who is {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book. Gilbert was from Flanders and came to England during 1069. Gilbert, who died around 1095, was married to Alice, daughter of Hugh de Montfort. Robert's conjectured siblings were Emma– wife of Alan de Percy, Hugh de Montfort-sur-Risle, Gilbert de Gant– who died before his father, and Walter de Gant. If Robert was a son of Gilbert, he was a younger son, probably {{the youngest of the}} four brothers, and probably was born sometime around 1085, as his supposed parents married about 1075 and there were older siblings. Robert is often confused in the historical records with another Robert, son of Walter. Robert was probably also the uncle of Gilbert de Gant, later Earl of Lincoln.|$|E

5|$|After the Union of Crowns in 1603 {{conflict}} between Scotland and England ended, but Scotland found itself involved in England's foreign policy, opening up Scottish shipping to attack. In the 1620s, Scotland found herself fighting a naval war as England's ally, first against Spain {{and then also}} against France, while simultaneously embroiled in undeclared North Sea commitments in the Danish intervention in the Thirty Years' War. In 1626 a squadron of three ships were bought and equipped {{at a cost of}} least £5,200 sterling, to guard against privateers operating out of Spanish-controlled Dunkirk and other ships were armed in preparation for potential action. The acting High Admiral John Gordon of Lochinvar organised at least three marque fleets of privateers. It <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> of Lochinvar's marque fleets that was sent to support the English Royal Navy defending Irish waters in 1626. In 1627, the Royal Scots Navy, and accompanying contingents of burgh privateers, participated in the major expedition to Biscay. The Scots also returned to the West Indies, with Lochinvar taking French prizes and founding the colony of Charles Island. In 1629 two squadrons of privateers led by Lochinvar and William Lord Alexander, sailed for Canada, taking part in the campaign that resulted in the capture of Quebec from the French, which was handed back after the subsequent peace.|$|E
5|$|Sophocles, {{the son of}} Sophilus, was {{a wealthy}} member of the rural deme (small community) of Hippeios Colonus in Attica, which {{was to become a}} setting for one of his plays, and he was {{probably}} born there. Sophocles was born a few years before the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC: the exact year is unclear, although 497/6 is the most likely. Sophocles was born into a wealthy family (his father was an armour manufacturer) and was highly educated. Sophocles' first artistic triumph was in 468 BC, when he took first prize in the Dionysia theatre competition over the reigning master of Athenian drama, Aeschylus. According to Plutarch, the victory came under unusual circumstances. Instead of following the usual custom of choosing judges by lot, the archon asked Cimon and the other strategoi present to decide the victor of the contest. Plutarch further contends that following this loss Aeschylus soon left for Sicily. Although Plutarch says that this was Sophocles' first production, it is now thought that his first production was probably in 470 BC. Triptolemus <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> of the plays that Sophocles presented at this festival.|$|E

25|$|Most {{scholars}} are now agreed that Ugolino {{was the author}} of the Fioretti, or Little Flowers of St. Francis, in their original form.

He also advocated transferring the m. brachioradialis to the wrist extensors when these muscles are paralyzed.|$|E
25|$|Domhnall's reign {{is noted}} for its tension with the monarchy. King David II irritated Domhnall by {{residing}} at Dumbarton on at least twelve occasions between 1341 and 1346.

25|$|For the {{language}} C++, Zortech (later Symantec, then Digital Mars), Watcom and Borland have all produced well known commercial compilers {{that have been}} used often with Win16, Win32s, and Win32. Some of them supplied memory extenders, allowing Win32 programs to run on Win16 with Microsoft's redistributable Win32s DLL. The Zortech compiler <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> of the first stable and usable C++ compilers for Windows programming, before Microsoft had a C++ compiler.|$|E
25|$|Bình Định <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> of {{the places}} where the Cham first arrived in what is now Vietnam. Its {{favourable}} geography led to the rise of the Cham Port of Thị Nại where Quy Nhon is now located. The city-state of Vijaya was located around this port and the main city, which was further inland. Its centre was in the southern lowland of Bình Định. However, its architecture implies that it did not become important until the eleventh or twelfth century.|$|E
25|$|The government's {{response}} to the increased threat was to appoint a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, which published a far-reaching report in 1860. It recommended that many existing forts should be upgraded or rebuilt entirely, and that new forts should be constructed to guard particularly strategic or vulnerable points along the coast. In all, around 70 forts and batteries were constructed around the English coast {{as a result of}} the Royal Commission's report. Slough Fort <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> of the smallest of these.|$|E
