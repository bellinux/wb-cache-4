25|$|While {{in prison}} he was {{transferred}} to the Bridgewater State Hospital. On March 22, 1984, he changed his name to Nathaniel Benjamin Levi Bar-Jonah. He gave several reasons for changing his name. Bar-Jonah told friends and relatives that he changed his name because he wanted to know what it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> discriminated against and persecuted as a Jew. During a later interview with Dr. Michael Stone for the television show Most Evil, he claimed he was Jewish and wanted his name to reflect that. Later in the same year, Superior Court Judge Walter E. Steele ruled that Massachusetts had failed to prove that Bar-Jonah was dangerous and he was released before moving to Great Falls, Montana. During this time, Bar-Jonah confided in his psychiatrists that he had a deep fascination and curiosity with the taste of human flesh, and had innumerable murderous fantasies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} I {{distinguish}} {{the notion of}} there being something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a certain kind of}} creature from that of there being something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have a certain kind of experience. Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there <b>is</b> something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there <b>is</b> anything it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an F is recommended...|$|R

How can one describe what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a particular entity, without actually being it yourself? Thomas Nagel, Raymond Smullyan, Douglas Hofstadter, and Robert Nozick tackle the problem of translating the experiences of one being into terms another can understand. But can we ever know what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> another self? For that matter, what can we know about what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ourselves? Hofstadter and Dennett's commentary suggest that self-knowledge <b>is</b> elusive, <b>to</b> say nothing of the experience of other minds.|$|R

500|$|McCracken next {{appeared}} on Broadway in the 1953 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Me and Juliet. The choreography was by Robert Alton, {{who had worked}} with McCracken on Good News. The play was meant to show what it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> backstage during the run of a hit Broadway show, and she performed opposite Ray Walston in the [...] "show within a show."

I started acting because I got offered a job when I was 16, and they wanted to pay me £8,000, and we'd always lived on Family Support".

Matt Damon was intentionally not brought into the camp, to make {{the rest of the}} group feel resentment towards the character.

500|$|Following his {{historic}} third Oscar win {{there was}} much debate about Day-Lewis's standing among the greatest actors {{in the history of}} cinema. Joe Queenan in The Guardian stated, [...] "Arguing whether Daniel Day-Lewis is a greater actor than Laurence Olivier, or Richard Burton, or Marlon Brando, is like arguing whether Messi is more talented than Pelé, whether Napoleon Bonaparte edges out Alexander the Great as a military genius." [...] Day-Lewis himself when asked what it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "the world's greatest actor", responded [...] "It's daft isn't it?. It changes all the time". Shortly after winning the Oscar for Lincoln, Day-Lewis announced he would be taking a break from acting, retreating back to his Georgian farmhouse in County Wicklow for the next five years, before making another film.|$|E
500|$|Early episodes {{tended to}} be shock value-oriented and {{featured}} more slapstick-style humor. While social satire had been used on the show occasionally earlier on, it became more prevalent as the series progressed, with the show retaining some of its focus on the boys' fondness of scatological humor {{in an attempt to}} remind adult viewers [...] "what it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> eight years old." [...] Parker and Stone also began further developing other characters by giving them larger roles in certain storylines, and began writing plots as parables based on religion, politics, and numerous other topics. This provided the opportunity for the show to spoof both extreme sides of contentious issues, while lampooning both liberal and conservative points of view. Parker and Stone describe themselves as [...] "equal opportunity offenders", whose main purpose is to [...] "be funny" [...] and [...] "make people laugh", while stating that no particular topic or group of people be exempt from mockery and satire.|$|E

500|$|Bannon set {{her stories}} in and among gay bars in the 1950s and 1960s that were secret. As {{described}} in Beebo Brinker, {{one had to}} knock on the door and be recognized before being let in. In reality, women were not allowed to wear pants in some bars in New York City. Police raided bars and arrested everyone within regularly; a raid on a gay bar prompted the seminal Stonewall riots in 1969 that started the gay rights movement. Because of the atmosphere of secrecy and shame, little was recorded at the time about what it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gay then, and Bannon unwittingly recorded history from her own visits to Greenwich Village. In 2007, one of the writers who adapted three of the books into a play said of Bannon's work, [...] "I think she rises above the pulp. She wasn't trying to write trash. There wasn't any place for a woman to be writing this kind of material... But I just think the writing's transcended its time and its era and its market." ...|$|E
500|$|Weiss {{said that}} they wanted to depict a {{full-fledged}} battle, [...] "From the beginning we knew that one thing we'd never had on the show was a true medieval pitched battle where two sides bring all the forces they can into play in some battlefield that's somehow negotiated or agreed upon and they go at each other until one of them wins and the other one loses. This is a staple of human history, and we started to look through film samples of it. There really wasn't one that both made you feel what it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there on the ground and gave you a sense of the geography of the battle." [...] According to Benioff, they also wanted to demonstrate the role luck plays in battle, [...] "Just to feel the kind of randomness of it where there's arrows falling from everywhere, people are getting killed, people are getting trampled by horses, and so much of it is just luck. Jon Snow is a very skilled combatant, but part of the reason he survives this battle is just he gets lucky".|$|E
