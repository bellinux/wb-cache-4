5|$|As {{they leave}} Vagra II, the crew holds a {{memorial}} service for Lt. Yar, with a pre-recorded simulation of Yar addressing each of the senior crew members telling them <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>meant</b> to her and what she learned from each of them. After the service, Data (Brent Spiner), who had previously become close to Yar, tells Picard that he is confused as to the purpose of the service. He says that his thoughts are for himself, because he can only think of how empty his life will be without Tasha. He asks if he has missed the point, but Picard assures him he got it.|$|E
5|$|Tara's {{best friend}} Ishita (Ratnabali Bhattacharjee) arrives at Kochi and advises her to start {{chanting}} prayers and to inform Rajat's estranged parents of his situation. Despite being an atheist, Tara chants Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō {{when she is}} alone with Rajat. Shiv desperately attempts to convince Malhotra to perform a spinal decompression on his wife, but he disregards Shiv's research and refuses to proceed with surgery.

Tara realises that she is no longer Ishita's top priority, now that Ishita is married. Shiv and Tara make up and later that night dance together at Shiv's house, much to the amusement of his neighbours. They get upset thinking about their spouses and discuss <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>meant</b> to them, before falling asleep in the living room.|$|E
25|$|Afrocentrism has {{its origins}} {{in the work of}} African and African {{diaspora}} intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, following social changes in the United States and Africa due both to the end of slavery and the decline of colonialism. Following the American Civil War, African Americans in the South gathered together in communities to evade white control, established their own church congregations, and worked hard to gain education. They increasingly took more active public roles despite severe racial discrimination and segregation. American and African intellectuals looked to the African past for a re-evaluation of what its civilizations had achieved and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>meant</b> for contemporary people.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{division}} of labour inherent in prescriptive technologies is usually associated with the industrial revolution, Franklin points out that such production methods have been used since ancient times. Chinese bronze casting before 1200 BC for example, required a tightly controlled and closely supervised production process {{as well as a}} strict division of labour. Franklin writes that when she studied Chinese bronze casting as a metallurgist, [...] "the extraordinary social meaning of prescriptive technologies dawned on me. I began to understand <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>meant,</b> not just in terms of casting bronze but in terms of discipline and planning, of organization and command." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Saadiq, [...] "Just One Kiss" [...] can be {{interpreted}} as a song devoted to a female love interest, [...] "but I'm really talking about music and what it did for me. That one guitar line, that certain drum beat, how it turned my life into a ball of gold." [...] The song incorporates cinematic strings, xylophone, and a rolling crescendo. The ballad [...] "Calling", featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R roots and doo-wop music, and incorporates Latin style guitar, and Spanish language lyrics. [...] "Staying in Love", an uptempo rhythm and blues song, was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex-girlfriend. Incongruous with its 1960s-inspired sound, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] has sexually forward lyrics and , which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest. The midtempo [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] is fashioned in Motown's early 1970 sound and, unlike other songs on the album, also incorporates elements from more modern soul music. [...] "Sometimes", which was inspired by Saadiq's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in Oakland, is about dealing with the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism. The line [...] "now I know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>meant</b> by 'keep your head to the sky'" [...] makes reference to Earth, Wind & Fire, whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the song's message, [...] "That's just giving dap to my moms and grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time and sometimes we have to back up and cry but I'm just giving thanks to the people that helped me along the way." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Liturgical Movement of {{the nineteenth}} and twentieth centuries, which arose {{from the work of}} Dom Prosper Guéranger, founder of Solesmes Abbey, {{encouraged}} the laity to [...] "live" [...] the liturgy by attending services (not only Mass) often, understanding <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>meant,</b> and following the priest in heart and mind. It envisaged only minor reforms of the liturgy itself; the most important changes it sought affected the calendar. It also focused on promoting Gregorian Chant.|$|E
2500|$|The {{expression}} [...] "subtile body" [...] appears {{suddenly in}} English literature in about 1650, appears erratically until it {{ceased to be}} used by about 1840. [...] At that time, the more common term [...] "subtle body" [...] comes into use. [...] The latter expression gradually gains in currency through the nineteenth century, and begins a sharp increase in usage from about 1940 until the present time. Further research is needed to clarify the actual authors who used the phrase, and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>meant</b> by it. [...] But the word may have a connection with the Sanskrit Sūkṣma (subtle, unmanifest, dormant) Śarīra (body) which is described in the Vedas.|$|E
2500|$|... "Kill the Boy" [...] was {{initially}} {{expected to be}} the first single released by Sandé, due to Sandé's strong promotion of the song. There were a number of songs which have had media attention: [...] "Kill the Boy", [...] "Easier in Bed" [...] and [...] "Summer of Wonder". An acoustic version of [...] "Easier in Bed" [...] was released onto iTunes on 12 December 2012. [...] "Summer of Wonder" [...] is a song which was written by her and Naughty Boy, which was not used and instead she used the song title for her upcoming summer tour entitled Summer of Wonder Tour. [...] "Boys" [...] which was Cheryl Cole's B-side track to [...] "3 Words" [...] was originally for Sandé's album. However, she said when she heard Cole sing it, she loved how what the lyrics meant to Cole was different from <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>meant</b> to her when she wrote it, so Sandé decided to give the track to Cole.|$|E

2500|$|The espantoon {{is a type}} of ornate wooden police baton that is {{distinct}} to the city of Baltimore and has been in use for generations. It is an ornate wood straight baton equipped with a swiveled leather strap with which it can be twirled. Between 1994 and 2000, the espantoon was banned in favor of the koga stick due to police commissioner Thomas Frazier's perception that its twirling intimidated the citizenry. [...] In 2000, Edward T. Norris assumed the office of police commissioner and lifted the ban on the espantoon, although he did not mandate its use. The move was made as part of a general effort to boost morale and instill a more aggressive approach to policing in Baltimore. Norris stated, [...] "When I found out <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>meant</b> to the rank and file, I said, 'Bring them back.' ... It is a tremendous part of the history of this Police Department." [...] While the move did not make the espantoon an issued item by the department as it once was, it remains to this day an optional piece of carry equipment.|$|E
