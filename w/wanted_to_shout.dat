500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on the album drew their lyrics from real life relationships. [...] "Peachy" [...] {{documents}} the permanent breakup of a relationship that had inspired her 2004 single [...] "Ten Days". [...] "Where I Stood", which Higgins calls [...] "a pretty sad love song", describes the end of another relationship. She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where you just feel that leaving this person is {{something you have to}} do to get to know yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
500|$|After 1974, Harrison {{no longer}} wrote songs as {{obviously}} Krishna-devotional as [...] "It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)", although {{he returned to}} recording bhajans intermittently, with songs such as [...] "Dear One" [...] in 1976 and [...] "Life Itself, released in 1981. In his book The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Peter Lavezzoli writes that following Dark Horse and the [...] "ill-fated 1974 tour", Harrison [...] "continued to infuse his work with an implicit spirituality that rarely manifested on the surface". Speaking to ISKCON devotee Mukunda Goswami in 1982, Harrison said: Back in the sixties, whatever we were all getting into, we tended to broadcast it as loud as we could. I had had certain realizations and went through a period where I was so thrilled about my discoveries and realizations that I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> and tell it to everybody. But there's a time to shout it out and a time not to shout it out.|$|E
500|$|From 2004 to 2007, Higgins' sexual {{orientation}} {{was the subject}} of media speculation based partly on interpretations of her lyrics and her interviews. In an October 2007 interview with Australian lesbian magazine Cherrie, she was asked if she fell under the moniker of [...] "not-so-straight" [...] girls. She replied [...] "Um, yeah, definitely. ... I think sexuality is a fluid thing and it's becoming increasingly more acceptable to admit that you're that way." [...] In November her Myspace page reported, [...] "I've been in relationships with both men and women so I guess I fall most easily under the category 'Bisexual'". She {{went on to say that}} she wanted future interviews to focus on her music rather than her sexuality. In a March 2008 interview with AfterEllen.com, Higgins said that her song [...] "Secret" [...] was written about an ex-girlfriend who was not comfortable, at first, about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E

6000|$|But Sir Isaac was now {{resolved}} upon eloquence. His {{mind was}} full with the accumulations of an extremely long and bitter afternoon and urgent to discharge.

At the horror of this chase, more ghastly in his imagination than if he could have seen it, the perspiration broke out on his forehead, while his throat was as dry as tinder. A last supreme scream was cut short suddenly.|$|E
50|$|On 25 Oct 1956, Chin Siong gave {{a speech}} at Beauty World in Hokkien to an angry audience, urging them to calm down and that their enemy was not the police, but Yew Hock and the colonial masters. Among those who {{attended}} the rally were Lee Kuan Yew, Toh Chin Chye and Devan Nair. A transcript of the speech by the Special Branch, recently declassified, revealed that Chin Siong had said: A lot of people don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> Merdeka! They <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> “pah mata”. This is wrong.

6000|$|... "Yes, but {{we hardly}} ever do that. There were disagreeable results, several times, {{and so we}} very seldom ask or grant the privilege, nowadays, and we never even think {{of such a thing}} unless the case is {{extremely}} urgent. Besides, a week's possession at a time seems so little that we can't bear to spare a minute of it. People who have the use of their legs all the time never think of what a blessing it is, of course. It never occurs to them; it's just their natural ordinary condition, and so it does not excite them at all. But when I wake up, on Sunday morning, and it's my week and I feel the power all through me, oh, such a wave of exultation and thanksgiving goes surging over me, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> 'I can walk!

"And she was right, Paul," [...] he whispered, {{pressing}} {{my small}} hand in his--it {{was necessary to}} whisper, for the street where we were was very crowded, but I knew that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>shout.</b> [...] "I will fight him and I will slay him." [...] My father made passes {{in the air with}} his walking-stick, and it was evident from the way they drew aside that the people round about fancied he was mad.

6000|$|He {{caught a}} bus, then another, then walked a while. Now {{that he was}} moving, he was agonizedly {{considering}} his problem: What was Istra to him, really? What could he be to her? He was just a clerk. She could never love him. [...] "And of course," [...] he explained to himself, [...] "you hadn't oughta love a person without you expected to marry them; you oughtn't never even touch her hand." [...] Yet he did want to touch hers. He suddenly threw his chin back, high and firm, in defiance. He didn't care if he was wicked, he declared. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> to Istra across all the city: Let us be great lovers! Let us be mad! Let us stride over the hilltops. Though that {{was not at all}} the way he phrased it.|$|E
60|$|He exulted at the {{swiftness}} {{with which}} a distant {{group of trees}} shot at him, under him. He turned, and the machine mounted {{a little on the}} turn, which was against the rules. But he brought her to even keel so easily that he felt all the mastery of the man who has finally learned to be natural on a bicycle. He tilted up the elevator slightly and shot across a series of fields, climbing. It was perfectly easy. He would go up--up. It was all automatic now--cloche toward him for climbing; away from him for descent; toward the wing that tipped up, in order to bring it down to level. The machine obeyed perfectly. And the foot-bar, for steering to right and left, responded to such light motions of his foot. He grinned exultantly. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>shout.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Shake! I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shout!</b> Oh, I tell you, I am immensely delighted and relieved. Oh, just to work--that is life!

Don't you feel good? I tell you I do." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No! I can't," [...] he retorted.

60|$|The two men he {{had left}} {{entangled}} at Sixty Mile failed to overtake him, and, on the other hand, his team failed to overtake {{any of the three}} that still led. His animals were willing, though they lacked stamina and speed, and little urging was needed to keep them jumping into it at their best. There was nothing for Smoke to do but to lie face downward and hold on. Now and again he would plunge out of the darkness into the circle of light about a blazing fire, catch a glimpse of furred men standing by harnessed and waiting dogs, and plunge into the darkness again. Mile after mile, with only the grind and jar of the runners in his ears, he sped on. Almost automatically he kept his place as the sled bumped ahead or half lifted and heeled on the swings and swerves of the bends. First one, and then another, without apparent rhyme or reason, three faces limned themselves on his consciousness: Joy Gastell's, laughing and audacious; Shorty's, battered and exhausted by the struggle down Mono Creek; and John Bellew's, seamed and rigid, as if cast in iron, so unrelenting was its severity. And sometimes Smoke <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> aloud, to chant a paean of savage exultation, as he remembered the office of The Billow and the serial story of San Francisco which {{he had left}} unfinished, along with the other fripperies of those empty days.|$|E
6000|$|... "My brother <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> {{the cry of}} challenge--one cry only--to let {{the people}} know we were freeborn robbers who trusted our arms and the great sea. And again I begged him {{in the name of}} our love to be silent. Could I not hear her {{breathing}} close to me? I knew the pursuit would come quick enough. My brother loved me. He dipped his paddle without a splash. He only said, 'There is half a man in you now--the other half is in that woman. I can wait. When you are a whole man again, you will come back with me here to shout defiance. We are sons of the same mother.' I made no answer. All my strength and all my spirit were in my hands that held the paddle--for I longed to be with her in a safe place beyond the reach of men's anger and of women's spite. My love was so great, that I thought it could guide me to a country where death was unknown, if I could only escape from Inchi Midah's fury and from our Ruler's sword. We paddled with haste, breathing through our teeth. The blades bit deep into the smooth water. We passed out of the river; we flew in clear channels amongst the shallows. We skirted the black coast; we skirted the sand beaches where the sea speaks in whispers to the land; and the gleam of white sand flashed back past our boat, so swiftly she ran upon the water. We spoke not. Only once I said, 'Sleep, Diamelen, for soon you may want all your strength.' I heard the sweetness of her voice, but I never turned my head. The sun rose and still we went on. Water fell from my face like rain from a cloud. We flew in the light and heat. I never looked back, but I knew that my brother's eyes, behind me, were looking steadily ahead, for the boat went as straight as a bushman's dart, when it leaves the end of the sumpitan. There was no better paddler, no better steersman than my brother. Many times, together, we had won races in that canoe. But we never had put out our strength as we did then--then, when for the last time we paddled together! There was no braver or stronger man in our country than my brother. I could not spare the strength to turn my head and look at him, but every moment I heard the hiss of his breath getting louder behind me. Still he did not speak. The sun was high. The heat clung to my back like a flame of fire. My ribs were ready to burst, but I could no longer get enough air into my chest. And then I felt I must cry out with my last breath, 'Let us rest!' [...] . 'Good!' he answered; and his voice was firm. He was strong. He was brave. He knew not fear and no fatigue [...] . My brother!" ...|$|E

A sound technician at a concert disappeared, and someone in the audience, pretending to know his name, shouted 'Valerio!', {{and more and more}} people joined in. It was apparently infectious, and it spread from Brindisi to Rimini and other cities. There is something about the sound of this name that makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> it loud.

He went across the bed of pinks, whose keen perfume came sharply across the rocking, heavy scent of the lilies, and stood alongside the white barrier of flowers. They flagged all loose, as if they were panting. The scent made him drunk. He went down to the field to watch the moon sink under.|$|R
