50|$|The {{technique}} of estimating {{is the least}} refined of all those available to the work measurement practitioner. It consists of an estimate of total job duration (or in common practice, the job price or cost). This estimate is made by a craftsman or person familiar with the craft.

In order to remanufacture a product, it requires a total dismantling of the product and the subsequent restoration and replacement of its parts. Remanufacturing is a preferred method of waste reduction compared to repairing and reconditioning because it preserves the embodied energy {{that has been used}} to shape the components of a product for their first life and it only requires 20-25% of the initial energy used in formation.|$|E

50|$|The conversations {{respective}} {{agreements on}} objectives cause {{an agreement that}} inform the employee about the reasons and backgrounds, {{as well as the}} conditions of the work task and thus counteract problems independently and purposefully. The control times of the executives are shortened. Furthermore, employees are encouraged to feel more accountable for the results of their activities. Agreements on objectives are increasing the employee's identification with the <b>work</b> <b>content</b> and the company, which also leads to improved performance of the employee and thereby increase the efficiency of the company.|$|E
5000|$|This {{technique}} {{has been developed}} to permit speedy and reliable assessment of the duration of variable and infrequent jobs, by estimating them within chosen time bands. Limits are set within which the job under consideration will fall, rather than in terms of precise capital standard or capital allowed minute values. It is applied by comparing the job to be estimated with jobs of similar <b>work</b> <b>content,</b> and using these similar jobs as [...] "bench marks" [...] to locate the new job in its relevant time band - known as Work Group.|$|E
50|$|At first glance, lean workcells {{may appear}} to be similar to {{traditional}} workcells, but they are inherently different. For instance, lean workcells must be designed for minimal wasted motion, which refers to any unnecessary time and effort required to assemble a product. Excessive twists or turns, uncomfortable reaches or pickups, and unnecessary walking all contribute to wasted motion and may put error inducing stress upon the operator. Workcells can often be reconfigured easily to allow the adaptation of the process to fit takt time. This flexibility allows the <b>work</b> <b>content</b> to be adapted as demand or product mix changes.|$|E

50|$|This {{technique}} introduces {{work measurement}} concepts into estimating. In analytical estimating the estimator {{is trained in}} elemental breakdown, and {{in the concept of}} standard performance. The estimate is prepared by first breaking the <b>work</b> <b>content</b> of the job into elements, and then utilising the experience of the estimator (normally a craftsman) the time for each element of work is estimated - at standard performance. These estimated basic minutes are totalled to give a total job time, in basic minutes. An allowance for relaxation and any necessary contingency is then made, as in conventional time study, to give the standard time.|$|E

50|$|The {{economic}} incentives {{to work on}} copyleft content can vary. Traditional copyright law is designed to promote progress by providing economic benefits to creators. When choosing to copyleft their <b>work,</b> <b>content</b> creators may seek complementary benefits like recognition from their peers. The open-source culture had {{been described as a}} gift culture, where social status is determined by an individual's contributions. Working on free software may also be an outlet for programmers to fill a need they have noticed. For some creators, keeping their work open is an incentive in and of itself. For these programmers, preventing commercial enterprises from absorbing and selling their product is another incentive.|$|E

This topic is current in primary school system nowadays. The thesis deals with <b>work</b> <b>contents</b> and the most common problems which are solved by guidance counsellor. The thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. The first part is theoretical. Theoretical part is focused on guidance counselloring requirements on guidance counsellor's personality. This part is simultaneously focused on which demands are placed on the guidance counsellor by educational system. These knowledges were given evidence of specialized literature which is concerned with the topic. The second part is focused on research which was done on primary schools during 2016 2017. The participans on research were also parents of children who attend the mentioned primary schools. The main aims of the research were to find out how guidance counsellors work, than awarness of parents about guidance councelloring and requirements of headmasters of primary schools to guidance counsellors. In this case were created four resech questions. On the grounds of these questions were respondents asked through half-structured interview. On the research were participated three groups of respondents. In the first group were guidance counsellors of primary schools. In the second group were parents of children who attend primary school and in the last group were headmasters of primary schools. The research part was focused on <b>work</b> <b>contents</b> and the most common problems which are solved by guidance counsellor on primary schools. It was found out that the main <b>work</b> <b>contents</b> of guidance counsellors are career consultancy and work with children who have special educational needs...|$|R
