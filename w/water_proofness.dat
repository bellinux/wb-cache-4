40|$|Waxed duplex cartons {{collected}} from different prawn freezing factories were evaluated for their physico-chemical properties such as bursting strength, puncture resistance, <b>water</b> <b>proofness,</b> tearing, strength, tensile strength, elongation, moisture content, thickness, {{weight of the}} carton, dimension, wax content and saponifiable matter. The results are discussed {{from the point of}} view of formulation of standards for this most widely employed packaging material for frozen fishery products in the country...|$|E
40|$|This {{is a book}} chapter. It was {{published}} by Woodhead Publishing: www. woodheadpublishing. comAn overview of laboratory tests for cold weather clothing is provided starting from physical measurements on fabrics, and physical measurements on whole garments using thermal manikins. This is extended to human wear trials and climatic chamber experimentation. Insulation and vapour resistance are considered the most relevant parameters followed by wind and <b>water</b> <b>proofness</b> and moisture absorption properties. The use of test participants in wear trials is considered regarding the information provided by such tests. Tests for innovative fabrics (heated, variable insulation, phase change materials) are discussed. Finally testing of sleeping bags is considered...|$|E
