5|$|The {{need for}} strong leaders <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> charge and steer America {{out of its}} crisis is seen in Gabriel Over the White House (1933), about a benevolent {{dictator}} who takes control of the United States. Walter Huston stars as a weak-willed, ineffectual president (likely modeled after Hoover) who is inhabited by the archangel Gabriel upon being knocked unconscious. The spirit's behavior {{is similar to that}} of Abraham Lincoln. The president solves the nation's unemployment crisis and executes an Al Capone-type criminal who has continually flouted the law.|$|E
5|$|A Roy of the Rovers {{computer}} game was released, on the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum in 1988. It was {{split into two}} parts: the first an adventure game, in which– taking the role of Roy Race– the player had to find and rescue the kidnapped Melchester team, before then playing the second part, which consisted of a charity match {{to raise funds for}} the club. The fewer players recovered before the match began, then the smaller the team <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> part. In the extreme, Roy would be the only player for Melchester. The game received mixed reactions; the Spectrum version received 7/10 from Your Sinclair, but only 3/10 from Sinclair User.|$|E
5|$|Sharon Elizabeth Hall {{was born}} on November 30, 1939, in Independence, Missouri. When she was in junior high, Doris and Eugene Hall moved the family to Washington, {{but by the time}} Sharon was fifteen they had {{returned}} to Missouri, where Sharon attended William Chrisman High School. Sixteen-year-old Sharon met twenty-two-year-old college student James Kinne at a church function in the summer of 1956, and the couple dated regularly until Kinne returned to Brigham Young University in the fall. Sharon, reportedly deeply interested in finding a partner with prospects and <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> her away from Independence, soon wrote a letter to Kinne at school informing him that she was pregnant by him. Kinne took leave from his college and returned to Independence, where he married Sharon on October 18, 1956. The couple's marriage license identified sixteen-year-old Sharon as being eighteen and a widow; though she later refused to address the assertion, Sharon told people at the time that she had been married when she lived in Washington, to a man who later died in a car accident. The new couple held a second, more formal wedding the next year in the Salt Lake Temple, after Sharon had completed the process of converting to Mormonism.|$|E

5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had what it took to make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much safer and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but because of the way evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> advantage of this would be rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at {{the right place at the}} right time, favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result in continuing evolution and diversification.|$|E

25|$|During the 2003 provincial election, the Saskatchewan Party {{campaigned on}} a {{platform}} of tax reduction and decreased government involvement in the private sector. The party won 28 seats, while the NDP won 30 seats. The party was accused of having undisclosed plans to privatize the province's crown corporations. Hermanson stated he would not sell the four major crown corporations, but would consider offers. The NDP used the ambiguity in the Saskatchewan Party's position to turn the election into a referendum on crown corporation ownership for many voters, and won the one seat it needed to regain a majority government. Hermanson resigned as leader shortly afterward. He stated he had taken the party as far as he could, and {{it was time for the}} party to elect a new leader <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> it further.|$|E

25|$|More and more, architects are {{investigating}} ways that courtyards {{can play a}} role in the development of today's homes and cities. In densely populated areas, a courtyard in a home can provide privacy for a family, a break from the frantic pace of everyday life, and a safe place for children to play. With space at a premium, architects are experimenting with courtyards as a way to provide outdoor space for small communities of people at a time. A courtyard surrounded by 12 houses, for example, would provide a shared park-like space for those families, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> pride in ownership of the space. Though this might sound like a modern-day solution to an inner city problem, the grouping of houses around a shared courtyard was common practice among the Incas as far back as the 13th century.|$|E
25|$|A ki' pohaku ({{petroglyph}}) of {{a turtle}} (or honu) {{can be found}} on The Big Island of Hawaii in the Pu'u Loa lava fields. The green sea turtle (called Honu) has always held a special meaning for Hawaiians and this petroglyph shows its importance dating to possibly when the islands first became populated. The turtle symbolizes a navigator that can find his way home time after time. This symbol mirrors the real life of the green Hawaiian turtle as it will swim hundreds of miles to lay its eggs at its own place of birth. Though there are other myths as well, some Hawaiian legends say the honu were the first to guide the Polynesians to the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiians revere the turtle and the legend of Kailua, a turtle <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> the form of a girl at will. In human form, she looked after the children playing on Punalu'u beach.|$|E
25|$|John's {{children}} were trained rigorously growing up. His {{plan was to}} have an intelligent son <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> his place as king, a strategically married daughter, and well-prepared statesmen sons; but he would achieve only part of his goal. From her birth, Infanta Maria Barbara's marriage had been closely arranged and monitored by John. When the engagement of Mariana Victoria of Spain to Louis XV of France was nullified, John proposed Infanta Maria Barbara as a possible bride for Louis XV, {{but in the end}} she was refused. John still managed to gain something from the dissolution of the engagement between Louis XV and Mariana Victoria, i.e., a wife for his son Prince José and a husband for Infanta Maria Barbara, Mariana Victoria's older brother Fernando, Prince of Asturias. Negotiations between Portugal and Spain began in 1725, and four years later John's eldest children would be matched with their spouses-to-be. The princesses Maria Barbara and Mariana Victoria were exchanged at a ceremony, called the Exchange of the Princesses (Troca das Princesas), held on the Caia River on 19 January 1729. Prince José married Mariana Victoria on 19 January 1729 in Elvas, and Infanta Maria Barbara married Prince Fernando on 20 January 1729 in Badajoz.|$|E

500|$|After {{the power}} shuffle, in 1805, Bhimsen became the {{architect}} of an unpopular plan of seizing all the tax free land granted to temple guthis and as birta to Brahmin priests in order to fill the empty state coffers. [...] The objective was to scrutinize the cases in which tax exempt lands had been used without valid documentary proof of land grant by a benefactor; owners with valid evidence or owners <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> an oath of validity were not affected. The money was spent in financing the military campaigns in the far west in Jamuna-Sutlej region. This was a very radical reform in the staunchly religious society {{of the time and}} became known as Baisathi Haran in the Nepalese history.|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to start}} of {{production}} on the show, Hillenburg decided early that he wanted SpongeBob SquarePants to be a storyboard-driven show, rather than script-driven. Storyboard-driven is an approach that required artists <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> a skeletal story outline and flesh it out with sight gags, dialogue and a structure that [...] "would {{strike a balance between}} narrative and whimsy." [...] Hillenburg originally wanted [...] "a team of young and hungry people" [...] to work on the show. The group, who worked with Hillenburg on Rocko's Modern Life before, consisted of Alan Smart, Nick Jennings, and Derek Drymon. Tim Hill was asked about if he want to work as story editor, but he was unavailable at the time. The crew got Peter Burns to work as story editor who developed the idea for the episode [...] "Ripped Pants" [...] about SpongeBob ripping his pants.|$|E
500|$|West was an {{all-around}} combo guard <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> the playmaking {{roles of}} a point guard and score like a shooting guard, while being equally strong on offense and on defense. He had a jump shot with a release the NBA lauded as [...] "lightning quick", and was known for making baskets late in the game, earning him the nickname [...] "Mr. Clutch". Having played forward early in his career, West was also a capable rebounder, and gifted with long arms, quick hands and strong defensive instincts, West was also once described {{as one of the}} best ball hawks, man-to-man defenders and shot blockers among NBA guards: when the All-Defensive Teams were introduced in 1969, West made every one of them until his career ended in 1974. [...] "He stole more than anybody, although they didn't keep records on it then", said Sharman. However, contemporaries were most impressed by West's work ethic, obsessively practicing and shooting and rarely being satisfied with himself.|$|E

500|$|The first instance, where {{weapons are}} personified in Hindu scriptures, {{appears in the}} Hindu epic Ramayana. Two daughters of the Prajapati Daksha, Jaya and Vijaya are married to the sage Krisasva. For {{destruction}} of Rakshasas, Jaya bore fifty sons - powerful divine weapons <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> any form. Suprabha gave birth to fifty invincible sons who were called Samharas ("destroyers"). These magical weapons were known as Shastra-devatas – the gods of weapons - and were given to king Kaushika, who later became the sage Vishwamitra. The weapons served him and later his pupil Rama, an avatar of Vishnu. The Mahabharata records {{at the time of}} the chakra-musala war, the weapons of Krishna – another avatar of Vishnu and his brother Balarama appear in human form from the heavens to watch the battle. They include Krishna's Sudarshana Chakra and Kaumodaki, and Balarama's Samvartak plough and Saunanda musala (club). The Duta-Vakya ("envoy's message") of the Sanskrit playwright Bhasa (c. 2nd century BCE – 2nd century CE) describes an episode from the Mahabharata when Krishna goes as an envoy to Kauravas' court to broker peace between them and their cousins the Pandavas, on behalf of the latter. However, when the Kauravas try to arrest Krishna, Krishna assumes his Vishvarupa (all pervading [...] "Universal form") and summons his weapons, who appear as humans. The ayudhapurushas include the Sudarshana Chakra, the bow Saranga, Kaumodaki, Panchajanya the conch and Nandaka the sword, elaborate descriptions of whom are found in the text. This is the only Sanskrit play that depicts the weapons on stage as humans. The Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa mentions about dwarf-like ayudhapurushas denoting Vishnu's chakra, lotus, sword, bow and mace.|$|E
