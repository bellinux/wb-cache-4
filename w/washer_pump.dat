50|$|As of February 1976, {{the engine}} was {{upgraded}} to the EK21 four-stroke water-cooled version introduced in the Rex to reduce emissions. This model saw the introduction of an electric window <b>washer</b> <b>pump</b> to improve driver visibility. Because of regulations changes, only three months later {{the engine was}} again upgraded with a 490 cc displacement (EK22) engine of a similar layout for the Sambar 5 (K75 truck, K76 panel van, K85 van). This was naturally sold as the Subaru 500 in export markets. This was in turn soon replaced by a full 550 cc (EK23) model, the K77/87 of March 1977. In export, the Sambar 550 {{was known as the}} Subaru 600 and later as the Subaru 700, with a 665 cc version of the EK engine.|$|E

50|$|Passive {{isolation}} {{operates in}} both directions, isolating the payload from vibrations {{originating in the}} support, and also isolating the support from vibrations originating in the payload. Large machines such as <b>washers,</b> <b>pumps,</b> and generators, which would cause vibrations in the building or room, are often isolated from the floor. However, there are a multitude of sources of vibration in buildings, and it is often not possible to isolate each source. In many cases, it is most efficient to isolate each sensitive instrument from the floor. Sometimes {{it is necessary to}} implement both approaches.|$|R
50|$|To {{construct}} a windpump, the bladed rotor {{needs to be}} matched to the pump. With non-electric windpumps, high solidity rotors are best {{used in conjunction with}} positive displacement (piston) pumps, because single-acting piston pumps need about three times as much torque to start them as to keep them going. Low solidity rotors, on the other hand, are best used with centrifugal pumps, waterladder pumps and chain and <b>washer</b> <b>pumps,</b> where the torque needed by the pump for starting is less than that needed for running at design speed. Low solidity rotors are best used if they are intended to drive an electricity generator; which in turn can drive the pump.|$|R

40|$|An {{electrically}} operated knapsack sprayer of ten (10) liters capacity was developed using locally available materials and its performance evaluated. This device is developed {{to reduce the}} constant application of energy to throttle to regulate air pressure a problem in conventional knapsack sprayers. The major components include; tank, 12 volts electric water pump, 12 volts accumulator battery, strap (belt), delivery pipe and a sprayer handle together with lance and nozzle. Electric water pump that bended with the designed parameter was Mercedes Benz wind screen <b>washer</b> <b>pump,</b> powered by 12 volts, 2. 5 amperes battery (motorcycle type). Laboratory and field tests were conducted to determine flow rate, application rate and distribution rate. Basic hydraulic principles were considered for determining flow rate, while application rate was determined by effective use of walking speed on field. The {{results showed that the}} sprayer has a flow rate of 531 ml, application rate of 250 l/ha and a spray distribution area of 0. 000675 m 2. The result from the laboratory test indicated that decrease in liquid head leads to decrease in flow rate and vice versa. Efficiency of spray decreased with decrease in voltage of battery and application rate is influenced by walking speed. The sprayer is capable of spraying 250 l/ha in 4. 17 hrs at a walking speed of 0. 7 m/s. This device cannot be operated continuously for more than 2 hrs due to decrease in voltage. It is advisable for extra batteries to be carried along to the farm for large hectare spraying...|$|E
50|$|Chain or <b>washer</b> <b>pumps</b> {{were used}} by the Chinese over 1000 years ago. In the 1980s Reinder van Tijen an {{inventor}} and grass roots activist, {{with the support of}} the Royal Tropical Institute of Amsterdam, created and began instructing various communities around the world how to make a rope pump from simple available parts using PVC pipes and plastic moldings. He began at Burkina Faso in Africa, continued to Tunisia, Thailand and Gambia among others. In Nicaragua, the technology was rapidly disseminated over the whole country and 25% of the rural population in Nicaragua now use rope pumps. It is also used in other parts of Central America with over 25,000 pumps installed to date. In Africa the rope pump is now being used with solar energy.By the end of 2009 more than 4 million people in 20 countries worldwide were using rope pumps for domestic and irrigation water.|$|R
40|$|Smallholder {{irrigation}} expansion {{would significantly}} increase agricultural production, and reduce food insecurity and poverty levels in East Africa. This paper reviews literature on trends, constraints and opportunities of smallholder irrigation in four East African countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Irrigation {{development has been}} slow in these countries, and has been mainly through traditional schemes. Recently, individual irrigation technologies such as small motorized pumps, drip kits, treadle <b>pumps,</b> rope and <b>washer</b> <b>pumps</b> are being promoted. Adoption of these technologies and expansion of smallholder irrigation however face a number of challenges including land tenure issues; {{lack of access to}} appropriate irrigation technologies, improved agricultural inputs, reliable markets, finance and credit services, and research support; poor transport and communication infrastructures; poor irrigation water management; poor extension systems; and the over dependence on national governments, NGOs and donors for support. Despite these challenges, opportunities exist for smallholder irrigation expansion in East Africa. Such opportunities include: high untapped irrigation potential; rainwater harvesting to improve water availability; high commitment of national governments, NGOs and donors to smallholder irrigation expansion; low cost irrigation technologies adaptable to local conditions; traditional schemes rehabilitation; growing urbanization; and increased use of mobile phones {{that can be used to}} disseminate information...|$|R

40|$|Climate change, global warming, and {{the recent}} {{worldwide}} economic crisis have emphasized the need for low carbon emissions while also ensuring economic feasibility. In this paper, the status and wind power potential {{of the city of}} Shahrbabak in Kerman province in Iran was investigated. The technical and economical feasibility of wind turbine installation is presented. The potential of wind power generation was statistically analyzed. The mean wind speed data of three-hour interval long term period from 1997 to 2005 was adopted and analyzed {{in order to determine the}} potential of wind power generation. The numerical values of the dimensionless Weibull shape parameter (k) and Weibull scale parameter (c) were determined. Annual values of "k" ranged from 1. 725 to 1. 930 with a mean value of 1. 504, while annual values of "c" were in the range of 4. 848 - 6. 095 with a mean value of 5. 314 (m/s). With the average wind power density of 100 Â W/m 2, it is found that the city is not an appropriate place for construction of large-scale wind power plants, but is suitable for employment of off-grid electrical and mechanical wind driven systems. An economic evaluation was done in order to show feasibility of installing small wind turbines. It was concluded that it costs 18 cents for 1 Â kWÂ h which is 5 cents more than the market price. Each turbine of 10 Â kW can supply power for icebox, <b>washer,</b> water <b>pump,</b> TV, lighting, electrical fan, charger, and air conditioning units for small houses. In order to utilize wind energy in the region, it is recommended to install small size wind turbines for electricity supply of public and public buildings and private houses.

50|$|Beside high {{mechanical}} energy, higher cleaning {{temperatures are}} one of the most effective methods of improving the cleaning results in a parts washer. In general, a 10 to 15 °F (5 to 8 °C) rise doubles the chemical reaction of the detergent. The increased chemical reaction between the greases and oils and the detergent delivers faster cleaning cycles and cleaner parts. Additionally, all greases and oils exhibit a lower viscosity at higher temperatures. Cleaning solution temperatures of 170 F and above softens or melts most oils and greases causing them to flow like water so they are easily removed resulting in faster cleaning, better results and cleaner parts. Many parts washers are not capable of maintaining this operating temperature due to the lack of amply heating systems. Additionally, careful design is required of the pumping system so it can pull in and deliver cleaning solution at temperatures that approach boiling in the parts <b>washer.</b> All centrifugal <b>pumps</b> require a net positive suction head (NPSHr) in order to be able to pump solution. As the temperature of the solution approaches the NPSHr, the pump stops pumping because the cleaning solution flashes to steam in the pump intake. Careful design of the pump is required to minimize NPSHr and allow pumping of high temperature cleaning solution.|$|R

Bunun yanında su emme değerlerine, arşimed yoğunluklarına, XRD faz analizlerine ve mikro sertlik değerlerine bakılmıştır.   Yapılan bu toz karakterizasyon ve sinterlenmiş numunelerin karakterizasyonu işlemleriyle elde edilen sonuçlar irdelenmiştir. Alumina is {{the most}} widely used oxide ceramic material. Its {{applications}} are widespread, and include spark plugs, tap <b>washers,</b> <b>pump</b> seals, electronic substrates, grinding media, abrasion resistant tiles, cutting tools, bioceramics, (hip-joints), body armour, laboratory ware and wear parts for the textile and paper industries. Very large tonnages are also used in the manufacture of monolithic and brick refractories. It is also used mixed with other materials such as flake graphite where even more severe applications are envisaged, such as pouring spouts and sliding gate valves. Sintering of alumina ceramics at relatively low temperatures to obtain dense and fine grained microstructures with sufficient mechanical properties is one of tecnological investigations. Alumina ceramics are extensively used for structural applications due to alumina’s high melting point, chemical stability, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties such as hardness and wear resistance at elevated temperatures. Restrictions to the applications of alumina arise due to the problems related to low thermal shock resistance and low fracture toughness.   In present day society, boron, an important element of both chemical and biological interest, has a variety of uses. Modern uses of boron-bearing minerals and boron derivatives include heat resistant glass (e. g., pyrex), fiberglass, ceramics, washing products (e. g., detergents and soaps), special alloys, fertilizers, fire retardants, wood treatment agents, insecticides and microbiocides. Colemanite (Ca 2 B 6 O 11. 5 H 2 O), a major source of boron mineral, is semi-soluble calcium-borate hydrate that is found in massive beds with other calcium containing minerals such as calcite and gypsium, and a variety of clays. Colemanite {{is the most}} important calcium containing commercial borate mineral with 5 mol crystal water. Direct use of colemanite is problematic for some industrial applications, e. g., in glasses and ceramics. Moreover, transporting raw colemanite and removing impurities and crystal water is expensive and energy inefficient, as colemanite must then undergo heat treatment before use, or the production process must be carried out under certain conditions. Ideally, the removal of impurities and crystal water at the same time will increase the use of the use of colemanite as amorphous B 2 O 3. Therefore, decrepitation or calcination is receiving increased attention. When raw colemanite is heated up to its decomposition temperature, only colemanite explodes, breaking up into a fine powder. This unique characteristic could be utilized in the upgrading of colemanite. Densification is the outcome of a combination of numerous parameters during processing, which include the powder characteristics, process variables, and sintering kinetics. The use of fine starting powder without agglomeration in the green preforms may improve densification. Regarding the latter, specific additives such as low melting oxides can be used to enhance the sinterability of powder. Additives in small amounts are deliberately and commonly used in ceramic systems to influence densification processes either by reducing sintering temperature or suppressing/promoting grain growth or enhancing mechanical and physical properties. Such additives can promote liquid phase formation at lower sintering temperatures and may considerably increase the rate of sintering. During sintering process, a viscous liquid may promote an additional diffusion mechanism of dissolution, particle rearrangement and capillary forces and finally may improve the densification. A variety of oxides such as B 2 O 3, MgO, TiO 2, SiO 2, MnO 2, Cr 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3 are some of the typical additives that have been commonly used in alumina ceramics. The fundamental explanation of anisotropic grain growth in alumina is not totally understood but includes several proposals: inhomogeneous distribution of the dopant and the presence of a liquid phase on the grain boundary. In this study, initially, colemanite mineral which is found in our country as large scale deposits along worldwide, provided as concentrate from Eti Maden Bigadiç enterprices. The tenor of B 2 O 3  increased from % 33, 08 to % 58, 40 by decrepitation at 4500 C – 2 hours and dry screening processes after cooling down to the room temperature. The characteristic of the obtained colemanite powder determined by experiment studies and powder is processed for incorporating with Al 2 O 3 in order to produce structural ceramics. The experiments for powder characterization are laser particle size distribution, pycnometer density, arnold density, tapped density and chemical analysis before&after decrepitation for the colemanite powder. Afterwards, enriched colemanite powder added to commercial Alcoa™ alumina powder with the ratios of % 1 - 3 - 5. These powder mixtures pelletized by PVA for dry pressing and pressed at 175 MPa to obtain green samples. Green density measurements made for the obtained samples to compare with theorical densities. Pressed samples have been sintered at 13500 C, 14500 C and 15500 C for 2 hours and freely cooled down to room temperature. SEM scanning electron microscope has been used for investigating the microstructure of the sintered samples. Besides, water absorption rates, sintered densities, relative densities, XRD phase analysis and micro hardness values measured in order for investigation of the effects of colemanite added alumina structural ceramics.   Eventually, the examination of powder characterization and sintered samples characterization have been made and commented for the obtained results. After sintering at 13500 C, % 3 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in micro hardness values, % 1 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in sintered density values, accordingly undoped alumina. For the same sintering temperature and soaking time, when the addition of colemanite increases, grain growth is also increases according to the scanning electron microscope images. It has been investigated that, while the colemanite additions inside alumina increase, water absorption rates are also increase at the samples which are sintered at 14500 C and 15500 C. XRD measuring results shows corundum and aluminum borate structures obtained during sintering of the samples.   The results in this thesis have revealed that, the place of use where the porosity and hardness is not important like undoped alumina, 1350 C sintered and % 3 added colemanite to alumina products can be substituted for industrial usage. 200 C decrease in sintering temperature brings many advantages such as; saving up the energy consumption, highly increasing the working life of the sintering furnaces, thermal isolation elements and sintering casettes,  reducing amortisation costs of the sintering furnaces, also brings in an alternative for the investing lower temperature furnaces which are cheaper, substantially reduces maintenance, investment and production costs.
