25|$|It's a rare gift {{which sets}} Irving Berlin apart {{from all other}} {{contemporary}} songwriters. It is a gift which qualifies him, along with Stephen Foster, Walt Whitman, Vachel Lindsay and Carl Sandburg, as a great American minstrel. He has caught and immortalized in his songs what we say, what we think about, and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{book has}} 16 colored plates of {{paintings}} by Abbott Thayer and Richard S. Meryman, including the well known frontispiece [...] "Peacock amid foliage", and the heavily criticised images of wood ducks, blue jays against snow, roseate spoonbills and flamingoes [...] "at dawn or sunset, and the skies they picture". The last 4 colored plates are of caterpillars. Gerald Thayer claims that [...] "The illustrations {{are of particular}} importance, inasmuch as they include <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> {{to be the first}} scientific paintings ever published of animals lighted as they actually are in nature".|$|E
500|$|Read by all ages, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is {{targeted}} at a teenage audience. The book addresses {{a range of}} themes dispassionately. These themes include drugs, friendship, body image, first love, suicide, eating disorders and sexuality. Chbosky appreciates the importance of entertainment in adolescence: [...] "Books, songs, and movies are more than entertainment when we're young. They help all of us discover who we are, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe,</b> and what we hope our life can be." [...] As such, the book contains several cultural references across all mediums: musically the book references The Smiths and Fleetwood Mac, literarily the book references This Side of Paradise, On the Road, To Kill a Mockingbird and theatrically the book references The Rocky Horror Picture Show.|$|E

C. H.

500|$|The Chariot is {{frequently}} called a Christian band, which Scogin agreed {{with in a}} 2005 interview: [...] "We are Christians in a band therefore we are a Christian band. We are not ashamed of our beliefs but we don’t force feed people <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> either." [...] In 2006, he reaffirmed his previous statements and further opined, [...] "When I was growing up, if I liked , I listened to it — and I went to the shows. If I didn't, I didn't. It wasn't like, 'Oh, they don't believe the same thing I do,' [...] People care {{too much about the}} fashion of it all.

500|$|Millard also noted, [...] "Not a lot {{of songs}} mention the {{foundation}} of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> in. The whole idea that Christ was born of a virgin, he died on the cross, he rose again. Just {{the basic principles of}} Christianity". He also commented that [...] "the song kind of takes us there, I say 'kind of' because the first line used to be talking about until a child was born, but it was instantly a Christmas song... but it does, the first verse goes through talking about how we were completely separated until the cross, basically." [...] Regarding the chorus of the song, Millard said [...] "the whole idea of the chorus and the sense that it brings in, with the tons of voices singing, is the fact that there's a day thats going to come when we are going to worship and be as one." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} planned as {{a documentary about}} Thirty Seconds to Mars' creative process while recording their next album, but upon {{the advent of the}} lawsuit, was retooled as a documentary about making that album {{in the face of a}} legal battle that might prevent it from being released. Leto described the film as [...] "a really special, DIY project." [...] He explained, [...] "We all shared a part of our lives that we've never shared on-screen before, a very intimate and personal part of our lives. We take you ... inside the studio, and in our hearts, and in our minds, to share how difficult this point is in our lives—just battling this massive corporation, and fighting for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> in." [...] Upon the film's release, Leto told Rolling Stone that [...] "I hope that artists and audiences watch this film and get a greater understanding of how things work , because understanding is the beginning of change." ...|$|E

5000|$|Of {{the goals}} of the college, Eileen McConomy, {{steering}} committee chairperson of the MMCC Centennial, stated, [...] "although some of the major disciplines available to us may seem archaic to current students, for our era they were relevant ... our education was rigorous.

500|$|Some media sources {{proposed}} that the dress {{could be interpreted as}} anti-vegan. Vegetarian singer Morrissey stated that he felt the dress was acceptable {{as long as it was}} a social or political statement, and not just a [...] "loony idea", pointing out that artist Linder Sterling had previously worn a meat dress in 1982 to protest against what she believed to be the perception of women by men. Ellen DeGeneres presented Gaga with a bikini made of vegetables when the singer appeared on her talk show, and the singer used the platform to respond to the controversy surrounding the dress saying, [...] "... it has many interpretations. For me this evening, if we don't stand up for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> in and if we don't fight for our rights pretty soon, we're going to have as much rights as the meat on our own bones. And, I am not a piece of meat." [...] She explained further that she was also using the dress to highlight her distaste for the US military's [...] "don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy.|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{announced}} the first tuition freeze {{before the state}} had determined Purdue's funding for the next biennium. [...] Amidst questions about the timing, Daniels argued that he didn't need to wait because [...] "it doesn't matter what the General Assembly does. This {{is the right thing}} to do and we are going to do it...the same way families do; the same way some governments do and all businesses do. [...] We are going to adjust our spending to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> is the available and in this case the fair amount of revenue. [...] I know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend, and I just think we've reached the point where we ought to break that pattern." [...] The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.|$|E
500|$|Gaga was {{the most}} {{nominated}} artist at 2010's Video Music Awards with a record thirteen nominations, including two nods for Video of the Year (the first female artist to achieve this feat). She arrived in an Alexander McQueen dress and changed into a Giorgio Armani number before donning her third and final outfit of the evening: a dress, hat, boots, and purse made of raw meat. Gaga wore the meat dress to accept her Video of the Year trophy for [...] "Bad Romance"; as she accepted the award from presenter Cher, she joked, [...] "I never thought I'd be asking Cher to hold my meat purse." [...] Gaga continued to wear the dress after the awards show for press photos and an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Gaga explained her interpretation of the dress to DeGeneres, stating, [...] "If we don’t stand up for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> in and if we don’t fight for our rights pretty soon we’re going {{to have as much}} rights as the meat on our bones." [...] "Now, I love Lady Gaga, but as someone who also loves animals, it was really difficult for me to sit next to Lady Gaga while she was wearing that outfit," [...] DeGeneres, who is vegan, later wrote. [...] "But it did make me ask myself, what's the difference between her outfit and an outfit made of leather?" ...|$|E

40|$|<b>What</b> should <b>we</b> <b>believe,</b> {{and which}} of our beliefs are justified? These questions, both important, are distinct. You {{might look at}} your hands and believe that you have them — but believe this simply on a whim, and not because you see them. Even though you believe what you should, your belief is unjustified. Thus we should {{distinguish}} propositions one should believe from justified beliefs. Additionally, we should distinguish beliefs from withholdings of belief. We should sometimes withhold, just as we should sometimes believe; and withholdings are sometimes justified, just as beliefs are sometimes justified.
