5|$|After his injury-hit Caribbean sojourn, Davidson had the 1955–56 season, {{which was}} purely domestic, to force his <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{national}} {{team for the}} 1956 tour of England. Johnston had also retired, leaving an extra vacancy for a pace bowler.|$|E
5|$|Rising {{through the}} junior ranks, Karthik made his {{first-class}} debut in late-2002 for Tamil Nadu as a 17-year-old, and was dropped {{in his first}} season despite his healthy run-scoring because of his problematic glovework. He fought his <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> team and after playing for India at the 2004 Under-19 World Cup, made his ODI and Test cricket debut in late 2004.|$|E
5|$|Knowing {{that his}} {{reputation}} {{was at stake}} following the much publicised Tora! Tora! Tora! debacle, Kurosawa moved quickly to a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, {{it has been suggested}} that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> business.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool {{tried to}} find a <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> match. With 16 minutes left, Whelan was brought down in the Juventus penalty area by Massimo Bonini, but the referee decided {{that it was not a}} foul. Liverpool created more chances near the end of the match; Tacconi saved a shot from Whelan. Wark and Steve Nicol saw headers go wide of the Juventus goal. No further goals were scored and at {{full-time}} the score was 1–0 to Juventus, who had won their first European Cup and became the first club to win all three seasonal UEFA competitions.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand {{campaign}} {{was a chance}} for the younger players to establish themselves in the national team. Meckiff took 2/46 and 3/25 in his first-class debut for Australia, an innings win over Otago. He played in the first match against New Zealand, but after taking 0/41 in a drawn encounter, he was dropped for the second game. The paceman forced his <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> team for the third match after claiming 4/12 and 5/48 to help to set up an innings victory over Auckland.|$|E
5|$|After {{appearing}} in a November 2006 friendly match against Greece, Diarra was {{absent from the}} national team for nearly two years, partly due to his struggle for playing time in Lyon. As a result, he missed UEFA Euro 2008, although he {{was named to the}} competition's preliminary squad. After regaining his form at Bordeaux, Diarra began making his <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> team and participated in seven 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches. He was later selected to participate in his second consecutive FIFA World Cup. France endured a disastrous campaign as the players went on strike in response to its disagreement over the expulsion of striker Nicolas Anelka from the team. In the team's final group stage match against hosts South Africa, with several veteran players missing from the squad, Diarra was rewarded with the captaincy {{for the first time in}} his international career and led the team to a 2–1 loss, which resulted in its elimination from the competition.|$|E

5|$|Higginbotham {{targeted}} {{to return from}} his knee injury by October 2011. He marked his return from his knee injury by scoring the only goal in a 1–0 reserve team win over Sheffield United on 11 October 2011. However, after failing to force his <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first team, Higginbotham joined Championship team Nottingham Forest on loan {{until the end of}} the season on 31 January 2012. Upon signing for Forest, Higginbotham admitted that he was unsure of his future at Stoke. He was backed by Thomas Sørensen to make a return to Stoke's first team. On 10 March 2012, Higginbotham scored his first goal for a year when he scored the second for Forest in a 3–1 home win over Millwall. His loan spell with Forest was ended early in April 2012 due to injury.|$|E
5|$|He joined fellow Championship side Stoke City for a £225,000 fee in August 2006. He {{was made}} captain when Michael Duberry left in January 2007 and Stoke {{went on to}} {{narrowly}} miss out on a play-off place. With Stoke not being promoted Higginbotham again decided to hand in a transfer request to help force through a move to Sunderland. He spent one season at the Stadium of Light before returning to Stoke in 2008. He became a vital member of Tony Pulis' squad as Stoke established themselves in the Premier League. He scored the winning goal in the FA Cup quarter-final against West Ham United but missed out on both the semi-final and the final due to a knee injury. After his recovery he struggled to force his <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> side and spent time out on loan to Nottingham Forest and Ipswich Town before joining Sheffield United on a free transfer in January 2013. After eight months at Bramall Lane, he left to join Conference Premier side Chester before ending his career with a short spell at Altrincham.|$|E
5|$|On lap 21, Rosberg made a {{pit stop}} for the {{intermediate}} tyres, leaving only Ricciardo and Hamilton {{at the front of}} the field on the full wet tyres. Ricciardo made the switch on lap 24, but Hamilton stayed out, opting to remain on the wet tyre until the track dried out enough to go straight to slicks. In the meantime, Verstappen had fought his <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> top ten, after having started 21st. In the subsequent laps, Ricciardo was able to reduce the gap to Hamilton in the lead, edging as close as half a second by lap 28. Behind the leading pair, Rosberg was third ahead of Pérez and Vettel. The pivotal moment of the race followed on lap 31, when Hamilton changed to slick tyres. When Ricciardo followed suit a lap later, his pit crew were not ready for him and had the wrong tyres, resulting in a long stop, handing the lead to Hamilton, who stayed narrowly ahead of him. Sergio Pérez was another driver who benefited during the second round of stops, emerging in third. Rosberg was left in sixth after both Vettel and Alonso also came out ahead of him after the switch to dry tyres. On lap 34, Ricciardo made an attempt to repass Hamilton on track, but Hamilton successfully defended his position.|$|E

5000|$|Paul Menard {{brought out}} the third caution on lap 135 after blowing an engine on the backstretch. Describing the incident, Menard said, “Something with the motor. I {{had a really good}} car. It’s too bad, awesome car; we had a pit stop problem and went to the back, but drove our <b>way</b> <b>back</b> up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> top 15 or so.” ...|$|R

5|$|Upon the {{resumption}} of competitive cricket, Tallon's chances of selection had improved due to the fates of his pre-war wicket-keeping rivals. Oldfield had long retired. Barnett, a captain in the army, had been a prisoner of the Japanese at Changi in Singapore for four years. Emaciated, he slowly recovered his fitness and forced his <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Victorian team, but was almost 40 and intended to retire in the near future. Walker had joined the Royal Australian Air Force as a gunner and {{was killed in a}} duel with Nazi fighter pilots over Soltau in Germany. This left Tallon as the front-runner, but there was a possibility that the selectors would opt for generational change and install a more youthful keeper like Gil Langley or Ron Saggers with an eye to the future. With the pressure of selection on his head, Tallon made eight dismissals in the first match after {{the resumption}} of cricket, against New South Wales in Brisbane, including three stumpings and three catches from the leg spin of Colin McCool, a future Test team-mate. The performance was to herald the start of a prolific bowler-wicket-keeper partnership. Tallon then scored 74 to guide Queensland to the target of 270 with four wickets in hand. Queensland won two of their seven matches and Tallon scored 305 runs at 30.50 and completed 27 dismissals to finally gain national selection.|$|E
5|$|Following the Invincibles tour, Lindwall {{found the}} pitches in South Africa in 1949–50 less to his liking and was dropped {{for the final}} Test. He {{returned}} in the following season against England, regularly taking wickets in another series win. The following year, he played a major part in stopping the much vaunted West Indian batsmen, but he was criticised for his prolific use of short-pitched bowling. In 1952, Lindwall played in the Lancashire League in England, where he developed his inswinger. He returned to 1953 with an aging national team in decline and despite {{the loss of the}} Ashes, commentators felt that Lindwall was at his zenith in terms of his bowling craft. Upon returning to Australia, Lindwall moved north to Queensland due to work commitments and then suffered a season of injury and illness in 1954–55 which saw him perform poorly as England retained the Ashes easily. After a strong performance in the Caribbean, Lindwall missed half of the 1956 English tour with injury and was otherwise ineffective as Australia lost its third consecutive Ashes series. During the return trip to Australia, Lindwall captained Australia for the only time in a Test match against India in Mumbai, after injuries forced out regular captain Ian Johnson. Following the repeated defeats to England, the Australian selectors instituted generational change and gambled on a radical youth policy which saw Lindwall dropped for the 1957–58 tour of South Africa. Lindwall forced his <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Test team at 37 years of age in the following season, breaking Clarrie Grimmett's Australian Test record of 216 wickets. He retired from Test cricket after the tour of the Indian subcontinent in the following season, with a total of 228 Test wickets. In retirement, Lindwall mentored Test world-record holder Dennis Lillee and also served as a national selector.|$|E

50|$|During half time, Charlton's manager Jimmy Trotter {{decided to}} move left winger Johnny Summers to centre forward, and asked his players to feed the ball to Summers, seeing him as their likeliest <b>way</b> to get <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> match. Summers also {{replaced}} his old boots, which {{were on the verge}} of falling apart, with some new ones.|$|R
50|$|Unwilling {{to abandon}} the hill, Commander Carlos Robacio on Sapper Hill was {{planning}} to counter-attack and drive back the Guardsmen. Only the personal intervention of Colonel Félix Aguiar, the 10th Brigade Chief of Staff, brought the fighting to an end. The 5th Marines worked their <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Stanley, leaving <b>the</b> 2nd Platoon of Sub-Lieutenant Marcelo Davis and 3rd Platoon of Sub-Lieutenant Alejandro Koch of M Company to cover the retreat.|$|R
25|$|Alderman {{was unable}} to force his <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Australian side over the 1983-84 summer. Hoever 30 first class wickets at 25.26 saw him picked for the West Indies.|$|E
25|$|Bright {{found his}} <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Victorian {{team for the}} 1972–73 season. His first class debut was against NSW. He took 2–32 and 1–64 and made 67 as a nightwatchman.|$|E
25|$|Ritchie {{was unable}} to force his <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Australian team. He broke a long century drought in January 1988 with 100 against New South Wales. That summer he also {{undertook}} a promotional walk while injured.|$|E
60|$|Ours is a noble house, and {{stretches}} a long <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> antiquity. <b>The</b> earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of {{was a friend}} of the family by the name of Higgins. This was in the eleventh century, when our people were living in Aberdeen, county of Cork, England. Why it is that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name (except when one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert foolishness), instead of Higgins, is a mystery which none of us has ever felt much desire to stir. It is a kind of vague, pretty romance, and we leave it alone. All the old families do that way.|$|R

5000|$|Although he has {{appeared}} in many stories, {{little is known about}} the Wretch's history or powers.

25|$|Optimism {{was still}} abound about the {{on the field}} product heading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> season, but an 0–5 start quickly brought the team back down to Earth.

50|$|However, the royalists, {{who were}} expecting a general uprising, {{did not receive}} the support they were expecting. On the nearby mountain, Republican troops {{remained}} and at any moment Republican reinforcements were expected to arrive from Chaves. Thus, the royalists abandoned Vinhais, {{and headed for the}} border. The republican garrison from Vinhais had meanwhile retreated towards Chaves, where they had met the troops coming in their support. When they arrived in Vinhais the royalists had already left. Crossing the rugged mountains north of Vinhais, and reduced to about 600 men after desertions, the rebels made their <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Spain. <b>The</b> companies that still remained formed nine groups, some staying near Xinzo de Limia and Ourense, but the bulk of the column concentrated nearer the border in Verín.|$|R
