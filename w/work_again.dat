In a 2017 interview he stated that if he did interior <b>work</b> <b>again,</b> it would more likely be on a creator-owned project, like Monkeyman And O'Brien.|$|E
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata on 16 June 1715. The performance material for Weimar is lost. Bach performed the <b>work</b> <b>again</b> as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. Extant performance material was prepared by his assistant Johann Christian Köpping. The first possible revival is the Trinity Sunday of Bach's first year in office, 4 June 1724, also the conclusion of his first year and first Leipzig cantata cycle, because he had assumed the office on the first Sunday after Trinity the year before. Bach made presumably minor changes.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{filled in}} for P. G. Wodehouse at Vanity Fair at the {{beginning}} of 1916, reviewing theatre in New York. This inspired staff at the Tribune magazine to creativity for articles (such as arranging for the producers of The Thirteenth Chair to cast Benchley as a corpse), but the situation at the magazine deteriorated as the pacifist Benchley became unhappy with the Tribunes position on World War I, and the Tribune editors were unhappy with the evolving tone and irreverence of the magazine. In 1917, the Tribune shut down the magazine, and Benchley was out of <b>work</b> <b>again.</b> When a rumored opening for an editorial position at Vanity Fair fell through, Benchley decided he would continue freelancing, having {{made a name for himself}} at the magazine.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{with the}} end of the two mathematicians' cryptologic work at the close of World War II, the Cipher Bureau ceased to exist. From nearly its {{inception}} in 1931 until war's end in 1945, the Bureau, sometimes incorporated into aggregates under cryptonyms (PC Bruno and Cadix), had been essentially the same agency, with most of the same core personnel, carrying out much the same tasks; now it was extinguished. Neither Rejewski nor Zygalski would <b>work</b> <b>again</b> as cryptologists. In late 1946 Rejewski returned to his family in a devastated and politically altered Poland, to live there another 33 years until his death in February 1980. Zygalski would remain in England until his death in August 1978.|$|E
5|$|Llywelyn {{responded by}} {{intervening}} {{with his own}} forces but outright conflict was prevented by the diplomatic efforts of Henry III. De Clare continued building work and in 1270 Llywelyn responded by attacking and burning the site, probably destroying the temporary defences and stores. De Clare began <b>work</b> <b>again</b> the following year, raising tensions and prompting Henry to send two bishops, Roger de Meyland and Godfrey Giffard, {{to take control of}} the site and arbitrate a solution to the dispute.|$|E
5|$|She was {{sensible}} how arduous a task it is {{to produce}} a truly excellent novel; and she roused her faculties to grapple with it. All her other works were produced with a rapidity, that did not give her powers time fully to expand. But this was written slowly and with mature consideration. She began it in several forms, which she successively rejected, after they were considerably advanced. She wrote {{many parts of the}} <b>work</b> <b>again</b> and again, and, when she had finished what she intended for the first part, she felt herself more urgently stimulated to revise and improve what she had written, than to proceed, with constancy of application, in the parts that were to follow.|$|E

5|$|The Seminoles {{returned}} Tech's post-score kick {{to their}} 15-yard line, where Florida State's offense began <b>work</b> <b>again,</b> hoping {{to regain the}} lead for State. Weinke completed a seven-yard pass to Warrick, then was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense. Weinke overcame the loss on the next play with a 19-yard first-down pass. State continued to advance the ball with short passes, as Weinke completed a five-yard throw. Chaney gained three yards on a rush to the right as the final seconds {{of the third quarter}} ticked off the clock, setting up an important third-down play. With one quarter remaining, Virginia Tech led Florida State, 2928.|$|E
5|$|The cantata falls {{relatively}} {{early in}} Bach's chronology of cantata compositions. It was possibly composed for 24 February 1715, but more likely {{a year or}} even two earlier. Bach structured the work in five movements, a sinfonia, a recitative, a recitative with chorale, an aria and a closing chorale. He scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-partchoir only in the chorale, and an unusual Baroque instrumental ensemble of four violas, cello, bassoon and basso continuo. When he performed the <b>work</b> <b>again</b> as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, he added two recorders to double viola I and II an octave higher.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} music more accessible, the {{composer}} and organist Max Beckschäfer arranged {{the work for}} voice, chorus and organ in 1985. The organ version was premiered in the Marktkirche in Wiesbaden, where Reger had played the organ himself when he studied there in the 1890s. Gabriel Dessauer conducted a project choir, later known as the Reger-Chor. Beckschäfer was the organist, Ulrike Buchs the vocal soloist. The choir, expanded into the Reger-Chor-International by singers from Belgium, performed the <b>work</b> <b>again</b> in 2001 with organist Ignace Michiels from St. Salvator's Cathedral, Bruges, both there and in St. Bonifatius, Wiesbaden (recorded live). They performed it a third time in 2010 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Reger-Chor.|$|E

5|$|Cross-lingual {{studies were}} {{performed}} at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek (the {{only one with}} a non-Roman alphabet), Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it {{was replaced by a}} simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at <b>work</b> <b>again,</b> it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.|$|E
5|$|The first project {{proposed}} {{and worked on}} was a period film to be called Dora-Heita, but when this was deemed too expensive, attention shifted to Dodesukaden, an adaptation of yet another Shūgorō Yamamoto <b>work,</b> <b>again</b> about the poor and destitute. The film was shot quickly (by Kurosawa's standards) in about nine weeks, with Kurosawa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget. For his first work in color, the dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier pictures were set aside, with the artist focusing {{on the creation of}} a bold, almost surreal palette of primary colors, in order to reveal the toxic environment in which the characters live. It was released in Japan in October 1970, but though a minor critical success, it was greeted with audience indifference. The picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four Knights to dissolve. Initial reception abroad was somewhat more favorable, but Dodesukaden has since been typically considered an interesting experiment not comparable to the director's best work.|$|E
5|$|After Cage {{finished}} {{teaching at}} the New School {{in the summer of}} 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street that she used as a studio and living space. Supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society, Ono allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961, with people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending, and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be Stepped On, which was a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional <b>work</b> <b>again</b> at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.|$|E
