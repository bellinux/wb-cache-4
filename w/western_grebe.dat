25|$|There are {{two types}} of animal {{locomotion}} on water, determined by the ratio of the animal's weight to the water's surface tension: those whose weight is supported by the surface tension at rest, and can therefore easily remain on the water's surface without much exertion, and those whose weight is not supported by the water's surface tension at rest, and must therefore exert additional motion in a direction parallel to the water's surface in order to remain above it. A creature such as the basilisk lizard, often dubbed the 'Jesus lizard', has a weight which is larger than the surface tension can support, and is widely known for running across the surface of water.

50|$|Government Island is a 1760 acre {{island in}} the Columbia River north of Portland, in Multnomah County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. Though Interstate 205 passes over it on the Glenn L. Jackson Memorial Bridge, access to the island is only by boat. There is a city {{controlled}} locked gate in the 205 fence. Government Island {{is known for its}} great blue heron colony and the Government Island State Recreation Area (primitive camping, beaches). The interior of the island, off limits to the public, contains a seasonal cattle ranch and protected natural areas, including Jewit Lake. There are also remnants of old pioneer buildings on the island. Camping is permitted below the vegetation line around the perimeter, and picnic tables and restrooms can be found in these areas as well. Many threatened or endangered wildlife species live on the island, including red-legged frog, pileated woodpecker, little willow flycatcher, olive-sided flycatcher, <b>western</b> meadowlark, horned <b>grebe,</b> red-necked grebe, bufflehead, purple martin, and possibly the endangered Columbian white-tailed deer.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1938 A {{water bird}} census was taken at three points on Upper Klamath Lake at weekly {{intervals}} extending {{over a period}} from September 9, 1936 to May 29, 1937. A total of 24, 319 birds was recorded in field records and included thirty-two species. Totals of birds by weekly field trips show the following maxima: October 3 produced by pintail, December 24 produced by olden eye, January 16 by ruddy and olden eye, March 6 by ruddy, and May 1 by greater scaup together with <b>western</b> and eared <b>grebe.</b> During the winter months while the lake is frozen over, the birds are concentrated in open water near hot springs or where a strong water current is present. They consist of bottom feeding or diving birds during this time; principally meranser, bufflehead, pied-billed grebe, ruddy, golden eye, coot and greater scaup. The fall migrants consisted largely of widgeons while the spring influx was composed mostly of greater scaup, <b>western</b> an eared <b>grebe.</b> The most abundant species were the ruddy, golden eye, widgeon, coot and greater scaup, constituting 23 %, 21 %, 16 %, 11 % and 10 % respectively {{of the total number}} of all birds observed. In frequency of appearance in field records, the greater scaup and coot were recorded on more than 80 % of the field trips while the ruddy and golden eye were present in from 70 % to 80 % of the trips. Availability of feeding areas appears to be the principal factor causing fluctuation in number during the winter season. The temperature and precipitation conditions during the period of the census were not average. The dry tall characteristic of this region prevailed extremely late. The first precipitation of any consequence and in the form of snow occurred in late December. An extremely cold period during January and February followed this dry fall season. The spring season was later than usual, the temperature falling to moderate until late March. These variations from the average weather conditions produced three effects: first, a delayed fall migration; second, limited feeding area for the wintering birds due to restricted areas of open water while the lake surface was frozen; third, a delayed spring migration which was concentrated an of short duration...|$|R
40|$|Grebes {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} diving birds having bills that vary from short and rather blunt tipped to long and acutely pointed, with bare lores and head feathers not extending to the linear or oval nostrils. There are 11 functional primaries and 17 – 22 secondaries, the inner secondaries {{longer than the}} primaries. Molting of the primaries is simultaneous; the wings are not used for underwater propulsion, which {{is provided by the}} feet. The rectrices are soft, rudimentary, and hidden. The body feathers are small, water-resistant, and shiny. Aftershafts and adult down feathers are present. The legs are set extremely far back on the body, making walking difficult and takeoff from land impossible. The tarsus is laterally compressed, with a scutellated scale pattern, and is serrated behind. The hallux is long and elevated; it and the front toes are separately lobed, and the claws are flat and nail-like. The wings are somewhat rounded to rather elongated, and most species have a white patch or 2 ̆ 2 speculum 2 ̆ 2 on the secondaries. The body is short, with a variably long neck and silvery white plumage on the underparts. Facial tufts or crests are usually present in both sexes during the breeding season. All species are monogamous and lack apparent sexual dimorphism; most have distinct breeding and wintering plumages. Their nests are built of floating and emergent vegetation anchored in shallow water. The eggs (3 to 9) are unspotted whitish and are elliptical to nearly fusiform. The young are covered with dense down and typically have complex color patterning. As with loons, the young have extended fledging periods and often are carried about on their parents 2 ̆ 7 backs. The family has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, and the species are mostly migratory, usually wintering on salt water and breeding colonially or solitarily in shallow and reedy freshwater habitats. Their foods include fish, aquatic invertebrates, and some plant materials; for uncertain reasons feathers are also often swallowed. There are at least twenty species, six (or seven) of which breed in part or entirely in North America, mainly in temperate-latitude marshes.

50|$|The <b>western</b> <b>grebe</b> has a {{straight}} bill {{with a dull}} green-yellow color {{as opposed to the}} Clark’s grebe, which has a slightly upturned, bright orange-yellow bill. In both species the male has a longer and deeper bill than that of the female, making it a distinguishing feature. All species of grebes display the pattern of lobed feet. A tough skin surrounds each toe separately, providing more surface area for effective swimming. This form increases the power of propulsion per stroke and reduces drag when the bird is recovering. Skeletal measurements taken from both species, when averaged together, revealed {{that for the most part}} the <b>western</b> <b>grebe</b> is larger than the Clark’s grebe.
