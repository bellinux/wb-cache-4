[...] In 1836, Edward Skae relocated his general store approximately 800 m east to the southeast corner of this intersection; as his store became a popular meeting place (probably because it also served as the Post Office), the corner and the growing settlement that surrounded it, were known as Skae's Corners.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} and descriptive study {{was to understand the}} experience of disability from the perspective of Aboriginal adults and the meaning they give to the importance of sport in their communities. The experiences of 3 Aboriginal adults with physical disabilities were captured using the phenomenological methods of one-on-one interviews, artifact collection, and field notes. The co-participants were provided the opportunity for collaboration at each research stage, from clarifying the purpose to finalizing and interpreting the emerging themes, in an effort to demonstrate sensitivity and respect for their Aboriginal culture, beliefs, and community. The conceptual framework utilized was the minority group model, which provided a framework for interpreting the sport experiences of the co-participants. The thematic analysis and interpretation of the findings facilitated by the co-participants revealed four themes: (a) <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> first, (b) not being a priority, (c) pride through accomplishments, and (d) the gift to grab others. <b>We</b> <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> First expressed the co-participants’ feelings that persons with disabilities were somewhat invisible in their rural Aboriginal communities as they did not venture far from their homes. The second theme, Not Being a Priority, recognized the lack of sport opportunities for people with disabilities. However, according to the third theme, Pride through Accomplishments, for these co-participants it was their involvement in their Aboriginal community and sport that gave them a sense of self-worth and dignity. The final theme, The Gift to Grab Others, empowered them to share the richness of their experiences with other Aboriginal people with disabilities. The results reflected the need to educate and build awareness of sport opportunities for Aboriginal people with disabilities. Furthermore, the co-participants expressed the need to encourage and support people with disabilities to get out of their homes and become active, visible members of society...|$|E
40|$|O propósito deste estudo é interpretar as mensagens auto-reflexivas de filhos adultos de alcoolistas (FAA) por meio de uma análise semiótico-fenomenológica. O ser humano tem múltiplas percepções a respeito da miríade de fenômenos que ocorrem em relacionamentos consigo mesmo e com os outros. Confere-se a validade de tais percepções deslocando-se de um nível de percepção para outro, podendo então contemplar a percepção anterior. Em outras palavras, é preciso sair da floresta para poder observar as árvores. Continuando a metáfora, o FAA encontra dificuldade em sair da floresta. Para este estudo foram entrevistados seis FAAs. O procedimento de análise dos dados inicia com (1) a leitura da descrição das reações dos participantes da pesquisa a um excerto da biografia de um outro FAA, seguindo-se (2) a descoberta das mensagens auto-reflexivas dos participantes e (3) a interpretação de perspectivas diretas, metaperspectivas e meta-metaperspectivas das mensagens auto-reflexivas. Os resultados da análise corroboram o trabalho de psicólogos clínicos que têm identificado o mundo-vivido do FAA como um sistema fechado. De um ponto de vista pragmático, os resultados sugerem que as mensagens auto-reflexivas podem ser a chave que fecha e abre o sistema interacional defeituoso do FAA. Interpreting the ACoA’s (adult {{children}} of the alcoholic) levels of perceptions through their self-reflexive messages is the primary objective of this study. Humans have multiple perceptions regarding the myriad of issues that occur in relationships with self and other. In order to check the validity of those perceptions, the individual must move {{to a higher level}} of perception in order to look back at the previous perception. In other words, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the forest in order to see the trees. To continue the metaphor, the ACoA has difficulty leaving the forest. Six ACoAs were interviewed. The {{purpose of this study is}} to interpret the self-reflexive messages of ACoAs through a semiotic-phenomenological analysis. This process begins by (1) reading the description of the ACoA’s reactions to an excerpt from another ACoA’s autobiography, (2) uncovering the self-reflexive messages of the ACoAs, and (3) interpreting the direct, meta, and meta-perspectives of the self-reflexive messages. The results of the analysis support the work of clinical psychologists who have identified the lived-world of the ACoA as a closed system. From a pragmatic point of view, the results suggest that self-reflexive messages may be the key that close and open the dysfunctional interactional system of the ACoA...|$|E
