25|$|Despite {{overseeing}} the club's relegation into the Conference Premier, Clarke remained in charge. An indifferent {{start to the}} season, with Rovers picking up just one point from their first three games and third defeat in seven in their away fixture with part-timers Braintree Town, saw calls for the manager to be sacked. What followed <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> run of just two defeats in 39 league games as Rovers came agonisingly close to making an immediate return to the Football League, finishing as runner-ups to Barnet. They were promoted back to League Two after winning the Playoff Final against Grimsby Town on Penalties.|$|E

25|$|This <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> feat, {{considering}} that Australia's bowling attack {{was almost as}} good as its batting. Their bowling-lineup boasted of some stellar names: Keith Miller, who was a genuine allrounder capable of giving very good performances with both bat and the ball, Ray Lindwall, who was said to possess absolute mastery of bowling in any condition, an who was bowling accurately, with penetrative and attacking bowling, and Ian Johnson and Bill Johnston, who were both equally vital cogs in the team. This particular innings of Hazare's was said to have enhanced India's reputation as well as his. In the process, Hazare emulated Bradman, who did the same in the previous test.|$|E
25|$|Before 1941, the {{shipyard}} {{at what is}} now Pier 70 produced some of its best ships. By the late 1930s, though, with war looming, Bethlehem began to modernize and upgrade the Potrero Yard. A number of new buildings were constructed, {{and by the time}} World War II began Potrero {{was one of the most}} productive shipyards in the country. During World War Two, the government once again took over the Potrero Point yards for the war effort. During the war, up to 4,000 men and women were employed, working three shifts a day. Finding skilled workers during wartime was a huge challenge, and much was done to train new workers, and to organize shipbuilding so that less skilled people could do what the highly skilled people had done before. At the height of the war effort productivity was tremendous: the destroyer escort Fieberling was built in 24 days, start to finish. Though Liberty ships and other simpler ships could be built faster, to build a modern warship in that amount of time <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> achievement. During the war, Bethlehem's Potrero yard produced 72 vessels (52 for combat) and repaired over 2,500 navy and commercial craft.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the State Soccer Council was renamed as the Tasmanian Soccer Association. This period saw the migrant {{communities}} grow to a size where their traditional rivalries from Europe began {{to influence the}} game in Australia, including in Tasmania. Although the new wave brought a new style and flair to the game, it also sometimes tarnished its reputation as those rivalries descended into occasional violence. The older clubs struggled for success, but the 1960s saw Olympia and Launceston Juventus play off against {{each other for the}} Tasmanian football championship on four occasions, Olympia getting the best of their northern opponents on three of them. The early 1970s saw the rise of Hobart Juventus, who won four state titles between 1969 and 1973, including a staggering 13–5 aggregate score over Riverside Olympic in the two-legged final of 1973. The 1976 State Championship play-off between Rapid and Launceston Juventus proved to be an all-time classic. The first leg finished 3-2 in favour of Rapid, but a 4-3 home win for Launceston Juventus saw the two-legged final finish 6-6 on aggregate, and go to penalties. The ensuing penalty shootout <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> 12-11 sudden death win to Rapid. This era also saw the rise of Glenorchy Croatia, who were crowned state champions three times in the 1970s.|$|E

[...] "That <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> scene," [...] reflected Lincoln. [...] "We were so lucky to get such cracking actors.

Modine said, [...] "I was flabbergasted because I hadn't auditioned for Birdy. I had never imagined playing the part of Birdy. So, I had to really go through an extraordinary transformation in my mind of trying to bring this remarkable character to life.

500|$|Club Harlem was {{outfitted}} with two lounges and a main showroom seating over 900. A cocktail lounge had room for 400 guests with continuous entertainment available. The club {{was equipped with}} seven bars; the front bar alone accommodated nearly 100 people. Guitarist Pat Martino recalled in his biography: [...] "In the front room at Club Harlem you had two stages for two different groups. Willis Jackson would do forty minutes, and then Chris Columbo's band would do forty minutes. They'd split sets all night long. And in the large back room you had singers like Sammy Davis with an orchestra. That <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> place". Weekends at Club Harlem started on Friday night with the two bands alternating sets; the music kept going until Monday morning.|$|E

The song was rumored to be a leftover cut from her Teenage Dream recording sessions, and fans speculated that the track might be included in an as-yet-unconfirmed re-release of the LP. This re-release was confirmed in January 2012, when Perry announced through her official website that the album would contain all twelve songs from the original album, plus three new songs and a remix, and would be released on March 26, 2012. Perry's press release stated: [...] "This is the complete story of Teenage Dream.

500|$|In the 1970s, Laucke {{moved to}} New York City to further his career. He {{was asked by}} Valdès-Blain if he would mind sharing his one-room {{apartment}} with flamenco guitarist Paco deLucía. Laucke taught deLucía music by Bach and Villa-Lobos. In return, deLucía showed Laucke some of the secrets of his art of flamenco, an oral tradition handed down through generations, [...] "their secrets and knowledge jealously guarded". Although Laucke had played flamenco for his own pleasure {{since he was a}} child, he had never felt comfortable playing it in public. De Lucía's influence helped change this: [...] "This meeting changed my life," [...] Laucke [...] declared, [...] "he taught me flamenco works which were not written anywhere and to which no other guitarist had access. So for me to be taught all these techniques by a guitarist of Paco's caliber <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> stroke of luck". (English translation) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference.

The kerbs here are very slippery and once you go over one there is not much you can do. I was lucky to keep going and I was able to chase Michael. But the car got better and better." [...] The driver added that he wanted to review his overtaking manoeuvre to see if Michael Schumacher performed an illegal move. Schumacher said that despite improvements to his car, he was unable to match Häkkinen's overall pace. He added that he experienced no problems running off-line to cool his tyres, and was happy to run behind backmarkers for straight-line speed assistance during the race's closing stages.|$|E

On November 6, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that Jared Leto would be returning to acting to play the role which Bernal was previously in talks to play. In January 2014, Jared Leto has admitted that he was sent a script 15 years ago but never read it. When Leto was asked about his role, he said: [...] "This was a really special movie. I think it was the role of a lifetime. It's {{one of the best things}} I've ever done." [...] He also said that he tried to stay focused on the role because he knew it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> opportunity. On November 14, Dallas Roberts and Steve Zahn joined the film; Roberts would play David Wayne, Ron's defense attorney, while Zahn would play a Dallas police officer who is sympathetic to Ron. On November 26, Griffin Dunne, Denis O'Hare, and Bradford Cox joined the cast when the shooting was underway in New Orleans.|$|E

500|$|The cast {{found out}} {{a couple of weeks before}} filming the episode that parts would be in animation. The {{animated}} portions were produced with Zoic Studios. Over an eight-week period, the studio defined the primary Fringe characters into their animated counterparts, and used footage of the actors and fight scene choreography to provide motion for the characters. The animators used a stand-in for Nimoy so that he did not have to fly to Vancouver from Los Angeles. The studio aimed to achieve a mixed look between stylized and authenticity to allow them to focus on animating the characters' emotions. The work also include recreating some of the settings already established from Fringe, such as Bell's office. Other parts of Olivia's dreamscape were handpainted scenes, projected onto 3D plates and used within the animation software. Andrew Orloff, Zoic's creative director commented, [...] "This project was one of the most intensive and rewarding we have worked on in Zoic’s history. It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> undertaking, from the amazing writers at Fringe to the animation production that is both steeped in tradition and groundbreaking." [...] The episode ultimately contained sixteen minutes of animation; executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that the amount of man hours placed into the episode was [...] "by far" [...] the longest the series has had to date. The writers have cited Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Waltz with Bashir as influences for the episode.|$|E
500|$|Preparing for {{the episode}} was {{physically}} difficult {{for some of}} the cast members, most of whom had little experience singing and dancing. They spent three months in voice training. Two choreographers worked with Whedon and the cast on dance sequences. Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn), who is trained in ballet, requested a dance sequence in lieu of a significant singing part, and Alyson Hannigan (Willow), according to Whedon, begged him not to give her many lines. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) told the BBC that [...] "It took something like 19hours of singing and 17hours of dancing in between shooting four other episodes" [...] and she was so anxious about singing that she [...] "hated every moment of it". When Whedon suggested using a voice double for her, however, she said, [...] "I basically started to cry and said, 'You mean someone else is going to do my big emotional turning point for the season?' In the end, it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> experience and I'm glad I did it. And I never want to do it again." [...] Davies was so impressed with Hinton Battle's performance on Broadway in The Wiz that he asked Battle to play the demon Sweet. Battle, a three-time Tony-winner, wore prosthetic make-up {{for the first time to}} give him a demonic red face. Sweet was portrayed as [...] "slick", smooth and stylish; in contrast, most demons on the series were designed to be crude and ugly. The set for The Bronze was used frequently throughout the series, but stairs were built from the stage to maximize floor space for Battle's dance.|$|E
500|$|According to Betty Cortina of People magazine, Dreaming of You {{marked a}} shift that abrogated the singer being marketed {{as part of}} her band and billed Selena as an American solo artist in [...] "the most {{fundamental}} way for her". From 1989, Selena's brother A.B. Quintanilla became Selena's principal music producer and songwriter, and remained so throughout her career. Because Quintanilla III was working on the singer's follow-up recording to Amor Prohibido (1994), he could not produce the crossover album. He was asked to meet with several producers in New York and choose one who would best [...] "fit with Selena's style". Dreaming of You was the first album Selena's family did not produce. They had decided to step down before the recording sessions and allow professional pop producers to work with her. Quintanilla III and Selena flew to Nashville, Tennessee, and met with Keith Thomas, who had prepared the instrumental parts for the song called [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] but had not yet completed the vocal parts, so he sang it for them. Selena and Quintanilla III immediately liked it; Quintanilla III said he wanted Selena to include it on her album. [...] Recording sessions began in December 1994 at The Bennett House in Franklin, Tennessee; Selena had to return later when Thomas could provide additional vocals. Selena and her husband Chris Pérez arrived at the studio on March 24, 1995 to finish recording the song. In a 2002 interview, Pérez said Thomas provided Selena with a cassette of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] and said she had the song [...] "on loop" [...] and she [...] "must have heard it a hundred times". He believed it had an [...] "effect on her" [...] because [...] "she went into the studio the next day to actually do the recording and just was nailing things left and right and [...] was letting her do her thing and I mean it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> thing to watch".|$|E
