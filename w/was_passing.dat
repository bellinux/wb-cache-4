5|$|On 18 June 1925, {{electric}} locomotive No. 4 {{collided with a}} passenger train at Baker Street station when a signal was changed from green to red just as the locomotive <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> it. Six people were injured.|$|E
5|$|Grace {{had only}} minor effects on land, {{although}} while it <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> through the Azores, islands {{close to the}} storm's center recorded winds of up to 44mph (71km/h) and moderate rainfall. Although not solely related to the cyclone, heavy rainfall in Portugal led to some street flooding. The remnants also impacted parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom, where rainfall approaching 2 in (51mm) and tropical storm-force winds were recorded. However, no damage occurred.|$|E

5|$|Hernández de Córdoba sent {{a second}} {{expedition}} into Honduras, carrying {{letters to the}} Audiencia of Santo Domingo and to the Crown, searching for a good location for a port on the Caribbean coast, to provide a link to Nicaragua. The expedition was intercepted and captured by Sandoval, who sent some of the Nicaraguan party back to Cortés at Trujillo. They informed Cortés of Hernández de Córdoba's plan to set himself up in Nicaragua independently of Pedrarias in Panama. Cortés responded courteously and offered supplies while the expedition <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> through Honduras, but sent letters advising Hernández de Córdoba to remain loyal to Pedrarias.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, {{while serving}} on the Texas {{frontier}} after the war, {{he was promoted to}} first lieutenant and then to captain in the 9th Infantry Regiment in 1855. In 1853, Pickett challenged a fellow junior officer, future Union general Winfield Scott Hancock, to a duel; (they had met only briefly when Hancock <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> through Texas). Hancock declined the duel, a response not unlikely as dueling had fallen out of favor at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Apple {{agreed to}} cut the price UK {{consumers}} pay to download music for their iPods after a formal complaint to the European Commission from the UK consumer group Which? demonstrated higher prices in UK for the same iTunes songs sold elsewhere in the European Union (EU). The Commission began an antitrust investigation in 2007 of Apple's business practices after the complaint was made, but ultimately the Commission probe found no agreements between Apple and major record labels on how iTunes is run in Europe, only that Apple had been paying higher wholesale prices to UK music labels and <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> the cost along to UK customers.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{lived in}} Durham {{until the age}} of 16, at which point she moved to New York to finish high school and prepare for college. There she lived with the family of her cousin Maude. The family <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> for white in their white neighborhood. Murray's {{presence}} discomfited Maude's neighbors, however, as Murray was more visibly of partial African descent. She nonetheless was graduated with her second high school diploma and honors in 1927, and was able to enroll at Hunter College for two years.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, as the {{precursor}} extratropical storm was forming, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale {{and later a}} storm warning for the island, expecting winds of 50 to 60mph (60 to 95km/h). Several radio interviews and television stations issued information on the expected storm. Many residents believed they were insufficiently warned, though it is acknowledged that emergency managers and citizens pay less attention to gale warnings then they do for tropical cyclone warnings. On October 12, as the storm <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> {{to the south of}} the island, officials closed all schools and government offices. Many private businesses closed as well.|$|E
5|$|Series veteran Michael Ironside did not reprise {{his role}} as the voice of Sam Fisher. His part was played by Eric Johnson, who also {{performed}} the motion capture. In a Blacklist developer diary, Ironside said that he <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> the torch to another actor. According to Ubisoft executives the change was made to take advantage of new performance-capture technology to enrich the game experience, and Ironside assisted Johnson with the role. Elias Toufexis, voice and performance-capture actor for Andriy Kobin in , said that he would return for the new game.|$|E

50|$|BRNN can {{be trained}} using similar {{algorithms}} compared to RNN, because the two directional neurons {{do not have any}} interactions. However, when back-propagation is applied, additional processes are needed because updating input and output layers cannot be done at once. General procedures for training are as follows: For forward pass, forward states and backward states <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> first, then output neurons <b>are</b> <b>passed.</b> For backward <b>pass,</b> output neurons <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> first, then forward states and backward states <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> next.

5|$|The LRDG now began {{a series}} of patrols behind the Axis lines. Near the end of July 'T' Patrol left for the desert to the south of the Gulf of Sirte. One 'T' Patrol truck managed to observe the main coastal road, along which Axis traffic <b>was</b> <b>passing.</b> They were {{followed}} two or three weeks later by 'S' Patrol, who carried out a similar reconnaissance between Jalo oasis and Agedabia. Both patrols returned safely to Kufra without being discovered. In August 1941 'R' Patrol relieved 'G' and 'Y' Patrols at Siwa and was joined by 'T' Patrol in October.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{entered the}} Army of the United States in 1941 and was {{assigned}} to the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, a part of the 82nd Airborne Division. In 1944, as a first lieutenant, Thompson led his men during an air raid as part of Operation Market Garden. The light in the jump bay of the platoon's C-47 Skytrain was later than expected, moving their landing zone from its intended location near Grave, Netherlands; the plane <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> over buildings when the paratroopers were signalled to leave the aircraft, and Thompson decided to wait until reaching several approaching fields.|$|E
5|$|A mid- to upper-level trough {{slowed the}} storm {{almost to a}} halt early on August 23, before a drift to the north-northwest began. The next National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{advisory}} then reported that the eye was becoming more distinct and well-defined. This strengthening trend abated because the storm had churned up the waters over which it <b>was</b> <b>passing,</b> bringing cooler water to the surface {{as a result of}} the slow track. Another inhibiting factor may have been related to the same trough that caused the northward turn, though due to a large anticyclone situated over the hurricane, the weakening effects were not substantial. Despite wind shear, the large and powerful circulation resisted weakening for a time. Early on August 25, the shear and the entrainment of drier air into the hurricane took its toll on Bonnie, giving it a ragged appearance on satellite imagery, and the eye briefly became cloud-filled.|$|E

5|$|Bradman {{arranged}} for Lindwall {{to see his}} Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman’s leg to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front, Bradman stated his firm belief in the fairness of Lindwall's delivery. During the lengthy sea voyage to England, Bradman {{emphasized the importance of}} caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first priority in the lead-in tour matches <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> the umpires' scrutiny. Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign, destroying his confidence {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Cartledge {{pursued the}} claim anyway {{in an attempt}} to have the law changed, and {{decisions}} were made against him in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. After the Court of Appeal decision a Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury was created under Mr Justice Davies, which produced its report before the Cartledge case had even got to the House of Lords. The report, published in September 1962, made several recommendations which found their way into a Limitation Bill placed before Parliament on 6 May 1963. While it <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> through the House of Lords, Lord Reid suggested it would be simpler to amend the Limitation Act 1939, but this was never acted on. The act received the Royal Assent on 31 July 1963 and came into force immediately.|$|E
5|$|Casting for {{the episode}} was difficult, as the {{production}} team wanted real Africans. They auditioned every one they could find, including an African theater troupe that <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> by. The role of Marcus Duff eventually went to Carl Lumbly, {{who was known}} for his role on CBS's Cagney & Lacey. The role of Aboah went to Willie Amakye, a Ghanaian Olympic runner who had just returned to his home in Southern California from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. To appear albino, Amakye's skin underwent several layers of cover-up cream, layers of white powder, and a little pink powder for color. He also wore contacts for the transparent pink eyes. Amakye's hair was dyed orange for post-production special effects to change it back and forth from black and white. As revealed on his resident alien card, Aboah's birthday is September 25, a reference to the birthday of Gillian Anderson's daughter.|$|E

5|$|Complaints lodged to the {{authorities}} against Mansur ultimately led to his dismissal in 1579. He was replaced with his son Muhammad. Mansur died in 1580. According to Duwayhi, Muhammad was alleged by {{the authorities}} to {{have participated in the}} looting of an Istanbul-bound caravan from Egypt while it <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> through the Akkar and was consequently imprisoned in Istanbul. However, Ottoman sources mention that the caravan arrived safely in Istanbul and that the commander of the caravan, Ibrahim Pasha, backed by a 20,000-strong army, arrested Muhammad and Qurqumaz Ma'an while suppressing rebel activity in Mount Lebanon en route to Istanbul. About a year later, Muhammad was released and assigned the tax farm for Tripoli Eyalet's rural districts, not including Tripoli itself, which remained under Yusuf Sayfa. The Ottoman authorities were content with Muhammad's rule, but were vexed by the Maronites in his retinue.|$|E
5|$|Disorder {{spread across}} the {{province}} as large processions ignored section 144 and condemned {{the actions of the}} police. More than 30,000 people congregated at Curzon Hall in Dhaka. During the continued protests, police actions led to the death of four more people. This prompted officers and clerks from different organisations, including colleges, banks and the radio station, to boycott offices and join the procession. Protesters burned the offices of two leading pro-government news agencies, the Jubilee Press and the Morning News. Police fired on a major janaza, or mourning rally, as it <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> through Nawabpur Road. The shooting killed several people including activist Sofiur Rahman and a nine-year-old boy named Ohiullah.|$|E
5|$|Early on October15, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted about 750km (465mi) east-northeast of Guam. Initially {{the system}} was located within an area of moderate wind shear, although conditions gradually became more favorable for tropical cyclogenesis. At 12:00UTC on October15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression developed about 450km (280mi) east of Guam. A few hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert before initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 26W early on October16. At that time, the depression <b>was</b> <b>passing</b> about 100km (65mi) southeast of Guam. After formation, the system moved west-southwestward under a ridge to the north. Its circulation consolidated as the thunderstorm activity organized, aided by warm sea surface temperatures and decreasing wind shear. At 06:00UTC on October16, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Francisco (1327).|$|E
