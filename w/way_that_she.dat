Due to her grim fate {{by the end of}} the series, a destiny that Shinbo believed was slightly unfair, he asked Urobuchi if it was possible to change the plot so that Sayaka could be spared. Urobuchi declined, asserting that her death was too integral to the overarching story. Shinbo then inquired if there were any <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could be brought back to life, admitting he had become very attached to the character. However, Urobuchi again refused, explaining that this would be impossible with regard to the already-established rules governing the story. Shinbo finally acquiesced to this, but remarked that he believed there may have been too large of a burden placed on the characters who were in essence young middle school girls.|$|E
5|$|M. N. Rajam {{was cast}} as Manohari, {{the queen of}} Ratnapuri, and king Marthandan's wife. Ramachandran wanted Rajam for the role to avoid her being typecast as a {{character}} driven by jealousy and malice. For the role of Ratna, B. Saroja Devi was selected after a successful audition. Saroja Devi was not fluent in Tamil at the time, so her dialogues were written in such a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would {{find it easier to}} pronounce them. P. S. Veerappa, M. N. Nambiar and Chakrapani played the antagonists Vijayavarman, Pingalan and Karmegam. T. K. Balachandran, who was prominent in Malayalam films, was cast as Bhupathi. K. R. Ramsingh was selected for the role of Madhana and Bhupathi's father, Veerabahu, after Ramachandran was impressed by his performance in one of the stage plays he featured in. J. P. Chandrababu played Veerangan's friend and sidekick, Sagayam. T. P. Muthulakshmi was cast as Nagamma, a native of Kanni Theevu, who wants a husband. G. Sakunthala played Manohari's lady-in-waiting Nandini and K. S. Angamuthu the restaurateur Pappa respectively.|$|E
25|$|Assembling the {{suspects}} together along with Carla, Poirot makes his denouement about the murder. Although Phillip's hostility to Caroline {{was due to}} her rejection of his love for her, and Meredith's sympathy was due to his weariness for his long affection for her, leading him to form an attachment to Elsa that was unreciprocated, both brothers' emotions were merely red herrings. In putting together the case, he reveals that Caroline had been innocent, but did not defend herself in court, because she believed that Angela had committed the murder; the evidence Poirot had uncovered showed that her younger sister had been angry with Amyas and had put salt in his glass as a prank. She {{had the opportunity to}} steal the poison from Meredith {{on the morning of the}} crime, and was seen fiddling with the bottle of beer that Caroline would take down to him. However, Caroline did not wish her sister to be charged for the crime, having felt a deep guilt for injuring her sister in a fit of jealous rage many years ago, which had left Angela blinded in one eye and with a permanent scar on the left side of her face. Therefore, she took steps to take the blame for her crime in order to earn redemption, which explained why she did not claim she was innocent in the letter she sent Angela but believed Angela knew Caroline was. However, Poirot reveals that Caroline's actions had actually proved her innocence, as she had wiped the fingerprints off the bottle because she believed that the poison had been put in it rather than in the glass, and that she would have no need to remove her own--thus, she was removing those of a third party. Furthermore, he reveals that Angela was not the killer, as she had been at Meredith's lab in order to steal valerian from him in preparation for playing another prank on Amyas, but never carried out the act because of the murder, deducing this from the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> spoke of the theft in the future tense to Poirot.|$|E

While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> does things and the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E

Although believers in the [...] "Chlois" [...] theory initially suspected that Chloe would eventually become Lois Lane, Clark's future wife in the comics, Mack contends that Clark does not love Chloe in the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> loves him. The actress {{does not believe that}} Clark's feelings will ever change. Regardless of Clark's feelings, Mack recognizes that Chloe is blinded by her love for Clark, which ultimately affects her judgment in not only seeing Clark's faults, but making choices that place her character in danger. In season five, Clark finally discovers that Chloe knows his secret, and this revelation allows Chloe the opportunity {{to come to terms with}} her feelings for Clark; this also provided a means for the two have a more meaningful friendship, without the concerns of Chloe's unrequited love.|$|E

Les's wife, Pam Coker (Lin Blakley), struggles with this and ends their marriage. In one of several attempts to win Pam back, Les burns all of Christine's belongings. Babe witnesses this and steals a half-burnt photograph of Christine. Badland said that Babe is [...] "quite Dickensian in the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> finds things and slips them into her pocket to use against people!" [...] The storyline was revisited in May 2016 when Babe begins anonymously blackmailing Les and Pam in exchange for her silence. Of Babe's motivation to blackmail the Cokers, Badland said that [...] "Babe hasn't got any respect for Pam and Les and she's using them to get money. It's as simple as that really." [...] She also said that she [...] "resents seeing [...] and Pam together as a unit" [...] after he rejects her romantic advances, because she has [...] "never had what they have".|$|E
500|$|Chloe's {{relationship}} with her mother is one tackled both off-screen and behind the scenes. In a brainstorming session, Mack, Gough and Millar {{came up with the}} idea that Chloe's mother had left her at a young age. Mack wanted to make the character a [...] "latchkey kid", in an effort to explain why she is out all hours of the night. Mack feels that Chloe has real abandonment issues, which play on the fact that she never feels like she is good enough for anyone. These abandonment issues were meant to provide a reason for why the character is devastated by the fact that Clark does not love her the same <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> loves him, as well as the reason for why Chloe does not have many female friends. One of Chloe's story arcs in season five involved her finding her mother in a mental institution, and living with the fear that she will have a mental breakdown of her own and end up in a psychiatric facility. This fear also affects Clark, who worries that keeping his secret will have negative effects on Chloe, like it did Pete.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{critics have}} given Procter's work little attention. The few critics who have {{examined}} Procter's poetry generally find it {{important for the}} <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> overtly expresses conventional sentiments while covertly undermining them. According to Isobel Armstrong, Procter's poetry, like that of many 19th-century women poets, employs conventional ideas and modes of expression without necessarily espousing them in entirety. Francis O'Gorman cites [...] "A Legend of Provence" [...] {{as an example of}} a poem with this kind of [...] "double relationship with the structures of gender politics it seems to affirm." [...] Other critics since Armstrong agree that Procter's poetry, while ladylike on the surface, shows signs of repressed emotions and desires. Kirstie Blair states that the suppression of emotion in Procter's work makes the narrative poems all the more powerful, and Gill Gregory argues that Procter's poetry often explores female sexuality in an unconventional way, while as often voicing anxiety about sexual desires. Elizabeth Gray criticizes the fact that the few discussions of Procter's poetry that do exist focus primarily on gender, arguing that the [...] "range and formal inventiveness of this illuminatingly representative Victorian poet have remained largely unexplored." ...|$|E

After the first performances in 2011, Louis Hobson of the Calgary Sun said the character of Marta was an unrealistic caricature and didn't [...] "ring true" [...] because of how she was written. The character underwent a series of rewrites to make her more well-rounded and kind before the 2012 cross-Canada tour. In the 2012 tour, the play was performed in several fringe theatre festivals, at which critics representing the Montreal Gazette, the Winnipeg Free Press, and CFEQ-FM said it stood out for its quality and moral content. The writing was praised by one critic from the Victoria News, who wrote that the play demonstrates that Kooman has a [...] "gift for creating powerful, believable dialogue that can draw an audience in", but criticised by Chamberlain of the Times Colonist, who attested to [...] "melodramatic—and just plain bad—cop-show dialogue". Liz Nicholls of the Edmonton Journal called the performances compelling.

Ned cannot and concedes victory to Lisa. Lisa kindly tells Ned that she fully respects religious beliefs, but she just does not think it is proper for the church to dominate the school, the same way that Mr. Flanders and Reverend Lovejoy do not want scientists taking over the church. Ned agrees and offers to take Lisa and his kids out for ice cream.|$|E

Consequently, it became the first project from Hollywood Records to be released under the [...] "day-and-date" [...] format, which allowed the project to be released nearly simultaneously worldwide instead of traditionally [...] "staggering" [...] its launch to accommodate [...] "the availability of the artist" [...] internationally. On May 7, Cyrus unveiled the album artwork through her website; it depicts Cyrus dressed in a leather jacket, pants, and midriff-baring shirt while standing against a black-and-white background. It was noted for establishing an increasingly provocative public image for Cyrus; her stylist Simone Harouche stated that it was inspired by singer Joan Jett and the band Blondie, and was [...] "basically a strong statement saying in the most simple <b>way,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> can’t be tamed–literally and metaphorically."

They confirmed Caillat would be available due to a then upcoming concert in Nashville, Tennessee and, coincidentally, on the same day, Swift had a vacation day. According to Swift, [...] "Breathe" [...] is about having to depart from a someone, however, not blaming anyone. Swift believed the scenario was one of the most difficult goodbyes, [...] "when it's nobody's fault. It just has to end." [...] Swift explained, [...] "It was total therapy because I came in and I was like look, 'One of my best friends, I'm gonna have to not see anymore and it's not gonna be part of what I do. It's the hardest thing to go through. It's crazy listening to the song because you would think it's about a relationship and it's really about losing a friend and having a fallout." [...] Caillat and Swift said one of the beauties of the song was that many people would be able to relate to it because it is never specific as why the departure is occurring or whose fault it was.|$|E
500|$|Ged, who in {{the story}} goes by his common name of Sparrowhawk, only enters the novel midway through {{when he comes to}} the tombs to steal the ring of Erreth-Akbe. Where he was an {{adolescent}} in A Wizard of Earthsea, he is depicted as a mature individual in the second Earthsea volume, one who gradually transforms Tenar's view of the world. In The Tombs of Atuan he plays the role of the wise helper to the protagonist, a type of companionship common to Le Guin's novels. After Tenar chooses to talk to him rather than have him killed, he tells her about the rest of Earthsea that she is ignorant of, and so helps her see a path out of her difficulties that she could not. The scars that Ged bears from his encounter with the shadow in A Wizard of Earthsea make Tenar realize that he has confronted death in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has never done. Literature scholar Elizabeth Cummins argues that while Ged does not actually save Tenar, he [...] "functions as the midwife in her rebirth". Ged is the figure of the [...] "other" [...] in this novel; in contrast to the other inhabitants of the Tombs, he is male, dark-skinned, and a wizard. Ged's difference in the story is symbolized by light on many occasions, such as when his staff allows Tenar to see the undertomb for the first time: she is shocked then to find it to be beautiful, rather than just dark. Ged is responsible for giving Tenar a wider perspective and showing her a more compassionate and joyful world than her previous experience allowed her to imagine.|$|E

The character was a [...] "vulnerable victim-turned-vigilante with the [...] "take-no-prisoners" [...] attitude of Lara Croft and the [...] "cool, unsentimental intellect" [...] of Spock. Fincher felt that Salander's eccentric persona was enthralling, and stated, [...] "there's a kind of wish fulfillment {{to her in the}} <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> takes care of things, the way she will only put up with so much, but there are other sides to her as well." [...] Casting was complicated by the raft of prominent candidates such as Natalie Portman, Ellen Page, Kristen Stewart, Emily Browning, Jennifer Lawrence, Keira Knightley, Anne Hathaway, Olivia Thirlby, Scarlett Johansson, and Emma Watson. Despite the hype, some eventually withdrew from consideration due to the time commitment and low pay. Mara had worked with Fincher in his 2010 film The Social Network. Fincher, while fond of the actress' youthful appearance, found it difficult at first to mold her to match Salander's antisocial demeanor, which was a vast contrast from her earlier role as the submissive Erica. Mara went through multiple changes in her appearance to become Salander. Her hair was dyed black and cut into various jagged points, giving the appearance that she cut it herself. In addition to her transgressive appearance, which was described as a [...] "mash-up of brazen Seventies punk and spooky Eighties goth with a dash of S temptress" [...] by Lynn Hirschberg of W, Mara participated in a formal screening and was filmed by Fincher on a subway in Los Angeles in an effort to persuade the executives of Sony Pictures that she was a credible choice.|$|E
