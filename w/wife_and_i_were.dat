Her son and heir to the New Zealand throne, The Prince of Wales, also said to New Zealand's governor-general and prime minister: [...] "My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> horrified when we heard the news early this morning... The scale of the {{destruction}} all but defies belief when we can appreciate only too well how difficult {{it must have been}} struggling {{to come to terms with}} last year's horror ... Our deepest sympathy and constant thoughts are with you and all New Zealanders." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1995, the McCombs {{sold the}} house to a local real estate agent, Christopher Shellabear: [...] "“Our family all left home and my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{rattling}} around in this huge house”, Harold McComb explained. On 30 June 1995, following receipt of petition from local residents worried about the potential redevelopment of the site, the Heritage Council of Western Australia issued a Stop Work (or Conservation) order under Section 59 of the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990. On 17 July 1995, Chris Shellabear sold the now-encumbered property to Sharon Creasy, wife of prospector Mark Creasy, for $2.7 million. On 10 October 1995, the Heritage Council of Western Australia added the property to the State Register of Heritage Places on an [...] "interim" [...] basis. The Creasys contested the interim listing for nine years, and in 2004 the Heritage Council removed the dwelling from the interim listing {{and placed it on}} the permanent register. [...] There was a legal dispute as to whether the listing was done correctly, resulting in the Heritage Council re-registering it on the permanent list in May 2005. The Creasys estimate that the dispute has cost them $225,000 in legal fees and claim that the house is now uninhabitable, estimating it would cost at least $2.8 million to make it liveable and much more to renovate it completely.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am a hop {{merchant}} myself, and as I have {{an income}} of seven or eight hundred, we found ourselves comfortably off, and took a nice eighty-pound-a-year villa at Norbury. Our little place was very countrified, considering {{that it is so}} close to town. We had an inn and two houses a little above us, and a single cottage at {{the other side of the}} field which faces us, and except those there were no houses until you got half way to the station. My business took me into town at certain seasons, but in summer I had less to do, and then in our country home my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> just as happy as could be wished. I tell you that there never was a shadow between us until this accursed affair began.|$|E
60|$|At {{the trial}} the whole case was very clearly proved against him, and my innocence was fully {{established}} before {{the face of}} all my fellow-countrymen. A fortnight later my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> among the rocks and woods at Ambleside; and when I returned to London, it was to take a place in the department of coins at the British Museum, which the superintendent begged of me to accept as some further proof in the eyes of everybody that the suspicion he had formed in the matter of the Wulfric was a most unfounded and wholly erroneous one. The coin itself I kept as a memento of a terrible experience; but I have given up collecting on my own account entirely, and am quite content nowadays to bear my share in guarding the national collection from other depredators of the class of Mactavish.|$|E

60|$|The partial {{restraint}} and embarrassment, caused at {{first by the}} strange terms on which my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> living together, gradually vanished before the frequency of my visits to North Villa. We soon began to speak with all the ease, all the unpremeditated frankness of a long intimacy. Margaret's powers of conversation were generally only employed to lead me to exert mine. She was never tired of inducing me to speak of my family. She listened with every appearance of interest, while I talked of my father, my sister, or my elder brother; but whenever she questioned me directly about any of them, her inquiries invariably led away from their characters and dispositions, to their personal appearance, their every-day habits, their dress, their intercourse with the gay world, the things they spent their money on, and other topics of a similar nature.|$|E
6000|$|During the {{two years}} which {{immediately}} preceded the cessation of my official life, my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> working together at the [...] "Liberty." [...] I had first planned and written it as a short essay in 1854. It was in mounting {{the steps of the}} Capitol, in January, 1855, that the thought first arose of converting it into a volume. None of my writings have been either so carefully composed, or so sedulously corrected as this. After it had been written as usual twice over, we kept it by us, bringing it out from time to time, and going through it de novo, reading, weighing, and criticizing every sentence. Its final revision was to have been a work of the winter of 1858-9, the first after my retirement, which we had arranged to pass in the south of Europe. That hope and every other were frustrated by the most unexpected and bitter calamity of her death--at Avignon, on our way to Montpellier, from a sudden attack of pulmonary congestion.|$|E
60|$|They {{were gone}} to bed at the log Inn, which was the only house of {{entertainment}} in the place, but soon answered to our knocking, and got some tea for us {{in a sort of}} kitchen or common room, tapestried with old newspapers, pasted against the wall. The bed-chamber to which my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> shown, was a large, low, ghostly room; with a quantity of withered branches on the hearth, and two doors without any fastening, opposite to each other, both opening on the black night and wild country, and so contrived, that one of them always blew the other open: a novelty in domestic architecture, which I do not remember to have seen before, and which I was somewhat disconcerted to have forced on my attention after getting into bed, as I had a considerable sum in gold for our travelling expenses, in my dressing-case. Some of the luggage, however, piled against the panels, soon settled this difficulty, and my sleep would not have been very much affected that night, I believe, though it had failed to do so.|$|E
