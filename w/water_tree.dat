50|$|In the {{presence}} of water, a diffuse, partially conductive 3D plume-like structure, called a <b>water</b> <b>tree,</b> may form within the polyethylene dielectric used in buried or water-immersed high voltage cables. The plume is known to consist of a dense network of extremely small water-filled channels which are defined by the native crystalline structure of the polymer. Individual channels are extremely difficult to see using optical magnification, so their study usually requires using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Water trees begin as a microscopic region near a defect. They then grow under the continued presence of a high electrical field and water. Water trees may eventually grow {{to the point where}} they bridge the outer ground layer to the center high voltage conductor, at which point the stress redistributes across the insulation. Water trees are not generally a reliability concern unless they are able to initiate an electrical tree. Another type of tree-like structure can form with or without {{the presence}} of water is called an electrical tree. It also forms within a polyethylene dielectric (as well as many other solid dielectrics). Electrical trees also originate where bulk or surface stress enhancements initiate dielectric breakdown in a small region of the insulation. This permanently damages the insulating material in that region. Further tree growth then occurs through as additional small electrical breakdown events (called partial discharges). Electrical tree growth may be accelerated by rapid voltage changes, such as utility switching operations. Also, cables injected with high voltage DC may also develop electrical trees over time as electrical charges migrate into the dielectric nearest the HV conductor. The region of injected charge (called a space charge) amplifies the electrical field in the dielectric, stimulating further stress enhancement and the initiation of electrical trees as the site of pre-existing stress enhancements. Since the electrical tree itself is typically partially conducting, its presence also increases the electrical stress in the region between the tree and the opposite conductor. Unlike water trees, the individual channels of electrical trees are larger and more easily seen.Treeing has been a long-term failure mechanism for buried polymer-insulated high voltage power cables, first reported in 1969. In a similar fashion, 2D trees can occur along the surface of a highly stressed dielectric, or across a dielectric surface that has been contaminated by dust or mineral salts. Over time, these partially conductive trails can grow until they cause complete failure of the dielectric. Electrical tracking, sometimes called dry banding, is a typical failure mechanism for electrical power insulators that are subjected to salt spray contamination along coastlines. The branching 2D and 3D patterns are sometimes called Lichtenberg figures.|$|E

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>tree</b> is {{a process}} that causes {{degradation}} of insulation performance and ageing of Cross-Linked Polyethylene (XLPE) underground cables. It is {{known as one of the}} major causes of premature ageing and failure of polymeric cables. Previous research has shown that there are different effects of ageing time on <b>water</b> <b>tree</b> growth in different types of polymeric insulating materials where nickel and platinum have been used as electrodes and were found to cause corrosion and reduce efficiency. Thus, in this research, a modified test assembly using tungsten needle as an electrode to avoid corrosion and increase efficiency was introduced. This research investigated the effects of ageing time on <b>water</b> <b>tree</b> growth in two different types of polymeric sample namely (XLPE) and Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) under high voltage stress. Using computational simulation, the effect of voltage application and angle of tip radius against electric field using COMSOL 4. 2 a was studied. In this study, the polymeric samples were prepared using a new method known as “leaf-like” specimen method. The experiment was based on BS IEC 61956 2001, “Methods of test for the evaluation of water treeing in insulating materials” and BS EN 60243 - 1 : 1998, “Electrical strength of insulating materials-Test methods”. Samples were exposed to high voltage injection for 150 hours and 470 hours. The simulation results show that when voltage application increases, the electric field will increase. Besides that, a lower angle of tip radius in polymeric sample, will result in higher electric field being produced. Experimental results show that <b>water</b> <b>tree</b> growth is proportional to ageing time of the two polymeric samples. However, XLPE has better water treeing resistance than LDPE because the average length of <b>water</b> <b>tree</b> growth for LDPE is higher as compared to XLPE.

40|$|When polymer {{power cables}} were {{introduced}} into mediumvoltage {{applications in the}} late 1960 s, the degradationphenomenon later referred to aswater treeingwas still unknown. However, this changedwithin a relatively short space of time.

Sincethen, cable manufacturers have been improving their designsgradually, and cables produced today are assumed to have muchlower susceptibility to <b>water</b> <b>trees.</b> However, <b>water</b> <b>treeing</b> isstill assumed {{to be the most important}} degradation process inthese applications. There are huge amounts of polymer cable installations thatare degraded by <b>water</b> <b>trees.</b> Since many of these cables areinstalled in the same grid nets, one cable fault oftengenerates another. If two or more cables fail at the same time,the consequences can be extensive. A non-destructive diagnosticmethod makes it possible to assess cables and take action priorto failures. This thesis presents the results of research work on thedevelopment of a measurement technique and diagnostic methodfor the assessment of medium voltage XLPE cables in the field. The method used is called high voltage dielectric spectroscopy,and involves the measurement of capacitance and loss as afunction of frequency at high voltages. The method is used in ashort frequency range of approximately one decade in thelow-frequency region (normally from 1 down to 0. 1 Hz). Thevoltage levels used initially are all below the service-voltagelevel. If the cable is assessed to be free from <b>water</b> <b>trees,</b> aslightly increased voltage can be used. Based on dielectric-spectroscopy measurements, specificwater-tree analysis and breakdown tests, a set of measurementprocedures and criteria that take into account differences incable designs has been proposed for the assessment of mediumvoltage XLPE cables. The characteristic responses of XLPEcables (in both non and water-tree-deteriorated cases) make itpossible to separate the cable response from the influence ofaccessories. Field experience shows thatwater-tree-deteriorated cables with relatively low breakdownstrengths can remain in service for many years.
