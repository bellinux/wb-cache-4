5|$|The {{designers}} {{conceived the}} Tallboys as town criers. Stilts were later added after Mitton noticed someone cleaning their office façade while wearing stilts; the town crier role {{was replaced with}} loudspeakers throughout Dunwall. The Tallboy design evolved into a lamplighter that would light street lamps with <b>whale</b> <b>oil</b> tanks, but after further development, the designers considered that their tall, mechanical legs allowed them to burn the dead and deal with plague-infected citizens while remaining above them and avoiding infection, leading to their final design as a guard armed with a bow. Mitton suggested adding a phosphorus canister to the Tallboys' backs for aesthetic reasons, but Smith suggested <b>whale</b> <b>oil,</b> which in turn led Mitton to design the whaling ships to give the whales a visible presence in the city. For other technologies, designers conceptualized using 18th-century technology to build modern items and vehicles, and creating 18th-century items using modern tools.|$|E

The results obtained are as follows. 1) The iso and anteiso fatty acids were recognized in all {{the parts of the}} stomach contents, but the quantity was little in all the parts, especially in the bacterial part. 2) The composition of iso fatty acids in the bacterial part isolated from the stomach was somewhat different from that in the food part, but it was not similar to that in the <b>whale's</b> <b>oil.</b> 3) The composition of anteiso fatty acid in the bacterial part was similar to that in the food part, and accordingly it was not similar to that in the <b>whale's</b> <b>oil.</b> 4) The composition of fatty acid in the free oil part in the stomach with digesting content was peculiar : The iso, anteiso and straight-chain fatty acid with the carbon number under 13 were relatively abundant, and there were detected more saturated fatty acid less monoene and polyene fatty acids as compared with that in the food part and the bacterial part. ﻿ 3 頭の生体イルカ(胃内から細菌が分離されたものとされないものがあった) について,その胃内容物を食物部,菌体部および遊離油脂部に分け,この各脂質中に含まれる高級脂肪酸組成を検索し,次の結果を得た。 1. 供試イルカのいずれの胃内容区分にもisoおよびanteiso酸を認めたが,量的にはどれも少なく,菌体部ではとくに少なかった。﻿ 2. 胃内から細菌が分離された菌体部のiso酸組成は食物部の組成と多少異なったが,この菌体部のiso酸組成はイルカ油脂中の組成とは類似しなかった。 3. 菌体部のanteiso酸組成は食物部の組成とほぼ類似し,したがってイルカ油脂中の組成とは類似しなかった。 4. 消化の進んでいない胃内に遊離の状態で存在していた油脂中の脂肪酸組成は特異的で,すなわち炭素数 13 以下のiso酸,anteiso酸,直鎖酸を比較的多く含み,また食物部や菌体部に比し飽和酸が多くモノエン酸,ポリエン酸が少なかった...|$|R

5|$|Enemy {{detection}} {{works on}} line-of-sight, with players {{being able to}} use cover or high areas out of enemies' cones of vision to stay undetected. Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, {{but it is only}} effective at a distance. Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route. Players can look through keyholes to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to look from cover without fully exposing themselves. The player is now able to be detected if they peer out from behind a wall for too long, a feature not seen in Dishonored. To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that enemies are not alerted to the player's presence. Walls of Light, barriers powered by wind or <b>whale</b> <b>oil,</b> are subject to have their power turned off or be rewired so that only enemies are killed by going through them. <b>Whale</b> <b>oil</b> canisters explode on harsh impact, and can be thrown at enemies to that end.|$|E

5|$|The {{island was}} {{subsequently}} visited by many government and whaling ships sailing between New South Wales and Norfolk Island {{and across the}} Pacific, including many from the American whaling fleet, so its reputation as a provisioning port preceded settlement, some ships leaving goats and pigs on the island as food for future visitors. Between July and October 1791 the Third Fleet ships arrived at Sydney and within days the deckwork was being reconstructed for a future in the lucrative whaling industry. <b>Whale</b> <b>oil</b> was to become Australia's most profitable export until the 1830s, {{and it was the}} whaling industry that shaped Lord Howe Island's early history.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Senate called the Arctic Resolution, to fund an expedition to the North Pole. Hall, aided by the Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson, successfully lobbied for, and received, a grant of $50,000 from the U.S. Congress to command the expedition and began recruiting personnel in late 1870. He secured the U.S. Navy tugboat Periwinkle, a 387-ton screw-propelled steamer. At the Washington Navy Yard the ship was fitted as a fore topsail schooner, and renamed Polaris. She was prepared for Arctic service by the addition of solid oak timber all over her hull, and the bow was sheathed in iron. A new engine was added, and one of the boilers was retrofitted to burn seal or <b>whale</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
5|$|Part of {{this scheme}} was the {{announcement}} of sharply increased freight charges. This touched off a firestorm of protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, {{which led to the}} discovery of Standard Oil's part in the deal. A major New York refiner, Charles Pratt and Company, headed by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers, led the opposition to this plan, and railroads soon backed off. Pennsylvania revoked the cartel's charter, and non-preferential rates were restored for the time being. While competitors may have been unhappy, Rockefeller's efforts did bring American consumers cheaper kerosene and other oil by-products. Before 1870, oil light was only for the wealthy, provided by expensive <b>whale</b> <b>oil.</b> But during the next decade, kerosene became commonly available to the working and middle classes.|$|E
5|$|Whitby grew in {{size and}} wealth, {{extending}} its activities to include shipbuilding using local oak timber. In 1790–91 Whitby built 11,754tons of shipping, making it the third largest shipbuilder in England, after London and Newcastle. Taxes on imports entering the port raised money to improve and extend the town's twin piers, improving the harbour and permitting further increases in trade. In 1753 the first whaling ship set sail to Greenland and by 1795 Whitby had become a major whaling port. The most successful year was 1814 when eight ships caught 172 whales, and the whaler, the Resolutions catch produced 230tons of oil. The carcases yielded 42tons of whale bone used for 'stays' which {{were used in the}} corsetry trade until changes in fashion made them redundant. Blubber was boiled to produce oil for use in lamps in four oil houses on the harbourside. Oil was used for street lighting until the spread of gas lighting reduced demand and the Whitby <b>Whale</b> <b>Oil</b> and Gas Company changed into the Whitby Coal and Gas Company. As the market for whale products fell, catches became too small to be economic and by 1831 only one whaling ship, the Phoenix, remained.|$|E
