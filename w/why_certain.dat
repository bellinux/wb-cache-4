5|$|Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for {{not realizing}} that moral laws are {{justified}} by a moral intuition based on utilitarian principles (that the greatest good for the greatest number ought to be sought). Mill argued that Kant's ethics could not explain <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> actions are wrong without appealing to utilitarianism. As basis for morality, Mill believed that his principle of utility has a stronger intuitive grounding than Kant's reliance on reason, and can better explain <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> actions are right or wrong.|$|E

5|$|The {{multiplayer}} side of Mysteries of the Sith {{was received}} positively, {{but did not}} completely escape criticism. Emil Pagliarulo of The Adrenaline Vault questioned <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> features seemed to be missing from the multiplayer mode that {{were present in the}} single-player mode. One such feature is the rancor which appears prominently in a single-player level but is not in any multiplayer maps.|$|E

5|$|Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and refutation of climate change denial. In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due to feeling frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. The methodology of those denying climate change is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence of climate change by those denying it, and criticism {{of the values of}} climate scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> individuals, and the wider public, have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus for climate change.|$|E
5|$|From 1974 to 1977, Oceanside police {{kept track}} of over 1,000 {{accidents}} that occurred along SR 76. A citizen action group known as Concerned Citizens for Highway 76 formed soon after. Caltrans began holding hearings again in 1979, proposing the building of an expressway {{as opposed to a}} freeway or to widening Mission Avenue. At one hearing, local officials criticized the delay, while others criticized the routing, the decision to build an expressway instead of a freeway, and building a route through an environmentally sensitive area. In May 1980, the state Assembly Transportation Committee approved a resolution that requested an answer from the governor at the time, Jerry Brown, and Caltrans as to <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> projects, including SR76, had not been started.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E

25|$|On 29 June 2010, Nasheed's 12 {{cabinet ministers}} {{resigned}} en masse, protesting the behaviour of opposition MPs who they said were “hijacking” {{the powers of}} the executive and making it impossible for the cabinet Ministers to discharge their constitutional duties and deliver the government’s election manifesto. The ministers called on the President to investigate <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> MPs were blocking the government's work, citing allegations of corruption and bribery in parliament.|$|E
25|$|An early {{model for}} {{fractional}} crystallization, which explained <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> types of mineral {{tend to be}} found together in igneous rocks, was Bowen's reaction series, formulated in 1922. He found that, as magma crystallizes, it separates into two series: a continuous series of minerals that continuously adjusts their composition through interactions with the melt, and a discontinuous series of minerals that remain fixed in composition as they cool. Thus, the type of mineral indicates the temperature at which it was formed.|$|E

30|$|Growth of G.P. zone between η phases can be {{restrained}} because surrounding Mg and Zn atoms {{are easy to}} be captured by those larger η phases, and therefore, such G.P. zone can be wrapped by more Al atoms, which explains <b>why</b> a <b>certain</b> quantity of G.P. zones can still exist after sufficient aging.|$|R
25|$|In 73 {{individual}} cases reviewed by Evers and Ellger, 57 patients heard tunes that were familiar, while 5 heard unfamiliar tunes. These tunes ranged from religious pieces to childhood favorites, and also included popular {{songs from the}} radio. Vocal and instrumental forms of classical music were also identified in some patients. Keshavan found that the consistent feature of musical hallucinations was that it represented a personal memory trace. Memory traces refer to anything that may seem familiar to the patient, which indicated <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> childhood or familiar songs were heard.|$|E
25|$|In the Pulitzer Prize winning Guns, Germs, and Steel (1999), author Jared Diamond {{points to}} {{geography}} {{as the answer}} to <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> states were able to grow and develop faster and stronger than others. His theory cited the natural environment and raw materials a civilization was blessed with as factors for success, instead of popular century old claims of racial and cultural superiority. Diamond says that these natural endowments began with the dawn of man, and favored Eurasian civilizations due to their location along similar latitudes, suitable farming climate, and early animal domestication.|$|E
25|$|To decide {{exactly where}} a new topic or thought begins within a biblical text {{involves}} {{a degree of}} subjectivity {{on the part of}} the reader. This subjective element may help explain differences amongst the various masoretic codices in some details of the section divisions (though their degree of conformity is high). It may also explain <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> verses which might seem like introductions to a new topic lack a section division, or why such divisions sometimes appear in places where no new topic seems indicated. For this reason, the parashah divisions may at times contribute to biblical exegesis.|$|E

25|$|Individual {{intelligence}} {{is shown to}} be genetically and environmentally influenced. Analogously, collective intelligence research aims to explore reasons <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> groups perform more intelligent than other groups given that c is just moderately correlated with the intelligence of individual group members. According to Woolley et al.'s results, neither team cohesion nor motivation or satisfaction correlated with c. However, they claim that three factors were found as significant correlates: {{the variance in the}} number of speaking turns, group members' average social sensitivity and the proportion of females. All three had similar predictive power for c, but only social sensitivity was statistically significant (b=0.33, P=0.05).|$|E
25|$|The Big Bang {{theory is}} the {{prevailing}} cosmological {{model for the}} universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. Despite its success in explaining many observed features of the universe including galactic redshifts, the relative abundance of light elements such as hydrogen and helium, {{and the existence of}} a cosmic microwave background, there are several questions that remain unanswered. For example, the standard Big Bang model does not explain why the universe appears to be same in all directions, why it appears flat on very large distance scales, or <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> hypothesized particles such as magnetic monopoles are not observed in experiments.|$|E
25|$|In India, {{the need}} for {{environmental}} flows has emerged from the hundreds of large dams being planned in the Himalayan rivers for hydro power generation. The cascades of dams planned across the Lohit, Dibang River in the Brahmaputra River , the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi River in the Ganga basin and the Teesta in Sikkim for example, {{would end up in}} the rivers flowing more through tunnels and pen stocks rather than the river channels. There have been some recommendations by various authorities (Courts, Tribunals, Expert Appraisal Committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)) on releasing e-flows from dams. However, these recommendations have never been backed by strong objectives about <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> e-flow releases are needed.|$|E

25|$|Phylogeny {{can give}} {{some sense of}} history when {{combined}} {{with a little bit}} more information. Each difference in the DNA indicates divergence between one species and another. This divergence, whether via drift or natural selection, is representative of some lapse of time. Comparing DNA sequences alone gives a record of the history of evolution with an arbitrary measure of phylogenetic distance “dating” that last common ancestor. However, if information about the rate of genetic mutation is available or geologic markers are present to calibrate evolutionary divergence (i.e. fossils), we have a timeline of evolution. From there, with an idea about other contemporaneous changes in life and environment, we can begin to speculate <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> evolutionary paths might have been selected for.|$|E
25|$|Innate {{immunity}} to gluten {{refers to an}} immune response that works independently of T-cell receptor or antibody recognition of the 'innate' peptide. This peptide acts directly on cells, such as monocytes, stimulating their growth and differentiation. Innate {{immunity to}} gluten is complicated by an apparent role gluten has in bypassing normal host defense and peptide exclusion mechanisms in the gut. While not truly innate, these activities allow gliadin to enter into areas where many lymphocytes patron. In bypassing these filters gliadin alters the normal behavior of both digestive cells, called enterocytes or epithelial cells, and lymphocytes. This increases the potential of causing sensitivity (see Underlying Conditions). One potential explanation of <b>why</b> <b>certain</b> people become sensitive is that these individuals may not produce adequate peptidases {{in some areas of}} the gut, allowing these peptides to survive. Other explanation for some may be that food chemicals or drugs are weakening the defenses. This can be the case with ω5-gliadin allergy with salicylate sensitivity. There is no clear reasoning, either from genetics or from long term studies of susceptible individuals why these gut peptide restrictions would change.|$|E

These numbers are what Eugene Wigner called magic numbers: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126. Enrico Fermi provided a critical insight by asking her: [...] "Is there any indication of spin orbit coupling?"
