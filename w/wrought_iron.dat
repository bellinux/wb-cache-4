5|$|Wrought iron: During the Han dynasty, new iron {{smelting}} processes led to {{the manufacture}} of new <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> implements for use in agriculture, such as the multi-tube seed drill and iron plough. In addition to accidental lumps of low-carbon <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> produced by excessive injected air in ancient Chinese cupola furnaces. The ancient Chinese created <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> by using the finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo. Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous Warring States period (403–221 BC), {{due to the fact}} that there are <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> items from China dating to that period and there is no documented evidence of the bloomery ever being used in China. The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation. Wagner writes that in addition to the Han Dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictoral evidence of the fining hearth from a Shandong tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text Taiping Jing.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron {{by means of a}} cold blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization. Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> and steel using a fining process.|$|E

5|$|In 1709, Abraham Darby I {{established}} a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron, replacing charcoal, although continuing to use blast furnaces. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron {{was one of}} the factors leading to the Industrial Revolution. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of <b>wrought</b> <b>iron,</b> cast iron, and steel until the 18th century.|$|E

50|$|The chest, 90 cm long, 26 cm {{wide and}} 24 cm high, {{was made of}} oak with iron hinges and lock. It was intact despite the rough {{encounter}} with the plow. It was rectangular with a slightly curved lid and flat bottom. The bottom was joined to the ends via a mortise and through tenon. Pegs were used to attach the sides {{to the bottom and}} end pieces. The ends and sides were trapezoidal and slightly angled. A lock <b>wrought</b> from <b>iron</b> was attached to the front side of the chest.|$|R
50|$|Fairbairn {{conducted}} some of {{the first}} serious studies of the effects of repeated loading of <b>wrought</b> and cast <b>iron</b> girders, showing that fracture could occur by crack growth from incipient defects, a problem now known as fatigue. He built large-scale testing apparatus for the studies, and was partly funded by the Board of Trade.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of Gaudí's {{increasing}} fame, in 1902 the painter Joan Llimona chose Gaudí's features to represent Saint Philip Neri in the paintings for the aisle of the Sant Felip Neri church in Barcelona. Together with Joan Santaló, son of his friend the physician Pere Santaló, he unsuccessfully founded a <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> manufacturing company the same year.|$|E
5|$|Co-fusion steel process: Although British {{scientist}} and historian Joseph Needham speculates {{that it could}} have existed beforehand, the first clear written evidence of the fusion of <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> and cast iron to make steel comes from the 6th century AD in regards to the Daoist swordsmith Qiwu Huaiwen, who was put in charge of the arsenal of Northern Wei general Gao Huan from 543 to 550 AD. The Tang Dynasty (618–907) Newly Reorganized Pharmacopoeia of 659 also described this process of mixing and heating <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> and cast iron together, stating that the steel product was used to make sickles and Chinese sabers. In regards to the latter text, Su Song (1020–1101) made a similar description and noted the steel's use for making swords.|$|E
50|$|There is one Pub called Hanleys Bar. The last Hanleys {{to own and}} run the Bar was {{the late}} Sean and Peig Hanley (Brother and Sister), who also ran a shop on the premises.

50|$|The {{historic}} bridge, {{in storage}} as of 2012, was a single-span Pratt through truss {{built out of}} <b>wrought</b> and cast <b>iron</b> with elements connected by pins. The bridge was 88 ft in length, with a roadway width of 14 ft (one lane), and a portal height of 11.5 ft. It was set on uncoursed fieldstone abutments.|$|R
50|$|Adolf Ulric was a {{dedicated}} and hands-on {{owner of the}} ironworks at Söderfors, who supervised the operation and managed the books. Initially the factory's main products were anchors but with additions and improvements to the facilities he expanded into the production of <b>wrought</b> and pig <b>iron</b> amongst other goods. The products from the ironworks were of good quality and production peaked in 1780.|$|R
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Henry Cort began {{refining}} iron from {{pig iron}} to <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> (or bar iron) using innovative production systems. In 1783 he patented the puddling process for refining iron ore. It was later improved by others, including Joseph Hall.|$|E
5|$|Puddling process: The {{puddling}} process was known the ancient Chinese during the Han Dynasty by the 1st century AD. The improvement of steelmaking processes improved {{the overall quality}} of steel by repeated forging, folding, and stacking of <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> from pig iron to make swords.|$|E
5|$|The San Esteban {{findings}} {{included three}} broken anchors and a <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> swivel gun {{that was also}} broken and unusable. The broken objects may have been kept so they could later be repaired, or may have just been used for ballast. There were four anchors in working condition.|$|E
5000|$|High {{ceilings}} predominate in {{the main}} structure, with first floor ceilings at 26 ft and second and third floors at 22 ft. Interior structure {{is a mixture of}} <b>wrought</b> and cast <b>iron,</b> supporting arched brick floors in a system that was referred to at the time of construction as [...] "fireproof." [...] The building's windows were provided with fireproof shutters.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{uses the}} design {{patented}} by William O. Douglas in 1878 for a lens-type truss bridge, and is {{built out of}} <b>wrought</b> and cast <b>iron,</b> with pin connections, and has a concrete deck. It rests on stone abutments, and has a total span of 53 ft. It {{is one of only}} about twenty lenticular truss bridges remaining in the state. It is now open only to pedestrian traffic.|$|R
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} {{also has}} a smaller, second, inner gate, engraved {{with the names of}} three significant figures: H. Wray RE, who designed the gate; J. Manning, clerk of works, who supervised its fabrication; and Joseph Nelson, the Royal Sappers soldier that <b>wrought</b> the <b>iron.</b> The complex was expanded and altered successively throughout the use of the entry complex for prison's functions. The entry complex was extended north to the female division as a workshop range, the western workshops, leaving a sterile zone beside the perimeter wall. The gatehouse has remained a significant feature and landmark since the closure of the prison, as the main entrance, and housing a café and office areas. Restoration was carried out in 2005, preserving the original stone facade and removing non-original rendering.|$|R
5|$|The {{equivalent}} {{strengths of}} the different armor plates was as follows: 15in (381mm) of <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> was equivalent to 12in (305mm) of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor, and to 7.75in (197mm) of Harvey armor or 5.75in (146mm) of Krupp armor.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of iron or steel {{is a process}} consisting of two main stages. In the first stage pig iron is produced in a blast furnace. Alternatively, it may be directly reduced. In the second stage, pig iron is converted to <b>wrought</b> <b>iron,</b> steel, or cast iron.|$|E
5|$|After 1872, steel {{started to}} be {{introduced}} as a material for construction. Compared to iron, steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight. The French Navy led the way {{with the use of}} steel in its fleet, starting with the , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876. Redoutable nonetheless had <b>wrought</b> <b>iron</b> armor plate, and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel.|$|E
50|$|Malvern is an inner-southern {{suburb of}} Adelaide in the City of Unley. It borders {{adjacent}} suburbs of Unley and Parkside to the north, Highgate to the east, Kingswood {{to the south}} and Unley Park to the west. Many Malvern streets are populated with jacaranda trees, a non-native evergreen tree species, giving a shady aspect to the area in conjunction with the predominant architectural style of single-storey colonial <b>iron</b> <b>wrought</b> residential buildings and Australian villas.|$|R
50|$|Spanish American War Monument to the 71st Infantry Regiment is a {{historic}} war memorial located in Mount Hope Cemetery at Greenburgh, Westchester County, New York. It was built in 1901 at the 71st Infantry Regiment burial plot, and is an 18 feet square and 18 feet high, Quincy granite structure in the Neoclassical style. It has granite steps, <b>wrought</b> and cast <b>iron</b> double entrance doors, and a square cupola. A second set of steps was built in 1905.|$|R
50|$|The use {{of steel}} for {{structural}} purposes was initially slow. The Bessemer process in 1855 made steel production more efficient, and cheap steels, which had high tensile and compressive strengths plus good ductility were available from about 1870, but <b>wrought</b> and cast <b>iron</b> continued to satisfy {{most of the}} demand for iron-based building products, due mainly to problems of producing steel from alkaline ores. These problems, caused principally {{by the presence of}} phosphorus, were solved by Sidney Gilchrist Thomas in 1879.|$|R
