40|$|Coal dust is {{a primary}} {{contributor}} to underground coal-mining disasters and is also {{a major factor in}} adversely affecting the occupational health of mine workers. Pre-wetting the coal seam with <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> is widely considered as one of the effective means of mitigating coal dust generation during mining. Injecting water through inseam long boreholes parallel to the working face is a commonly used technique. However, for most fully-mechanised top-coal caving working faces, inseam gas drainage boreholes are drilled to extract gas from the gassy seam prior to mining. Therefore, there is neither enough time nor space at the working site for an elaborated <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> process. Based on the mining conditions at Panel 9801 of the Yangquan coalfield, this study designed a <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> system through the inseam gas drainage boreholes to control dust arising from the longwall face. Under the influence of abutment pressure, <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> through a set of inseam gas drainage boreholes was experimentally investigated to offset the conflict between <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> and gas drainage in terms of the time and space availability. The relations between the amount of injected <b>water,</b> the <b>injection</b> rate, the seam moisture content and the coal dust level at the working space were investigated. The effect of <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> for dust control at different distances ahead of working face was assessed. With the change of abutment pressure, the effect of <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> to inseam gas drainage and gas emission at working face was revealed and a space-time balance between gas drainage and dust control by <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> was established. The results indicate that under the influence of abutment pressure, <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> through inseam gas drainage boreholes wetted the seam and decreased the dust level at the working face. <b>Water</b> <b>injection</b> only has marginal influence on inseam borehole drainage and has a negligible impact on the gas level produced at the working face. Under the influence of abutment pressure, the optimum area for <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> through the inseam boreholes was the primary fracture opening zone and the secondary fracture development zone...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this master thesis is to evaluate the IOR potential for the NorneField’s E-segment using low salinity <b>water</b> <b>injection.</b> Sea water/high salinity waterwas injected into this formation in the past. The Norne Field’s E-Segment has produced about 40 % of the oil in place so far afteremploying the combination of primary and sea water flooding as a secondary recovery technique {{for a period of}} 7 years of production (i. e. from 6 November 1997 to 1 December 2004). There is about 60 % oil is still trapped as residual oil especially in the Ile and Tofte formations which take hold of about 80 % of oil in the reservoir. The oil trapped as a result of high capillary action of water which keeps this oil immobile. Low salinity <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> could be an effective recovery mechanism to extract this residual oil from the reservoir. For the modeling of low salinity <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> for the Norne Field’s E-Segment, low salinity water is injected from 1 January 2005 as tertiary recovery method using ECLIPSE 100 reservoir simulator and the simulation is ended on 1 December 2022. Simulation studies using the original wells shown that low salinity <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> with optimal concentration of salinity 1, 000 ppm TDS (Total Dissolved Salts) or 1. 0 kg/m 3 revealed substantially higher oil production (34. 13 MSCM) compared to seawater/high salinity <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> (32. 95 MSCM). Having found that the low salinity <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> is an effective IOR technique for the Norne Field’s E-Segment, the next job was to find the different ways to extractmore oil using low salinity <b>water</b> <b>injection.</b> For extracting more oil there are six significant different simulations have been run using different well configurations including base case such as; (1) Base case/sea <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> using the existing or the original wells (i. e. twoinjectors: F- 1 H & F- 3 H and two producers: E- 2 H & E- 3 AH), (2) Low salinity <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> using the original wells, (3) Low salinity <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> using the original wells in addition to a new producing well PROD- 1 H, (4) Low salinity <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> using the original wells in addition to recompleted producing well E- 3 AH, (5) Low salinity <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> using the original wells in addition to a new injection wellINJ- 1 H, and (6) Low salinity <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> using the original wells in addition to recompleted injection well F- 3 H. </p...|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} many {{investigations}} on methods of <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> and their effects on engine performance. <b>Water</b> <b>injection,</b> also known as Anti-Detonant Injection (ADI), is a method of cooling the combustion chamber of an internal combustion (IC) engine by adding water to the incoming air-fuel mixture. Water is far more effective compared to gasoline {{when it comes to}} absorbing heat energy with a latent heat of vaporization about 6 times that of gasoline. By absorbing more heat energy, the in-cylinder temperatures are reduced thus helping to supress detonation. With a cooler and denser air charge, the Engine Control Unit (ECU) can advance the ignition timing and take advantage of the increased power. This study experimentally investigated the effect of <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> on the torque output, air intake temperature and exhaust gas temperatures in a naturally aspirated, spark ignition (SI) engine where water was injected at the intake port just before throttle body. Furthermore, this study also investigated the effect of <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> on detonation. A suitable <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> kit from Snow Performance was chosen to conduct the experiments. The experiments were conducted to test water to fuel mass flow rate ratios of 0 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 % at constant engine speed set at 3000 rpm and at Wide Open Throttle (WOT). The results showed that with increasing mass ratios of water to fuel injected into the engine, the intake air temperature and exhaust gas temperature decreases. <b>Water</b> <b>injection</b> at 20 % mass ratio of water to fuel resulted in the lowest intake air temperature and lowest exhaust gas temperature. The engine torque on the other hand was observed to decrease with increasing <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> flow rate. However due to the lower intake temperature, advancing the ignition timing is permitted. It was found that with <b>water</b> <b>injection,</b> the knock is suppressed and detonation occurs at later spark ignition timing. It was concluded that <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> at 15 % mass ratio of water to fuel was the optimal injection amount for the Ford Barra engine operating at the speed of 3000 rpm with WOT. At this ratio of <b>water</b> <b>injection,</b> the power output was the highest with the ignition timing at 27 °bTDC (where knock occurs) and also produces low exhaust gas temperature and low intake air temperature compare to the engine‟s original performance characteristics...|$|R
