500|$|... "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] {{and three}} other tracks written by the group and Absolute {{appeared}} on the Spice album. The songs were produced and recorded {{for the most part}} at Olympic Studios in Barnes, London. At this time, the Autotune facility was not available and most of the vocals were recorded with few adjustments made afterwards, as Wilson remembers: [...] "Because of the fact we were not using computers, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> them very hard. They were in that recording booth for hours because we just had to get the right take".|$|E

500|$|Berryman {{discontinued}} {{his university}} studies {{to prepare for}} the entrance examination for Staff College, Camberley. Eighteen Australian Army officers sat the exam that year, but only Berryman and one other officer passed. Only two Australian officers were accepted into staff college each year, so Berryman's [...] attendance from 1926 to 1928 marked him out as one of the Australian Army's rising talents. It also allowed him to forge useful contacts with the British Army. Berryman later recalled, [...] "The advantage of this was that in war we had the same doctrine of tactics and administration, which was essential if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> together. More than that, the officers who had to carry out their duties in cooperation knew each other personally." [...] After graduation he was posted to the High Commission of Australia, London, from 1929 to 1932, where he served under the Military Liaison Officer, Major General Julius Bruche.|$|E
500|$|Gray {{wanted the}} film to be as {{realistic}} as possible; accordingly, the actors did most of their own stunts, and computer-generated imagery was used very sparingly. The second unit, under director Alexander Witt and cinematographer Josh Bleibtreu, filmed establishing shots, the Venice canal chase sequence, and the Los Angeles chase sequence {{over a period of}} 40 days. Filming on location posed some challenges. The opening heist sequence in Venice, Italy, was strictly monitored by the local authorities, due to the high speeds the boats were driven at. The frigid temperatures at Passo Fedaia in the Italian Alps created problems during production: [...] "The guns would jam, and if you could imagine not being able to walk 40 feet with a bottle of water without it freezing, those are the conditions <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in," [...] Gray remarked. Pedestrians had to be allowed to use the sidewalks of Hollywood Boulevard between takes. Also, scenes which took place on freeways and city streets were only filmed on weekends.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Gordon {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win of the 2009 season in front of 176,300 who attended the race. He also earned $541,874 in race winnings. Gordon was delighted with his victory: [...] "Incredible team effort. This whole year has been amazing. What a great car. I've never had a car like this at Texas. We finally had one {{and put it in}} position." [...] Johnson was happy with his second-place result, saying, [...] "It was nice to get our car up front and get some clean air on it. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> really hard all day long to keep the car right. I'm very proud of the team." [...] Third-place finisher Biffle was candid with his performance: [...] "We worked our way {{all the way back to}} fourth, third -- 15 more laps, would've passed [...] and then a little while longer we could've gotten [...] But, I just ran out of time, lost track position and weren't able to capitalize on it." ...|$|E

Pat Robertson gives more fodder to our enemies." [...] Ham said, referring to secularists and atheists who applauded Robertson online for his statements. He {{went on to say}} that, [...] "Such leaders — including Pat Robertson — <b>have</b> a lot <b>to</b> answer to the Lord for one day, such leaders are guilty of putting stumbling blocks in the way of kids and adults in regards to believing God’s word and the Gospel." ...|$|R

500|$|Rebellion {{was given}} {{materials}} from the film's production, including footage and the full script, in order to recreate {{the feel of the}} film and lend authenticity to the game. The game's plot is loosely based on the film's, with the player character working to remove traces of Alien and Predator presence in a small American town. Despite similarities to the movie, the ending is different and the game does not feature the [...] "predalien", a Predator-Alien hybrid introduced in Alien vs. Predator. The directors of the film, the Brothers Strause, are fans of Rebellion's PC Aliens vs. Predator game and worked with the studio to develop Aliens vs. Predator: Requiems premise. In an interview with IGN, Rebellion's Tim Jones said [...] "Fox is very protective of their franchise and take [...] great care to make sure it is treated properly. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> within strict confines to remain consistent with the movie and everything we did had to be approved by the studio." [...] The game's system of honor points was considered crucial by Rebellion, who felt that the Predators, despite being the [...] "bad guys", were characterized by a strict code of honor.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} {{received}} generally mixed to negative reviews. Many critics said {{the series was}} too similar to The Office and its mock documentary style. In particular, several commentators said the naive and well-meaning Leslie Knope character too closely resembled The Office protagonist Michael Scott, the well-intentioned but dimwitted manager of a paper company sales office. Maureen Ryan, television reviewer for the Chicago Tribune, said Parks and Recreation surpassed the Friends spin-off Joey as the [...] "worst example of NBC's tendency to extend its franchises well beyond what is desirable or logical." [...] Daniels said of the comparisons between Leslie Knope and Michael Scott, [...] "My sense {{is that if we}} had built 'Parks and Recreation' around a 90-year-old Maasai warrior people would still have said, 'He reminds me of [...] Michael Scott'. There was just no way to escape it." [...] Poehler acknowledged that there was some validity to the comparisons, but felt that the series overcame them with the production of [...] "Rock Show": [...] "I think it was something <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> through in the beginning, and I’m kind of hoping we’re {{on the other side of}} that and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it’s just a completely different world in a similar style." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Rock Show", {{the first}} season finale of Parks and Recreation was written by Norm Hiscock and {{directed}} by series co-founder Michael Schur. Schur said he felt [...] "Rock Show" [...] marked a change in tone for the series and struck a better balance between personal and professional stories {{than any of the}} other episodes from the season. Schur said: [...] "We treated that whole six-episode season like a pilot. If you go back and watch those episodes now, you can see us making changes. The sixth episode is different in tone than the first. And we made some character tweaks, like every show ever does". Amy Poehler said she believed [...] "Rock Show" [...] would end what she described as the inevitable comparisons between Parks and Recreation and The Office, which is also produced by Parks creators Schur and Greg Daniels. Poehler said, [...] "I think it was something <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> through in the beginning, and I’m kind of hoping we’re on the other side of that and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it’s just a completely different world in a similar style.” Schur made his directorial debut with [...] "Rock Show", and had only one day of preparation before directing the episode. While preparing to direct the episode, Schur was asked to make an appearance on The Office as Mose Schrute, the cousin of Dwight Schrute and a popular minor character, in the fifth season finale episode, [...] "Company Picnic". Schur regretfully declined because he needed the time to work on [...] "Rock Show", leading Office episode writers Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta to create the character Rolf, Dwight's friend played by James Urbaniak, as an alternative.|$|E

5000|$|The {{group was}} pleasantly {{surprised}} at the positive reactions the album received. Gutsov said that [...] "Most people say that Night WinD has the melody in them and we create really melodic songs and easy <b>to</b> perceive sounds. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in such way and save our reputation {{all over the world}} as a melodic rock-band." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "When {{we did the}} 'Music' video, it was a weird time. She was {{pregnant}} and we didn't want her to look pregnant – so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> around that. We had an idea to do a fun party video with her and her girls, {{make it a little}} bling and cowboy hats and all that.

2500|$|Raymond Poulidor {{was the son}} of Martial and Maria Poulidor, {{small farmers}} outside the hamlet of Masbaraud-Mérignat, where the Creuse region east of Limoges meets the département of Haute-Vienne. He was born in the same year that his {{eventual}} directeur sportif, Antonin Magne, became world road race champion. Poulidor began working on the farm where, he remembered, [...] "the soil was poor and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hard; farming incomes were poor." [...] The need for working hands on the farm meant he left school at 14 even though he wanted to continue his studies. Local entertainment went little further than village fairs, with coconut shies, sack-races, competitions for bottles of home-made jam... and inter-village cycle races.|$|E
2500|$|Poehler {{said the}} first season {{struggled}} {{in part due to}} extremely high expectations from comparisons to The Office. After the first season ended, she said, [...] "I think it was something <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> through in the beginning, and I'm kind of hoping we're {{on the other side of}} that and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it's just a completely different world in a similar style." [...] Likewise, Schur said he believed much of the early criticism stemmed from the fact that audiences were not yet familiar with the characters, and he thought viewers who revisited the episodes would enjoy them more with a better understanding of the characters.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{discourage}} the cheap tricks of controversy, the retort, {{the search for}} inconsistency. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> realize that these things are as foolish and ill-bred and anti-social as shouting in conversation or making puns; and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> out habits of thought purged from the sin of assurance. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do this for our own good quite as much as {{for the sake of}} intercourse.|$|R
5000|$|From {{any given}} {{configuration}} we can, in general, create several CSFs. CSFs are therefore sometimes also called N-particle symmetry adapted basis functions.

5000|$|... "There will be changes," [...] he continued. [...] "I will be tweaking a few things, {{and we will}} {{be looking}} at the playing system. I'm still stunned about what <b>has</b> happened, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{revitalise}} and rejuvenate the team quickly. Frank Burrows brought me to Cardiff and did everything within his power for the club. But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look forward, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> quickly. That's what Frank would want." ...|$|R
2500|$|Pulis {{began his}} career at Bristol Rovers where he joined their school of {{football}} excellence in Eastville from Newport YMCA. Pulis cites his time at Eastville as an excellent grounding with his Rovers team mate and friend Ian Holloway also making it in football management. [...] "We learned our trade at a football club with really, really good people who had old fashioned values," [...] I truly believe that it's {{because of the way}} we were brought up back then that we have managed to go on and achieve what we have done in the game. [...] "The basic principles were drilled into us, {{both on and off the}} pitch. Nothing was given to us and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> very, very hard for everything we got." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the August 11 Iowa Straw Poll, Huckabee took {{second place}} with 2,587 votes, roughly 18 percent. Huckabee spent $57.98 per {{vote in the}} Straw Poll, which is the lowest among the top three finishers. Since Romney was {{expected}} by the vast majority to take first in the poll, many declared Huckabee the big winner. The National Review said that [...] "When it was all over, {{there was no doubt}} that the winner of the day was Huckabee." [...] Huckabee told reports that [...] "It is beyond huge. Tonight, for all practical purposes, we won the Iowa straw poll. No one was even saying we would come in second. You gotta admit, for what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with, the resources we had, for us to surge, coming in second, is the victory, it is the story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{production}} overhaul and the studio's attempts for more cost-efficient animated features, Mark Dindal urged for [...] "a simpler approach that emphasized the characters rather than overwhelming special effects or cinematic techniques". Because {{of the subsequent}} departure of Deja, animator Dale Baer inherited the character of Yzma. Using Eartha Kitt's gestures during recording sessions, Baer commented that [...] "She has a natural voice for animation and really got into the role. She would gesture wildly and it was fun just to watch her. She would come into each session almost serious and very professional and suddenly she would go wild and break up laughing." [...] Ranieri was later asked {{to serve as the}} supervising animator of Kuzco (as a human and a llama), though he would admit being reluctant at first until he discovered that Kuzco [...] "had a side to him, {{there was a lot of}} comedy potential and as a character he went through an arc". Pudleiner was also reassigned to work as an animator of the human version of Kuzco. In addition to drawing inspiration from David Spade during recording sessions, the Kuzco animation team studied llamas at the zoo, visited a llama farm, watched nature documentaries, and even observed the animals up close when they came for a visit to the studio. For the rewritten version of Pacha, animator Bruce W. Smith observed that [...] "Pacha is probably the most human of all the characters," [...] and further added that he [...] "has more human mannerisms and realistic traits, which serve as a contrast to the cartoony llama he hangs out with. He is the earthy guy who brings everything back into focus. Being a big fellow about six-foot-five and weighing about 250 pounds <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hard to give him a sense of weight and believability in his movement." ...|$|E
5000|$|Primark, {{a leading}} high street fashion chain, has been blamed {{that three of}} its Indian {{suppliers}} are using child labour in their factories. After BBC Panorama’s six months undercover investigation, they discovered the Indian suppliers were sub-contracting middlemen who employed children at Bhavanisagar refugee camp. Investigators found a 9-year-old boy who is working in the refugee camp sweatshop “Sometimes we get major orders in and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> double quick. I get paid a few rupees for finishing each garment, but in a good day I can make 40 rupees (60p)” and “The beads we sew are very small and when we work late at night <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> by candle - the electricity in the camp is poor.” [...] Primark sub-contractors hired young children <b>to</b> <b>work</b> under poor working conditions, paying them as little as 13p an hour and they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> up <b>to</b> 48 hours a week. After BBC Panorama investigation discovered that the Indian suppliers had used child labour to carry out embroidery and sequin work, Primark then fired the Indian suppliers.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Steve Albini for his Matter column in 1983, singer and guitarist Bob Mould told Albini: [...] "We're {{going to try to}} do something bigger than anything like rock & roll and the whole puny touring band idea. I don't know what it's going <b>to</b> be, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> that out, but it's going to go beyond the whole idea of 'punk rock' or whatever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Things {{will grow}} and ripen {{as if it}} were a comet year," [...] said Will. [...] "The public temper will soon get to a cometary heat, now the {{question}} of Reform has set in.
