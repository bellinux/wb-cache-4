Mosimane said; [...] "We have good players playing in Europe and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> players that we haven't called up. There is a striker who is {{constantly}} scoring goals, Davide Somma. He is busy scoring and I'm monitoring that. I'm monitoring {{whether he can}} add value to our team… it is not because he plays overseas" [...] after mentioning a planned trip to Europe {{to take a closer}} look at some of these players.|$|E
2500|$|David Sullivan blamed {{former manager}} Steve Bruce for the club's relegation, {{accusing him of}} buying poorly the {{previous}} summer, and singled out Franck Queudrue and Richard Kingson as particularly poor, calling Kingson a [...] "waste of space". Queudrue hit back, {{saying that he had}} not played enough to be judged so harshly. Sullivan apologised to Queudrue for his outburst, but not to Kingson, who expressed his sadness at the incident, which he described as a [...] "slap in the face". Kingson was released: McLeish said, [...] "It's about opinions and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> plans, so {{for the sake of his}} first-team future, we have let Richard move on." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a December 2008 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Gibbard laughed off suggestions that The Postal Service's long overdue follow-up to their 2003 hit Give Up {{would be an}} indie version of the Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy, which took 15 years to produce and release. Gibbard said that both he and Tamborello do not {{see it as a}} priority in light of their main projects, Death Cab for Cutie and Dntel, respectively. He said, [...] "The anticipation of the second record has been a far bigger deal for everybody except the two of us... I don't know about it being the indie-rock Chinese Democracy, but now that Chinese Democracy has come out, I guess it just becomes the second Postal Service record that will never come out. There never really was a plan to do a second album. We work from time to time together but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> things that take up all of our time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{concerns}} with Qatar's bid {{deal with the}} extreme temperatures. The World Cup is always held in the European off-season in June and July and during this period the average daytime high in most of Qatar is in excess of 40°C (104°F), with the average daily low temperatures not dropping below 30°C (86°F). Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the 2022 Qatar bid chairman, responded saying [...] "the event has to be organised in June or July. We {{will have to take}} the help of technology to counter the harsh weather. We have already set in motion the process. A stadium with controlled temperature is the answer to the problem. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> plans up our sleeves as well." [...] The first five proposed stadiums are planned to employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to 20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the upper tiers of the stadiums will be dis-assembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst the {{reviewer}} in The Guardian of 16 May 1928 {{seemed to}} feel that the play itself showed no great originality, he was impressed with Laughton, saying [...] "we can hardly resist the play despite its wheezy start and inability to accelerate, because M. Poirot is presented in the flesh by Mr. Charles Laughton, who, unlike much youth of brilliant hopes, continues to perform almost more than he so lavishly promised.” The reviewer concluded, [...] "M. Poirot sifts the alibis of the assembled company, finds a scent and hunts it close. None of the other characters appears to have any more personality than is necessary for a human fragment of the puzzle. It is hardly needed. Mr. Laughton is there, and he cannot fail to entertain, whether he is in the supreme frenzy of vigilance, or relaxing over the oldest of old brandies, or making a tender gesture to a charming young lady who is as English as a rose and not, it seems, more talkative or intellectual. Scarcely the wife for Poirot, but let us not be fussy and make difficulties. Mr. Laughton is an important arrival in Crookery Nook, yet we trust he will not stay there too long. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> uses for such an actor than to brood over the fingermarks on the dagger and discover why the parlourmaid was in the garden at the moment of the crime.” ...|$|E
