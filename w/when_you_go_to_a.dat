As Thomas sat by the window of the junior day-room reading a magazine, and deeply {{interested}} in it, there fell upon his face such a rapt, angelic expression that the sight of it, silhouetted against the window, roused Master P. Burge, his fellow-Blackburnite, as it had been a trumpet-blast. To seize a Bradley Arnold's Latin Prose Exercises and hurl it across the room was with Master Burge the work of a moment. It struck Thomas on the ear. He jumped, and turned some shades pinker. Then he put down his magazine, picked up the Bradley Arnold, and sat on it. After which he resumed his magazine.|$|E
60|$|Now, poets in our epoch {{will tend}} towards ecclesiastical {{religion}} strictly {{because it is}} just a little more free than anything else. Take, for instance, the case of symbol and ritualism. All reasonable men believe in symbol; but some reasonable men do not believe in ritualism; by which they mean, I imagine, a symbolism too complex, elaborate, and mechanical. But whenever they talk of ritualism they always seem to mean the ritualism of the Church. Why should they not mean the ritual of the world? It is much more ritualistic. The ritual of the Army, the ritual of the Navy, the ritual of the Law Courts, the ritual of Parliament are much more ritualistic. The ritual of a dinner-party is much more ritualistic. Priests may put gold and great jewels on the chalice; but at least there is only one chalice to put them on. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dinner-party they put in front of you five different chalices, of five weird and heraldic shapes, to symbolise five different kinds of wine; an insane extension of ritual from which Mr. Percy Dearmer would fly shrieking. A bishop wears a mitre; but he is not thought more or less of a bishop according to whether you can see the very latest curves in his mitre. But a swell is thought more or less of a swell according to whether you can see the very latest curves in his hat. There is more fuss about symbols in the world than in the Church.|$|E
60|$|There is this {{drawback}} {{upon the}} happy condition which Mr. Hittaway had achieved,--that it demands a certain expenditure. Let nobody dream {{that he can}} be somebody without having to pay for that honour;--unless, indeed, he be a clergyman. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> concert at Buckingham Palace you pay nothing, it is true, for your ticket; and a Cabinet Minister dining with you does not eat or drink more than your old friend Jones the attorney. But in some insidious, unforeseen manner,--in a way that can only be understood after much experience,--these luxuries of fashion do make a heavy pull on a modest income. Mrs. Hittaway knew this thoroughly, having much experience, and did make her fight bravely. For Mr. Hittaway's income was no more than modest. A few thousand pounds he had of his own when he married, and his Clara had brought to him the unpretending sum of fifteen hundred. But, beyond that, the poor official salary,--which was less than what a decent grocer would make,--was their all. The house in Warwick Square they had prudently purchased on their marriage,--when houses in Warwick Square were cheaper than they are now,--and there they carried on their battle, certainly with success. But two thousand a year does not go very far in Warwick Square, even though you sit rent free, if you have a family and absolutely must keep a carriage. It therefore resulted that when Mr. and Mrs. Hittaway went to Scotland, which they would endeavour to do every year, it was very important that they should accomplish their aristocratic holiday as visitors at the house of some aristocratic friend. So well had they played their cards in this respect, that they seldom failed altogether. In one year they had been the guests of a great marquis quite in the north, and that had been a very glorious year. To talk of Stackallan was, indeed, a thing of beauty. But in that year Mr. Hittaway had made himself very useful in London. Since that they had been at delicious shooting lodges in Ross and Inverness-shire, had visited a millionaire at his palace amidst the Argyle mountains, had been fêted in a western island, had been bored by a Dundee dowager, and put up with a Lothian laird. But the thing had been almost always done, and the Hittaways were known as people that went to Scotland. He could handle a gun, and was clever enough never to shoot a keeper. She could read aloud, could act a little, could talk or hold her tongue; and let her hosts be who they would and as mighty as you please, never caused them trouble by seeming to be out of their circle, and on that account requiring peculiar attention.|$|E

[...] Dr. Luke and Max Martin had written the melody, and asked Bonnie McKee to write lyrics.

[...] Curtis was also happy with the production of the album and was impressed with Hannett's work. Hook conceded in 2006, [...] "It definitely didn't turn out sounding the way I wanted it ...

5000|$|The album {{sounds like}} {{straightforward}} hardcore at first glance; with volume and power being emphasized over melody, it's the Hüsker Dü record that least sounds like Hüsker Dü. Bob Mould once {{referred to it}} as [...] "the bad part of the acid...It sounds like <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gig and get your ears blown off". The album was recorded just as they went on a tour of various places in the country, those close to the band say upon their return the band was louder, faster and noisier than before. The magazine Discords said about it: [...] "It's hard to believe but the only Minneapolis hardcore band have gotten even faster during their stay away." [...] Yet there are some elements emerging under the wash of noise that foreshadow the band's future direction. [...] "Don't Try To Call" [...] is one of their most melodic early songs, while Hart's [...] "Data Control" [...] slows the tempo to conjure a creepy musical mood to match the paranoia of the lyrics.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{tradition}} of making most of Ferraro's records where he imagined an album as being a stage play, film or opera, what would later be an album named after the crime-and-poverty-heavy Los Angeles area of Skid Row began {{as a series of}} poems named after The Terminator (1984), a film set in Los Angeles. The movies Colors (1988) and Boyz n the Hood (1991) were influences throughout the whole writing process when he the turned the poems into album lyrics and changed the name to Skid Row. As Ferraro said, [...] "I kind of see it as if, you know <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> movie house, there's Colors and Boyz n the Hood, and then there's Skid Row, this weird B-movie from the time that nobody really saw." [...] Skid Row was the second record in Ferraro's career where he produced in an actual studio. Ferraro {{said in an interview that}} [...] "it's cool to be in an actual space that is just dedicated to you crafting this work. You really [...] in on certain things and spend more time being focused." [...] One difference of making Skid Row from his previous releases is that the recording was done first before mixing instead of all at one time.|$|E

30|$|Thus {{a further}} {{definition}} of rituals {{is that they}} are patterned human activities with deep cultural meaning, and each cultural group stipulates this distinct meaning. Cultural meanings of different ethnic groups may be quite different.

40|$|The {{internet}} has many characteristics that support extremists' information operations, {{such as being}} able to reach large audiences. Yet the internet also has inherent weaknesses that can be exploited. One of these weaknesses is the ambiguous nature of the net. You trust that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> website that it is legitimate. If it looks professional, you {{tend to believe that}} the site is real. However, criminals or terrorists could just as easily be running that website. The same is true when you chat with someone online. […]. Terrorist organizations also have an inherent weakness that can be exploited using the internet. This weakness is the decentralized nature of terrorist organizations. Many terrorist organizations that do not have state sponsorship organize and accomplish work utilizing social networks versus a hierarchy command structure. This only makes sense. Individuals engaged in criminal activities need to work with people they trust so they can accomplish their mission. In the physical world, social networks are very reliable. However, in the virtual world social networks can be exploited because personalities in the virtual world can be real or fictitious. In order to exploit these weaknesses, a cyber system that invisibly drives Islamic extremists from terrorist websites to covertly controlled websites can be developed. I will generically refer to this system as cyber-herding...|$|E

But in terms of the curriculum negotiation process, I've got to choose what I wanted to leam. (Melissa II 27 / 11 / 01 : 3) This thesis focuses on the process of negotiating the curriculum with twelve pre-service teachers registered for the Bachelor of Education (Primary) Degree during their Mathematics Education Course in their third year of study. The research is presented methodologically as an action research located within two paradigmatic positions, interpretive and critical. The research attempted to understand, interpret and critique the process of curriculum negotiation within the context of teacher education in South Africa In order to understand the negotiated curriculum process, experiences of the participants are presented through the use of their voices within the thesis. The interpretation is based on the construction and reconstruction of meaning during the enactment of the negotiated curriculum process and during the writing and reviewing of this thesis. The critique is rooted in the historical, cultural and social contexts of both the students and the author. The main contention of this thesis is that curriculum negotiation is not necessarily a suitable vehicle for developing a critical pedagogy in pre-service teacher education when all the participants form a homogenous group in this case, white middle-class women. The democratic values promoted within the context of our curriculum negotiation were fraught with dilemmas and entrenched the values of western liberalism. At most, the curriculum negotiation process {{and the development of a}} democratic learning environment, promoted a conscientisation at an individual level, namely a ' transformation of consciousness'. The democratic values promoted in our pedagogy were not sufficient in bringing about social change, a 'transformation for social action'...|$|E
