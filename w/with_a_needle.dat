Nani seriously injures Sudeep <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>needle.</b> The latter clips Nani's wing and fatally stabs him with the same needle. Nani jumps through the flame of a burning match then into a loaded cannon, which fires. The {{projectile}} passes through Sudeep and hits an oxygen cylinder, which explodes and kills him. Bindu takes the fly's wing and makes an amulet with it. One day when travelling to work, an eve teaser bothers her; Nani, again reborn as a fly, attacks him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> before announcing his return.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage). This is the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the sample is obtained <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E
5|$|The 'Beating of the bounds' is {{an ancient}} annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the {{traditional}} checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364. The Admiral of the Port of Poole (the mayor) and other dignitaries, {{and members of the}} public sail {{from the mouth of the}} River Frome to Old Harry Rocks to confirm the Mayor's authority over the water boundaries of the harbour and check for any encroachments. As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember the bounds of their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving the beating of a boy and pricking of a girl's hand <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>needle.</b> In modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) arrives at the hospital in San Diego where Scully introduces him to Emily. Mulder tells Scully that he had Melvin Frohike look into Emily's case: her surrogate mother is a woman named Anna Fugazzi (slang for fake), {{and there are no}} true records of how Emily came into the world. Mulder, along with Scully's family, attend a meeting regarding Emily's adoption at the San Diego Hall of Justice. Mulder tells the Judge that Emily was conceived from Scully's ova, which was taken from her during her abduction, which the Judge does not believe. Later, Scully receives a call from the County Children's Center that cuts off abruptly. She and Mulder head there, where they find Emily safe, but coming down with a fever. They find a greenish cyst on the back of Emily's neck. Later, when a nurse pierces the cyst <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>needle,</b> green liquid comes out, causing her to become gravely ill, yet Emily appears unaffected. Mulder believes that Emily has the same body chemistry that they have seen before with alien-human hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's case {{is brought}} to trial the {{following}} morning, {{with the assistance of}} the cobbler Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) testify that they have witnessed Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, and want to be rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin laughing at her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike decide that the rest of the trial should be conducted in private. Elizabeth is pricked <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to profess her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth confesses that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat, but Two-Shoes denies this, and the trial is adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements.|$|E

25|$|Standard {{treatment}} for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is cutting {{it open and}} drainage.

25|$|One of {{the more}} common {{problems}} after an abdominoplasty is collection of fluid under the skin after the drains have been removed. A surgeon can aspirate the fluid <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>needle.</b> The drainage stops within a month and {{does not affect the}} final results.|$|E

25|$|Commercial silks {{originate}} from reared silkworm pupae, which are bred {{to produce a}} white-colored silk thread with no mineral on the surface. The pupae are killed by either dipping them in boiling water before the adult moths emerge or by piercing them <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>needle.</b> These factors all contribute {{to the ability of}} the whole cocoon to be unravelled as one continuous thread, permitting a much stronger cloth to be woven from the silk.|$|E
25|$|Pleural {{effusion}} and empyema: Microorganisms {{from the}} lung may trigger fluid {{collection in the}} pleural cavity. If the microorganisms are in the fluid, the collection is an empyema. If pleural fluid is present, it should be collected <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> and examined. Depending on the results, complete drainage of the fluid with a chest tube may be necessary. If the fluid is not drained, bacteria may continue to proliferate because antibiotics do not penetrate the pleural cavity well.|$|E
25|$|A lumbar {{puncture}} is a procedure in which cerebral spinal fluid {{is removed from}} the spine <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>needle.</b> A {{lumbar puncture}} is necessary to look for infection or blood in the spinal fluid. A lumbar puncture can also evaluate the pressure in the spinal column, which can be useful for people with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (usually young, obese women who have increased intracranial pressure), or other causes of increased intracranial pressure. In most cases, a CT scan should be done first.|$|E

Klee's solitary early work ended in 1911, the year he met and {{was inspired by the}} graphic artist Alfred Kubin, and became associated with the artists of the Blaue Reiter.|$|E
25|$|Some LCDs mimic needle tuners <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> graphic {{that moves}} {{in the same way}} as a genuine needle tuner. Somewhat misleadingly, many LED {{displays}} have a 'strobe mode' that mimics strobe tuners by scrolling the flashing of the LEDs cyclically to simulate the display of a true strobe. However, these are all just display options. The way a regular tuner 'hears' and compares the input note to a desired pitch is exactly the same, with no change in accuracy. For more on how strobe tuners work see the dedicated section.|$|E
25|$|A needle, LCD {{or regular}} LED type tuner uses a {{microprocessor}} {{to measure the}} average period of the waveform. It uses that information to drive the needle or array of lights. When the musician plays a single note, the tuner senses the pitch. The tuner then displays the pitch {{in relation to the}} desired pitch, and indicates whether the input pitch is lower, higher, or equal to the desired pitch. With needle displays, the note is in tune when the needle is in a 90° vertical position, with leftward or rightward deviations indicating that the note is flat or sharp, respectively. Tuners <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> are often supplied with a backlight, so that the display can be read on a darkened stage.|$|E
