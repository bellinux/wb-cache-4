5|$|The {{red panda}} (Ailurus fulgens), {{also called the}} lesser panda, the red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear, is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a <b>waddling</b> gait due to its shorter front legs; it is {{roughly the size of}} a {{domestic}} cat, though with a longer body and somewhat heavier. It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} usually found in small groups, {{although}} substantial flocks can form at favoured sites. It walks well, without <b>waddling,</b> {{and although it}} normally feeds by upending, it can dive if necessary. It does not often perch in trees, unlike other whistling ducks. It flies at low altitude with slow wingbeats and trailing feet, in loose flocks rather than tight formation. It feeds {{during the day and}} at night in fairly large flocks, often with other whistling duck species, but rests or sleeps in smaller groups {{in the middle of the}} day. They are noisy and display their aggression towards other individuals by throwing back their heads. Before taking off in alarm, they often shake their head sideways.|$|E

25|$|The {{legs are}} short, and their feet are adapted for {{perching}} rather than walking, {{as the front}} toes are partially joined at the base. Swallows are capable of walking and even running, but they do so with a shuffling, <b>waddling</b> gait. The leg muscles of the river martins (Pseudochelidon) are stronger and more robust than those of other swallows. The river martins have other characteristics that separate them from the other swallows. The structure of the syrinx is substantially different between the two subfamilies; and in most swallows the bill, legs and feet are dark brown or black, but in the river martins the bill is orange-red and the legs and feet are pink.|$|E
500|$|Like other parrots, {{cockatoos}} have short legs, strong claws, a <b>waddling</b> gait {{and often}} use their strong bill {{as a third}} limb when climbing through branches. They generally have long broad wings used in rapid flight, with speeds up to [...] being recorded for galahs. The members of the genus Calyptorhynchus and larger white cockatoos, such as the sulphur-crested cockatoo and Major Mitchell's cockatoo, have shorter, rounder wings and a more leisurely flight.|$|E
500|$|Colonies {{are mostly}} on islands {{where there are}} no {{terrestrial}} predators but adult birds and newly fledged chicks are at risk of attacks from the air by gulls and skuas. Sometimes a bird such as an Arctic skua will harass a puffin arriving with a beakful of fish, causing it to drop its catch. The striking appearance, large colourful bill, <b>waddling</b> gait and behaviour of this bird have given rise to nicknames such as [...] "clown of the sea" [...] and [...] "sea parrot". It is the official bird symbol for the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{included}} in the set list of Farmer's 1989 tour and was performed as a duet. Carole Fredericks, one of Farmer's vocalists, portrayed the nurse, and in a long monologue, she complained about one of her female patients, who was difficult to bear. Farmer, hidden beneath Frederick's long dress, suddenly appeared, wearing pyjamas, and performed the song by <b>waddling</b> like a little child. The song was also performed during the Mylenium Tour but included in a medley composed of her 1980s greatest hits. A snippet of the song was performed on the opening night of the Timeless Tour on 7 September 2013 in Paris. As for [...] "My Mum Is Wrong", it does not appear on any of Farmer's albums and has not been performed on stage.|$|E
500|$|The Egyptian vulture {{is usually}} seen singly or in pairs, soaring in {{thermals}} {{along with other}} scavengers and birds of prey, or perched {{on the ground or}} atop a building. On the ground, they walk with a <b>waddling</b> gait. They feed on a range of food, including mammal faeces (including those of humans), insects in dung, carrion, vegetable matter, and sometimes small animals. When it joins other vulture species at a dead animal, it tends to stay on the periphery and waits until the larger species leave. Wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) form {{a significant part of the}} diet of Spanish vultures. In the Iberian Peninsula, landfills are an important food source, with the vultures more likely to occupy territories close to landfill sites. [...] Studies suggest that they feed on ungulate faeces to obtain carotenoid pigments responsible for their bright yellow and orange facial skin. The ability to assimilate carotenoid pigments may serve as a reliable signal of fitness.|$|E
500|$|In 1920, Lloyd {{appeared}} {{twice at}} Hendon Magistrates Court and gave {{evidence of the}} abuse she had suffered from Dillon.

[...] By now, she was becoming increasingly unreliable on stage; she appeared at a theatre in Cardiff for a mere six minutes before being carried off by stage hands. During the performance, she seemed dazed and confused, and she stumbled across the stage. [...] She was conscious of her weak performances and frequently cried between shows. Virginia Woolf was among the audience at the Bedford Music Hall on 8 April 1921 and described Lloyd as [...] "A mass of corruption – long front teeth – a crapulous way of saying 'desire', and yet a born artist – scarcely able to walk, <b>waddling,</b> aged, unblushing." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 20, they sailed {{first to}} England, where Crane was warmly received. [...] They arrived in Athens in early April; between April 17 (when Turkey {{declared}} war on Greece) and April 22, Crane wrote his first published report of the war, [...] "An Impression of the 'Concert'". [...] When he left for Epirus in the northwest, Taylor remained in Athens, where she became the Greek war's first woman war correspondent. [...] She wrote under the pseudonym [...] "Imogene Carter" [...] for the New York Journal, a job that Crane had secured for her. [...] They wrote frequently, traveling throughout the country separately and together. [...] The first large battle that Crane witnessed was the Turks' assault on General Constantine Smolenski's Greek forces at Velestino. [...] Crane wrote, [...] "It {{is a great thing}} to survey the army of the enemy. [...] Just where and how it takes hold upon the heart is difficult of description." [...] During this battle, Crane encountered [...] "a fat <b>waddling</b> puppy" [...] that he immediately claimed, dubbing it [...] "Velestino, the Journal dog". Greece and Turkey signed an armistice on May 20, ending the 30-day war; Crane and Taylor left Greece for England, taking two Greek brothers as servants and Velestino the dog with them.|$|E
500|$|The common {{starling}} is [...] long, with a wingspan of [...] and {{a weight}} of [...] Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the culmen is [...] and the tarsus is [...] The plumage is iridescent black, glossed purple or green, and spangled with white, especially in winter. The underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted {{than those of}} adult females {{at a given time}} of year. The throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed. The legs are stout and pinkish- or greyish-red. The bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip; in the winter it is brownish-black but in summer, females have lemon yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue-grey bases. Moulting occurs once a year- in late summer after the breeding season has finished; the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white (breast feathers) or buff (wing and back feathers), which gives the bird a speckled appearance. The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off. Juveniles are grey-brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile feathering, especially on the head. They can usually be sexed by the colour of the irises, rich brown in males, mouse-brown or grey in females. Estimating the contrast between an iris and the central always-dark pupil is 97% accurate in determining sex, rising to 98% if the length of the throat feathers is also considered. The common starling is mid-sized by both starling standards and passerine standards. It is readily distinguished from other mid-sized passerines, such as thrushes, icterids or small corvids, by its relatively short tail, sharp, blade-like bill, round-bellied shape and strong, sizeable (and rufous-coloured) legs. In flight, its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive, while on the ground its strange, somewhat <b>waddling</b> gait is also characteristic. The colouring and build usually distinguish this bird from other starlings, although the closely related spotless starling may be physically distinguished by the lack of iridescent spots in adult breeding plumage.|$|E
