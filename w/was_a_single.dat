5|$|The Beaufort was {{too fast}} for the torpedoes available, so new tactics had to be {{developed}} and the aircraft was restricted to mine-laying or bombing missions. It was soon grounded for other reasons. After No. 22 Squadron carried out more trials, it began operations on 31 August 1940. On 11 September a torpedo attack succeeded in hitting a 6,000 ton freighter. On 17 September No. 22, 53 and 57 Squadron sank a 1,600 ton freighter in Cherbourg harbour. An E-boat was also destroyed and oil tanks were also set ablaze and burned uncontrollably for several days. The cost <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> Beaufort.|$|E

Only damage near Schoharie was at the F4 level, and some sources doubt it even reached that intensity at all.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{cast and}} credits were {{unbilled}} {{and very few}} details emerged, but the film has been claimed to have featured Lon Chaney by two scholars. Jon Mirsalis states that Lon Chaney has an unbilled part as a pawnbroker. Michael Blake also notes that Lon Chaney {{had a role in}} the film, but Blake also states that the film had only one reel and lists the production code as 0119. Blake's claim that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> reel is the subject of dispute because the release was originally as a two reel production in publications and many advertisements for the film.|$|E

5|$|There was {{a period}} of renewed {{lobbying}} for a road crossing in the 1920s and 1930s, at which time the only vehicle crossing <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> passenger and vehicle ferry. Sir William Denny championed the expansion of that service in the 1930s, providing and operating on behalf of the London and North Eastern Railway two additional ferries that aimed to supplement the services of the adjacent railway bridge. Their success allowed for the addition of two more craft in the 1940s and 1950s, by which time the ferries were making 40,000 crossings annually, carrying 1.5 million passengers and 800,000 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|This {{research}} has shown that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> origin of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in the Amanita genus.

This clade has a single ancestor (or a very small number) and seems to have come into being at a very early stage {{in the evolution of the}} genus.|$|E

A cupola topped the structure and stairs beneath the pediment led to a three sets of double doors—one large, the others smaller but otherwise identical. Above each set of doors <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> large window.

The Akela Badge was discontinued in 1925, and all leaders were awarded the Wood Badge on completion of their training. Very few of the fangs issued as Akela Badges can now be found.|$|E
5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{large room}} {{furnished}} {{with some kind}} of bedding and perhaps a bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. The bedding on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day, such as at Guisborough, where men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum, two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were required to be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission.|$|E
