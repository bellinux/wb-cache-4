40|$|AbstractThe Southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus – a vector of West Nile virus – is {{equipped}} with 130 odorant receptors (ORs), which enable young females to locate plants and blood-meal sources and older females to find suitable sites for oviposition. In our attempts to de-orphanize ORs expressed in female antennae, we identified CquiOR 37 and CquiOR 99, which were narrowly tuned to two phenolic compounds, 4 -methylphenol and 4 -ethylphenol. When tested in the Xenopus oocyte recording system the observed EC 50 s for 4 -methylphenol and 4 -ethylphenol were 6. 4 and 18. 2  μM for CquiOR 37 and 14. 4 and 0. 74  μM for CquiOR 99 (goodness of fit, R 2  =  0. 88 – 0. 99), respectively.

A dsRNA construct based on the two genes, CquiOR 37 / 99 -dsRNA was stable in pupa hemolymph for up to 3  h. Pupae injected with CquiOR 37 / 99 -dsRNA, β-galactosidase-dsRNA or water had more than 40 % survival rate at the peak of oviposition (day- 9). qPCR analysis showed individual variation, but significant mean reduction in CquiOR 37 and CquiOR 99 transcript levels in CquiOR 37 / 99 -dsRNA-treated mosquitoes.

As demonstrated through field observations and large-scale experimental tests, wind-driving rain can penetrate the building envelope through design defects or through defects which may develop during its lifetime operation. The {{rate at which the}} penetrated water can be evacuated, which is a function of the drying capacity of the envelope, can affect significantly the durability of building envelope systems. However, adequate methods for quantifying the relative drying capacity of building envelope systems do not exist. The objective of this research is to develop a methodology to evaluate the relative drying capacity of building envelope systems of different compositions and thereby to assist the performance evaluation and design of envelope systems. An innovative experimental procedure has been introduced to apply uniform in-cavity moisture loading by placing a <b>water</b> <b>tray</b> at the bottom of the stud cavity to represent the penetrated water. After a preliminary test for verification and improvement, an experimental program was carried out to monitor the processes of water evaporation from the tray, moisture absorption by envelope materials and moisture evacuation from the envelope. Thirty-one full-size wall specimens of various configurations formed the enclosures of a two-story test hut, located in a large environmental chamber. Tests were carried out over five test periods in 283 days under steady-state "outdoor" conditions that were selected from 10 % worst-drying months of Montreal based on 31 -year weather data. Over 1, 000 electronic sensors and 750 gravimetric samples were installed. By implementing the <b>water</b> <b>tray,</b> a quantitative relationship between in-cavity moisture loading and the moisture responses in the envelope systems was established experimentally for the first time for each wall specimen. A drying capacity indicator has been developed to quantitatively characterize and compare the relative drying capacity of wood-framed building envelope systems. First, load-response profiles are developed by monitoring the evaporation from the water trays as the moisture source in the stud cavity and by monitoring the moisture absorbed in the gravimetric samples in the sheathings. Second, an allowable moisture limit of wood-framed envelopes is set at 20 % MC by weight. Third the region from this 20 % MC to the fiber saturation point (FSP), about 28 % MC depending on wood species, is deemed as a safety margin against fungal decay. Fourth, the loading at which the 20 % MC limit is reached in the moisture response of sheathing was determined from the load-response profiles and was defined as the In-Cavity Evaporation Allowance (ICEA). By comparing the ICEA values obtained from the experimental data for the 31 specimens, the drying performances of these wall configurations were characterized and compared; and ICEA has shown to be a good indicator for evaluating drying capacity of envelopes. To demonstrate the potential of the newly proposed experimental method and the ICEA concept, a procedure is presented to verify quantitatively the acceptability of a wall configuration by matching potential moisture penetration of the wall against its drying capacity. This verification procedure adopts the concept of the LSD (limit state design) principle used in structural engineering. A case study applying this procedure to 12 testing wall assemblies is presented. This thesis research on experimental and analytical investigation on the drying performance of building envelope systems has explored innovative concepts, validated them with quantitative testing procedures, advanced the current understanding and design of building envelope systems, and posed new challenges for future research...|$|E

30|$|Pedagogy in ECEC in Germany {{follows a}} child- and situation-oriented {{tradition}} {{and so does}} the concept of early language education embedded into daily preschool routines. This approach does not only imply specific challenges for the early childhood professional but also for the researcher trying to grasp information on the quality of implementation of this approach. This is especially true for the quality of the interactions between early childhood professionals and children. Child- and situation-oriented pedagogy happens systematically, but is not tied to specific hours of the day, while formal schooling is organized according to a timetable, which {{can also be used to}} plan observations of pedagogical interactions. Appropriate situations to be extended for language education in ECEC may occur throughout the day. One day a conversation with the group at the <b>water</b> <b>tray</b> may happen to be meaningful, and on the other day the professional will have a good and deep talk with one child regarding putting on shoes for going outside. The early childhood professional needs not only to pick up interests and questions of the children systematically, but also spontaneously. Certain situations such as mealtime may be especially suitable to be used for language education, but in general the professional cannot foresee when suitable situations occur. Due to time and cost limitations of researchers as well as practitioners, the researcher can only be present in the setting for a limited time, so it is very likely that the researcher misses out on important interactions and it is arguable if a time sample of 3 – 4  h is representative for the practice in the group and the setting. Praetorius et al. (2014) recently showed for the observations of instructional quality of mathematics lessons in secondary school that the observation of nine lessons would be needed to generate reliable and valid conclusions on the level of cognitive activation. Given the nature of child- and situation-oriented pedagogy in ECEC, it may be hypothesized that observational intervals in ECEC would need to be even longer.|$|E
40|$|Frost {{formation}} on {{the cold}} evaporator surface is a typical problem in household refrigerators. It happens due to humidity present in the ambient air associated with frequent door openings. In addition, mass transfer from stored goods to dry internal cabinet air and moisture infiltration through door gaskets also contribute to frost formation on the evaporator surface. To prevent this, the evaporator has to be defrosted manually or automatically (as in modern refrigerators). To do so, an electrical heater is switched on at a preset time and frequency and defrosts the evaporator. During this time, defrosted water is drained through a pipe into a <b>water</b> <b>tray</b> which is usually placed at {{the vicinity of the}} compressor. There the water evaporates mainly due to heat transfer from hot compressor shell. This system of defrosting and evaporation works well in areas with low relative humidity, where the amount of defrosted water is small and the evaporation rate is higher when compared to places with high relative humidity. Moreover, the compressor shell temperatures of high efficient compressors are not usually high enough to provide the minimum evaporation rate to balance the defrosted water flow rate and thus avoid water overflow. The aim of this work is to get {{a better understanding of the}} defrosted water evaporation process and to come up with low cost, practical and more efficient designs of water trays. To this end a test facility was designed and constructed to reproduce the compressor operating conditions and the defrosted water flow rate and temperature. The test rig was placed within a climate-controlled room with a strict control of air temperature and relative humidity. A mathematical model was also developed to predict the water evaporation rate based on the fundamental conservation equations of mass and energy. Several tests were carried out under different operating conditions and with different water trays designs. The model predictions were compared to the experimental data base with most of the points falling within an error band of ? 10 %...|$|E

When the pump has raised <b>water</b> into the <b>tray,</b> briefly submerging the roots, the pump is rendered inactive using a switch, typically a timer, and the water flows back down the same tube.

40|$|Pitch canker, {{caused by}} Fusarium circinatum, was first {{reported}} in a forestry nursery in the Mpumalanga Province of South Africa in 1990, and it has since spread to almost all forestry nurseries in the country, where it causes significant economic losses. The aim {{of the current study}} was to (i) identify sources of F. circinatum contamination in the Karatara forestry nursery in the Western Cape Province and (ii) manage the disease by implementing an oxidation reduction potential (ORP) -based sanitation method using hydrogen peroxide. The irrigation <b>water,</b> planting <b>tray</b> inserts and seeds were screened for fungal contamination. Fusarium circinatum colonies were identified morphologically and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using speciesspecific primers. Both the irrigation <b>water</b> and planting <b>tray</b> inserts served as sources of inoculum that introduced the pathogen into the nursery. The irrigation water was amended with hydrogen peroxide at an ORP level of 400 mV for an exposure time of 6 h because it was observed that such a treatment effectively killed all F. circinatum spores and was not phytotoxic to pine seedlings under laboratory conditions. In addition, the contaminated planting tray inserts were cleaned in water amended with hydrogen peroxide at an ORP value of 360 mV for 6 h, which was shown to efficiently eliminate all inoculum from planting tray inserts. Since the introduction of the ORP-based sanitation method at Karatara nursery, losses of pine seedlings were reduced to insignificant levels, and field losses were minimized.

40|$|A {{previous}} related {{study has}} indicated that for an {{air source heat pump}} (ASHP) unit having a vertically installed multi-circuit outdoor coil, during reverse cycle defrosting, downwards flowing of melted frost over the outdoor coil surface could affect the defrosting performance, without however giving a detailed quantitative analysis. Therefore an experimental study has been carried out and the study results are reported in this paper. Firstly, a detailed description of a specially built experimental ASHP unit having a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil is presented. This is followed by reporting the experimental results. Finally, a detailed quantitative analysis is presented. The experimental results and the corresponding analysis demonstrated that allowing downwards flowing of the melted frost over a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil would result in a longer defrosting duration and more energy consumption. The study results also suggested that the use of <b>water</b> collecting <b>trays</b> can help mitigate these negative impacts on defrosting performance.

40|$|To {{reconstruct}} {{a building}} is a long-term investment for farmers {{and it is important}} that people with different qualifications are involved at an early stage for making the system adapted to the animals as well the animal keeper. Therefore, ethologists who can contribute with their expertise are needed to design the system and get it to function well for the animals. A Swedish farmer who planned to rebuild her stall for tied dairy cattle to a loose-housing system for recruitment heifers for milk production asked me as an ethologist to find a system which can be fit to her existing tie-stall barn for 30 dairy cows, considering the animal needs in terms of movement, social interactions and play behaviors, and to theoretically compare the system with other systems with respect to the behaviors mentioned. The theoretical comparison between different systems was made through a scientific literature review. In agreement with the animal keeper I set out to fit a system with feeding cubicles, a system with cubicles and a system with deep straw bedding to the barn. After measurements were taken and preliminary drawings were outlined it was found that only the feeding cubicle system was possible to fit to the barn. The space provided will limit the animals to perform some playing behaviors. To decrease aggressive interactions between animals even thought a limiting area it is possible to provide partitions between resources animals compete around to prevent that more than one animal can get success to the resource at a particular place at one time. To increase the animal movement in the system the <b>water</b> <b>trays</b> were moved to the outer wall instead of kept in contact with the stalls. Although this report provides guidelines for rebuilding, other competences regarding building construction and a pre-test of the suggested building solution according to Swedish legislation are needed before the rebuilding can start. The results are directed mainly to the owner of the barn, but the literature review can be used by other cattle farmers and might bring increased understanding of the possible effects of different building solution on the animals...|$|R
