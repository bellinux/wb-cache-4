50|$|Celebrated {{twentieth century}} playwright Eugène Ionesco said that Wilson “surpassed Beckett” because “Wilson's silence is a silence that speaks”. This silence onstage may be unnerving to {{audience}} members but serves a purpose of showing how important language is by its absence. It is Wilson's means of answering his own question: “Why is it <b>no</b> <b>one</b> looks? <b>Why</b> is it <b>no</b> <b>one</b> {{knows how to}} look? <b>Why</b> does <b>no</b> <b>one</b> see anything on stage?”.|$|R
25|$|In 2007, on April 5, a {{northbound}} train {{ran through}} a wildfire on the Isleta Pueblo reservation. No {{one was hurt}} and no equipment was damaged, but officials soon {{tried to find out}} <b>why</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> received notification of the blaze until the incident actually occurred. On the evening of August 24, a southbound train hit a vehicle at a private grade crossing south of Los Lunas. Two people in the vehicle were killed. No one aboard the train was injured. It appears that the Rail Runner personnel followed procedure. On the evening of September 19, a southbound train hit a vehicle at a private grade crossing between Belen and Los Lunas. One person in the vehicle was killed.|$|E
25|$|Neighbours {{had assumed}} the flat was unoccupied, and the odour of decomposing body tissue was {{attributed}} to nearby waste bins. The flat's windows did not allow direct sight into the accommodation. Drug addicts frequented the area, which may explain <b>why</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> questioned the constant noise from the television. Half of her rent was being automatically paid to Metropolitan Housing Trust by benefits agencies, leading officials {{to believe that she}} was still alive. However, over two years, £2,400 in unpaid rent accrued, and housing officials decided to repossess the property. Her corpse was discovered on 25 January 2006 when the bailiffs broke in. The television and heating were still running due to her bills being continually paid for by automatic debit payments and debt forgiveness.|$|E

Emma kisses him on the forehead, causing a pulse of energy to engulf the entire town and restore everyone's true memories while freeing Henry from the effects of the poisoned apple. Snow and Charming reunite with each other and Regina returns to her mansion alone as Emma begins to wonder <b>why</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> is returning to the Other World since the curse is broken. Rumplestiltskin reunites with his true love Belle (Emilie de Ravin) and takes her to a Wishing Well {{deep in the heart of}} the forest, a well with the power to restore that which one had lost. He takes the potion and drops it into the well, causing a purple cloud to emerge and consume Storybrooke as the Clock Tower strikes 8:15.|$|E

500|$|According to MTV's Karl Heitmueller, Smallville's Clark Kent was {{a better}} {{representation}} of the original material and remained [...] "true {{to the heart of}} the story" [...] by showing Clark's selflessness and his struggle between his desires and his obligations. However, Heitmueller wrote that the series would have a difficult time addressing <b>why</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> in Smallville (including Lex Luthor) recognized Clark when he put on the suit. TV Guide's Michael Schneider called it one of the best examples of a superhero adaptation for television, but Christopher Hooton of Metro wrote that Smallville was a story which did not need to be told: [...] "No-one bothered to follow Bruce Wayne's tedious years spent manufacturing microchips before he became Batman, so why must we endure a decade of flannel shirt-wearing Clark Kent bucking hay?" ...|$|E

500|$|Evolve adapts an {{asymmetrical}} multiplayer structure, a {{new concept}} in the video game industry during its development. It was so new that the developer itself worried and wondered <b>why</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else was working on such project. The design team was also uncertain about whether the 4v1 structure would work or not. According to Turtle Rock, when the publishers heard that the original creators of Left 4 Dead were making a new game, they were interested. However, the design team encountered difficulties when they were pitching the game, and used two months {{to prepare for the}} pitching process. According to Robb, publishers were conservative and unsupportive about the idea and [...] " [...] to poke holes" [...] in their pitch. Even though the representatives from these publishers were excited about their pitch after they knew that it would be an extension to the Tank mode in Left 4 Dead, they questioned the ability of Turtle Rock making a triple-A video game, and were uncertain whether it was a project they should invest in.|$|E
500|$|In 2017, author Timothy Tyson {{released}} {{details of}} a 2008 interview with Carolyn Bryant, during which she disclosed that she had fabricated the most sensational part of her testimony. [...] Tyson stated: [...] "she said {{with respect to the}} physical assault on her, or anything menacing or sexual, that that part isn't true". [...] She also said: [...] "nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him". [...] The 72-year-old Bryant said she could not remember the rest of the events that occurred between her and Till in the grocery store. [...] Tyson said that Roy Bryant had been verbally abusive toward Carolyn, and [...] "it was clear she was frightened of her husband". Bryant described Milam as [...] "domineering and brutal and not a kind man". [...] An editorial in The New York Times said: [...] "This admission is a reminder of how black lives were sacrificed to white lies in places like Mississippi.

500|$|The cast {{itself has}} {{received}} criticism from reviews. Lundigran criticized {{the manner in}} which romantic interactions play out, stating that [...] "considering that the love story is so integral to everything that happens—not to mention forming the central image of the box art—it's incomprehensible <b>why</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> says 'I love you' to anyone, ever". With Squall, he felt that [...] "FFVIII does break one cardinal rule: when your story is character centered, you'd better center it on a character the audience can care about. Squall, unfortunately, just doesn't fit the bill". However, GameSpot felt that Final Fantasy VIII shifts the story from the [...] "epic" [...] concepts of Final Fantasy VII to the [...] "personal", in that [...] "the characters and their relationships are all extremely believable and complex; moreover, the core romance holds up even under the most pessimistic scrutiny". A later editorial by IGN's Ryan Clements echoed this sentiment, appreciating that Squall and Rinoa's single kiss during the finale serves [...] "one of the player's main rewards for hours of dedication". Although the reviewer at Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine acknowledged possible fears over a romantic storyline, he stated that [...] "it's only later in the game, once you are really attached to all the distinct and complex characters, that the more emotional themes are gradually introduced".|$|E

Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "Unless you're allergic to musicals in general and Broadway in particular, you should find that a compelling central story, a strong cast, an out-of-the-procedural-mold premise and some rousing, roof-raising numbers more than compensate for any lingering problems." [...] He ultimately gave it three and a half stars out of four. The A.V. Club reviewer Noel Murray praised the cast and Eileen's divorce storyline. He mainly criticized the staging and arrangement of the musical numbers saying they threatened the realism of the show and wrote they weren't completely [...] "digetic". He ultimately gave the episode a B. Another A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff criticized the series for not avoiding clichés but also wrote [...] "the show is so damned sincere about how much it embraces the clichés of the backstage Broadway story that those inclined to like this sort of thing—and I'm very much one of them—will forgive it some of these excesses." [...] He also criticized the adoption storyline. Despite this, he went on to compare the series to Hill Street Blues, ER and The West Wing.|$|E
500|$|Peng made regular {{inspection}} {{tours of}} the Chinese provinces after becoming Defense Minister in 1953. In a tour on Guangzhou in April 1958, he openly criticized Mao, saying [...] "The Chairman talks {{all the time about}} more, faster, better, and more economical results. That is annoying. What does he want with chanting these liturgies all the time?" [...] On an inspection tour through Gansu in October 1958, Peng observed many of the problems associated with the Great Leap Forward. Mature crops were left to die in the field because all of the young men had been drafted to operate primitive backyard furnaces. When Peng asked an old peasant <b>why</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was collecting the harvest, he received the answer: [...] "unless the centre sends down a great comrade, one cannot stand up against this storm." [...] On the same tour Peng heard complaints that household utensils were being melted down for [...] "steel", and that houses and orchards were cut and torn down in order to provide fuel for the backyard furnaces. In a subsequent tour through his native province of Hunan, later in 1958, Peng observed the same problems associated everywhere with the Great Leap Forward: serious food shortages; hungry children and babies; elders who expressed bitterness and anger; and arrogant, boasting Party cadres who administered local economic reforms. During his inspection tours through China in the fall of 1958, Peng composed a poem that summarized his attitude towards the Great Leap Forward: ...|$|E

[...] After Getzein gave up 10runs in an August1888 game against Washington, the Detroit Free Press dubbed him the [...] "Pulverized Pretzel."

[...] As the 1888season progressed, relations between Getzein and the Detroit manager became strained. [...] After {{a game in which}} Getzein gave up 21hits against Boston, The Sporting Life reported on speculation that Getzein may have intentionally thrown the game: [...] "The Getzein episode makes Detroiters weary.
