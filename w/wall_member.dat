40|$|Experiments {{were focused}} on {{deflection}} responses of the <b>wall</b> <b>member</b> of upright structures to impulsive wave forces. The experiments revealed that the wall deflection response depends on wave loading modes {{as well as on}} natural frequency of the <b>wall</b> <b>member</b> system, fNW. Single degree-of-freedom model of transient impact shows that the peak wall deflection is given {{as a function of the}} ratio between rise time of wave force xF and fNW, representing characteristics of the wave load and the <b>wall</b> <b>member.</b> The measured peak deflection agrees well with the predicted by the model. In addition, the model indicates that with decreasing natural frequencies of the wall system, the wave load mode brought about greater peak deflections changes from the mode of short duration force to that of long-lasting force...|$|E
40|$|A {{macroscopic}} model, macro plate model, {{was proposed}} {{to represent a}} <b>wall</b> <b>member</b> of RC walls. Both in-plane and out-of-plane behavior were considered for numerical derivations of macro plate model. For out-of-plane behavior, bending deformation was incorporated with shear deformation to consider out-of-plane deformation as same as in-plane behavior. The hysteretic behavior of macro plate model can be directly expressed by stress-strain relationships in any conventional hysteretic rules, which have been proposed by other researchers, for member level. Unless nonlinear analysis of RC walls was proposed in case of earthquake, macro plate model can be proposed for nonlinear analysis of those in case of wind and tsunami by converting distributed force to nodal force...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{two major}} sections {{with the objective}} of introducing a new cold-formed steel (CFS) shear wall system with corrugated steel sheathings. The work shown herein includes the development of an optimal shear wall system as well as an optimal slit configuration for the CFS corrugated sheathings which result in a CFS shear wall with high ductility, high strength, high stiffness and overall high performance. The conclusion is {{based on the results of}} 36 full-scale shear wall tests performed in the structural laboratory of the University of North Texas. A variety of shear walls were the subject of this research to make further discussions and conclusions based on different sheathing materials, slit configurations, wall configurations, sheathing connection methods, wall dimensions, shear <b>wall</b> <b>member</b> thicknesses, and etc. The walls were subject to cyclic (CUREE protocol) lateral loading to study their deformations and structural performances. The optimal sit configuration for CFS shear walls with corrugated steel sheathings was found to be 12 × 2 in. vertical slits in 6 rows. The failure mode observed in this shear wall system was the connection failure between the sheathing and the framing members. Also, most of the shear walls tested displayed local buckling of the chord framing members located above the hold-down locations. The second section includes details of developing a Finite Element Model (FEM) in ABAQUS software to analyze the lateral response of the new shear wall systems. Different modeling techniques were used to define each element of the CFS shear wall and are reported herein. Material properties from coupon test results are applied. Connection tests are performed to define pinching paths to model fasteners with hysteretic user-defined elements. Element interactions, boundary conditions and loading applications are consistent with full scale tests. CFS members and corrugated sheathings are modeled with shell elements, sheathing-to-frame fasteners are modeled using nonlinear springs (SPRING 2 elements) for monotonic models and a general user defined element (user subroutine UEL) for cyclic models. Hold-downs are defined by boundary conditions. A total of three models were developed and validated by comparing ABAQUS results to full scale test results...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPresent paper {{deals with}} a type of thin steel plate shear wall (SPW) called “special plate shear wall” (SPSW). Although several methods have been {{proposed}} to predict the behavior of SPW, but lack of a comprehensive method containing a complete design procedure, have always confused the designers. Absence of the mentioned method has also restricted usage of steel plate shear wall significantly. Recently a new design technique using “orthotropic membrane model” has been proposed in “AISC Steel Design Guide 20 ”. In this method, after preliminary design of the system, in order to correctly distribute the forces between the <b>wall</b> <b>members,</b> an orthotropic membrane model is developed using ETABS program. Tension field angle in each web plate is calculated after specifying web plates and boundary elements characteristics. This angle affects the distribution of applied forces to <b>wall</b> <b>members</b> and the web plates shear strength. Finally, the effect of changes in web plate thickness {{on the behavior of}} SPSW is assessed...|$|R

50|$|Deflection in {{mullions}} {{is controlled}} by different shapes and depths of curtain <b>wall</b> <b>members.</b> The depth of a given curtain wall system is usually controlled by the area moment of inertia required to keep deflection limits under the specification. Another way to limit deflections in a given section is to add steel reinforcement to the inside tube of the mullion. Since steel deflects at ⅓ the rate of aluminum, the steel will resist much of the load {{at a lower cost}} or smaller depth.|$|R

40|$|Standard {{prestressed}} hollow-core slabs {{have many}} advantages as construction members while being relatively {{very low in}} cost. The principal advantages include the ease of mass production, a small cross-sectional area, light weight, and flat surfaces. In addition, the slabs have the advantage s of concrete, precasting and prestressing. The only specifications which make hollow-core components unsuitable for <b>wall</b> <b>members</b> are their lack of weight and mass, their inability {{to be used as}} long members because of the limited distance between the floor-to-floor height, and, in some cases, insufficient insulating qualities. This thesis recommends a practical and economical system for the structural use of hollow-core components which have been modified with two other additional structural members - a continuous precast "L" beam and a precast support panel. This system will allow a high degree of standardization and an additional saving in the total cost of the equipment and formworks. Most of all, the <b>wall</b> <b>members</b> have the advantages of precast prestressed hollow-core slabs and their low cost. The new system's applications are mainly directed towards housing, administrative and public buildings. A design example is also introduced and analyzed in terms of possible variations in area of the individual units and the total cost of the building. The latter case shows that the total cost of structure per square-foot for the recommended system is considerably lower than the other construction types. by Farnaz A. Beroukhim. Thesis (M. S.)
