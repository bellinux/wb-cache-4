Miller was {{prominent}} with the ball and in the field, taking 5/46 and two catches for his fellow bowlers. In reply, Australia were already 184/1 at stumps, with Brown heading for a consecutive century. He put on 176 for the second wicket with Hamence, who made 92. Brown reached 200 and was out immediately thereafter, prompting stand-in skipper Hassett to declare midway through the second day at 414/4, having reached 61 not out himself. In their second innings Cambridge failed to cope with the leg-spin of McCool, who took 7/78 as the match ended early on the third morning. Attendance over the three days was nearly 25,000.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the fifth}} inning saw no more hits, and after a Keltner double, three Indians <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top of the sixth inning. The Red Sox began to fight back {{in the bottom of}} the sixth inning. After getting Pesky out, Ted Williams reached first base on an error by Gordon. Stephens struck out, and with two outs in the inning, Bobby Doerr hit his 27th home run of the season to make the score 6–3. No runs were scored in the seventh inning, though Bearden and Mitchell both reached base. The Indians were able to score another run in the eighth inning after Jim Hegan was {{intentionally}} walked. Bearden then hit a fly ball to Williams, who dropped it, allowing Hegan to score and making it 7–3 in the Indians' favor. The Indians were able to score one more run in the ninth when Robinson scored after Keltner grounded into a bases-loaded double play. Bearden got the final three Red Sox out {{in the bottom of the}} ninth, finishing the game with an 8–3 Indians victory and giving Bearden a complete game.|$|E

Sri Lanka batted through ten overs, but Farveez Maharoof gave a return catch to Hoggard, and two overs later Flintoff makes a breakthrough, getting Jayawardene out with a catch by wicket-keeper Geraint Jones. However, the ninth-wicket stand between Vaas and Nuwan Kulasekara gave the most runs of the entire innings, as the two add 62 in just over an hour. After lunch, however, they <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> space of three deliveries, and Sri Lanka were all out for 192.|$|E

Lawry (21) added 65 for the first wicket with Stackpole who made 136 with 16 fours. It would have been 17 boundaries but the ball was stopped in the outfield when it hit a seagull, which survived the experience and flew away.

25|$|The {{number of}} mercenaries was {{unknown to the}} Seychellois, as was the fact of whether the attack at the airport was {{supposed}} to coincide with a seaborne invasion. They subsequently set up a roadblock on {{the north end of}} the airport and mounted an unsuccessful attack on the Pointe La Rue Barracks in which one mercenary was wounded. Seychellois forces, with two armoured vehicles, occupied the airstrip, confining the putschists to the airport's buildings. They also fired upon the chartered aircraft, disabling it. One of the armoured vehicles made its way to the terminal forecourt, but the lights <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building and the driver had difficulty spotting the mercenaries. The vehicle's tires were quickly shot out and it was set ablaze by a Molotov cocktail. 2nd Lieutenant David Antat, the vehicle's commander, emerged from the top and engaged the mercenaries. They surrounded the vehicle and shot Antat several times in the chest, killing him.|$|E

25|$|In his {{original}} 1972/73 deep ecology paper, Arne Næss claims the deep ecology movement arose from scientists – ecologists who <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field studying the biodiversity and wild ecosystems throughout the world. They were also {{doing the work}} of philosophers, laying the foundations for the Age of Ecology and a new ecological worldview to replace the anthropocentric, mastery of Nature, and modernist worldview arising in the 17th and 18th centuries. Three {{of the most influential}} ecological spokespersons of the 1960s were Rachel Carson, David Brower, and Paul R. Ehrlich. Some consider the publication of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring (1962) as the beginning of the contemporary, long-range deep ecology movement. When her book appeared there was a long-standing movement for conservation of land and resources, as well as support for creating parks and other areas devoted to preserving wilderness and spectacular nature. Carson's writings were especially influential because they clearly showed how human well-being depends on the condition of whole biotic communities. She explained in practical terms how living beings are interrelated within ecosystems. She explained how pesticides used to control mosquitoes and other insects led to declines in some bird populations. Silent Spring helped show how complex food webs and networks of biotic relationships function. Since humans are at the top of many food chains, exposure to chemicals becomes more concentrated as these move up the chains. The chemicals also can be stored in human tissues and gradually accumulate over time, adversely affecting health. Carson showed the need for deep changes in human practices and ways of living.|$|E
500|$|The killings at Kragujevac and Kraljevo {{exacerbated}} {{tensions between}} the Partisans and Chetniks. They also convinced Mihailović that active resistance was futile {{for as long as}} the Germans held an unassailable military advantage in the Balkans, and that killing German troops would only result in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs. He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing in the Balkans. The killings occurred only a few days before Captain Bill Hudson, a Special Operations Executive officer, met with Mihailović at his Ravna Gora headquarters. Hudson witnessed the aftermath of the massacre and noted the psychological toll it exacted. [...] "Morning and night was the most desolating atmosphere," [...] he recounted, [...] "because the women <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields, and every sunrise and sunset you would hear the wails. This had a very strong effect on Mihailović." [...] "The tragedy gave to Nedić convincing proof that the Serbs would be biologically exterminated if they were not submissive," [...] Djilas wrote, [...] "and to the Chetniks proof that the Partisans were prematurely provoking the Germans".|$|E

2500|$|Dieskau {{ordered his}} Canadians and Indians {{to follow up}} their success with an attack on Johnson's camp. However, with their morale already shaken {{by the loss of}} their leader, the Caughnawagas [...] "did not wish to attack an entrenched camp, the {{defenders}} of which included hundreds of their Mohawk kinsmen. The Abenakis would not go forward without the Caughnawagas, and neither would the Canadians". Hoping to shame the Indians into attacking, Dieskau formed his 222 French grenadiers into a column, six abreast, and led them in person along the Lake Road into the clearing where Johnson's camp was, around which Sir William had hurriedly constructed defensive barricades of [...] "wagons, overturned boats and hewn-down trees". Once the grenadiers <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open ground, the British gunners, crewing Johnson's three cannons, loaded up with grapeshot and cut [...] "lanes, streets and alleys" [...] through the French ranks. When Johnson was wounded and forced to retire to his tent for treatment, Gen. Phineas Lyman took over command. When Dieskau went down with a serious wound, the French attack was abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by Wilson, who intended to encapsulate {{the feel of the}} Drifters' version of [...] "On Broadway". The instrumental was made on April 6, 1965 at United Western Recorders, requiring 44 takes before Wilson could deem a satisfactory performance. Problems had arisen from the tempo and guitar part in the introduction, which fatigued Wilson, engineer Chuck Britz, and the dozen-plus session players. The song did not appear to have lyrics or a title at this juncture, and Wilson can be heard calling the song [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] and [...] "You're Grass and I'm a Power Mower". Wilson remembers: [...] "When we got into the studio with Chuck, he said that he wanted Carl’s twelve-string guitar in the intro to sound more direct. I didn’t know what that meant. 'Can he play it in the booth?' Chuck said. I had never thought about that before, but {{it seemed like a good}} idea. Carl was standing next to me in the booth and all the other musicians <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio. I conducted it like an orchestra." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the Friday {{night before}} the 1979 festival was officially opened, the festival [...] {{attendance}} had already reached its maximum capacity. At 3 am Saturday morning Peter {{was on the phone}} negotiating paddocks from neighboring farms, while Fred, Mike and Bernie <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dead of night with bolt cutters, removing fences to allow cars and campers into newly acquired festival acreage. By 11 am Saturday morning on opening day, the traffic police closed the festival, and were telling people to go home, announcing on radio that the event could accommodate no more patrons. They ordered the organizers to remove the entry gates to free the roads, as vehicles and pedestrians were banked up in all directions for some 20 kilometers. But still they arrived. Some 5 kilometers towards Waihi a tent city spontaneously arose on a neighboring farm where approximately 15,000 people parked and then walked the final leg into the festival site. Others abandoned their vehicles in Waihi itself and made the pilgrimage to Nambassa on foot.|$|E

The concept of 20 Y.O. {{is a celebration}} {{of what was happening}} musically when Control was released. The addition of Dupri, quotes Jackson as saying, [...] "It's an edge, an attitude, an exciting vibe that's assertive. It's about taking charge. It says, 'Here I am. I'm coming on. Musically, I have it. You want it. And I'm giving it to you.'" [...] With the album Dupri wanted to reconnect Jackson with her urban fan base without losing her pop and dance audience she had built during the last two decades before the album's release. [...] "Times have changed from when Michael and Janet <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> '80s", he noted, pointing to the fact that urban artists no longer had to cross over to pop genres before achieving maximum exposure and sales. [...] "Janet shouldn't be changing or trying to change to get on pop radio", the producer completed.|$|E
2500|$|However, his bowling leaked runs {{at a rate}} {{quicker than}} the target rate, with the first four overs costing 41 runs after he had come on as first change bowler for James Anderson, who had {{dismissed}} Kamran Akmal with the eleventh ball of the match. Salman Butt and Younis Khan shared a stand of 117 runs {{at a rate of}} 6.75 per over, but mid-innings England's slowest bowlers came to the fore. Ian Blackwell bowled ten overs without conceding a boundary, ending without a wicket but conceding 45 runs, while Paul Collingwood dismissed Inzamam-ul-Haq as the latter mistimed a guide to third man into the gloves of Geraint Jones who held the catch on the second attempt. With ten overs remaining, Pakistan needed 88 with six wickets in hand, with Harmison, Flintoff and ODI debutant Liam Plunkett bowling. Plunkett was the first to get a wicket, dismissing Mohammad Yousuf after an 83-run stand (off 96 balls) with Shoaib Malik, but Abdul Razzaq hit Flintoff for 11 off the four balls he faced in the next over, and with five overs remaining Pakistan needed 51. However, both the recognised batsmen <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next over to Plunkett, as the debutant finished with 3/51 (all caught), and Shoaib Akhtar was run out on the final ball of the over. Flintoff got two wickets in the 47th over to end the chase, but Strauss was named Man of the Match for his innings of 94, which included partnerships with every batsman except Trescothick and Collingwood.|$|E
2500|$|The men of {{the convoy}} then began {{launching}} boats to pick up Japanese survivors and kill all of the remaining prisoners. A machine gun mounted on the grounded cargo ship and a second on the Shinyō Maru were also opened up on the Allied personnel. Marine Corps Sergeant Onnie Clem later reported the following; [...] "Up on the bridge there was a machine gun spraying the hatch. A burst of machine-gun fire caught {{all three of us}} and knocked us back down in the hold. We'd all been hit. I got plowed in the skull. Another bullet chipped out my chin. Nevertheless, I was able to work myself back up on deck, and I was eyeing that bridge when I came out that time. The gun was still there, but the gunner was laying out on deck. Somebody had apparently got up there and killed him. At this time I found out that we <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ocean about two or three miles from shore. All I had was a loincloth." [...] Fifteen or 20 others were recaptured and taken aboard one of the torpedo boats, where they were executed by firing squad as punishment for trying to escape. One of those men was able to free his hands which had been tied behind his back, and he successfully escaped by jumping overboard again. The Japanese dropped 45 depth charges and other explosives on the American submarine over the course of two hours, and the ship sustained some light damage, but nobody was hurt. After that, she surfaced and began patrolling the area again.|$|E
