5|$|All {{dates of}} the dollar also exist in proof finish. The 1999 coins were sold as {{standalone}} proof strikes, rather than {{as part of a}} larger proof set, as the 1979, 1980 and 1981 issues were offered. The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, and bears a 'P' mint mark, while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coinage dies with a different punch, causing them to have a more legible appearance. They are considered scarce and are valued considerably higher than normal proofs of the series.|$|E
5|$|Although NY99 {{was signed}} as a state highway, {{maintenance}} on the route was performed by Franklin County, which designated the roadway as CR26. All of NY99 was initially a gravel road; however, most of the road was paved in the early 1970s {{through the use of}} state funds procured by New York State Senator Ronald Stafford of Plattsburgh. The western and eastern extents of the road were paved soon afterward; however, the road was left unpaved in the vicinity of Loon Lake—a lake near the midpoint of the route—even though the necessary gravel base <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire highway. The unpaved section deteriorated as a result, and the NY99 designation was removed from the roadway on September26, 1994.|$|E

5|$|Bletchley, on the 1846 {{junction}} of the London and Birmingham railway with the Bedford branch, {{was to become}} an important railway town too. In 1850, another branch from Bletchley to Oxford was built, later to become the (Cambridge/Oxford) Varsity Line. Bletchley, originally a small village in the parish of Fenny Stratford, grew to reach and absorb its parent. In Stony Stratford, expertise learned in the works <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> construction of traction engines for agricultural use and {{the site of the}} present Cofferidge Close was engaged in their manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Gratiot Avenue in Detroit {{was one of}} the {{original}} avenues laid out by Judge Augustus Woodward after the Detroit fire in 1805. It was later used as a supply road for Fort Gratiot in Port Huron under authorization from the US Congress in the 1820s. The roadway was included in the State Trunkline Highway System in 1913 and signposted with a number in 1919. Later, it was used as a segment of US Highway25 (US25) before that highway was functionally replaced by Interstate94 (I-94) in the 1960s. The M-3 designation <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> current highway in 1973, and a southern section was reassigned to M-85 in 2001.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{a mixture}} of sand and cement <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{external}} faces of the mosque {{with the intention of}} protecting the mosque from wind and rain damage. However, this treatment resulted in substantial damage to the building as moisture became trapped in the walls built of mud and started a deterioration process of the structure, with termites infesting the wooden supports under humid conditions. This resulted in part of the mosque collapsing and during the repair work it caused some distortions of the structural elements and the exterior of the mosque.|$|E
5|$|M-222 is {{the current}} {{designation}} of a state trunkline highway in Allegan County of the US state of Michigan. It runs between the city of Allegan, where it connects with M-40/M-89, and the US Highway131 (US131) freeway near Martin. The highway runs along a series of streets in Allegan and through rural farm fields and woods between the two communities along 116th Avenue. The roadway was a state highway back in 1919 when the system was initially signed. It was assigned as part of M-89 and M-40 before being given its own number, M-118. That designation <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highway until 1988 when that was retired {{in favor of the}} current M-222.|$|E

Within NSW, the highway was created in 1938 and designated as State Highway 19 within the Department of Main Roads. In 1958, It was named the Monaro Highway in both NSW and the ACT, though the same name had been in use by the Snowy Mountains Highway until 1955. The Monaro Highway has more recently had a grade-separated dual carriageway extension constructed within Canberra, {{as part of the}} Eastern Parkway construction project.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{the name}} <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{peninsula}} but it now usually {{refers to the}} town itself. The settlement began in the Middle Ages as a fishing village, renowned for its herring industry. Thanks to its seascapes, fishermen and evening light, {{towards the end of}} the 19th century it became popular with a group of Impressionist artists now known as the Skagen Painters. In 1879, the Skagen Fisherman's Association was established with the purpose of facilitating the local fishing industry through the Skagensbanen railway, which opened as a narrow-gauged railway in 1890. The modern port of Skagen opened on 20 November 1907, and with the railway connections to Frederikshavn and the rest of Denmark, tourism began to develop.|$|E

US-412 continued east {{from the end of}} the turnpike along US-64. From there, it was routed through the Tulsa metropolitan freeway system along I-244 and I-44. East of Tulsa, the highway replaced SH-33 to the Arkansas line. The highway designations made redundant by US-412 were removed, effective December 12, 1988.|$|E
5|$|The current M-54 was {{designated}} in 1962 for a former routing of US10 through the Flint area; US10 was moved {{after the completion}} of the I-75 freeway, and the M-54 designation <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Saginaw Road-Dort Highway routing of US10 from I-75 in Grand Blanc to M-83 in Birch Run.

During this timeframe, another highway bore the M-119 moniker {{in the southern part of}} the state near Paw Paw from the 1930s until the early 1970s.
