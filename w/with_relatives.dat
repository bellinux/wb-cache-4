After production began in Berlin, the writers were able to visit locations and meet <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> of the conspirators; these meetings informed changes made to the script during filming.|$|E

He broke peace with the Livonian Order in 1261, possibly renouncing Christianity, and was assassinated in 1263 by his nephew Treniota and another rival, Duke Daumantas. His three immediate successors were assassinated as well. The disorder was not resolved until Traidenis gained the title of Grand Duke c. 1270.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{was inaugurated}} as {{president}} of Jefferson College on September 27, 1845. During his tenure, he also pastored a church {{in the city of}} Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.

A desire to see his children, most of whom were living <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> scattered throughout Kentucky and Virginia, also factored into his decision to resign his post in 1847.

5|$|By August22, city {{officials}} in Corpus Christi, Texas {{declared a state}} of emergency as Bret was considered a significant threat to the region.

Later that day, Texas State Highway 361 and docks in Port Aransas were shut down. Highways throughout the area were congested due to the large-scale evacuations and long lines for gas and emergency items developed. Three schools, two universities and a college were closed on August23 and remained closed for several days.|$|E
5|$|Chief of Police Alf Reksten {{arrived in}} the {{afternoon}} and took over responsibility.

The sister aircraft Najaden arrived later in the afternoon <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> of the deceased and journalists; its main objective was to search for survivors, but there was no possibility for it to land on the mountain and so could not help with the salvaging. Later a Widerøe aircraft arrived as well, which transported DNL's technical director Bernt Balchen, Captain Eckhoff, who worked for the aviation authorities, and Gjermundson from the insurance company.

5|$|Circa 1930, Gabriel had an {{argument}} {{with one of the}} Jesuits, and as a result the Mugabe family were expelled from the mission village by its French leader, Father Jean-Baptiste Loubiere. They settled in a village about seven miles away, although the children were permitted to remain at the mission primary school, living <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> in Kutama during term-time and returning to their parental home at weekends. Around the same time, Robert's older brother Raphael died, likely of diarrhoea. In early 1934, Robert's other older brother, Michael, also died, after consuming poisoned maize. Later that year, Gabriel left his family in search of employment at Bulawayo. He subsequently abandoned Bona and their six children and established a relationship with another woman, with whom he had three further offspring.|$|E

By February 1965, Patricia Hodges had stopped visiting 16Wardle Brook Avenue, but David Smith was still a regular visitor. Brady gave Smith books to read, and the two discussed robbery and murder.

5|$|Judah and two {{siblings}} were boarded <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> in Fayetteville {{for about}} 18 {{months after the}} rest of the family moved to Charleston. He attended the Fayetteville Academy, a well-regarded school where his intelligence was recognized. In Charleston, his father was among the founders of the first Reform congregation in the United States, with shorter services conducted in English rather than Hebrew. Philip was ultimately expelled from that community, as he did not keep the Sabbath, and the extent of Judah's religious education is uncertain. The boy's intelligence was noted by others in Charleston, one of whom offered to finance his education.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose—This {{meta-analysis}} systematically reviewed {{randomized controlled}} trials comparing aspirin plus dipyridamole with aspirin alone {{in patients with}} stroke and TIA to determine the efficacy of these agents in preventing recurrent cerebral and systemic vascular events. Methods—We performed separate analyses of the incidences of stroke alone and composite outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. We also performed two subset analyses, planned a priori, to examine effect size based on trials using (1) exclusively immediate-release and (2) predominantly extended-release dipyridamole. Results—The summary results indicate {{a significant reduction in}} the overall risk ratio in favor of aspirin plus dipyridamole for stroke alone <b>with</b> <b>relative</b> risk 0. 77 (0. 67 to 0. 89) and the composite end point <b>with</b> <b>relative</b> risk 0. 85 (0. 76 to 0. 94). Studies using immediate-release dipyridamole showed a nonstatistically significant trend in favor of the combination for stroke alone <b>with</b> <b>relative</b> risk 0. 83 (0. 59 to 1. 15) and for the composite outcome <b>with</b> <b>relative</b> risk 0. 95 (0. 75 to 1. 19). Studies using predominantly extended-release dipyridamole showed a statistically significant difference in favor of the combination for stroke alone <b>with</b> <b>relative</b> risk 0. 76 (0. 65 to 0. 89) and for the composite outcome <b>with</b> <b>relative</b> risk 0. 82 (0. 73 to 0. 92). Conclusions—The combination of aspirin plus dipyridamole is more effective than aspirin alone in preventing stroke and other serious vascular events in patients with minor stroke and TIAs.
