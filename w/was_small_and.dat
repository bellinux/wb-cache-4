5|$|In the 1850s, Stonehenge {{recommended}} {{a cross between}} a Beagle and a Scottish Terrier as a retriever. He found the crossbreed to be a good worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> could barely carry a hare.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the convent}} school <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> only temporary, the next order of {{business}} was to build the actual school. The parochial school took ten years to build (1950–1960). This building also consists of three floors and is covered with red sandstone in the front. The rear of the building is made of white Pennsylvania sandstone. There is a bell tower on the building. It has three heavy, bronze bells that were salvaged from three Protestant churches of Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|That summer, both couples {{moved into}} nearby summer homes. In November, they {{returned}} to Pisa and met Lord Byron, who had recently arrived there himself. The two couples later shared {{a house in a}} remote location near Lerici, where they were visited in early 1822 by Edward John Trelawny. Though they enjoyed each other's company, the house <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> the arrangements led to numerous conflicts between the servants of each family.|$|E

5|$|The {{market for}} duck meat in Aylesbury itself <b>was</b> <b>small,</b> <b>and</b> the ducks were {{generally}} sent to London for sale. By the 1750s Richard Pococke recorded that four cartloads of ducks were sent from Aylesbury to London every Saturday, {{and in the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries the ducks continued to be sent over the Chiltern Hills to London by packhorse or cart.|$|E
5|$|A {{lawrencium}} atom has 103 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. In 1970, {{it was predicted that}} the ground-state electron configuration of lawrencium was 5f146d17s2 (ground state term symbol 2D3/2), following the Aufbau principle and conforming to the 4f145d16s2 configuration of lawrencium's lighter homolog lutetium. However, the next year, calculations were published that questioned this prediction, instead expecting an anomalous 5f147s27p1 configuration. Though early calculations gave conflicting results, more recent studies and calculations confirm the s2p suggestion. 1974 relativistic calculations concluded that the energy difference between the two configurations <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> that it was uncertain which was the ground state. Later 1995 calculations concluded that the s2p configuration should be energetically favored, because the spherical s and p1/2 orbitals are nearest to the atomic nucleus and thus move quickly enough that their relativistic mass increases significantly.|$|E
5|$|A weather system {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September3. The {{disturbance}} <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> became unidentifiable within 24hours of formation. Satellite imagery indicated that the disturbance may have acquired a circulation on September7, but the circulation was gone by the next day. The remaining tropical wave moved into the Lesser Antilles on September11 and a reconnaissance aircraft was deployed. The aircraft found circulation; however, by the next day, only a strong wave was detected. Atmospheric conditions became more favorable for development, yielding lower wind shear near Hispaniola for several days. The system moved into this area as the latest Reconnaissance aircraft was deployed, declaring it a tropical depression on September13 near the Dominican Republic.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} {{war broke out}} in Europe, the Australian armed forces were less {{prepared}} than at the outbreak of World WarI in August 1914. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the best-prepared of the three services, <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> equipped with only two heavy cruisers, four light cruisers, two sloops, five obsolete destroyers {{and a number of}} small and auxiliary warships. The Australian Army comprised a small permanent cadre of 3,000men and 80,000part-time militiamen who had volunteered for training with the Citizen Military Forces (CMF). The Royal Australian Air Force(RAAF), the weakest of the services, had 246aircraft, few of them modern. While the Commonwealth Government began a large military expansion and transferred some RAAF aircrew and units to British control upon the outbreak of war, it was unwilling to immediately dispatch an expeditionary force overseas due to the threat posed by Japanese intervention.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{entered the}} Second World War on 3 September 1939. At {{the time of}} the {{declaration}} of war against Germany the Australian military <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> unready for war. Recruiting for a Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) began in mid-September. While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War, a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid-1940. Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940, three of which were dispatched to the Middle East. The RAAF's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), through which almost 28,000 Australians were trained during the war.|$|E
5|$|Between 1822 and 1848 Bute {{played a}} central role in the {{creation}} of the Cardiff Docks. The idea was first put forward to Bute by one of his staff in 1822, who suggested that, with the right investment, Cardiff could be transformed into a major port for exporting coal and iron. The existing seaport, used by the Glamorganshire Canal, <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> inefficient. The new port would then deliver a direct return to Bute from shipping rates, improve the value of his lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields. Initially Bute opposed plans for docks put forward by the local ironmasters, but then changed his mind and pushed forward with his own scheme shortly afterward.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{fought in}} the Raid on St Malo in June 1758. The British landed near St Malo, at first {{planning}} to attack the town. However, they decided to destroy shipping first and attack the town later. Finding that to occupy the town would require a full siege, for which they had insufficient troops, they occupied St Servan, where they burned over one hundred vessels including thirty privateers. British ships retreated after seeing a large French force, but sailed around the coast {{for a few weeks}} seeking another place to attack. Even though the Raid on St Malo <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> little damage was done, it is considered a British victory.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Quorn was founded, an {{anonymous}} organization calling themselves The Spooks was started. Each Christmas, the members provided free {{food and clothing}} to the needy in Quorn and then in Kingsley. Their membership <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> only the members themselves knew who {{was a part of}} the organization. All members wear masks and they are still in operation in Kingsley. The Women's Kingsley Community Action Club was founded in June 1980 as a splinter group of the Men's KCAC. It was started with the plan to help summer programs for Kingsley's youth. The city once published the newspaper The Kingsley-News Times that began publication in 1887. The local newspaper was founded by J. H. Strief, who later became president of the Iowa State Federation of Labor. The Kingsley-News Times was later combined with two other newspapers to form The Record, spreading its coverage to include multiple nearby cities.|$|E
5|$|The Charolais breed <b>was</b> <b>small,</b> <b>and</b> {{most closely}} {{physically}} resembled the Morvan horse, another now-extinct French type. The breed {{had a short}} head with small ears and a short, strong neck attached low on the shoulder. The body was short and rounded, with a broad croup and strong legs. They were {{generally considered to be}} small and inelegant. They were strong, robust and hardy, the last of these traits especially so before the breeding changes of the 19th century, and were known for their pulling power.|$|E

5|$|The Rhynia plant <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> stick-like, {{with simple}} dichotomously {{branching}} stems without leaves, each tipped by a sporangium. The simple form echoes {{that of the}} sporophyte of mosses, {{and it has been}} shown that Rhynia had an alternation of generations, with a corresponding gametophyte in the form of crowded tufts of diminutive stems only a few millimetres in height. Rhynia thus falls midway between mosses and early vascular plants like ferns and clubmosses. From a carpet of moss-like gametophytes, the larger Rhynia sporophytes grew much like simple clubmosses, spreading by means of horizontal growing stems growing rhizoids that anchored the plant to the substrate. The unusual mix of moss-like and vascular traits and the extreme structural simplicity of the plant had huge implications for botanical understanding.|$|E
5|$|The {{couple had}} still been in debt {{at the time of}} Blanchard's death, so to {{minimise}} her expenses Sophie was as frugal as possible in her choice of balloon. She used a hydrogen-filled gas balloon (or Charlière), as it allowed her to ascend in a basket little bigger than a chair, and there was no requirement for the volume of material necessary for a hot air balloon. A hydrogen balloon also freed her from having to tend a fire to keep the craft airborne. Because she <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> light, she was able to cut back on the amount of gas used to inflate the balloon. Sophie had used, or at least owned, a hot air balloon; Colonel Francis Maceroni recorded in his memoirs that she sold it to him in 1811 for £40.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Syria's {{population in the}} 12th century consisted of Sunni Muslims, typically from Arab or Kurdish backgrounds. There were also sizable Muslim communities of Twelver Shias, Druzes, and Alawites. The Ismaili presence <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> most were of Persian origin, having migrated from Alamut. They mostly resided in the mountainous area near the northern Syrian coastline. Large Christian communities existed in northern Syria, Palestine, Transjordan and Upper Mesopotamia. They were Aramaic-speaking and indigenous to the area, mostly belonging to the Syriac Orthodox Church. They lived in villages of Christian or mixed Christian and Muslim population, monasteries, and in small towns where {{they appear to have}} been on friendly terms with their Muslim neighbors. Ideologically, they were led by the Patriarch of Antioch.|$|E

5|$|The only blood parasites {{found in}} a study of blackcaps trapped on {{migration}} were protozoans from the genera Haemoproteus and Plasmodium. Of those affected, 45.5% were males and 22.7% were females, but the number of parasites <b>was</b> <b>small,</b> <b>and</b> the ability to store fat for the migration flight was unimpaired. Seventeen strains of H. parabelopolskyi are found only in the blackcap, and form a monophyletic group; three further members of that group are found only in the garden warbler, and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species. The protozoan Isospora ashmoonensis was first identified in a blackcap in Egypt. Blackcaps may carry parasitic worms that sometimes kill their hosts. External parasites include chewing lice and feather mites. The latter do little damage, although heavy infestations cause individual tail feathers to develop asymmetrically.|$|E
5|$|The skull was {{generally}} {{similar to that}} of Oryzomys couesi, as were the teeth. It was robust and bore well-developed supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) on the braincase. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> narrow. The bony palate extended beyond the third molars. The nasal bones extended further back than the premaxillaries, whereas these bones are usually about coterminous in O.couesi. On average, the incisive foramina, which perforate the front part of the palate, were shorter than in O.couesi. The zygomatic arch (cheekbone) appears to have been better developed in O.antillarum.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} September 2001, {{a poorly}} defined {{tropical}} wave moved westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean through an area of hostile wind shear, which {{was caused by a}} large upper-level low within a trough to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles. A few days later, the upper-level low detached from the trough and moved southwestward over the Caribbean Sea, allowing for an upper-level ridge, or high-pressure area, to form over the tropical wave. The change provided a favorable environment for tropical development, and an area of convection soon blossomed along the wave's axis. As the tropical wave approached the Lesser Antilles, a mid-level wind circulation formed within the deepest part of the convection, and a low-level circulation became gradually more pronounced on satellite imagery. Although its low-level circulation <b>was</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> poorly defined, the system increased in organization enough to be classified as Tropical Depression Eleven at 12:00UTC on October4, located about 100mi (160km) southeast of Barbados. Operationally, however, Hurricane Hunters did not confirm the depression's formation until nine hours later.|$|E
