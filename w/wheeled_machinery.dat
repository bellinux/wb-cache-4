Turning the shaft pushes the brake shoes against the drum, producing friction.|$|E
50|$|Webb Dock East {{has five}} berths and 40 {{hectares}} of container stacking area. Berths 1 and 2 serve the Tasmanian coastal trade and three multi‐purpose general cargo berths and an automotive terminal accommodate cars, trucks, buses and other <b>wheeled</b> <b>machinery,</b> {{as well as}} bulk break commodities such as timber, wood pulp and newsprint. The ship loading installed in the 1980s were removed in mid 2014. Webb Dock West is Australia’s main terminal for motor vehicle imports and exports with over 370,000 new vehicles pass shipped in 2012‐13. It comprises “roll‐on roll‐off” ramps with a 19‐hectare automotive terminal with storage for 7000 vehicles.|$|E

There have been obtained the formulas of equivalent rigidity of fastening spatial flexible elements relative to a vertical line, which are equal to rigidity of bus and spring flexible elements being plugged in series and which are then equal to rigidity of all elastic elements of <b>wheeled</b> <b>machinery</b> as springs being plugged in parallel...|$|E
50|$|The {{growth of}} <b>wheel</b> <b>machinery</b> in the United States was {{spurred by the}} {{conversion}} of motor oil containers from paperboard cans to plastic bottles, and the conversion of laundry detergent from powder to liquid form. Additional high volume applications have included single-serve juices and drinkable yogurt, condiments, and household cleaning supplies.|$|R
50|$|In shuttle machinery, the {{containers}} are usually trimmed in the machines, and finished containers leave the blow molding machine. Other blow molding equipment, such as rotary <b>wheel</b> <b>machinery,</b> requires {{the use of}} downstream trimming. Types of downstream trimming equipment include detabbers for tail removal, rotary or reciprocating punch trimmers, and spin trimmers.|$|R

50|$|Very tight {{weight and}} {{dimensional}} tolerances {{can be obtained}} on wheel equipment, as the parison is captured on both ends. It is pinched in the preceding mold on the leading end, and positioned by the stationary flowhead die on the other end. In shuttle machinery and reciprocating screw machinery multiple parisons are extruded and are free hanging. Because there is always some variation in the parison length on these machines, bottle weight and tolerance consistencies are not as tight as on rotary <b>wheel</b> <b>machinery.</b>|$|R

25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} required regular and, {{compared to}} a diesel-electric engine, frequent service and overhaul (often at government-regulated intervals in Europe and the US). Alterations and upgrades regularly occurred during overhauls. New appliances were added, unsatisfactory features removed, cylinders improved or replaced. Almost {{any part of the}} locomotive, including boilers, was replaced or upgraded. When service or upgrades got too expensive the locomotive was traded off or retired. On the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad two 2-10-2 locomotives were dismantled; the boilers were placed onto two new Class T 4-8-2 locomotives and the residual <b>wheel</b> <b>machinery</b> made into a pair of Class U 0-10-0 switchers with new boilers. Union Pacific's fleet of 3-cylinder 4-10-2 engines were converted into two-cylinder engines in 1942, because of high maintenance problems.|$|R
5000|$|Wide gauge {{locomotives}} {{offered more}} room to place reciprocating machinery inside, rather than outside the driving <b>wheels.</b> Reciprocating <b>machinery</b> {{was a source of}} vibration before mechanical engineering encompassed a good understanding of dynamics; and keeping such vibration close to the center of mass reduced the angular momentum causing rocking.|$|R

5000|$|The Van Deusenville furnace {{operated}} until 1896. It was dismantled in 1906. By 1908, the Richmond {{site had}} an annual capacity of 5,000 tons, and produced pig iron for car <b>wheels</b> and <b>machinery.</b> [...] The main furnace was described {{at that time}} as measuring approximately 33 feet tall by 9.5 feet wide at its base.|$|R

"They {{could not}} be easily made to believe, I suppose," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "that such an immense structure, all of iron, could have been made, and launched, and then navigated {{all over the world}} just by the power of the maze of iron beams and <b>wheels,</b> and <b>machinery,</b> which they would see in ruins in the hold." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{looking at}} these ruins {{as long as they}} wished, Mr. George and the boys went back to the station, in order to take the next train that came by, and {{continue}} their journey. They went on about an hour longer, and then they got out again at a station called Cowdenbeath, which was the place on the road that was nearest to Loch Leven, and where they had understood that there was a coach, which went to Loch Leven twice a day. The place was very quiet and still, and {{was in the midst of}} a green and pretty country, with small groups of stone cottages here and there. There were also several pretty tall chimneys scattered about the fields, with a sort of platform, and some <b>wheels</b> and <b>machinery</b> near each of them. These were the mouths of coal pits. The <b>wheels</b> and <b>machinery</b> were for hoisting up the coal.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} was gradually dismantled, only the <b>machinery,</b> <b>wheel,</b> and millstones surviving. In the 1930s its roofing iron was repurposed for the Matahiwi School. A two-room cottage belonging to Pestell also survived. The mill was rebuilt {{in the late}} 1970s to a design by architect Chris Cochran, the cottage was moved to its present site and restored, and both reopened {{to the public in}} October 1980.|$|R
60|$|The {{machinery}} made a heavy, rumbling sound, {{which grew}} {{louder and louder}} as the boys went up stairs. Jonas opened a door into a large room, and at this the noise increased very loudly, so that Oliver and Jonas could hardly hear each other talk. Jonas put down the bundle of wool by the door, and then he and Oliver went in among the <b>wheels</b> and <b>machinery.</b> There were a great many separate machines at {{different parts of the}} room, with girls tending them. There was a large, round beam of wood, overhead, slowly revolving. There were wheels upon it in different parts, with straps passing around these wheels, and also around other wheels connected with the machines below.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} a mill on the site since the 16th century. The present mill dates from the 18th century {{and is in the}} care of the National Trust for Scotland. It was used commercially until 1959, and it {{produced}} oatmeal. The River Tyne still drives the water <b>wheel,</b> and the <b>machinery</b> can still be seen at work by visitors taking part in a tour. There is also an exhibition about milling, and a mill pond.|$|R
50|$|This corn mill at Charing still stands, {{retaining}} {{a little}} machinery. The overshot waterwheel was 10 ft diameter and 5 ft wide. It bears the legend HILL & SON ASHFORD 1877. The waterwheel {{is carried on}} a 11 in cast-iron axle, driving a cast-iron Pit <b>Wheel.</b> All other <b>machinery</b> has been removed. The mill had two pairs of millstones. Millers were a Mr Pay and Mr Pope from 1878 - 1892, and Walter Hicks in 1892, having previously been at the windmill.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of steam power fuelled primarily by coal, wider utilisation of water <b>wheels</b> and powered <b>machinery</b> (mainly in textile manufacturing) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. The development of all-metal machine {{tools in the}} first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting most of the world, a process that continues as industrialisation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company made}} blowing engines for {{furnaces}} and smelters, boilers, weighing machines, water <b>wheels</b> and mill <b>machinery.</b> It supplied machinery [...] "on {{a new and}} perfectly unique" [...] concept together with iron pillars, roofing and fittings for the steam-driven pulp and paper mill at Woolwich Arsenal in 1856. The mill made cartridge bags {{at the rate of}} about 20,000 per hour, sufficient to supply the entire British army and navy. The intention was to manufacture paper for various departments of Her Majesty's service.|$|R
50|$|Just {{north of}} the village is Gleaston Water Mill. Now a tourist attraction, the mill would once {{have been used to}} grind oats for farmers {{throughout}} the Furness area. The present mill was built in 1774 on the site of an earlier one and its water <b>wheel</b> and milling <b>machinery</b> are still in working order. The Mill is privately owned and was restored in the early 1990s and preserved for posterity. Also on the site are the Dusty Millers restaurant and Pigs Whisper country store.|$|R

A platform and rough shed extended from side to side of the gully over the dam-head; the <b>wheel</b> and <b>machinery</b> were working underneath; and two or three circular saws were kept in constant employment. The open sides of the workshop displayed this curious work of art in the midst of nature's wildest scenery... The stern craggy sides of the gully might be imagined to frown upon so strange a neighbor as the fretting wheel. Two or three log-huts under the forest sent up their curl of smoke; while the neat housewives, with their flaxen-haired children, stood at the doors to receive with joyful pride the praises bestowed by visitors on the untiring industry of their husbands." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{expansion}} of the town was very rapid {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. There was a great influx of people from country areas. The poor were [...] "crowded in in offensive, dark, damp and incommodious habitations, a too fertile source of disease". Dr John Ferriar, a physician at Manchester Royal Infirmary in 1795 helped to set up a Board of Health which rented 4 houses in Portland Street belonging to the Lunatic Asylum for use as a fever hospital. He described to the Committee for the Regulation of the Police the appalling living conditions in cellars without lighting, sanitation or ventilation. People newly arrived from the country were particularly vulnerable to fevers. The Board pressed for the <b>wheels</b> of <b>machinery</b> to be guarded against accidents. A scheme for inoculating poor people for smallpox was started in 1784. Jenner's scheme of vaccination was enthusiastically adopted in 1800, and 1000 people were vaccinated in six months ...|$|R

50|$|Doynton's {{history can}} be traced back to the Domesday Book (1086) in which the village is {{mentioned}} as having two mills. One was probably a corn mill and the other a tucking or fulling mill connected with the Cotswold woollen cloth industry. Both these mills were important to the survival of the village and were referred to again in historical records 500 years later. The tuck mill, however, is not mentioned after the middle of the 17th century. The corn mill continued in use until the 1950s marking nine centuries of service to the village. The mill <b>wheel</b> and old <b>machinery</b> were then broken up and electrically powered equipment installed. More recently a light engineering firm has taken over the site.|$|R
