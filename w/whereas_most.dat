5|$|Many fungi {{can serve}} as source of food for insect larvae, <b>whereas</b> <b>most</b> insects eat fungi only occasionally. Still, {{a whole range of}} insect species {{specialize}} on fungi. These animals are mainly beetle larvae, especially hairy fungus beetles (Mycetophagidae), rove beetles (Staphylinidae), and true flies (Diptera). Milk caps are especially attractive for true flies, while beetle larvae are comparatively rarer. The most common insects found on the fungus are Mycetophilidae and Phoridae larvae, which populate even the youngest fruit bodies. Also relatively common on mature or overaged fruit bodies are Drosophilidae and Psychodidae. Species from the section Deliciosi are often infested by Diptera larvae.|$|E
5|$|Renoir used few close-ups {{or reverse}} shots {{and most of}} the shots are two shots. The hunt scene differs {{from the rest of the}} film; it uses rapid editing <b>whereas</b> <b>most</b> of the film uses long takes of {{dialogue}} or action. Renoir wanted to shoot the film in color to take advantage of the beauty of Sologne in the winter but he was unable to secure funding from Jean Jay. One week before filming began Renoir tried to persuade Technicolor to fund the color cinematography but the company refused.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{suggested}} that the unique skull shape of Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids indicate different predatory habits than other theropods. <b>Whereas</b> <b>most</b> theropods were characterized by long, low skulls of narrow width, abelisaurid skulls were taller and wider, and often shorter in length as well. The narrow skulls of other theropods were well equipped to withstand the vertical stress of a powerful bite, but not as good at withstanding torsion (twisting). In comparison to modern mammalian predators, most theropods may have used a strategy similar in some ways to that of long- and narrow-snouted canids, with the delivery of many bites weakening the prey animal.|$|E

5|$|Vanadinite {{is in the}} apatite {{group of}} phosphates, and forms a {{chemical}} series with the minerals pyromorphite (Pb5(PO4)3Cl) and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl), with both of which it may form solid solutions. <b>Whereas</b> <b>most</b> chemical series involve the substitution of metallic ions, this series substitutes its anion groups; phosphate (PO4), arsenate (AsO4) and vanadate (VO4). Common impurities of vanadinite include phosphorus, arsenic and calcium, where these may act as an isomorphic substitute for vanadium. Vanadinite when containing a high amount of the arsenic impurity is known as endlichite.|$|E
5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian {{fruit is}} ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, <b>whereas</b> <b>most</b> cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E

5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, <b>whereas</b> <b>most</b> microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E
5|$|Most British breeders {{thought the}} {{regulation}} necessary and welcomed it, <b>whereas</b> <b>most</b> American breeders found it insulting, {{and believed that}} it was intended merely to protect the British racehorse market. The rule did adversely affect many British breeders as well though, including even one senior member of the Jockey Club, Lord Coventry, whose successful line of racehorses was ineligible for registration. Initially there was little foreign complaint or organized opposition, probably owing to the effect of the gambling bans in the United States on the domestic horse market. The American Jockey Club did not even remark on the Jersey Act in its official publication, the Racing Calendar, and no mention of it appears in the Jockey Club's meeting minutes for 1913. Contributing to the lack of outcry was a legal ruling in New York allowing oral betting at racetracks, which led to the growth of racing in the United States; by 1920 the American breeding market had rebounded and was booming.|$|E
5|$|The 20S {{proteasome}} is both ubiquitous {{and essential}} in eukaryotes. Some prokaryotes, including many archaea and the bacterial order Actinomycetales also share homologs of the 20S proteasome, <b>whereas</b> <b>most</b> bacteria possess heat shock genes hslV and hslU, whose gene products are a multimeric protease {{arranged in a}} two-layered ring and an ATPase. The hslV protein has been hypothesized to resemble the likely ancestor of the 20S proteasome. In general, HslV is not essential in bacteria, and not all bacteria possess it, whereas some protists possess both the 20S and the hslV systems. Many bacteria also possess other homologs of the proteasome and an associated ATPase, most notably ClpP and ClpX. This redundancy explains why the HslUV system is not essential.|$|E

5|$|The Silkie (sometimes spelled Silky) is a {{breed of}} chicken {{named for its}} atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk, and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, <b>whereas</b> <b>most</b> {{chickens}} only have four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It {{is among the most}} docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Though they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature. Silkie chickens are very easy to keep as pets. They are suitable for children, as they can easily withstand being roughly handled.|$|E
5|$|The citadel {{is located}} in the {{northwest}} corner of the old walled city of Damascus, between the Bab al-Faradis and the Bab al-Jabiyah. <b>Whereas</b> <b>most</b> medieval Arabic castles are located on prominent hilltops, the citadel of Damascus was built on flat ground at the same level {{as the rest of the}} city, a feature it shares with the Citadel of Bosra. The location of the citadel ensured that it could control the Barada River, which flows north of the citadel. The location of the river also offered protection against attack from that side of the citadel. The Nahr Aqrabani, a canal branching off the Barada, flowed immediately below the northern wall and provided additional protection. The dry moats on the other sides of the citadel could be filled from these streams. Another branch of the Barada, the Nahr Banyas, entered the city under the citadel. Hydraulic structures below that made control of the flow of water into Damascus possible from within the citadel were probably constructed under Al-Adil. The citadel was fully integrated into the defences of Damascus, with the city walls abutting the citadel on its southwest and northeast corners.|$|E
5|$|WALL-E was {{the most}} complex Pixar {{production}} since Monsters, Inc. because {{of the world and}} the history that had to be conveyed. <b>Whereas</b> <b>most</b> Pixar films have up to 75,000 storyboards, WALL-E required 125,000. Production designer Ralph Eggleston wanted the lighting of the first act on Earth to be romantic, and that of the second act on the Axiom to be cold and sterile. During the third act, the romantic lighting is slowly introduced into the Axiom environment. Pixar studied Chernobyl and the city of Sofia to create the ruined world; art director Anthony Christov was from Bulgaria and recalled Sofia used to have problems storing its garbage. Eggleston bleached out the whites on Earth to make WALL-E feel vulnerable. The overexposed light makes the location look more vast. Because of the haziness, the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be large, otherwise they would have lost shape (in turn, this helped save rendering time). The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a Christmas tree. Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL-E—who was made yellow to emulate a tractor—would not blend into the deserted Earth, and to make the plant more prominent.|$|E
