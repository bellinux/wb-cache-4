500|$|Andreas Heldal-Lund, {{founder of}} the Scientology-critical website and {{non-profit}} organization Operation Clambake, released a statement criticizing the digital assault against Scientology. Heldal-Lund commented, [...] "People {{should be able to}} have easy access to both sides and make up their own opinions. Freedom of speech means we need to allow all to speak - including those <b>we</b> <b>strongly</b> disagree with. I am of the opinion that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organisation and a cult which is designed by its delusional founder to abuse people. I am still committed to fight for their right to speak their opinion." [...] He also stated that [...] "Attacking Scientology like that will just make them play the religious persecution card ... They will use it to defend their own counter actions when they try to shatter criticism and crush critics without mercy." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, vaccine {{scientists}} praised the ruling, with Paul Offit stating [...] "the autism theory had 'already had its day in science court {{and failed to}} hold up. Additionally, Autism Speaks said that [...] "the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, <b>we</b> <b>strongly</b> encourage parents to vaccinate their children {{to protect them from}} serious childhood diseases." [...] The Department of Health and Human Services released a statement saying that [...] "Hopefully, the determination by the special masters will help reassure parents that vaccines do not cause autism." [...] Similarly, the chairman of the American Medical Association stated that the [...] "recent rulings by the Special Masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims provide even more overwhelming evidence that there is no association between vaccines and autism or related disorders." ...|$|E

2500|$|We {{would like}} to {{announce}} {{to the people that}} <b>we</b> <b>strongly</b> believe that the National Education Law will affect not only the education sector but [...] the entire country and the people. [...] Therefore, the Myanmar Teachers Federation will fully cooperate with the student unions across the country who are pushing for the education reform that will benefit the country.|$|E
2500|$|But we {{also believe}} the recent violent acts surpass {{the limits of}} {{peaceful}} protest. [...] In particular, <b>we</b> <b>strongly</b> condemn the deplorable attacks on diplomatic missions {{that have occurred in}} Damascus, Beirut and elsewhere. [...] Aggression against life and property can only damage the image of a peaceful Islam. [...] We call on the authorities of all countries to protect all diplomatic premises and foreign citizens against unlawful attack.|$|E

2500|$|Chinese {{authorities}} were also reportedly {{concerned that the}} Tibetan protests could [...] "embolden activists in restive Xinjiang province" [...] to organise street protests as well. The Chinese-backed Panchen Lama, Gyaincain Norbu, condemned the unrest, saying, [...] "the rioters' acts not only harmed {{the interests of the}} nation and the people, but also violated the aim of Buddhism.... <b>We</b> <b>strongly</b> condemn the crime of a tiny number of people to hurt the lives and properties of the people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zeman {{called for}} unified armed {{operation}} against Islamic State (ISIL) {{led by the}} U.N. Security Council. In June 2015, Zeman commented that: [...] "If European countries accept a wave of migrants, there will be terrorist groups among them, of which also a Libyan minister has warned. By accepting the migrants, <b>we</b> <b>strongly</b> facilitate Islamic State’s expansion to Europe." [...] Zeman described the Middle Eastern refugees arriving in Europe as an [...] "organized invasion". In September 2015, Zeman rejected the European Union's proposal of compulsory migrant quotas, saying, [...] "Only the future will show {{that this was a}} big mistake".|$|E
2500|$|We {{also see}} honest congruity with the {{language}} of the body by saying [...] "no" [...] to conception with our bodies (via barrier methods or sensual massage) when our minds and hearts are also saying [...] "no" [...] to conception. We don’t believe this angers God, nor that it leads to the slippery slope of relativism or divorce. <b>We</b> <b>strongly</b> disagree with the idea that this is a mortal sin.... It’s a theological attack on women to always require that abstinence {{during the time of the}} wife’s peak sexual desire (ovulation) for the entire duration of her fertile life, except for the handful of times when she conceives.|$|E

For such functions we show their Sobolev regularity and smoothness. Moreover, <b>we</b> prove that <b>strongly</b> harmonic functions satisfy the sub-Laplace equation for the appropriate gauge norm and that the inclusion is sharp. We observe that spherical harmonic polynomials in H_ 1 are both strongly harmonic and satisfy the sub-Laplace equation. Our presentation is illustrated by examples. Comment: 24 page...|$|R

2500|$|... – President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo {{condemned}} the assassination, saying [...] "We mourn {{with the nation}} of Pakistan over the deaths of Benazir Bhutto and others killed in the shooting and bomb attack in Rawalpindi. <b>We</b> <b>strongly</b> condemn this unmitigated, senseless atrocity, even as we convey our sympathies to the followers of former Prime Minister Bhutto and {{the families of those}} who perished. Whoever perpetrated it, this attack is an assault on democracy. The Philippines joins hands with the entire civilized world in solidarity against such mindless barbarity and in unwavering defense of peace, freedom, law and order." [...] Arroyo called on the international community to join hands in preserving peace and order and democracy.|$|E
2500|$|Scott {{voted for}} the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. In 1966, along with two other Republican Senators and five Republican Representatives, Scott signed a {{telegram}} sent to Georgia Governor Carl E. Sanders regarding the Georgia legislature's refusal to seat the recently elected Julian Bond in their state House of Representatives. This refusal, said the telegram, was [...] "a dangerous attack on representative government. None of us agree with Mr. Bond's views on the Vietnam War; in fact <b>we</b> <b>strongly</b> repudiate these views. But unless otherwise determined by a court of law, which the Georgia Legislature is not, he is entitled to express them." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Virgin Media, the {{comments}} in the article were {{taken out of context}} and misinterpreted. A statement released by the company states: [...] "With Virgin Media rolling out a 50Mb service later this year, we are uniquely equipped to cope with the demand for new bandwidth-hungry services. <b>We</b> <b>strongly</b> support the principle that the internet should remain a space that is open to all and we have not called for content providers to pay for distribution. However, we recognise that as more customers turn to the web for content, different providers will have different needs and priorities and in the long term, it's legitimate to question how this demand will be managed. We welcome an informed debate on this issue." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the sentence the British embassy in Indonesia said the United Kingdom [...] "remains strongly opposed {{to the death penalty}} in all circumstances" [...] and that it was in touch with the UK government to discuss how best to provide Sandiford with legal representation. In a statement to the House of Commons, Hugo Swire, Minister of State for the Foreign Office expressed his concern about the decision. [...] "We are aware that Lindsay Sandiford is facing the death penalty in Indonesia. <b>We</b> <b>strongly</b> object to the death penalty and continue to provide consular assistance to Lindsay and her family during this difficult time." [...] He also said that Foreign Secretary William Hague had raised the matter with his Indonesian counterpart.|$|E
2500|$|European People's Party President and Chairman of the EPP European Parliament group MEP Joseph Daul and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament MEP Elmar Brok {{issued a}} joint {{statement}} that read: [...] "On behalf of the largest political family in the European Union, <b>we</b> <b>strongly</b> condemn the decision to deploy troops in Ukraine and we call on President Putin to stop any influx of Russian troops on the sovereign territory of Ukraine. It is despicable that Russia would use its military force and violate the territorial integrity of an independent state which is Ukraine. Russia’s provocative actions risk a military confrontation and bloodshed which could be too big to contemplate. The invasion of Ukraine should stop now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gartons Limited was the United Kingdom’s {{only major}} {{agricultural}} plant breeding company. [...] But this caused them difficulties {{as early as}} in their Spring 1900 seed catalogue where a paragraph of the introduction reads: [...] It has come to our knowledge that nearly all the New Breeds introduced by us {{up to the present}} time have been renamed by various dealers and are being offered by them under different names. Although the honesty of this conduct is more than questionable, we are resigned for the present to regard it as a novel form of flattery, but <b>we</b> <b>strongly</b> recommend all those who wish to secure our Seeds to order them direct from us, as they cannot be procured from any other genuine source.|$|E

We think that Jesus' words in Luke 11:46 apply: [...] "And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry." [...] How is it that spouses are saying [...] "yes" [...] to the gift of each other when they end up abstaining for much of their married lives? ...

2500|$|His {{attitude}} towards homosexual Ethiopians remains orthodox. In December 2008, {{he was one}} of nearly a dozen Ethiopian religious figures (including the leader of Ethiopian Muslim Majlis Council and the heads of the Protestant and Catholic churches) who adopted a resolution against homosexuality, urging Ethiopian lawmakers to endorse a ban on homosexual activity in the constitution. The religious figures attributed a rise in sexual attacks on children and young men to the vice of homosexuality. Abuna Paulos went on to say, [...] "This is something very strange in Ethiopia, the land of the Bible that condemns this very strongly. For people to act in this manner they have to be dumb, stupid like animals. <b>We</b> <b>strongly</b> condemn this behaviour. They (homosexuals) have to be disciplined and their acts discriminated, they have to be given a lesson." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "most {{prominent}} addition" [...] to {{the protest}} was the [...] "Reform Government Surveillance" [...] coalition, which includes AOL, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Yahoo. It was not initially clear how the sites would participate. The group {{sent a letter}} to President Obama on November 11 and [...] "urged changes that would include a government agreement not to collect bulk data from Internet communications." [...] On the same day, Google announced its support for the USA Freedom Act, saying [...] "Google recognizes the very real threats that the U.S. and other countries face, but <b>we</b> <b>strongly</b> believe that government surveillance programs should operate under a legal framework that is rule-bound, narrowly tailored, transparent, and subject to oversight." [...] Matt Simons, director of social and economic justice at ThoughtWorks, nevertheless said the coalition's support of The Day We Fight Back [...] "rings a little hollow" [...] because of the late date of its announcement and its member's past disclosure of their customers' data to the NSA.|$|E
