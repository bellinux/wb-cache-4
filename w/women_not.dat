5|$|Let us {{bring up}} <b>women,</b> <b>not</b> {{to aspire to}} {{advantages}} which the Constitution denies them, but to know and appreciate those which it guarantees them... Men are destined {{to live on the}} stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places before their eyes all the scenes of life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home is better for the education of women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for <b>women</b> <b>not</b> only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E
5|$|In a dissenting opinion, a {{systematic}} review of four head-to-head comparative trials of metformin and clomifene found them equally effective for infertility. Four positive studies of metformin were in <b>women</b> <b>not</b> responding to clomifene, while {{the population in}} the negative studies was drug-naive or uncontrolled for the previous treatment. Metformin should be used as a second-line drug if clomifene treatment fails. Another review recommended metformin unreservedly as a first-line treatment option because it has positive effects not only on anovulation, but also on insulin resistance, hirsutism and obesity often associated with PCOS. A Cochrane Collaboration review found metformin improves ovulation and pregnancy rates, particularly when combined with clomifene, but is not associated with {{an increase in the number}} of live births.|$|E

5|$|Romney took a {{hands-on}} {{role in the}} Belmont Stake's matters, helping in domestic maintenance efforts, visiting the sick, and counseling burdened church members. A number of local church members later credited him with turning their lives around or helping them through difficult times. Others, rankled by his leadership style, desired a more consensus-based approach. Romney tried to balance the conservative directives from church leadership in Utah with the desire of some Massachusetts members {{to have a more}} flexible application of religious doctrine. He agreed with some requests from a liberal women's group that published Exponent II calling for changes in the way the church dealt with women, but he clashed with women whom he felt were departing too much from doctrine. In particular, he counseled <b>women</b> <b>not</b> to have abortions except in the rare cases allowed by LDS doctrine and encouraged unmarried women facing unplanned pregnancies to give up their babies for adoption. Romney later said that the years spent as an LDS minister gave him direct exposure to people struggling financially and empathy for those with family problems.|$|E

25|$|Earrings {{became a}} {{mainstream}} fashion for male teenagers. Jelly or thin metal bracelets (also known as bangles) were {{very popular in}} the 1980s, and would be worn in mass quantities on one's wrist. Designer jewelry, such as diamonds and pearls, were popular among many <b>women,</b> <b>not</b> only for beauty, but as symbols of wealth and power.|$|E

25|$|Citing this, the Mishnah Berurah {{rules that}} not only are <b>women</b> <b>not</b> to prepare or attach warp threads to a weaving loom, but it is {{forbidden}} for anyone to make, buy or wear new clothes or shoes {{from the beginning of}} the week in which Tisha B'Av falls until after the fast, and that people should ideally not do so from the beginning of Av.|$|E
25|$|In {{regions of}} Iraq and Syria under ISIL, {{there have been}} reports of floggings as well as {{execution}} against people who engage in adultery. The method of execution was typically through stoning. ISIL would not merely oppose adultery but also oppose behavior that {{from their point of view}} could lead to adultery, such as <b>women</b> <b>not</b> being covered, people of the opposite sex socializing with one another, or even female mannequins in store windows.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{problems}} with gender segregation have surfaced on airlines such as El Al, where ultra-Orthodox male passengers have pressured females to move, and planes have been delayed as a result. The New York Times interviewed Anat Hoffman on {{the phenomenon of}} ultra-Orthodox males asking female passengers on airlines to move, noting that IRAC had started a campaign urging Israeli <b>women</b> <b>not</b> {{to give up their}} seats. “I have a hundred stories,” said Hoffman.|$|E

25|$|Appointed by the Provisional Government in 1933 {{to draft}} {{the first page}} of the new Constitution, Berta Lutz {{included}} various provisions to promote equal rights between men and <b>women.</b> <b>Not</b> only were women granted the equal right to hold government office and earn equal pay for equal work, but also were given preference over men in all government jobs dealing with the home, motherhood, children, and working conditions for women. The preferential treatment afforded to women in regard to certain government positions was controversial at the time.|$|E
25|$|The Vestals were {{a public}} priesthood of six women {{devoted to the}} {{cultivation}} of Vesta, goddess of the hearth of the Roman state and its vital flame. A girl chosen to be a Vestal achieved unique religious distinction, public status and privileges, and could exercise considerable political influence. Upon entering her office, a Vestal was emancipated from her father's authority. In archaic Roman society, these priestesses were the only <b>women</b> <b>not</b> required {{to be under the}} legal guardianship of a man, instead answering directly to the Pontifex Maximus.|$|E
25|$|Mangels et al. write that, {{because of}} the lower {{bioavailability}} of iron from plant sources, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences established a separate RDA for vegetarians and vegans of 14mg for vegetarian men and postmenopausal women, and 33mg for premenopausal <b>women</b> <b>not</b> using oral contraceptives. Supplements should be used with caution after consulting a physician, because iron can accumulate {{in the body and}} cause damage to organs. This is particularly true of anyone with hemochromatosis, a relatively common condition that can remain undiagnosed.|$|E
