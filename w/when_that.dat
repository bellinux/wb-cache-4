On 1 April 1974, Bristol became a local government district of the county of Avon. The city regained its independence and county status on 1 April 1996, when Avon was abolished and Bristol became a unitary authority.|$|E

In an attempt to scotch the rumours, he demanded a retraction from five of the house party; <b>when</b> <b>that</b> was not forthcoming, with no withdrawal forthcoming, on 6 February 1891, Gordon-Cumming issued writs for slander against the five, claiming £5,000 against each of them.|$|E
5|$|Disregarding the dates, most historians agree {{upon the}} same {{sequence}} of events for {{this part of the}} Sacred War. The principal question is therefore <b>when</b> <b>that</b> sequence started. Thus, Buckler (as well as Beloch and Cloche) dates Neon to 355 BC, Methone to 355–354 BC, Philip's first Thessalian campaign to 354 BC, and his second to 353 BC. Conversely, Cawkwell, Sealey, Hammond and others give these dates as occurring one year later, beginning with Neon in 354 BC.|$|E

5|$|NY36 was {{assigned}} in the mid-1920s to an alignment extending from Hornell {{in the south}} to Avon in the north. The route utilized the routing of legislative Route15 from Hornell to Dansville and from Mount Morris to Shakers Crossing, the modern junction of NY63 and NY408 northeast of Mount Morris. Between Dansville and Mount Morris, NY36 followed its current alignment. Past Shakers Crossing, NY36 continued northward through Geneseo to Avon on modern NY63 and NY39. The Geneseo–Avon segment of NY36 became part of US20 <b>when</b> <b>that</b> route {{was assigned}} in 1927. South of Hornell, what is now NY36 from Hornell to Jasper became part of NY17 <b>when</b> <b>that</b> route was assigned to most of legislative Route4 in 1924. The remaining sections of contemporary NY36—from Jasper to the Pennsylvania state line and north of Mount Morris—were state-maintained but unnumbered.|$|E

5|$|Once {{registration}} {{had been}} completed and the deposits were made, the author was granted an exclusive right to control the copying of the book.

This exclusive right's length was dependent on when the book had been published. If it was published after 10 April 1710, the length of copyright was 14 years; if published before that date, 21 years. An author who survived until the copyright expired would be granted an additional 14-year term, and <b>when</b> <b>that</b> ran out, the works would enter the public domain.
