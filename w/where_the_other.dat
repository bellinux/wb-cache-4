5|$|Dustin won Eurosong 2008, {{and went}} on to {{represent}} Ireland in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 on 20 May 2008. Only the winner of the final was announced; it is unknown <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> five songs placed.|$|E
5|$|As these laudes {{were to be}} {{performed}} with a very limited accompaniment of instruments, they were supposedly performed from the small loft in the high choir of the Thomaskirche, opposite to the large organ loft <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> movements of the Magnificat were performed. The autograph of the E-flat major version of the Magnificat (BWV 243a) suggests that Bach intended to perform {{the first version of}} his Magnificat also without the laudes, depending on circumstances, for example on other feasts than Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Later, Tyrion is {{awakened by}} Bronn as a Stark force approaches. Tyrion leaves his tent dressed in armor and orders the hill tribes to combat, {{but he is}} trampled as they rush to war. By the time he regains consciousness, the battle has been played out. Lord Tywin reveals that the Stark host was only 2,000 men, leaving them to wonder <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> 18,000 went.|$|E

5|$|On 21 June 1958, the Parliamentary Assembly {{recommended}} to the Council that the Assembly should have its {{seat in the}} same place <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> organisations are based, although it accepted that plenary sessions could be held elsewhere. The Assembly also nominated three cities to be the seat of the institutions (Brussels, Strasbourg and Milan), however no permanent agreement was reached.|$|E
5|$|The A57 and A61 {{roads are}} the major trunk roads through Sheffield. These run east–west and north–south respectively, {{crossing}} in the city centre, from <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> major roads generally radiate spoke-like. An inner ring road, mostly constructed in the 1970s and extended in 2007 to form a complete ring, allows traffic to avoid the city centre, and an outer ring road runs to the east, south east and north, nearer {{the edge of the}} city, but does not serve the western side of Sheffield.|$|E
5|$|Vrataski frees Cage, who {{recruits}} J squad to help {{destroy the}} Omega {{before the invasion}} begins. They fly to Paris, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> soldiers sacrifice themselves so that Cage and Vrataski {{can get into the}} Louvre. Just before luring away an Alpha standing between them and the submerged Omega, Vrataski kisses Cage to thank him for getting her as far as he did. The Alpha kills Vrataski and mortally wounds Cage, but he manages to drop a belt of grenades, killing the Omega.|$|E

5|$|Prey is {{obtained}} by hunting {{either on the}} ground or in the trees. During the non-breeding season the fossa hunts individually, but during the breeding season hunting parties may be seen, and these may be pairs or later on mothers and young. One member of the group scales a tree and chases the lemurs from tree to tree, forcing them down to the ground <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> is easily able to capture them. The fossa is known to eviscerate its larger lemur prey, a trait that, along with its distinct scat, helps identify its kills. Long-term observations of the fossa's predation patterns on rainforest sifakas suggest that the fossa hunts in a subsection of their range until prey density is decreased, then moves on. The fossa has been reported to prey on domestic animals, such as goats and small calves, and especially chickens. Food taken in captivity includes amphibians, birds, insects, reptiles, and small- to medium-sized mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiments}} with the 184-inch magnet {{led to the}} construction of a prototype calutron called the XA. It contained a rectangular, three-coil magnet with a horizontal field in which the calutron tanks could stand side by side, with four vacuum tanks, each with a double source. At the 25 June 1942 meeting of the S-1 Executive Committee, which had superseded the S-1 Uranium Committee on 19 June, there was a proposal to build the electromagnetic plant at Oak Ridge, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Manhattan Project facilities would be located, for reasons of economy and security. Lawrence lodged an objection due to his desire to have the electromagnetic separation plant located much nearer to Berkeley. The Shasta Dam area in California remained under consideration for the electromagnetic plant until September 1942, by which time Lawrence had dropped his objection. The 25 June meeting also designated Stone & Webster as the primary contractor for the design and engineering.|$|E

25|$|In Central and Eastern Europe {{horseradish}} {{is called}} khren (in various spellings like kren) in many Slavic languages, in Austria, {{in parts of}} Germany (<b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> German name Meerrettich isn't used), in North-East Italy, and in Yiddish (כריין transliterated as khreyn).|$|E
25|$|In most Communist {{countries}} adultery {{was not a}} crime. Romania was an exception, where adultery was a crime until 2006, {{though the}} crime of adultery had a narrow definition, excluding situations <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> spouse encouraged the act or when the act happened at a time the couple was living separate and apart; and in practice prosecutions were extremely rare.|$|E
25|$|However, some UK {{commentators}} {{argue that}} the FNC rules may still apply to cases <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> proceedings {{are not in a}} Member state but this remains uncertain. What is certain is that a Scottish Court may sist its proceedings in favour of the Courts of England or Northern Ireland on the ground of FNC, since this is settling intra-UK jurisdiction.|$|E

25|$|Where {{the signals}} and points (UK term) or rail {{switches}} (US) are power-operated, {{it can be}} worthwhile to signal each line in both directions, so that the double line becomes a pair of single lines. This allows trains to use one track <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> track is out of service due to track maintenance work, or a train failure, or for a fast train to overtake a slow train.|$|E
25|$|The Tainted – <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Nazgûl were slowly {{swallowed}} by the taint of their rings, the Tainted gave himself wholly and willingly to Sauron. Now all natural things rebel in his presence, vegetation withers, animals sicken and bold warriors cower. He is an abomination whose merest presence is poison to life, honour and hope. The Tainted {{is one of the}} Nazgûl, representing their withering, abhorrent nature. His mounted model is built to look as though his horse were sickened and dying by merely being near him.|$|E
25|$|Dead or diseased trees {{within the}} reach of saw team crews are evaluated, the {{strength}} {{and direction of the}} wind is evaluated. The lay of tree sections to be bucked or the lean of a tree to be felled is evaluated within the context of being aware of where the tree will fall or move to when cut, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> members of the saw team are located, how they are moving, whether hikers are within the area of influence, whether hikers are moving or are stationary.|$|E

25|$|In 2010 and 2013, {{expeditions to}} Muschu Island were {{conducted}} by MIA Australia, leading {{to the discovery of}} the remains of four of the Z Special Commandos lost on the Muschu raid. In late February 2014 it was announced that the remains of former St George first grade rugby league player, Lance Corporal Spencer Henry Walklate, and Private Ronald Eagleton, would be laid to rest in May 2014 with full military honours at the Lae War Cemetery, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> five men from Operation Copper are buried.|$|E

In a brave attempt to save both Laerdan and the ring Narchuil, the player {{is able to}} get to them before Amarthiel does, but only half of the ring was found. Laerdan confesses to Elrond he has broken the Narchuil in two, and reveals <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> part should be.

The head later appeared in numerous locations most notably the set of a Dubliners concert and also ina london antique shop close to Trafalgar square <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> pillar is located.|$|E
