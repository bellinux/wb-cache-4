Methods and results We performed a meta-analysis of eight randomized trials comparing drug-eluting stents (sirolimus-eluting or paclitaxel-eluting stents) with bare-metal stents in 2786 patients <b>with</b> acute <b>ST-segment</b> <b>elevation</b> myocardial infarction. All patients were followed up for a mean of 12. 0 - 24. 2 months. Individual data were available for seven trials with 2476 patients. The primary efficacy endpoint was the need for reintervention (target lesion revascularization). The primary safety endpoint was stent thrombosis. Other outcomes of interest were death and recurrent myocardial infarction. Drug-eluting stents significantly reduced the risk of reintervention, hazard ratio of 0. 38 (95 % CI, 0. 29 - 0. 50), P < 0. 001. The overall risk of stent thrombosis: hazard ratio of 0. 80 (95 % CI, 0. 46 - 1. 39), P = 0. 43; death: hazard ratio of 0. 76 (95 % CI, 0. 53 - 1. 10), P = 0. 14; and recurrent myocardial infarction: hazard ratio of 0. 72 (95 % CI, 0. 48 - 1. 08, P = 0. 11) was not significantly different for patients receiving drug-eluting stents vs. bare-metal stents.

The objectives of this multinational study were to describe geographic variation in the extent of and factors associated with prehospital delay in patients enrolled in the GRACE study. Data were collected from 44, 695 patients hospitalized with an acute coronary syndrome in 14 countries from 2000 to 2006. The regions under study included Argentina and Brazil (n = 8, 203), United States/Canada (n = 12, 810), Europe (n = 19, 354), and Australia/New Zealand (n = 4, 328). Patients <b>with</b> <b>ST-segment</b> <b>elevation</b> AMI, non-ST-segment elevation AMI, and unstable angina comprised the study population. There were marked geographic differences in extent of prehospital delay in patients <b>with</b> <b>ST-segment</b> <b>elevation</b> AMI and those with non-ST-segment elevation AMI/unstable angina. In patients <b>with</b> <b>ST-segment</b> <b>elevation</b> AMI, the shortest duration of prehospital delay was observed in patients from Australia/New Zealand (median 2. 2 hours), whereas patients from Argentina and Brazil delayed the longest (median 4. 0 hours).

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{evaluate}} the frequency of occurrence of leukocytosis and its prognostic value for the course and outcome of myocardial infarction <b>with</b> <b>ST-segment</b> <b>elevation.</b> Material and Methods. The study included 245 patients aged 61, 2 years, who were on treatment at the Department of Emergency Cardiology with diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction <b>with</b> <b>ST-segment</b> <b>elevation.</b> Results. Leukocytosis (white blood cell levels of more than 10 * 109 /L) was observed in 34, 7 % of patients.

There {{were no significant differences in}} the incidence of adverse events in the long-term period between the patients with leukocytosis and with normal level of white blood cells. Conclusion. Increased levels of white blood cells (more than 10 * 109 /L) in patients with myocardial infarction <b>with</b> <b>ST-segment</b> <b>elevation</b> is associated with a significantly increase relative risk of cardiogenic shock (Odds ratio 5, 2, 95 % Cl, 1, 7 - 15, 8, p= 0. 001), ventricular fibrillation (Odds ratio 8, 5, 95 % Cl, 1, 9 - 38, 3, p= 0. 001) and death during hospitalization (Odds ratio 2, 47, 95 % Cl, 1, 87 - 38, 4, p= 0, 03).

The degree of exercise-induced <b>ST-segment</b> <b>elevation</b> (1. 8 ± 0. 2 vs. 2. 0 ± 0. 2 mm) and the time from the onset of infarction to the study (75 ± 49 vs. 74 ± 52 days) did not differ between groups.
