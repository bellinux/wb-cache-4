5|$|Coffin {{continued}} to farm {{after moving to}} Indiana and {{within a year of}} his arrival he opened the first dry-goods store in Newport. In later years Coffin credited the success of his business, which he expanded in the 1830s, <b>with</b> <b>providing</b> him the ability to become heavily involved in the costly enterprise of the Underground Railroad, a costly and risky enterprise that provided a network of stopover sites for fugitive slaves as they traveled north into Canada.|$|E
5|$|From 2006 until 2013 a battalion-sized Australian Army {{task force}} {{operated}} in Urozgan Province, Afghanistan; this unit was primarily tasked <b>with</b> <b>providing</b> assistance for reconstruction efforts and training Afghan forces, but was frequently involved in combat. In addition, Special Forces Task Groups were deployed from 2005 to 2006 and 2007 until 2013. Other specialist {{elements of the}} ADF, including detachments of CH-47 Chinook helicopters and RAAF radar and air traffic control units, were also periodically deployed to the country. A total of 40 ADF personnel were killed in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2013, and 262 wounded. Following {{the withdrawal of the}} combat forces in 2013, ADF training teams have continued to be stationed in the country to train Afghan forces.|$|E

5|$|Georgia Tech {{maintains}} {{close ties}} to the industrial world. Many of these connections are made through Georgia Tech's cooperative education and internship programs. Georgia Tech's Division of Professional Practice (DoPP), established in 1912 as the Georgia Institute of Technology Cooperative Division, operates the largest and fourth-oldest cooperative education program in the United States, and is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Cooperative Education. The DoPP is charged <b>with</b> <b>providing</b> opportunities for students to gain real-world employment experience through four programs, each targeting a different body of students. The Undergraduate Cooperative Education Program is a five-year program in which undergraduate students alternate between semesters of formal instruction at Georgia Tech and semesters of full-time employment with their employers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1770s, cannon {{operation}} {{worked as}} follows: each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, {{and the left}} gunner would fetch the powder from the magazine {{and be ready to}} fire the cannon at the officer's command. On each side of the cannon, three soldiers stood, to ram and sponge the cannon, and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left tasked <b>with</b> <b>providing</b> 50 bullets.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years in western Virginia, pioneer {{settlers}} were primarily concerned <b>with</b> <b>providing</b> defense from Native American attacks, so little emphasis was placed upon education.

With the growth of settlement in Pearsall's Flats, and later Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans for the establishment of schools and churches.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, six Beauforts of No. 100 Squadron RAAF {{had arrived}} at Milne Bay on 5 September. An {{additional}} three Beaufighters of No. 30 Squadron RAAF, the first to operate this aircraft, joined them the following day. The Beauforts were tasked <b>with</b> <b>providing</b> additional support against further landings and undertaking anti-shipping missions. On 6 September, the Allied offensive reached the main camp of the Japanese landing force, fighting a number of minor actions against small groups {{that had been left}} behind after the evacuation.|$|E
5|$|Other accomplishments during Brittain's {{administration}} {{included a}} doubling of Georgia Tech's enrollment, the first ROTC unit in the Southern United States, accreditation for the Institute by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, {{and the creation of}} a new ceramic engineering department, building, and major that attracted the American Ceramics Society's national convention to Atlanta. Perhaps most significantly, Brittain is attributed <b>with</b> <b>providing</b> the vision and securing the finances to move Georgia Tech away from its roots as a teaching-oriented trade school and towards a new focus on science and technology research.|$|E

5|$|Reshef sent another tank {{company to}} rescue the infantrymen. The tanks {{advanced}} towards the Chinese Farm from the south. As they neared the farm and the village, a downpour of anti-tank and artillery fire forced the company to retreat. Nathan kept pleading with Rehsef to send additional support, unaware he was facing superior Egyptian forces after entering the administrative bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions. With no help coming, the unit commander had his men carry the wounded and attempted to leave the battlefield, tasking two sections of heavy machine guns <b>with</b> <b>providing</b> cover to the force. As the Israelis slowly made {{their way back to}} their lines, a group of Egyptian tanks intercepted and wiped out the Israeli force.|$|E
5|$|The Axis had {{air superiority}} as Soviet Karelian was {{protected}} by the 1st and 55th Mixed Air Divisions, totaling 273 aircraft, many outclassed by their enemy. This situation was partly alleviated by the reinforcement of No. 151 Wing RAF on September 7, 1941 at Vaenga airfield. The Wing was tasked <b>with</b> <b>providing</b> Hawker Hurricane aircraft and training for the Russians, but also flew 365 sorties over the Murmansk area, accounting for 14 German aircraft kills.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Croatia {{established}} several {{bodies to}} address the problem of land mines in Croatia; foremost among them are the Office for Mine Action and the Croatian Mine Action Centre.

5|$|The Stoßtrupp was {{abolished}} {{after the}} failed 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, {{an attempt by}} the NSDAP to seize power in Munich. In 1925, Hitler ordered Schreck to organize a new bodyguard unit, the Schutzkommando (Protection Command). It was tasked <b>with</b> <b>providing</b> personal protection for Hitler at NSDAP functions and events. That same year, the Schutzkommando was expanded to a national organization and renamed successively the Sturmstaffel (Storm Squadron), and finally the Schutzstaffel (Protection Squad; SS). Officially, the SS marked its foundation on 9 November 1925 (the second anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch). The new SS was to provide protection for NSDAP leaders throughout Germany. Hitler's personal SS protection unit was later enlarged to include combat units.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{incorporation}} {{of rock and}} roll into their sound was an inspiration for groups such as Restless Heart, Shenandoah, Exile, Diamond Rio, Lonestar, Ricochet, and the Mavericks. According to Irwin Stambler and Grelun Landon, authors of Country Music: The Encyclopedia, the group's diminishing sales in the late 1980s reflected competition from country bands that would not have received recognition {{had it not been for}} Alabama paving the way. For their part, these groups credited Alabama <b>with</b> <b>providing</b> a massive influence on their careers. Prior to Alabama's unprecedented chart success, most country hit singles belonged to solo artists or duets. Many Alabama singles and albums represented crossover appeal on the pop charts.|$|E

From the Jagdfliegerschule in Werneuchen, he detached two squadrons and placed them under the command of Jagdgruppe 20 based at Strausberg. At the end of October 1939, a change in command of I. Gruppe (1st group) of Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG3—3rd Fighter Wing) was announced. The former commander Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Otto-Heinrich von Houwald was transferred to the Jagdfliegerschule in Werneuchen. Lützow joined I. Gruppe on 1 November 1939, officially taking over command as Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) two days later.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{shot down}} her first Japanese {{aircraft}} the following month, in March 1944. The ship conducted anti-aircraft defense operations during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944. After that, she joined other battleships that were providing gunfire {{support to the}} ground troops in the Marianas islands. She was assigned to Task Force 34 during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. In early 1945, Alabama returned for repair and refit work at the Puget Sound naval yard; the work consisted primarily of improvements to her guns and radar equipment. By early May the ship returned to fleet operations. She was tasked <b>with</b> <b>providing</b> anti-aircraft support to the fast carrier groups that were launching air strikes on the Japanese main island of Kyushu. In July 1945, she shelled {{a number of areas}} in Japan, including Kamaishi on the 14th, Hitachi on the 18th, and Hamamatsu on the 29th and 30th. These turned out to be her last offensive operations of the war. Her last duty in the Far East was to assist in the landing of occupation forces in Japan, after which she departed for the United States.|$|E
5|$|Any {{offensive}} planning by the U.S. was, however, {{limited by}} the passage on 29 December 1970 of the Cooper-Church Amendment, which prohibited U.S. ground forces and advisors from entering Laos. Dewey Canyon II would, therefore, be conducted within territorial South Vietnam in order to reopen Route 9 {{all the way to}} the old Khe Sanh Combat Base, which had been abandoned by U.S. forces in 1968. The base would be reopened and would then serve as the logistical hub and airhead of the ARVN incursion. U.S. combat engineers were tasked with clearing Route 9 and rehabilitating Khe Sanh while infantry and mechanized units secured a line of communications along the length of the road. American artillery units would support the ARVN effort within Laos from the South Vietnamese side of the border while Army logisticians coordinated the entire supply effort for the South Vietnamese. Air support for the incursion would be provided by the aircraft of the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, and U.S. Army aviation units were tasked <b>with</b> <b>providing</b> complete helicopter support for the ARVN operation.|$|E
