25|$|Pond {{hockey is}} a form of ice hockey played {{generally}} as pick-up hockey on lakes, ponds and artificial outdoor rinks during the <b>winter.</b> <b>Pond</b> hockey is commonly referred to in hockey circles as shinny. Its rules differ from traditional hockey because there is no hitting and very little shooting, placing a greater emphasis on skating, puckhandling and passing abilities. Since 2002, the World Pond Hockey Championship has been played on Roulston Lake in Plaster Rock, New Brunswick, Canada. Since 2006, the US Pond Hockey Championships have been played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the Canadian National Pond Hockey Championships have been played in Huntsville, Ontario.|$|E

50|$|Sailing stones, {{also known}} as sliding rocks, rolling stones, and moving rocks, are a {{geological}} phenomenon where rocks move and inscribe long tracks along a smooth valley floor without human or animal intervention. Instead, rocks move when large ice sheets a few millimeters thick floating in an ephemeral <b>winter</b> <b>pond</b> start to break up during sunny days. These thin floating ice panels, frozen during cold winter nights, are driven by wind and shove rocks at up to 5 m/min.|$|E

Koi are cold-water fish, but benefit from being {{kept in the}} 15 - 25 C range, and do not react well to long, cold, winter temperatures; their immune systems are very weak below 10°C. Koi ponds usually have a metre or more of depth {{in areas of the}} world that become warm during the summer, whereas in areas that have harsher <b>winters,</b> <b>ponds</b> {{generally}} have a minimum of 1.5 m.

50|$|News {{articles}} {{reported the}} mystery solved when researchers observed rock movements using GPS and time-lapse photography. The research team witnessed and documented rock movement on December 20, 2013, that involved more than 60 rocks, with some rocks {{moving up to}} 224 m between December 2013 and January 2014 in multiple movement events. These observations contradicted earlier hypotheses of winds or thick ice floating rocks off the surface. Instead, rocks move when large ice sheets a few millimeters thick floating in an ephemeral <b>winter</b> <b>pond</b> start to break up during sunny days. These thin floating ice panels, frozen during cold winter nights, are driven by light winds and shove rocks at up to 5 m/min (0.3 km/h).

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Presentation date: 1991 - 08 - 28 Dimensional {{characteristics}} of 44 beaver dams and ponds on Kuiu Island in Southeast Alaska {{were determined to}} evaluate the hydrologic effects of these structures on peak flows. The study area consisted of low gradient, incised streams in broad U-shaped valleys. Pond routing simulations were conducted using four return intervals (2 -, 10 -, 25 -, and 50 -year) and seven watershed sizes through medium- (752 m² of surface area) and large-sized (6002 m²) beaver ponds. The annual precipitation during field data collection was below normal resulting in a need to estimate <b>winter</b> <b>pond</b> conditions from summertime measurements. The average dam length and height was 32 m and 0. 7 in, respectively. The average <b>winter</b> <b>pond</b> surface area and volume was 2, 140 m² and 1, 250 m³, respectively. Pond volume was significantly related (p = 0. 05) to surface area (r² = 0. 91). Dam and pond dimensions were influenced by local stream and landscape characteristics. Simulated peak flow routing through a beaver pond was accomplished using the Modified Puls method to calculate the theoretical percentage reduction in storm peak flows due to beaver damns and ponds. A triangular inflow hydrograph with the time to peak at 1 / 2 the total hydrograph duration was used. Thirty inflow hydrographs of various durations and peak discharges were routed through each pond to determine their effect on peak flows. Beaver damn surface profiles are very flat. This resulted in large outflow rates over a dam with little increase in pond head. Single, full beaver ponds were found to theoretical reduce peak flows by no more the 5. 3...|$|E
40|$|Pollution {{history of}} Pb and other trace metals was reconstructed {{for the first}} time for the Eastern Mediterranean, from a small urban <b>winter</b> <b>pond</b> (Dora, Netanya), located at the densely {{populated}} coastal plain of Israel. An integrated approach including geochemical, sedimentological, and historical analyses was employed to study sediments {{from the center of the}} pond. Profiles of metal concentrations (Pb, Zn, V, Ni, Cu, Cr, Co, Cd, and Hg) and Pb isotopic composition denote two main eras of pre- and post- 19 th century. The deeper sediment is characterized by low concentrations and relatively constant 206 Pb/ 207 Pb (around 1. 20), similar to natural Pb sources, with slight indications of ancient anthropogenic activity. The upper sediment displays an upward increase in trace metal concentrations, with the highest enrichment factor for Pb (18. 4). Lead fluxes and isotopic composition point to national/regional petrol-Pb emissions as the major contributor to Pb contamination, overwhelming other potential local and transboundary sources. Traffic-related metals are correlated with Pb, emphasizing the polluting inputs of traffic. The Hg profile, however, implies global pollution rather than local sources...|$|E

Study was conducted at the farm "Corop", located in Rawa-Ruska, Lviv region. The objects of research were fingerlings of Galician carp, growing under semi-intensive conditions. The main fish-breeding and biological indexes were examined during the autumn catches and after spring inventory using conventional fish farming methods. Determination of the biochemical composition of skeletal muscles was conducted under zootechnical analysis. Findings. The weight of fingerlings of Galician carp during the <b>wintering</b> in <b>ponds</b> of fish-farm "Carp" was an average 104 ± 7, 5 g, nutritional ratio was at 3. 1 ± 0, 3 while after the following winter it was 2. 6 ± 0, 3. The biochemical composition of muscles in Galician carp was within legal parameters, confirming satisfactory physiological state of fish before winter maintenance. Environmental conditions of winter incubation of fish corresponded to fish breeding requirements. Thermal regime of <b>pond</b> during the <b>winter</b> of Galician carp age 0 + was in the range 1 °C– 6 °C. The quantity of dissolved oxygen also does not exceed the critical limits.

40|$|Temporary waters {{have been}} {{sporadically}} investigated in Sicily. These environments reflect the climatic {{features of the}} Mediterranean area with a <b>winter</b> <b>ponding</b> phase and {{a more or less}} prolonged dry period in summer. Their biota, especially those organisms strictly linked to aquatic environments and without any terrestrial life stage, have to exhibit special adaptations to survive the dry phases that are recurrent in such ecosystems. This study included more than 250 water bodies distributed on the whole Sicilian territory and on the small circum-Sicilian islands. This paper represents a first attempt to characterize Sicilian temporary waters from an ecological point of view and is mainly based on some of their limnological features and on the crustacean components of their communities. In particular, the groups which have been taken into consideration are those of cladocerans, calanoid copepods, and large branchiopods (notostracans, anostracans, and spinicaudatans) ...|$|R
