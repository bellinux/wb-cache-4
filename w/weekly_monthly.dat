5|$|The temple priests {{perform the}} pooja (rituals) during festivals {{and on a}} daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are {{performed}} six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Pundarikakshan and Pankajavalli. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves {{in front of the}} temple mast. There are <b>weekly,</b> <b>monthly</b> and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.|$|E

25|$|This system {{provides}} an on-bus smart card and cash-based revenue management system {{which will help}} to record data such as passenger behaviour, popular routes and type of tickets purchased.

The Smart Card can be re-charged with a <b>weekly,</b> <b>monthly</b> or season ticket. Another benefit of the smart card is that a passenger can use it (once it is re-charged), multiple times. The card fits into a pocket or purse, is very secure and cannot be read or copied.|$|E

2500|$|Following on {{from the}} {{implementation}} of the London congestion charge in February 2003, City of Edinburgh Council announced plans to introduce a road tolls scheme to be put in place on main routes into the city. [...] A postal referendum of Edinburgh residents was held between 7–21 February 2005, with 74.4% of those voting no, announced on 22 February 2005. The system would have operated in a broadly similar fashion to the one in London, with two cordons - an inner cordon and an outer cordon operating from Monday to Friday. A flat charge of £2 would have applied to vehicles entering the city boundary - by passing the outer cordon, or those entering the city centre by passing the inner cordon. This charge would have applied {{no matter how many times}} a vehicle crossed both cordons. Cameras with automatic number plate recognition technology would have been placed at the entry to both cordons, which would record the registration numbers of vehicles passing them. At the end of each day numbers would have been recorded against received payments. Paying would have been done electronically via the internet, text message or at specialised payment terminals in shops, where daily, <b>weekly,</b> <b>monthly</b> and yearly passes would have been available.|$|E

6000|$|After I {{had been}} there about ten or twelve days, it came into my {{thoughts}} that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and ink, and should even forget the sabbath days from the working days: but, to prevent this, I cut it with my knife upon a large post, in capital letters; and making it into a great cross, I set {{it up on the}} shore where I first landed, viz. [...] "I came on shore here on the 30th of September, 1659."

6000|$|It must be conceded {{to begin}} with that the {{argument}} in favour {{of the existence of}} other people's minds cannot be conclusive. A phantasm of our dreams will appear to have a mind--a mind to be annoying, as a rule. It will give unexpected answers, refuse to conform to our desires, and show all those other signs of intelligence to which we are accustomed in the acquaintances of our waking hours. And yet, when we are awake, {{we do not believe that}} the phantasm was, like the appearances of people in waking life, representative of a private world to which we have no direct access. If we are to believe this of the people we meet when we are awake, it must be on some ground short of demonstration, since it is obviously possible that what we call waking life may be only an unusually persistent and recurrent nightmare. It may be that our imagination brings forth all that other people seem to say to us, all that we read in books, all the daily, <b>weekly,</b> <b>monthly,</b> and quarterly journals that distract our thoughts, all the advertisements of soap and all the speeches of politicians. This may be true, since it cannot be shown to be false, yet no one can really believe it. Is there any logical ground for regarding this possibility as improbable? Or is there nothing beyond habit and prejudice? ...|$|E
60|$|Thus {{entered into}} as strange {{a scene of}} life as ever any man was in, I had most melancholy apprehensions {{concerning}} my deplorable condition: and many times the tears would plentifully run down my face, when I considered how I was debarred from all communications with human kind. Yet while these disponding cogitations would seem to make me accuse Providence, other good thoughts would interpose and reprove me after this manner: Well, supposing you are desolate, it is not better to be so than totally perish? Why, were you singled out to be saved and the rest destroyed? Why should you complain, when not only your life is preserved, but the ship driven into your reach, {{in order to take}} what was necessary out of her for your subsistence? But to proceed, it was, by the account I kept, the 30th of September, when I first landed on this island. About twelve days after, fearing lest I should lose my reckoning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath days, for want of pen, ink, and paper, I carved with a knife upon a large post, in great letters; and set it up: in the similitude of a cross, on the seashore where I landed, I CAME ON SHORE, Sept. 30 1659. Every day I cut a notch with my knife {{on the sides of the}} square post, and this on the Sabbath was as long again as the rest; and every first day of the month as long again as that long one. In this manner I kept my calendar, <b>weekly,</b> <b>monthly</b> or yearly reckoning of time. But had I made a more strict search (as afterwards I did) I needed not have set up this mark; for among the parcels belonging to the gunner, carpenter, and captain's mate, I found those very things I wanted; particularly pens, ink, and paper. So I found two or three compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials, perspective glasses, books of navigation, three English Bibles, and several other good books, which I carefully put up.--Here I cannot but call to mind our having a dog and two cats on board, whom I made inhabitants with me in my castle. Though one might think I had all the necessities that were desirable, yet still I found several things wanting. My ink was daily wasting; I wanted needles, pins, and thread to mend or keep my clothes together; and particularly a spade, pickax, or shovel, to remove the earth. It was a year before I finished my little bulwark; and having some intervals of relaxation, after my daily wandering abroad for provision, I drew up this plan, alternately, as creditor and debtor, to remind me of the miseries and blessings of my life, under so many various circumstances.|$|E
