5|$|The club's {{return to}} the First Division was not {{immediately}} successful. Under Leslie Knighton, the club never finished better than ninth, and in 1923–24 came close to returning to the Second Division, finishing 19th and only a point clear of the relegation zone. Arsenal did no better the following season, finishing 20th (although paradoxically the club <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> safer this time, being seven points clear of the relegation places), which {{was the last straw}} for Norris; he fired Knighton in May 1925, and appointed the Huddersfield Town manager, Herbert Chapman in his place.|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen, liberated of {{the work}} on the daily comic, started on a comic series based on one of the novels he had read as a youth: Robert en Bertrand, the story of two Flemish tramps at the fin de siècle.

5|$|According to the Shenboo Atlas of 1933, in the 1930s {{most people}} lived within the {{perimeter}} of the Xi'an Wall but still there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of unoccupied open areas. Among the visitors who came to see the Xian Wall were American captain (later general) Stilwell in 1922 and the Czech sinologist Jaroslav Průšek (1906–1980) in 1933. In 1983, the administration of the Xi'an municipality carried out more renovations and additions to the wall. At that time, the Yangmacheng tower, the Zhalou sluice tower, the Kuixinglou dipper tower, the Jiaolou corner tower and the Dilou defense tower were all refurbished; the crumbling parts of the rampart were changed into gates; and the moat was restored. In May 2005, all of Xi'an's ramparts were inter-connected.|$|E

The Norman revenues were only £6,750 in 1180, then they reached £25,000 a year in 1198, higher than in England. What was more impressive was the fact the Norman population was considerably smaller than England's, an estimated 1.5 million as opposed to England's 3.5 million. This period has become known as the 'Norman Fiscal Revolution' due to this increase in revenue.|$|E

25|$|Climate is a {{key factor}} that has been studied in the colony {{productivity}} of P. snelleni. Since there is always one founding queen in a P. snelleni nest, the denominator of colony productivity is always one. Productivity was found to vary drastically {{with a couple of}} very large nests that were found in Kanto, Japan. These nests had hundreds of cells in comparison to the usually 100 cells. In these nests, there was a female-biased sex ratio, which lines up with the resource availability hypothesis. This hypothesis states that colonies with better resources should be more heavily female based. The numbers of first brood workers in these nests were not greater than other nests, but there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more females, so the sex ratio was heavily female.|$|E

In order to prove himself fit for active service with the independent companies Harcourt was required to pass a rigorous physical fitness and endurance program that was said to have tested even the instructors at the school, many of whom <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> younger than Harcourt, who was 47 at the time.

25|$|Jean de Mailly, a French Dominican at Metz, {{places the}} story in the year 1099, in his , which dates from {{approximately}} 1250 and gives what is almost certainly the earliest authentic account of the woman who became known as Pope Joan. His compatriot Stephen of Bourbon acknowledges this by placing her rule at approximately 1100. Also, Rosemary and Darrell Pardoe, authors of The Female Pope: The Mystery of Pope Joan. The First Complete Documentation of the Facts behind the Legend, are assuming that a more plausible time-frame would be 1086–1108, when there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of antipopes, and the reign of the legitimate popes Victor III, Urban II, and Paschal II was not always established in Rome, since this city was occupied by Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and later sacked by the Normans.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it seems}} that the results of the raid <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more {{effective}} than the press had led people to believe. All of the bombs were dropped into the correct target box, except for one string of bombs which had missed the area completely because of a radar failure. After about a week, US Army teams began to enter the area and reported almost total destruction of all life in the area. Additional missions were cancelled and did not resume until July. There was initially some skepticism about the usefulness of a high-altitude radar bomb drop against guerrilla forces. Nevertheless, within a few months there was universal acceptance {{of the power of the}} B-52 raids as a new type of artillery. By November 1965, the B-52s were able to support the 1st Air Cavalry Division in mopping up operations near Pleiku.|$|E

Thirdly, left-arm spinner Maninder Singh was the best bowler for India with 14 wickets and was the best spinner of the tournament, coming at 4th place among the tournament's highest wicket takers, with only fast bowlers Craig McDermott, Imran Khan and Patrick Patterson above him. Finally, wicketkeeper Kiran More, with 11 dismissals, effected the most number of dismissals in the tournament, while Kapil, with 6 catches, took the most number of catches.|$|E
