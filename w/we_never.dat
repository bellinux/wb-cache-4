5|$|Because {{of their}} human qualities, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> entirely lose sympathy with Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, and our {{imagination}} participates with theirs in the tragedy. Their imagination makes the two more human and yet also destroys them. As Kinnaird points out (elaborating on {{an idea of}} Joseph W. Donohue, Jr.), Hazlitt in part sees Macbeth as a tragedy of imagination itself.|$|E
5|$|I {{had a lot}} of {{theories}} I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the unconscious mind of Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. <b>we</b> <b>never</b> showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of the unconscious. That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.|$|E
5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but <b>we</b> <b>never</b> meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

25|$|Mind against context. The mind is both {{a machine}} and an anti-machine; it is both formulaic and totalizing. Thus <b>we</b> <b>never</b> rest in any context, {{and we need to}} have {{arrangements}} that constantly lend themselves to reinvention.|$|E

In early 1983, Marcos was seriously ailing, the Philippine economy was just as rapidly declining, and insurgency was becoming a serious problem.

25|$|<b>We</b> <b>never</b> {{found any}} {{proof of the}} part played by the Olterra in this affair. From British Naval Headquarters on Gibraltar we could see, with the naked eye, the Olterra’s {{superstructure}} above the exterior mole at Algeciras.

25|$|According to Henry, {{life can}} never {{be seen from the}} exterior, as it never appears in the exteriority of the world. Life feels itself and {{experiences}} itself in its invisible interiority and in its radical immanence. In the world <b>we</b> <b>never</b> see life itself, but only living beings or living organisms; we cannot see life in them. In the same way, it is impossible to see another person's soul with the eyes or to perceive it {{at the end of a}} scalpel.|$|E
25|$|Is {{he going}} to throw it away? Is {{he going to}} beat him with it? Or even kill him with it? Beckett’s plays often have a certain open-endedness and this sketch is no different. Perhaps because it has taken so little time to build up to this climax it lacks the {{resonance}} of Endgame’s concluding scene where <b>we</b> <b>never</b> know if Clov ever leaves Hamm or the close of Happy Days where the audience is left wondering if Willie is reaching for the gun or for Winnie.|$|E
25|$|We {{started off}} with no idea at all. We pretty much threw all the stuff in the pot and went on playing. It {{was a case of}} demand driving it. It took off like a rocket. We got more work than we could travel away, but the thing took {{on a life of its}} own. The thing with the Falcons, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way through. There was no plan. – John Power.|$|E

25|$|Congratulations to Australia, {{they were}} the better team...I felt that with Laker not fit we had to gamble on the first morning. I thought {{this was the best}} way to win the match, but it did not come off. Richie Benaud has a fine team; he {{inspired}} them in the field and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best I have seen. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> got the starts we would have liked and injuries on the tour generally affected the batting, but I have no excuses to offer.|$|E
25|$|Wales is a conquered country, it {{is proper}} to {{introduce}} the English language, {{and it is the}} duty of bishops to endeavour to promote the English, in order {{to introduce the}} language... It has always been the policy of the legislature to introduce the English language in Wales. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> heard of an act of parliament in Welsh... The English language is, by act of parliament, to be used in all the courts of judicature in Wales; and an English Bible is to be kept in all the churches in Wales, that by comparison with the Welsh, they may the sooner attain the knowledge of the English.|$|E
25|$|This {{arises in}} the {{following}} way. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> need four colors in a neighborhood unless there be four counties, {{each of which has}} boundary lines in common with each of the other three. Such a thing cannot happen with four areas unless one or more of them be inclosed by the rest; and the color used for the inclosed county is thus set free to go on with. Now this principle, that four areas cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without inclosure, is not, we fully believe, capable of demonstration upon anything more evident and more elementary; it must stand as a postulate.|$|E
