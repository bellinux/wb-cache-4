5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain <b>why</b> <b>men</b> torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the fishing season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 {{study found}} that gay and {{bisexual}} men choose to have unprotected sex {{for a variety of}} reasons and cannot be generalized.

They believed that the breeze and the sea were married; and that the land breeze brought forth a reed, which was planted by the god Captan. When the reed grew, it broke into two sections, from which came a man and a woman. To the man they gave the name Silalac, and that is the reason <b>why</b> <b>men</b> from that time on have been called lalac; the woman they named Sicavay, and henceforth women have been called babaye...|$|E

25|$|Perceptions of wage {{entitlement}} differ {{between women}} and men such that men are more likely to feel worthy of higher pay while women's sense of wage entitlement is depressed. Women's beliefs about their relatively lower worth and their depressed wage entitlement reflects their lower social status such that when women's status is raised, their wage entitlement raises as well. However, gender-related status manipulation has no impact on men's elevated wage entitlement. Even when men's status is lowered on a specific task (e.g., by telling them that women typically outperform men on this task), men do not reduce their self-pay and respond with elevated projections of their own competence. The usual pattern whereby men assign themselves more pay than women for comparable work might explain <b>why</b> <b>men</b> tend to initiate negotiations more than women.|$|E
25|$|It {{was enacted}} at the {{parliament}} assembled in Forfar in 1057 by King Malcolm Canmore that every baron should erect a gibbet for {{the execution of}} male criminals, and sink a well or pit, for the drowning of females. The term pit and gallows described the jurisdiction of a Baron in criminal cases; in full 'pit and gallows, sake and soke, toll, team, and infangthief'. A pit, according to Mackenzie {{was a form of}} dungeon or prison cell, not a pit for drowning the condemned. Others take the view that the pit was the drowning pool for women and the gallows for the men. It is not clear <b>why</b> <b>men</b> {{were more likely to be}} hanged and women drowned in a fen, river, pit or 'murder hole', however it may relate to ideas of decency. The place name 'Muttonhole' is not infrequently found and one suggestion is that it is derived from 'Mort-toun-hole', another of the names for a hollow where women were drowned.|$|E
25|$|Salary {{disparities between}} men and women may {{partially}} be explained by differences in negotiation tactics used by men and women. Although men and women are equally likely to initiate in a salary negotiation with employers, men will achieve higher outcomes than women by about 2% of starting salary Studies have indicated that men tend to use active negotiation tactics of directly asking for a higher salary, while women tend to use more of an indirect approach by emphasizing self-promotion tactics (e.g. explaining the motivation to be a good employee). Other research indicates that early-childhood play patterns may influence the way men and women negotiate. Men and women tend to view salary differently in terms of relative importance. Overall level of confidence in a negotiation may also be a determinant of <b>why</b> <b>men</b> tend to achieve higher outcomes in salary negotiations. Finally, the awareness of this stereotype alone may directly cause women to achieve lower outcomes as one study indicates. Regardless of the cause, the outcome yields a disparity {{between men and}} women that contributes to the overall wage gap observed in many nations.|$|E

500|$|During the {{intermission}} {{and after}} the showing, books relevant {{to the subject of}} the film were sold. Mom and Dads distributor Modern Film Distributors sold over 45,000 copies of Man and Boy and Woman and Girl, written by Babb's wife, netting an estimated $31,000. According to Babb, these cost about eight cents to produce, and were sold for $1 apiece. While Modern Film was able to sell 45,000 on its own, Babb estimates sales of 40 million, citing [...] "IRS figures."

500|$|The show's {{popularity}} {{resulted in}} enquiries for coats similar to Sherlock's, reported retailer Debenhams.

500|$|It {{was felt}} at the time that, {{precisely}} because most soldiers in combat were afraid, an example needed {{to be made of}} men who deserted. Front line soldiers also sometimes felt that those who left their mates [...] "in the lurch" [...] by deserting [...] "deserved to be shot". One historian writes that there is [...] "virtually no evidence" [...] that soldiers thought the death penalty unjust, although another writes that some soldiers deplored the death penalty, while most thought it justified. Desertion normally meant an absence of 21 days or other evidence to indicate intent of not returning, e.g. wearing civilian clothes or failing to report for a key deployment. Those executed were normally not boys– the average age was in the mid-twenties and 40 percent had been in serious trouble before. Thirty percent were regulars or reservists, 40 percent were Kitchener volunteers, 19 percent were Irish, Canadian or New Zealand volunteers, but only nine percent were conscripts, suggesting indulgence to the conscripts, many of them under 21, who made up the bulk of the army by late in the war. Only executed men's records survive, so it is hard to comment on the reasons <b>why</b> <b>men</b> were reprieved, but {{it has been suggested that}} the policy of commuting 90 percent of death sentences may well have been deliberate mercy in the application of military law designed for a small regular army recruited from the rougher elements of society. Only 7,361 of the 38,630 desertions were in the field. Most were away from the front line — 14 of the executed deserters were arrested in the United Kingdom — and many deserters had never served in the front line at all.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} of <b>why</b> <b>men</b> hunt, rather than {{spend all day}} extracting palm resources, cannot be explained by energy maximization, since men obtain about 750 calories per hour hunting, and around 1,000 calories per hour extracting palm starch and hearts. [...] Hill {{has suggested that the}} macronutrient content of meat, relative to plants, means that meat is worth more nutritionally than equivalent caloric amounts of palm starch. Hawkes on the other hand, has suggested that Aché men hunt because hunting is a form of costly signaling, rather than exclusively a manner to provision hungry family members.|$|E
2500|$|One of Thornhill and Palmer's {{rejected}} hypotheses for <b>why</b> <b>men</b> rape implicates violent pornography. Subscribers to {{the social}} science theory of rape purport {{that one of the}} main reasons why the human male learns to rape is via learning imitative behaviour when watching violent pornography. However, this fails to explain why if males are likely to imitate behaviour witnessed in violent pornography they would not also imitate the actions of human males in other videos. Furthermore, no explanation is offered into why this behaviour is inspired in some men and not others. It is also limited in its ability to predict valuable variables surrounding why rape occurs (such as who, when or where). For this reason, Thornhill and Palmer argued that [...] "although the removal of violent pornography may be desirable in its own right, it is very unlikely to solve the problem of rape".|$|E

2500|$|In general, Janus is at {{the origin}} of time as the {{guardian}} of the gates of Heaven: Jupiter himself can move forth and back because of Janus's working.

[...] He presides over the concrete and abstract beginnings of the world, such as religion and the gods themselves, he too holds the access to Heaven and to other gods: this is the reason <b>why</b> <b>men</b> must invoke him first, regardless of the god they want to pray or placate.

2500|$|As commander-in-chief, one of Haig's {{responsibilities}} was to {{give the}} final signature to the death warrants of British and Commonwealth soldiers (but not Australian – these went to the Governor-General of Australia) who had been first sentenced to death by Field General Court Martial. Although the book Shot at Dawn (1983), which began the campaign for pardons, {{says that it is}} [...] "quite incorrect" [...] to hold Haig solely responsible, as he was part of a legal process, by the late 1990s Haig was perhaps best known to the general public because of publicity which implied him to be a brutal disciplinarian – this was not the view of contemporaries. Of the 3,080 men sentenced to death in all theatres, 346 were executed, 266 (77%) were for desertion, 37 for murder (who would probably have been hanged under civilian law at the time) and 18 for cowardice. Just over 250 of the executions took place during Haig's time as Commander-in-Chief, but only executed men's records survive, so it is hard to comment on the reasons <b>why</b> <b>men</b> were reprieved.|$|E
2500|$|These {{inconsistent}} {{results have}} led researchers to propose novel theories {{that attempt to}} explain the sex differences observed in certain studies.One theory that has been hypothesized to explain <b>why</b> <b>men</b> and women both report more distress to emotional infidelity than sexual infidelity is borrowed from childhood attachment theories. [...] Studies have found that attachment styles of adults are consistent with their self reported relationship histories. For example, more men are reported to have an insecure, dismissing avoidant attachment style; where these [...] "individuals often attempt to minimize or constrict emotional experience, deny needs for intimacy, are highly invested in autonomy, and are more sexually promiscuous than individuals who have other attachment styles". [...] Levy and Kelly (2010) tested this theory and found that adult attachment styles strongly correlate to which type of infidelity elicited more jealousy. [...] Individuals who have secure attachment styles often report that emotional infidelity is more upsetting whereas dismissing attachment styles {{were more likely to}} find sexual infidelity more upsetting. It is important to note however that their study did report that men in general were more likely than women to report sexual infidelity as more distressing, however this could be related to more men having a dismissing attachment style.The authors propose that a social mechanism may be responsible for the observed results. In other words, replicable sex differences in emotion and sexual jealousy could be a function of a social function. Similar studies focusing on the masculinization and feminization by society also argue for a social explanation, while discounting an evolutionary explanation.|$|E
