5|$|Although Godwin {{was fond}} of his children, he <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> ways, ill-equipped to care for them. As Todd explains, he was {{constantly}} annoyed by their noise, demanding silence while he worked. However, {{when he took a}} trip to Dublin to visit Wollstonecraft's sisters, he missed the girls immensely and wrote to them frequently.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> {{ways the}} most {{interesting}} personality in Nixon's political camp: aggressive, egocentric, a professional among amateurs, brilliant, overbearing, ruthless, engaging, habitually guilty of overkill, constantly enlarging his area of operation. Painted in sinister colors by the press, he was both a public relations problem for Nixon and an invaluable campaign strategist.|$|E
5|$|Ronsard <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> ways proved correct. The {{death of}} Catherine's beloved son Henry III in 1589, {{a few months}} after her own, brought the Valois dynasty to an end. Precious little of Catherine's grand {{building}} work has survived.|$|E

5|$|EdwardIII was a temperamental man but {{capable of}} unusual clemency. He <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> ways a {{conventional}} king whose main interest was warfare. Admired {{in his own}} time and for centuries after, Edward was denounced as an irresponsible adventurer by later Whig historians such as William Stubbs. This view has been challenged recently and modern historians credit him with some significant achievements.|$|E
5|$|Mycale <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> ways, the {{beginning}} of a new phase in the conflict, in which the Greeks would go on the offensive against the Persians. The immediate result of the victory at Mycale was a second revolt amongst the Greek cities of Asia Minor. The Samians and Milesians had actively fought against the Persians at Mycale, thus openly declaring their rebellion, and the other cities followed in their example.|$|E
5|$|The Waleses made Sandringham House their {{preferred}} residence, with Marlborough House their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward {{did not give}} his wife {{as much attention as}} she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation. This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift. Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever. Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress Lillie Langtry; Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; humanitarian Agnes Keyser; and society matron Alice Keppel. Alexandra knew about most of these relationships, and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit the king as he lay dying. Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.|$|E

25|$|The Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle also {{believed}} that female pleasure {{played a central role}} in conception. Female reproduction <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> ways, viewed through the lens of male reproductive processes, imagining that female organs functioned as inverted versions of male organs, and hence orgasm was required for conception.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{hired to}} teach design classes (in the College of Agriculture), it was Arneson who {{established}} the ceramic sculpture {{program for the}} Art Department.

25|$|Differences {{were noted}} between the {{characters}} {{on the radio}} and TV versions of Gunsmoke. In the radio series, Doc was acerbic, somewhat mercenary, and borderline alcoholic—at least in the program's early years. On radio's Gunsmoke, Doc Adams's real name was Dr. Calvin Moore. He came west and changed his name to escape a charge of murder. The television Doc, though still crusty, <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> ways softer and warmer.|$|E
25|$|At {{one point}} Samuel {{requested}} a legal separation, but Julia refused. Many of their arguments centered on Julia’s {{desire to have}} a career apart from motherhood. While Dr. Howe <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> ways progressive {{by the standards of}} the day, he did not support the idea of married women having any work other than that of wife and mother. He believed that Julia's proper place was in the home.|$|E
25|$|The Communist {{began on}} 5 August 1920, {{just four days}} after the {{completion}} of the conference (the Congress of London) which founded the CPGB. The publication continued without interruption until its 131st issue, dated 3 February 1923.

25|$|The {{establishment}} of America's transcontinental rail lines securely linked California {{to the rest}} of the country, and the far-reaching transportation systems that grew out of them during the century that followed contributed to the state’s social, political, and economic development. When California was admitted as a state to the United States in 1850, and for nearly two decades thereafter, it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> ways isolated, an outpost on the Pacific, until the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869.|$|E
25|$|The Hambledon Club <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> respects a Hampshire county {{club for}} it {{organised}} Hampshire matches, {{although it was}} a multi-functional club and not dedicated to cricket alone. Its membership attracted large numbers of sporting gentry and it dominated the sport, {{both on and off the}} field, for about thirty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1787. Hambledon produced Hampshire players including batsman John Small and the two fast bowlers Thomas Brett and David Harris.|$|E
25|$|When he met Capote in 1948, Dunphy {{had written}} a well-received novel, John Fury, and was just getting over a painful divorce from McCracken. In 1950 the two writers settled in Taormina, Sicily, in a house where the author D. H. Lawrence had once lived. Ten years older than Capote, Dunphy <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> ways Capote’s opposite, as solitary as Capote was exuberantly social. Though they drifted more and more apart in the later years, the couple stayed {{together}} until Capote's death.|$|E
