5|$|On May 7, 1950, Monson {{became an}} LDS bishop at age 22, serving {{for five years}} in two wards. He had {{previously}} served as <b>ward</b> <b>clerk,</b> ward Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association superintendent. At the time, Monson's Salt Lake City ward contained over 1,000 people, including 85 widows whom he visited regularly, and he continued visiting to these widows after completing his service as bishop. He brought them gifts during the Christmas season, including poultry he had raised himself. Monson eventually spoke at the funerals {{of each of these}} women. Also during his time as bishop, 23 men from his ward served in the Korean War. He wrote weekly personal letters to each serviceman. At least one of these men became fully involved with the church as a result of Monson's communication. During his service as bishop of the 6th-7th Ward, sacrament meeting attendance in the ward quadrupled.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} of Holby City {{featured}} an ensemble {{cast of characters}} in the medical profession, {{who worked on the}} hospital's Darwin Ward.

5|$|The series {{focuses on}} the hospital's cardithoracic ward, Darwin. Department heads and {{consultant}} surgeons Anton Meyer (George Irving) and Muriel McKendrick (Phyllis Logan) clash frequently over patient care and division of beds. Tension arises between nurses Julie Fitzjohn (Nicola Stephenson) and Jasmine Hopkins (Angela Griffin) over the position of Darwin ward sister. Registrar Nick Jordan (Michael French) clashes professionally with his estranged wife Karen Newburn (Sarah Preston), and pursues relationships with registrar Kirstie Collins (Dawn McDaniel) and theatre sister Ellie Sharpe (Julie Saunders). <b>Ward</b> <b>clerk</b> Paul Ripley (Luke Mably) resigns after being caught kissing a comatose patient, and house officer Victoria Merrick (Lisa Faulkner) begins taking amphetamines {{to cope with the}} pressures of work. In the series finale, Jasmine is stabbed by thieves, and Nick endeavours to save her life in theatre.|$|E
25|$|Most {{disciplinary}} councils are convened by {{a bishop}} of a ward. In such an instance, {{the council is}} composed of the bishop and his two counselors. The <b>ward</b> <b>clerk</b> will also be present to take notes of the proceedings. After hearing {{all of the evidence}} in the case, the bishop and his counselors are encouraged to make a joint unanimous decision on the outcome. However, the bishop has the final say and can theoretically make a decision over the protest of either or both of his counselors.|$|E
50|$|In {{recent times}} the <b>ward</b> <b>clerk</b> is a {{permanent}} position held by {{an official at the}} Corporation, and based at the Guildhall, though wards can appoint (usually at the wardmote) an honorary <b>ward</b> <b>clerk</b> in addition.

25|$|Supporters of {{traditional}} work hours contend that much may be {{learned in the}} hospital during the extended time. Some argue that it remains unclear whether patient safety is enhanced or harmed by a reduction in work hours which necessarily lead to more transitions in care. Some of the clinical work traditionally performed by residents has been shifted to other healthcare workers such as <b>ward</b> <b>clerks,</b> nurses, laboratory personnel, and phlebotomists. It has also resulted in a shift of some resident work towards home work, where residents will complete paperwork and other duties at home as to not have to log the hours.|$|R
50|$|Rice married Margaret Bremond, {{daughter}} of Paul Bremond (Houston and Texas Central Railway) and Harriet Martha Sprouls, in 1850 in Houston, Texas. The 1860 census places William and Margaret Rice in Houston's 2nd <b>Ward.</b> <b>Clerks</b> are also {{identified in the}} same census report; thus the location is most likely Rice's merchant business. Margaret was 16 years Rice's junior. She died, at age 31, in 1863 in Houston, Texas. Rice is also reported to have lived in Matamoros, Mexico in 1863. Whether {{there is a connection}} to the timing of Margaret's death to his living in Matamoros is not clear. By 1865, he was reported as living back in Houston.|$|R

40|$|Communication {{difficulties}} between hospital {{doctors and}} nurses are well docu-mented. A survey undertaken jointly by medical and nursing administration at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth, Western Australia, verified difficulties in doctor-nurse communication as perceived by {{doctors and nurses}}, {{as well as by}} <b>ward</b> <b>clerks</b> as impartial observers. Questionnaire responses revealed some impediments in the flow of communication. Both nurses and doctors perceived less frequency of difficulties in communicating with members of their own professional group than with members of the other group. Nurses with university preparation and other special clinical qualifi-cations perceived significantly fewer communication problems with doctors than nurses with less education. Interns perceived greater frequency in difficulty communi-cating with nurses than did more highly qualified doctors, and female doctors who were not interns claimed fewer problems than their male counterparts. Moreover, more highly qualified male doctors who had a previous occupation acknowledged fewer doctor-nurse communication problems...|$|R
40|$|The Intensive Care Unit is {{the area}} in patient care where the amount of patient data {{from a variety of}} sources is {{particularly}} large. The problem for clinicians lies in the ability to gather, and use these data in the decision making process. A well designed computer based patient data management system, incorporating a variety of data analysis tools, would have a dramatic impact in patient care in an environment such as this. The PDB System has been in continuous use at the Montreal General Hospital's Surgical and Trauma Intensive Care Unit since Jan. 88. Its initial implementation in two beds in our SICU has allowed the complete replacement of the conventional patient paper record. It is used by all ICU staff, including nurses, physicians, and <b>ward</b> <b>clerks</b> for the recording/viewing of all patient vital data, laboratory data, medications, and optionally chart notes. In addition, medical staff has the option to use the entered data to perform a variety of data analysis procedures...|$|R

50|$|Students {{study the}} {{biomedical}} and clinical sciences such as anatomy, physiology and pathology {{in the first}} year followed by the clinical subjects (medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology) in the second year. The third and fourth year involves supervised clinical practice and internship in teaching hospitals where they rotate in all the departments, receive beside lectures, attend consultants' <b>ward</b> rounds, <b>clerk</b> patients and present medical histories, perform deliveries and first-assist in major surgery. They also attend clinical meetings and write prescriptions which at this stage must be counter-signed by a supervising clinician.|$|R
40|$|Immunisation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} health interventions in existence yet outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases continue to occur in developed countries. High rates of cover are needed to provide adequate herd immunity and there is evidence that a significant proportion of paediatric inpatients are not up to date even in areas with high levels of community cover. A proportion of these children will have parents who consciously declined immunisation, however the remaining children represent a vulnerable cohort whose under-immunisation is not routinely identified. Two-hundred consecutive admissions to rural paediatric assessment unit had their routinely documented vaccination histories checked against their records on the regional Child Health Information System (CHIS). 30 children (15 %) were not up to date on the CHIS, yet routine clerking only identified 5 of these children (17 %). After introduction of a simple system whereby <b>ward</b> <b>clerks</b> and doctors were taught how to access and print full immunisation histories from the CHIS, a further 200 consecutive admissions were audited. A similar number were not up to date (29 / 200) but the proportion of children with missing immunisations correctly identified in the clerking documentation increased to 52 % (15 children). This is a 35 % improvement (95 % CI; 12 - 58 %). Access to routinely collected data can significantly improve identification of under-immunised children and contribute towards higher levels of individual and herd-immunity. Proble...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Nurses' {{communication}} skills {{have a significant}} impact on their professional effectiveness. This study examines the communication strategies used by nurses on the ward in one aspect of the job, namely the ways that they describe health procedures to patients. Design and setting: The data used in this project was collected by nurses on a busy hospital ward as part of Victoria University's Language in the Workplace Project. Three nurses carried minidisc recorders as they went about their normal working day, recording their conversations with patients, visitors, and other staff. Relevant sections of this talk (totalling 300 minutes) were transcribed and analysed using a discourse analysis approach, thus providing a sound basis for analysing the communicative act of describing a health procedure and for identifying a range of relevant sociolinguistic components of the interaction. Subjects: The data was collected in a women's hospital ward. All patients, nurses, cleaners and <b>ward</b> <b>clerks</b> were female; two doctors were female and two were male. Results: Twenty three instances where nurses described procedures to patients were identified in the data set. The analysis identified several typical components; indicated there was no fixed order of components; and demonstrated that all except the core component of describing the procedure were optional rather than obligatory elements. Conclusions: This is qualitative and exploratory research. Our findings demonstrate the benefit of discourse analysis within a sociolinguistic framework for the analysis of nurse-patient interaction. The results indicate that health discourse is not one-sided, nor is it as straightforward as many nursing textbooks suggest. 13 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the <b>wards</b> his <b>clerks</b> read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and â€“ how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|R
