5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater {{came into contact}} with the land surface and created a massive <b>wetland</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E
5|$|Water is the {{dominant}} element in the Everglades, and it shapes the land, vegetation, and animal life of South Florida. The South Florida climate was once arid and semi-arid, interspersed with wet periods. Between 10,000 and 20,000years ago, sea levels rose, submerging portions of the Florida peninsula and causing the water table to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone, eroding some of it and creating springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and through evaporation formed thunderstorms. Limestone was dissolved by the slightly acidic rainwater. The limestone wore away, and groundwater {{came into contact with}} the surface, creating a massive <b>wetland</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> Although the region appears flat, the wearing away of the limestone in some areas created slight valleys and plateaus—a difference of inches in elevation—that affected not only the flow of water, but also types of vegetation present.|$|E

40|$|<b>Wetland</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are an {{important}} component in global carbon (C) cycles and may exert a large influence on global clinlate change. Predictions of C dynamics require us to consider interactions among many critical factors of soil, hydrology, and vegetation. However, few such integrated C models exist for <b>wetland</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> In this paper, we report a simulation model, Wetland-DNDC, for C dynamics and methane (CH 4) emissions in <b>wetland</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> The general structure of Wetland-DNDC was adopted from PnET-N-DNDC, a process-oriented biogeochemical model that simulates C and N dynamics in upland forest ecosystems. Several new hnctions and algorithms were developed for Wetland-DNDC to capture the unique features of <b>wetland</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> such as water table dynamics, growth of mosses and herbaceous plants, and soil biogeochemical processes under anaerobic conditions. The model has been validated against various observations from three wetland sites in Northern America.

25|$|The <b>wetland</b> <b>ecosystem</b> and {{wildlife}} habitat on several kilometres of less polluted Najafgarh drain in rural Delhi {{before entering the}} main city, including the former Najafgarh lake or Najafgarh jheel area, is very important habitat to migratory waterbirds {{as well as local}} wildlife. It has been earmarked to be declared a bird sanctuary for Delhi. The area came to be recognised as an important wildlife habitat after a local naturalist studying the area during 1986 to 1989 called attention to it, recommending it to be conserved as a bird sanctuary. After this, the Delhi wildlife department posted 16 guards in the area to control illegal bird hunters, including diplomats from various international embassies located in Delhi, India's capital. Delhi Administration officials were tasked with declaring about 25km stretch of the drain in rural Delhi, including where it passes through the core area of the now drained Najafgarh Lake or jheel, protected under the Wildlife Act after Lt. Governor of Delhi Mr. H.L. Kapur was invited to the area for touring the site where he also heard accounts of local villagers about the rampant illegal hunting of waterbirds that went on here every year. The existing staff of the Flood Control and Irrigation Department, numbering about 40, were also given the additional responsibility of protecting the wildlife on and around the drain.|$|E

40|$|Effective {{programmes}} for integrated {{river basin}} management {{are critical for}} the protection and wise use of rivers and other <b>wetland</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Conversely, considering <b>wetland</b> <b>ecosystems</b> as essential aspects of “water infrastructure” can help to support integrative water resources management programmes, especially in relation to water supply and development objectives. In recognition of the critical role of <b>wetland</b> <b>ecosystems</b> {{in the delivery of}} water and water-related ecosystem services, and the importance of water for maintaining the ecological character of wetlands, Contracting Parties of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands have adopted several significant water-related Resolutions and a range of scientific and technical guidance. The Convention’s water-related guidance is intended to assist policy makers and wetland managers towards developing and implementing practical strategies and solutions to problems and challenges associated with integration of wetlands and water management. on the guidance further promotes best practices in {{the development and implementation of}} cross-sectoral policies and programmes where these depend on or affect wetlands, for example in relation to climate change, food and water security, and poverty reduction. The very real institutional, technical, biophysical and economic challenges related to integrated river basin management must be recognized. However, progress in integrating the needs of <b>wetland</b> <b>ecosystems</b> into land and water resources planning and management at river basin level remains slow: successes tend to be hard-won over very long periods, frequently confined to smaller river basins, and seeming often to need the incentive of threatened or actual collapse of <b>wetland</b> <b>ecosystems</b> in order to stimulate collaborative planning and implementation in response. Case studies suggest that while the range of potential obstacles and challenges to integrating wetlands into river basin management might be limited to a set of fairly common generic themes, locally-developed solutions to overcoming them are varied and creative...|$|R
