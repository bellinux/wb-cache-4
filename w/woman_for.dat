5|$|The {{theme of}} a heroine {{moving to a}} strange place where {{she does not know}} the local {{language}} is replicated in Ratnam's later films, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995). The heroine has a dilemma; because she does not know the language in Delhi she can barely socialise with local people, and she is at loggerheads with the only person with whom she can relate. According to Rangan, the restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya is the first instance in Tamil cinema where a man invites a <b>woman</b> <b>for</b> a cup of coffee. He compared it to Oru Thalai Ragam (1980), in which the protagonists barely spoke. Ratnam said that he was inspired by the Doors and the Beatles and, although it was not uncommon to invite a <b>woman</b> <b>for</b> a cup of coffee, it was not reflected in the Tamil cinema of the time.|$|E

5|$|A year later, Catherine was {{banished from}} court, and her rooms {{were given to}} Anne. Anne was an unusually educated and {{intellectual}} <b>woman</b> <b>for</b> her time, and was keenly absorbed and engaged {{with the ideas of}} the Protestant Reformers, though the extent to which she herself was a committed Protestant is much debated. When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died, Anne's influence and the need to find a trustworthy supporter of the annulment had Thomas Cranmer appointed to the vacant position. This was approved by the Pope, unaware of the King's nascent plans for the Church.|$|E

The play is about Wilding, a young law student who gives up his studies to seek pleasure, and his attempts to marry a <b>woman</b> <b>for</b> her money. Fielding focuses on hypocrisy and gender equality in marriage with characters' interaction with Wilding.|$|E

Cadron-Jetté hid the <b>woman</b> <b>for</b> the night in her cellar, fed her, and counselled her to change her way of life.

30|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the durability of}} ACI in patients treated for full-thickness cartilage defects. The most important finding of our study was confirmation of the long-term effectiveness of ACI, even up to 14  years after the first implantation performed in our center. Clinical and functional improvements, with significantly increased mean IKDC and Tegner Activity Level scores, were observed in 86.6  % of cases. A functional evaluation was also performed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at final follow-up. The KOOS results were compared with the age-specific KOOS scores for the general population, as obtained in the epidemiological study of Paradowski et al. [19]. The mean KOOS scores for the 18 – 34  year-old age group were 92.2 men/ 92.1 <b>women</b> <b>for</b> pain, 87.2 men/ 89.1 <b>women</b> <b>for</b> symptoms, 94.2 men/ 95.2 <b>women</b> <b>for</b> ADL, 85.1 men/ 86.4 <b>women</b> <b>for</b> sports, and 85.3 men/ 83.6 <b>women</b> <b>for</b> quality of life. At the final follow-up evaluation, our patients had {{a mean age of}} 33.6  years and, if the two failed implantations are excluded, the average KOOS scores were 95.1 men/ 86.6 <b>women</b> <b>for</b> pain, 93.3 men/ 80 <b>women</b> <b>for</b> symptoms, 97.8 men/ 98.8 <b>women</b> <b>for</b> ADL, 88.7 men/ 69 <b>women</b> <b>for</b> sport, and 89.1 men/ 80 <b>women</b> <b>for</b> quality of life. The KOOS results obtained in our study are comparable with the results of Paradowski et al. [19]. The increases observed in all clinical and functional scores at the last follow-up might be related to the young age of the study population at the time of ACI. Indeed, {{the mean age of the}} participating patients was 21.33 years (range 13 – 45), 10  years less than the average age of patients in other studies [10 – 12].|$|R

5|$|Sometime around 1850, PedroII began having {{discreet}} {{affairs with}} other women. The {{most famous and}} enduring of these relationships involved Luísa Margarida Portugal de Barros, Countess of Barral, with whom he formed a romantic and intimate, though not adulterous, friendship after she was appointed governess to the emperor's daughters in November 1856. Throughout his life, the Emperor held onto a hope of finding a soulmate, something he felt cheated of due to {{the necessity of a}} marriage of state to a <b>woman</b> <b>for</b> whom he never felt passion. This is but one instance illustrating his dual identity: one who assiduously carried out his duty in the role of emperor which destiny had assigned to him and another who considered the imperial office an unrewarding burden and who was happier in the worlds of literature and science.|$|E
5|$|The Magic Wand {{has found}} great {{commercial}} {{success as a}} vibrator, a masturbation aid for women. Its popularity for this purpose {{is associated with the}} American artist and sex educator Betty Dodson, who used it in demonstrations and instructional classes to instruct women regarding self-pleasure techniques. Dodson became active in the sex-positive movement in the late 1960s. She recommended women put a small towel over their sex organs in order to dull the sensation of the vibrator and prolong the pleasurable experience. Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method. Her sessions were known as Bodysex workshops and featured 15 naked women in supine position, each using a Magic Wand simultaneously to aid in masturbation. She provided a Magic Wand to each <b>woman</b> <b>for</b> these two-hour masturbation sessions. Dodson taught thousands of women to achieve orgasm using this technique.|$|E

Southey and Mure differ in details. Southey's bears have porridge, but Mure's have milk; Southey's old woman has no motive for entering the house, but Mure's old woman is piqued when her courtesy visit is rebuffed; Southey's old woman runs away when discovered, but Mure's old woman is impaled on the steeple of St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Wollstonecraft's ideas became {{associated}} {{with her life}} story and women writers {{felt that it was}} dangerous to mention her in their texts. Hays, who had previously been a close friend and an outspoken advocate for Wollstonecraft and her Rights of <b>Woman,</b> <b>for</b> example, did not include her in the collection of Illustrious and Celebrated Women she published in 1803. Maria Edgeworth specifically distances herself from Wollstonecraft in her novel Belinda (1802); she caricatures Wollstonecraft as a radical feminist in the character of Harriet Freke. But, like Jane Austen, she does not reject Wollstonecraft's ideas. Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial {{to the development of the}} nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who should choose companionate marriage.|$|E

5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black <b>woman</b> <b>for</b> the sake of appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time}} that Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E

The Cigarette Smoking Man claims he likes the both of them, which is why she was returned; he reveals that he told Skinner it was Mulder who shot {{the man in the}} parking lot, although he didn't believe this to be true, incidentally revealing himself as unaware of who did shoot the man, namely X.

5|$|In the interim, {{rather than}} await a decision, Ferrari {{continued}} her studies.

The Faculty of Medicine of Paris awarded her the first diploma ever given to a <b>woman</b> <b>for</b> studies in urinary tract monitoring. In 1924, she designed a vaginoscope, which was much easier to sterilize and was more adaptable to multiple specula than previous models. The device significantly improved services which were available to women in Brazil, and was featured in the articles of the Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Rio de Janeiro. The innovation won the Grand Prize at the 1924 Congreso Hispano Lusitano Americano de Ciencias Médicas held in Seville, Spain.|$|E
