While Massa passed Daniil Kvyat for seventh place on lap 21, Sebastian Vettel <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> 16th behind the McLaren of Fernando Alonso, who was told to save fuel, a problem that also afflicted his {{teammate}} Jenson Button. By lap 23 however, Vettel had gone past Alonso and the two Toro Rosso cars of Verstappen and Sainz to move up into 13th.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion {{disengaged}} {{from the}} North Korean and began its withdrawal at 03:00, September 6. The battalion abandoned {{two of its}} own tanks, one because of mechanical failure and the other because it <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> the mud. The battalion moved to the rear in two main groups: G Company to attack Hill 464 {{and the rest of}} the battalion to seize Hill 380, farther south. The North Koreans quickly discovered that the 2nd Battalion was withdrawing and attacked it. The battalion commander, Major Omar T. Hitchner, and his operations officer, Captain James T. Milam, were killed. In the vicinity of Hills 464 and 380 the battalion discovered at daybreak that it was virtually surrounded by North Koreans. Nist thought that the entire battalion was lost.|$|E

5|$|At age 10, Abovian {{was taken}} by his father to Echmiadzin to study for the priesthood. He dropped out after five years and moved to Tiflis in 1822 to study Armenian studies and {{languages}} at the Nersisyan School {{under the guidance of}} Harutiun Alamdarian. Abovian graduated in 1826 and began preparing to move to Venice to further his education. However, the outbreak of the Russo-Persian War (1826–28) curtailed his plans. For the following three years he taught briefly at Sanahin and then worked for Catholicos Yeprem of Armenia as his clerk and translator. While working for the Catholicos, the twenty-year-old Abovian met many notable foreigners, including the diplomat and playwright Alexandr Griboyedov, who <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> Echmiadzin en route to Tabriz in September 1828. Griboyedov's weekly Tifliskiye Vedemosti became the first paper to publish an article on Abovian.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{then shot}} the {{sequence}} where the Little Tramp first meets the millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide. During filming, Henry Clive suddenly {{decided that he}} did not want to jump into the tank of cold water in the scene, causing Chaplin to storm off the set and fire Clive. He was quickly replaced by Harry Myers, who Chaplin had known while under contract at Keystone Studios. Chaplin finished shooting the sequence on July 29, 1929 with exteriors at Pasadena Bridge. Chaplin then shot a sequence that was eventually cut from the film involving the Little Tramp attempting to retrieve a stick that <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> a wall. The scene included a young Charles Lederer; Chaplin later praised the scene, but insisted that it needed to be cut. He then continued filming the scenes with the millionaire until September 29, 1929.|$|E
5|$|It was {{difficult}} for crew members to perceive the film's quality {{during much of the}} production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design. Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially, but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting. According to Lee Unkrich, one of the original editors of Toy Story, a scene was cut out of the original final edit. The scene features Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently. Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the creators of the movie thought the audience would be loving Buzz and Woody at that point. Another scene, where Woody was trying to get Buzz's attention when he <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie. Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.|$|E

5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I excited Baker, as it finally {{gave him a}} purpose in life and allowed him to {{make good use of}} his pilot training. He left the United States for Europe in the summer of 1917, among the first group of Americans to do so. Though eager to join the front immediately, Baker was told that he had to be {{certified}} by the French. Success in the courses was dependent on how quickly the pilots learned French, the predominant language of instruction. Though he managed to complete all the courses easily, a lack of qualified teachers meant that Baker was first sent to a school in England for more training and then back to France to teach Americans what he had learned in England, in an attempt to create pilots as quickly as possible. This discouraged Baker, who was eager to get into the front lines and fight. Owing to a lack of aircraft supplies, Baker <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> Paris, and doubted he would ever get to the front. While in Paris, he was happy to continue seeing Scott, who had enlisted as a nurse and worked at a hospital in France.|$|E
5|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran for 30-minutes. The drivers' fastest lap times {{determined the}} starting {{order for the}} first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. The session was held in cooler night-time weather conditions. Drivers used soft-compound tyres for their first timed laps before entering the pit lane for new tyres {{for the remainder of}} the session. Vandoorne set the pace in the early part of the session and improved to clinch his first pole position of the season, and his fifth consecutive in the series, with a time of 1:39.237. He was joined on the grid's front row by his teammate Matsushita who was three-tenths of a second slower than Vandoorne. Lynn was ninth after his first timed lap but recovered to qualify in third place. Pic, who was Vandoorne's closest contender in the session's opening segment, took fourth, ahead of Marciello who <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> second gear until his team corrected the issue. King was relegated to sixth by Marciello's fastest lap. Norman Nato and Rossi were seventh and eighth. Gasly made a mistake late in the session which restricted him to ninth and Sirotkin rounded out the top ten. Artem Markelov was the fastest driver to not qualify in the top-ten starting positions; his best lap time was seven-tenths of a second slower than Vandoorne. Haryanto ran strongly in the session's early period but took 12th after he was unable to improve on his second set of soft-compound tyres. He was ahead of Evans, Robert Visoiu, and Richie Stanaway. The two Carlin drivers qualified in 16th and 18th (with Julián Leal ahead of Marco Sørensen). They were separated by Sergio Canamasas in the faster of the two MP Motorsport cars. André Negrão, Daniël de Jong, Nathanaël Berthon, René Binder, Marlon Stöckinger, and Zoël Amberg were the last of the qualifiers.|$|E

It had to be cut from the ship while being supported by the shipyard's hammerhead crane. The carrier occupied drydock number 8 from 21 September 1967, until 10 February 1968, displacing USS John King, an oil tanker, and a mine sweeper that were occupying the drydock. During the post-fire refit, the ship's four aft 5"/54 caliber Mark 42 guns were removed. The forward four guns had been removed prior to 1962.|$|E
25|$|The {{passage from}} Ukraine to China {{was even more}} {{problematic}} than the purchase. In June 2000, Varyag was taken under tow. As the tugboat approached the Bosphorus, Turkey denied permission for the ship to pass through, citing the risk that {{a gust of wind}} would turn the ship widthwise and block the entire strait. Varyag spent the next 16 months being towed counterclockwise around the Black Sea, accruing towing charges of $8,500 a day as Chong Lot stopped paying its bills. The tugboat operator compared its fate to the Yellow Fleet that <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> the Suez Canal for eight years, and French thrillseekers even landed a helicopter on the ship.

Marshall played black against Fox who was up a pawn after 20 moves. However, Fox quickly blundered a rook and Marshall won. Meanwhile, Janowski and Lasker were playing against each other for second place. Janowski, with a one-point lead, only needed a draw with the white pieces to clinch the second prize. Janowski {{launched}} a very spirited attack against Lasker's king, which <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> {{the center of the}} board.

25|$|Screamers <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> {{development}} {{hell for}} over a decade before finally being produced. Screenwriter Dan O'Bannon had completed his adaptation of Dick's short story Second Variety in the early 1980s (along with his adaptation of another of Dick's short stories, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, which became the 1990 film Total Recall). By 1983, O'Bannon's screenplay for Screamers had been optioned by Tom Naud (SFX designer on the 1981 film Outland). However, the production never went ahead as planned and {{it was not until the}} 1990s that Screamers went into production, by which time the screenplay had been rewritten by Miguel Tejada-Flores. The film, directed by Christian Duguay, was made in Canada. Locations included a quarry in Quebec, in Montreal's Olympic Stadium, as well as Joliette.|$|E
