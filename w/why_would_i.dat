How could I say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces?...|$|E
500|$|Caragiale {{showed little}} {{surprise}} at the news. In an interview with poet Alexandru Antemireanu, he explained his conflict with Caion in paternalistic terms: [...] "They did well not to sentence the kid. Is he the guilty party? No! Caion is merely a victim. Say I were a juror: <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> be setting an example by punishing this unreasonable and irresponsible kid, {{for those who are}} more mature and better placed, and who employ the same means as he did?" [...] The general public was by then firmly on Caragiale's side, and Macedonski's reputation suffered greatly as a result, increasing his isolation on the literary scene.|$|E
500|$|A {{freelance}} computer artist {{created a}} 3-D image of Scully for {{the scene where}} she is fighting the nurses in the virtual hospital.

500|$|The {{author was}} further {{prompted}} {{to write about}} grace when a friend told him about encountering a homeless prostitute in Chicago who began to cry as {{she told him that}} she had raised money for drugs by prostituting her two-year-old child. When Yancey's friend asked the woman if she had sought help at a local church, she answered, [...] "Church? <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> ever go there? I was already feeling terrible about myself. They'd just make me feel worse." [...] This story convinced Yancey that Christians are doing a poor job of communicating the message that God is willing to accept people, regardless of what they have done; the story haunted him, he said, because the woman was [...] "the type of person who would have gone to Jesus. The more unrighteous a person was, the more comfortable they felt around Jesus".|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the [...] season the Sauber team, {{planning}} their Formula One debut with Mercedes backing for the following year, invoked a clause in Schumacher's contract that stated that if Mercedes entered Formula One, Schumacher would drive for them. It was eventually agreed that Schumacher would stay with Benetton, Peter Sauber said that [...] " [...] didn't want to drive for us. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> have forced him?". The year was dominated by the Williams of Nigel Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, featuring powerful Renault engines, semi-automatic gearboxes and active suspension to control the car's ride height.

500|$|With his {{aggressive}} running style which favored {{running over}} players instead of around them, questions began to arise over how long Campbell could stay healthy. [...] "He runs {{with a lot}} of reckless abandon," [...] said Ron Johnson, a former running back whose own career was cut short. [...] "You can run like that in college. But you can't do that for 10 years and hope to survive." [...] Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris said [...] "Knocking over people can look very good but you can't do it forever. Sometimes it's going to be somebody else who knocks you over ... so the most important thing I think isn't to get a few extra yards every time but to make sure you're healthy enough to play." [...] Bum Phillips, though, favored Campbell's running style. [...] "I've been looking for a back like Earl," [...] he said. [...] "I'm not going to change his style. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>I?</b> You don't want a guy who gets hit and then flops on the ground. Earl does the same thing other backs do, only better." ...|$|E

500|$|For the crew's space suits, Scott was {{inspired}} to include spherical glass helmets after reading a story in Steve Jobs' biography about building an office out of Gorilla Glass. Scott said, [...] "If I'm in 2083 and I'm going into space, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> design a helmet that has blind spots. What I want is something where I have 360 [...] Glass, by then, will be light and you won't be able to break it with a bullet." [...] The interior of the prop helmets had nine functioning video screens, internal lighting, an air supply provided by two fans, and battery packs concealed within a backpack. The helmet's exterior featured a functional light source and high definition video cameras with a transmitter and recorder. For the suit itself, Scott wanted to avoid the unwieldy NASA-style suit. His frequent collaborator, Janty Yates, used medical research concepts relating to skin replacement treatments and materials to develop a garment that would be believable, flexible and comfortable. The outfit comprised a neoprene suit worn under an outer space suit, a base to which the helmet could be attached, and a backpack.|$|E

[...] Boo still runs [...] "Pony Farm" [...] as a horse camp for children. In 1977, Robinson began working with a committee in the Diocese of New Hampshire to study human sexuality and co-authored a small manual on the subject. Robinson and Boo's first daughter, Jamee, was born in 1977, followed by a second daughter, Ella, in 1981. Robinson treasures his marriage stating, [...] "hat is inextricably tied up with having children. And since I cannot imagine my life without Jamee and Ella, it's just a completely irrelevant question for me. And I don't regret having been married to Boo, either, even if there had not been children. It's just a part of my journey, and <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> possibly regret that?" ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, an off-off-Broadway company named The Hourglass Group {{produced}} {{an adaptation of}} The Beebo Brinker Chronicles in a production that ran for a month. The writers used material from I Am a Woman, Women in the Shadows and Journey to a Woman to predominantly positive reviews. It was successful enough to be moved Off Broadway for another ten-week run in 2008. The play's writers commented on the difficulty of lesbian-themed works finding financial success. They were tempted {{to make it more}} appealing by turning to camp for comedy. However, one of the writers said, [...] "I just felt like, how can you turn these people into a joke? I mean, these people are real people! <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> direct a play where I held the characters in some sort of contempt or felt that they were ridiculous?

2500|$|That same year, Robyn {{returned}} home to Sweden and discovered the electronic music brother-and-sister duo The Knife while browsing through a record store. She became inspired by how the duo self-financed and released their recordings, and bought herself out of her recording contract with Jive Records. She was free from her contract, but {{did not want to}} sign with another major label because she felt that [...] "it was totally illogical. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> do that?

[...] According to Turkish authorities, investigations into the smuggling operations in Turkey showed that refugees were often tasked with helping smugglers sign up passengers for smuggling trips. It was also not uncommon for one of the passengers to be given the responsibility of driving the boat. No smuggler, with family in Turkey and a steady income from the lucrative smuggling trade, would want to end up illegally in Europe and risk not being able to return home, where he would be likely to face arrest anyway. The President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan offered Alan's father Abdullah citizenship of Turkey.|$|E

[...] Judge Snow expanded the complaint into a class-action lawsuit, including all Latino drivers stopped by the Sheriff's Office since 2007, or who will be stopped in the future. He also enjoined the MCSO and all of its officers from [...] "detaining any person based only on knowledge or reasonable belief, without more, that the person is unlawfully present within the United States, because as a matter of law such knowledge does not amount to a reasonable belief that the person either violated or conspired to violate the Arizona human smuggling statute, or any other state or federal criminal law." ...|$|E

Sun Quan was so furious {{when he heard about}} it that he had Diao Jia arrested and imprisoned. During the interrogation, when Diao Jia's colleagues were asked whether they heard him defame the imperial court, they all said they did, because they feared retaliation from Lü Yi if they said no. Shi Yi, however, insisted that he did not hear Diao Jia say anything defamatory. As the investigation dragged on for days, the tone of the imperial edicts issued by Sun Quan on this issue became increasingly harsh and stern, to the point where Shi Yi's colleagues feared for his life. Shi Yi remained unfazed and told Sun Quan, [...] "The sword's blade is now on my neck. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> dare to conceal the truth, seek my own death, and end up becoming a disloyal ghost? I only hope that everyone will see the truth." [...] When he was questioned, he answered truthfully and gave consistent responses. Sun Quan eventually believed Shi Yi and spared Diao Jia. The Eastern Jin dynasty historian Xu Zhong (徐眾) praised Shi Yi for maintaining his integrity, standing by his moral principles, and showing moral courage in such a life-threatening situation.|$|E
