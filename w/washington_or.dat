The jury could not reach a verdict and John Surratt was released.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} year, the {{garrison}} would be plagued by mosquitoes and the heat and humidity common to the Washington area during the summer. Though Fort Greble was built on a hill, the area immediately surrounding the fort consisted of swampy bottomland drained by the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, {{a breeding ground for}} malaria. Communication with the outside world was provided by the military road that served the Eastern Branch line of forts, and supply wagons would usually arrive on a weekly schedule. Trips to <b>Washington</b> <b>or</b> Uniontown from the fort were uncommon, and by virtue of its location at the extreme end of the Eastern Branch defenses, Fort Greble was isolated even from its neighboring forts.|$|E
5|$|Dinwiddie sent Washington {{back to the}} Ohio Country to {{safeguard}} an Ohio Company's construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before he reached the area, a French force drove out colonial traders and began construction of Fort Duquesne. A small detachment of French troops led by Joseph Coulon de Jumonville was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day Uniontown, Pennsylvania. On May 28, 1754, Washington {{and some of his}} militia unit, aided by their Mingo allies, ambushed the French in {{what has come to be}} called the Battle of Jumonville Glen. Exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of contention, but several primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes, that Jumonville was killed, and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner. It is not completely clear whether Jumonville died at the hands of Tanacharison in cold blood, or was somehow shot by an onlooker with a musket as he sat with <b>Washington,</b> <b>or</b> by another means. Following the battle, Washington was given the epithet Town Destroyer by Tanacharison.|$|E

5|$|During the Mexican oil boom, Air France flew Concorde twice weekly to Mexico City's Benito Juárez International Airport via Washington, DC, or New York City, from September 1978 to November 1982. The {{worldwide}} {{economic crisis}} {{during that period}} resulted in this route's cancellation; the last flights were almost empty. The routing between <b>Washington</b> <b>or</b> New York and Mexico City included a deceleration, from Mach 2.02 to Mach 0.95, to cross Florida subsonically and avoid creating a sonic boom over the state; Concorde then re-accelerated back to high speed while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. On 1 April 1989, on an around-the-world luxury tour charter, British Airways implemented changes to this routing that allowed G-BOAF to maintain Mach 2.02 by passing around Florida {{to the east and}} south. Periodically Concorde visited the region on similar chartered flights to Mexico City and Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|Mason slowly {{moved from}} being a {{peripheral}} figure towards the center of Virginia politics, but his published response to the Stamp Act, which he opposed, is most notable {{for the inclusion of}} his anti-slavery views. George <b>Washington</b> <b>or</b> George William Fairfax, the burgesses for Fairfax County, may have asked Mason's advice as to what steps to take in the crisis. Mason drafted an act to allow {{for one of the most}} common court actions, replevin, to take place without the use of stamped paper, and sent it to George Washington, by then one of Fairfax County's burgesses, to gain passage. This action contributed to a boycott of the stamps. With the courts and trade paralyzed, the British Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766, but continued to assert the right to tax the colonies.|$|E
5|$|Of the 65 players picked in {{the first}} round by <b>Washington</b> <b>or</b> Texas, 36 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 26 of these were right-handed, while 10 were left-handed. Eleven outfielders, seven third basemen, five shortstops, four catchers, and two first basemen were also taken. The team has never drafted a player at second base. Twelve of the players came from high schools or colleges in the state of Texas, and California follows with nine players. The Rangers have drafted one player, Tanner Scheppers in 2009, who was playing in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball {{at the time of the}} draft.

5|$|The serious {{collection}} and publication of Washington's documentary record {{began with the}} pioneer work of Jared Sparks in the 1830s in Life and Writings of George Washington (12 vols., 1834–1837). The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745–1799 (1931–44) is a 37 volume set edited by John C. Fitzpatrick. It contains over 17,000 letters and documents and is available online from the University of Virginia. The definitive letterpress edition of his writings was begun by the University of Virginia in 1968, and today comprises 52 published volumes, with more to come. It contains everything written by <b>Washington</b> <b>or</b> signed by him, together with most of his incoming letters.

25|$|The Washington-Franklin issues {{employed}} a classical yet simple style in their designs with either <b>Washington</b> <b>or</b> Franklin displayed in full profile, both figures surrounded, in early issues, with {{an arrangement of}} olive branches. This style was in stark contrast {{with that of the}} definitive stamps previously issued in 1902-03 as that issue not only presented a variety of American historical figures, but framed them with an elaborate assortment of allegorical and ornamental designs—which, in spite of their artistic quality, were criticized as so flamboyant that they detracted from the central portrait and theme. The relatively austere design consequently chosen for the Washington-Franklins was the result of this concern.|$|E
25|$|Phra Ong Chao Yodying Prayurayot Bovorn Rachorod Rattana Rachakumarn (พระองค์เจ้ายอดยิ่งประยุรยศบวรราโชรสรัตนราชกุมาร) {{was born}} on the 6 April 1838, the eldest son of Prince Chutamani and Princess Aim. It was said that his father gave him an English name in honour of his {{personal}} hero, the first President of the United States, George Washington. Therefore, he is {{sometimes referred to as}} Prince George <b>Washington</b> <b>or</b> Prince George. In May 1851 Prince Yodyingyot's father was elevated as Second King Pinklao or the Front Palace by his older brother King Mongkut (Rama IV). Pinklao also received from his brother all the styles, titles and honour of a monarch, despite never having been crowned himself. During his childhood the Prince received a modern education, including the English language and modern sciences. It was said that he became an extremely skillful engineer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the first four designs, {{preparing}} printing plates for each stamp required two separate transfer phases. Two different steel dies were used, one containing the <b>Washington</b> <b>or</b> Franklin engraving, the other providing the framework and lettering. After every image on the steel plate had been impressed with both design components, the plate was heat-treated and hardened to prepare it for printing. In the lower-denomination Washington-Franklin Issues, 400 separate impressions appeared on a printing plate, referred to as a flat plate. The higher value of 1-dollar was printed from a flat plate of 200 subjects. The fifth design required different plates for each of the two elements, as printing took place in two stages: the frame was first printed in color and, in a second impression, the Franklin portrait was laid over it in black. These $2 and $5 values employed plates of 100 subjects.|$|E

25|$|Minimum wage rates {{vary greatly}} across many {{different}} jurisdictions, {{not only in}} setting a particular amount of money—for example $7.25 per hour ($14,500 per year) under certain US state laws (or $2.13 for employees who receive tips, which {{is known as the}} tipped minimum wage), $9.47 in the US state of <b>Washington,</b> <b>or</b> £7.50 (for those aged 25+) in the United Kingdom—but also in terms of which pay period (for example Russia and China set monthly minimum wages) or the scope of coverage. Currently the American federal minimum wage rests at seven dollars, twenty-five cents ($7.25) per hour. However, some states do not recognize the minimum wage law such as Louisiana and Tennessee. Other states operate below the federal minimum wage such as Georgia and Wyoming. Some jurisdictions even allow employers to count tips given to their workers as credit towards the minimum wage levels. India {{was one of the first}} developing countries to introduce minimum wage policy. It also has one of the most complicated systems with more than 1,200 minimum wage rates.|$|E
25|$|The Washington-Franklin Issues were {{unique in}} the sense that these {{subjects}} were the only ones found on definitive stamps for more than a decade. Beginning in 1908 the Washington-Franklin definitive stamps were issued over a twelve-year period in denominations ranging from one cent to , with different colors for each denomination, all with the same engraved profile of <b>Washington</b> <b>or</b> Franklin. While both Washington and Franklin occur on the 1-cent values, both in green, only one of them appears in a given series (Franklin on the issues until 1912, Washington on the subsequent releases). In the first issue, Franklin appeared only on the one-cent value, while the same Washington image graced the remaining eleven denominations, which ranged from two cents to one dollar. In later issues, Washington was present only on the seven denominations between one cent and seven cents, and all the higher values were assigned to Franklin. The engraving of Washington was modeled after a bust by the renowned sculptor Jean Antoine Houdon. The few examples exhibited here are largely representative of this greater series. Franklin is displayed once here for general reference to the Washington-Franklin issues.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} Washington-Franklin issues (1908–11), every design {{incorporated}} {{a pair of}} olive branches surrounding {{one or the other}} of the two profiles. From 1912 on, however, the Franklin-head issues would instead appear with Oak leaves near the bottom of the oval in the image. Olive branches and Oak leaves are often used as symbols for peace (Olive branches) and strength (Oak leaves), though no significance was officially acknowledged in their use here. The Washington-Franklins were issued in denominations ranging from 1-cent to 5-dollars, each value printed in different color ink. The two engravings of either <b>Washington</b> <b>or</b> Franklin are employed in five basic design themes (i.e., framework, ornaments, lettering) which in turn were used to print more than 250 separate and distinct stamp issues over a fourteen-year period. During this time seven separate series of the Washington-Franklins appeared in succession, each series differing somewhat from its predecessor in physical characteristics (i.e., paper type, perforation size, etc.), while some series would also introduce new denominations printed with new colors. Produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington D.C., these issues were generally printed by the flat-plate process, but several of the issues also employed other new and experimental printing methods, including use of the revolutionary rotary printing press and the offset printing process. The first Washington-Franklin postage stamp to be released was a two-cent stamp issued on November 16, 1908. Other denominations soon followed and would continue to appear through the first World War years, with the last Washington-Franklin postage stamp issued in 1923. The series thus survived for almost fifteen years, longer than any previous U. S. Postage Stamp series produced by a single printing organization.|$|E
