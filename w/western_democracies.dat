5|$|In the pre-war years, Göring enjoyed {{widespread}} personal {{popularity among}} the German public {{because of his}} perceived sociability, colour and humour. As the Nazi leader most responsible for economic matters, he presented himself {{as a champion of}} national interests over allegedly corrupt big business and the old German elite. The Nazi press was on Göring's side. Other Nazi leaders, such as Hess and Ribbentrop, were envious of his popularity. Even in the political circles of Britain and the United States, there were those who viewed Göring as more acceptable than the other Nazis, and as a possible mediator between the <b>western</b> <b>democracies</b> and Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Variations of the {{original}} theory were also proposed, including {{the claim that the}} plot involved overseas groups intent on overthrowing the Chakri dynasty, the claim that media consolidation was a core component of the conspiracy, the claim that the Plan was aimed at maintaining a constitutional monarchy while reducing the powers of the monarch to a mere figurehead, and the claim that a law designed to further decentralize central administrative power to the Thai provinces, and the claim that Thaksin wanted to establish a government based on the model of <b>western</b> <b>democracies.</b>|$|E
25|$|For all her censures of Communism, however, West {{was hardly}} an {{uncritical}} {{supporter of the}} <b>Western</b> <b>democracies.</b> Thus in 1919–1920, she excoriated the U.S. government for deporting Goldman and for the infamous Palmer raids. She was also appalled at the failure of <b>Western</b> <b>democracies</b> {{to come to the}} aid of Republican Spain, and she gave money to the Republican cause.|$|E
50|$|An {{opponent}} {{believes that}} Gomaa {{is not necessarily}} committed to democracy. Following the Egyptian coup, he expressed hostility towards <b>Western</b> <b>democracy</b> in a television interview and stated that it was contrary to Islamic law. Specifically, {{he argued that the}} Muslim Brothers should be following Islamic law, not <b>Western</b> <b>democracy.</b>|$|R

25|$|The same legal {{interpretation}} {{is shared by}} the United States, the United Kingdom, and all other <b>Western</b> <b>democracies</b> , who held the forcible incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the Soviet Union to be illegal. At least formally, the <b>Western</b> <b>democracies</b> never considered the three Baltic states to be constituent parts of the Soviet Union. Australia was a brief exception to this support of Baltic independence: In 1974, the Labor government of Australia did recognize Soviet dominion, but this decision was reversed by the next Australian Parliament.|$|E

25|$|According to the Government of Estonia, the European Court of Human Rights, the EU, and the US, Estonia {{remained}} {{occupied by}} the Soviet Union until restoration of its independence in 1991; the 48 years of Soviet occupation and annexation were never recognized as legal by the <b>Western</b> <b>democracies.</b>|$|E

25|$|Eastern Bloc {{politics}} {{followed the}} Red Army's occupation {{of much of}} eastern Europe {{at the end of}} World War II and the Soviet Union's installation of Soviet-controlled Stalinist or Marxist–Leninist governments in the Eastern Bloc through a process of bloc politics and repression.

25|$|Marijuana {{use in the}} United States {{is three}} times above the global average, but in line with other <b>Western</b> <b>democracies.</b> 44% of American 12th graders have tried the drug at least once, and the typical age of first-use is 16, similar to the typical age of first-use for alcohol but lower than the first-use age for other illicit drugs.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks after}} the release of the book, Hager spoke at the four-day {{biennial}} Writers & Readers Festival in Christchurch. About 5000 people attended 57 events, one of which was a public discussion called Secrets, Spies and Free Speech featuring Dirty Politics author Nicky Hager, Guardian journalist Luke Harding and Australian journalist Richard King. The discussion was mainly about the freedom of speech in <b>Western</b> <b>democracies.</b>|$|E

40|$|Drawn {{from the}} textual {{data in the}} online and printed media from {{mainland}} China and Hong Kong, this article aims to identify and feature how Chinese-style democracy is constructed by engaging in discourse analysis, arguing that China-style democracy {{is not a political}} experiment aiming to critically reflect upon the weaknesses of democracy in conceptual and procedural aspects, and not a creative project focusing on how the Chinese experiences can refresh and reframe the conventional wisdom. Instead, it is a meaning-construction project surrounding the following themes explored: (1) negative <b>Western</b> <b>democracy</b> versus positive Chinese-style democracy in terms of efficiency, (2) <b>Western</b> <b>democracy</b> as the symbol of political failure, such as street politics, domestic struggles, chaos, (3) positivity of Chinese-style democracy with China’s rise brought by reform and opening-up since 1978, and (4) perverting the language of <b>Western</b> <b>democracy</b> to construct Chinese-style democracy, such as rule of law, human rights. Specialty, uniqueness and adaption, in the main, are the common ground during the process of meaning reconstruction, with the intention to conduct the political performance for an undemocratic, illiberal and autocratic regime...|$|R
50|$|Together with Boris Pahor, he {{edited the}} journal Zaliv (The Bay), founded to promote {{political}} and cultural pluralism and the values of <b>western</b> <b>democracy.</b> He was also co-editor of the literary journals Sidro (Anchor), Tokovi (Currents) and Most (Bridge).|$|R
25|$|Coleman is also outspoken {{about the}} threat posed by Iran to <b>Western</b> <b>democracies.</b> He {{sponsored}} numerous Congressional Resolutions aimed at Iran, including measures condemning Iran’s violations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and other Iranian violations its international obligations. Coleman also led an effort to bring worldwide pressure on Iran to stop their attempts to enrich uranium, which many believe is the final step in an effort for Iran to have offensive nuclear weapons capabilities.|$|E
25|$|The turn towards Germany {{could also}} {{have been made in}} early 1939, marked by Stalin's speech to the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in March 1939, shortly after the German {{occupation}} of Czechoslovakia, when he warned that the <b>Western</b> <b>democracies</b> were trying to provoke a conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union and declared the Soviet Union's non-involvement in inter-capitalist quarrels, which is sometimes considered to have been a signal to Berlin.|$|E
25|$|The central {{thesis of}} Unto Caesar is that Communism and National Socialism were “revolutionary secular {{religions}} {{arising from the}} arrogant endeavour of man to transform religious promises directly into worldly reality” (Markus Huttner). Voigt argues that such 'secular religions' {{pose a threat to}} the fundamentals of European civilization by seeking to “render to Caesar what is God's” and can only be defeated if the <b>western</b> <b>democracies,</b> particularly Britain, stand up and actively defend Christianity and Civilization against the totalitarian onslaught.|$|E
5000|$|But {{yet another}} critic {{points out that}} bin Laden contradicts this democracy-creates-responsibility {{position}} in another, more typical, Islamist description of <b>Western</b> <b>democracy</b> (specifically American democracy) as `the law {{of the rich and}} wealthy, who hold sway in the political parties.` ...|$|R

50|$|Shariati {{believed}} {{that the government of}} Imam Ali could be considered the best form of democracy. On this occasion, he tried to interpret the behavior of Imam Ali in contrast with his enemy. He called this democracy Commitment democracy. It appears that Shariati did not accept the <b>western</b> definition of <b>democracy</b> although he had no problem with democracy. According to him, a religious government is the democratic right of Muslim citizens. He {{believed that}} one of the basic problems of <b>western</b> <b>democracy</b> is demagogy. Nowadays the votes of voters direct to special channels with the help of advertising instruments. In such a condition only one who is critically conscious can dispose of distractions and surface-level arguments, and vote effectively for themselves and their communities. He maintains that the <b>western</b> <b>democracy</b> based on gold, cruelty and tricking (Zar, Zour va Tazvir) is an anti-revolutionary regime which is different with ideological Guidance.|$|R
25|$|In most <b>western</b> <b>democracies,</b> {{the desire}} to {{eliminate}} or reduce economic inequality is generally associated with the political left. One practical {{argument in favor of}} reduction is the idea that economic inequality reduces social cohesion and increases social unrest, thereby weakening the society. There is evidence that this is true (see inequity aversion) and it is intuitive, at least for small face-to-face groups of people. Alberto Alesina, Rafael Di Tella, and Robert MacCulloch find that inequality negatively affects happiness in Europe but not in the United States.|$|E
25|$|By 1921 Sun {{had become}} {{president}} of the southern government. He spent his remaining years trying to consolidate his regime and achieve unity with the north. His efforts to obtain aid from the <b>Western</b> <b>democracies</b> were fruitless, however, and in 1920 he turned to the Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own revolution. The Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by offering scathing attacks on Western imperialism. For political expediency, though, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established Chinese Communist Party (CCP).|$|E
25|$|As king, Faisal {{continued}} the close {{alliance with the}} United States begun by his father, and relied on the US heavily for arming and training his armed forces. King Faisal was also anti-Communist. He refused any political ties with the Soviet Union and other Communist bloc countries, professing to see a complete incompatibility between Communism and Islam, and associating communism with zionism, which he also sharply criticized. He maintained close relationships with <b>Western</b> <b>democracies</b> including the United Kingdom: on his state visit in 1967, he presented Queen Elizabeth II with a diamond necklace.|$|E
50|$|Germany is {{the only}} <b>western</b> <b>democracy</b> with an {{organization}} like the BPjM. The rationales for earlier decisions to add works to the index are, in retrospect, incomprehensible reactions to moral panics.

50|$|In 2014, Roslyn {{appeared}} as a guest on the Keiser Report and Worlds Apart, discussing democracy and whistle-blowing respectively.

50|$|In {{common with}} a similar {{movement}} in England at the same time, the writers of 18th century France were critical, skeptical and innovative. Their lasting contributions were the ideas of liberty, toleration, humanitarianism, equality, and progress, which became the ideals of modern <b>western</b> <b>democracy.</b>|$|R
25|$|After its {{defeat at}} the Battle of the Ebro the Republican Army was broken {{and would never}} recover. The Republicans had lost most of their {{armament}} and experienced units. Furthermore, in October 1938 the Republican government agreed to withdraw the volunteers of the International Brigades. On the other hand, the Nationalists received new supplies of ammunition, weapons and aircraft from Germany. Furthermore, after the Munich Agreement, the hope of an intervention of the <b>Western</b> <b>democracies</b> in order to aid the Republic against Germany and Italy vanished. France had closed the frontier again in mid-June 1938 and froze Republican financial assets in French banks.|$|E
25|$|Although the United States and the United Kingdom, {{the allies}} of the USSR against Nazi Germany during World War II, {{recognized}} the occupation of the Republic of Estonia by USSR at Yalta Conference in 1945 de facto, {{the governments of the}} rest of the <b>western</b> <b>democracies</b> did not recognize it de jure according to the Sumner Welles' declaration of July 23, 1940 Some of these countries recognized Estonian diplomats who still functioned in many countries in the name of their former governments. These consuls persisted in this anomalous situation until the ultimate restoration of Estonia's independence in 1991.|$|E
25|$|The May Fourth Movement {{helped to}} rekindle the then-fading cause of republican revolution. In 1917 Sun Yat-sen had become {{commander-in-chief}} {{of a rival}} military government in Guangzhou in collaboration with southern warlords. Sun's efforts to obtain aid from the <b>Western</b> <b>democracies</b> were ignored, however, and in 1920 {{he turned to the}} Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own revolution. The Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by offering scathing attacks on Western imperialism. But for political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established Chinese Communist Party (CCP).|$|E
50|$|The {{issue of}} fake {{news in the}} 2016 United States {{election}} has given the Chinese Government a reason to further criticize <b>Western</b> <b>democracy</b> and press freedom.
