5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls {{attention to the fact that}} poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play <b>will</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E

500|$|His {{language}} {{became more}} forceful; the Jesuit Father Peter Finlay {{was described by}} Yeats {{as a man of}} [...] "monstrous discourtesy", and he lamented that, [...] "It is one of the glories of the Church in which I was born that we have put our Bishops in their place in discussions requiring legislation". During his time in the Senate, Yeats further warned his colleagues: [...] "If you show that this country, southern Ireland, is going to be governed by Roman Catholic ideas and by Catholic ideas alone, you will never get the North... You <b>will</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> wedge {{in the midst of this}} nation". He memorably said of his fellow Irish Protestants, [...] "we are no petty people".|$|E

500|$|Michael Scott's (Steve Carell) [...] "best friend forever" [...] Todd Packer (David Koechner) offends {{the staff}} with crude gossip about an upper {{management}} scandal. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) informs Michael {{that he will}} conduct {{a review of the}} company's sexual harassment policies because the CFO resigned after allegations made by his secretary. [...] Michael's indignation that this <b>will</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> damper on his easygoing office environment rises to outrage when he learns that the corporate headquarters is sending down a lawyer to talk to him. Michael and the warehouse staff mock the sexual harassment video, but the crude remarks come to a screeching halt when Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) and the lawyer arrive from Corporate.|$|E
500|$|In 1924 J.

[...] J. Jovanović's account changed {{back and forth over the}} years and never adequately addressed Colonel Lesanin's statement. [...] Bilinski did not speak openly on the subject, but his press department chief confirmed that a meeting had taken place including a vague warning, but there was no mention of an ethnic Serb Austro-Hungarian soldier shooting Franz Ferdinand.|$|E
500|$|The first-ever New Zealand tour to the Northern Hemisphere was in 1905–06. It {{was also}} the first time they wore a black strip and the first time they {{performed}} the haka. The team – known today as [...] "The Original All Blacks" [...] – played various club and national sides throughout the British Isles before taking on France on 1 January 1906. This was France's first Test and was held at Parc des Princes, Paris. The All Blacks scored ten tries, including six in the second half, to France's two, and won 388. Despite the scoreline, France's two tries were more than any previous team had scored against the All Blacks on tour. Commenting on the state of French rugby in their book The Complete Rugby Footballer, Original All Blacks Dave Gallaher and Billy Stead wrote: [...] "We are strongly of the opinion that the game will spread in their country and that in the course of time they <b>will</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> team in the field which will command the utmost respect of any other." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 1992, {{the group}} self-funded a seventrack self-titled {{extended}} play, {{also known as}} the Blue EP, on their own Finger label and distributed by MDS. It was produced by Leroy Bath and Ian Taylor, and recorded at Broken Toys Studios, Brisbane. The EP has an early version of [...] "Save Your Skin", co-written by Coghill, Collins, Haug, Middleton and Fanning; it was later expanded and released in July 1994 as a single from their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears. Their second EP, Transfusion, was issued in September 1993, distributed by Polydor Records. At that time, Simon McKenzie of Time Off noted they were [...] "hoping the major label <b>will</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> bit of weight behind the disc, but it's not as though they've signed a record deal or anything". McKenzie felt the EP showed they were [...] "wanting to get heavier and louder for a long time, but is it also a reaction against the sixties tags they've been stuck with?". The five tracks include [...] "Reap What You Sow", which reached the No.1 spot on the ARIA Alternative Singles Chart, replacing Nirvana's [...] "Heart-Shaped Box". The group recorded their first music video, for [...] "Reap What You Sow"; it was directed by David Barker, who subsequently directed their next seven videos. After the EP's success the group were signed by Polydor.|$|E
500|$|Mason had {{submitted}} {{his plan}} sometime between June 8 and 10, 1776. It named {{the new state}} the [...] "Commonwealth of Virginia", a name chosen pointedly by Mason to indicate that power stemmed from the people. The constitution provided for a popularly elected House of Delegates, chosen annually by men who owned or leased property, or who had fathered three or more Virginians. Most governmental power resided in the House of Delegates—the governor could not even veto a bill, and could only act {{as head of the}} state militia on the advice of his Council of State, whose members were elected by the legislature. The draft was considered by the committee, and it issued a report on June 24, at which time Jefferson's preamble and several amendments authored by him were included—George Wythe, who advocated for Jefferson's draft before the committee, found discussion far enough advanced that members were only willing to yield to Jefferson on a few points. The entire convention considered the document between June 26 and 28, and it was signed on the 29th. Richard Henry Lee wrote the day prior to the constitution's passage by unanimous vote, [...] "I have had the pleasure to see our new plan of Government go on well. This day <b>will</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> finishing hand to it. 'Tis very much of the democratic kind." ...|$|E
