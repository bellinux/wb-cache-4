5000|$|Wigner {{crystallization}} in {{a two-dimensional}} electron gas under high magnetic fields was predicted (and was observed experimentally [...] ) to occur for small filling factors (less than ν=1/5) of the lowest Landau level.

50|$|Additionally, {{experiments}} using quantum wires - short quantum wires {{are sometimes}} referred to as ‘quantum point contacts’, (QPCs) - have also led to suggestions of Wigner crystallization in 1D systems.In the experiment performed by Hew et al., a 1D channel was formed by confining electrons in both directions transverse to the electron transport, by the bandstructure of the GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction and the potential from the QPC. The novel device design allowed the electron density in the 1D channel to be varied relatively independently of the strength of transverse confining potential, thus allowing experiments to be performed in the regime in which Coulomb interactions between electrons dominate over the kinetic energy. It is a well-established result that the conductance through a QPC shows a series of plateaux quantized in units of the conductance quantum, 2e2/h However, this experiment reported a disappearance of the first plateau (resulting in a jump in conductance of 4e2/h), which was attributed to the formation of two parallel rows of electrons. In a strictly 1D system, electrons will occupy equidistant points along a line, i.e. a 1D <b>Wigner</b> <b>crystal.</b> As the electron density increases, the Coulomb repulsion becomes large enough to overcome the electrostatic potential confining the 1D <b>Wigner</b> <b>crystal</b> in the transverse direction, leading to a lateral rearrangement of the electrons into a double-row structure.

50|$|A <b>Wigner</b> <b>crystal</b> is {{the solid}} (crystalline) phase of {{electrons}} first predicted by Eugene Wigner in 1934. A gas of electrons moving in 2D or 3D in a uniform, inert, neutralizing background will crystallize {{and form a}} lattice if the electron density {{is less than a}} critical value. This is because the potential energy dominates the kinetic energy at low densities, so the detailed spatial arrangement of the electrons becomes important. To minimize the potential energy, the electrons form a bcc (body-centered cubic) lattice in 3D, a triangular lattice in 2D and an evenly spaced lattice in 1D. Most experimentally observed Wigner clusters exist due to the presence of the external confinement, i.e. external potential trap. As a consequence, deviations from the b.c.c or triangular lattice are observed. A crystalline state of the 2D electron gas can also be realized by applying a sufficiently strong magnetic field. However, it is still not clear whether it is the Wigner-crystallization that has led to observation of insulating behaviours in magnetotransport measurements on 2D electron systems, since other candidates are present, such as Anderson localization.|$|E
