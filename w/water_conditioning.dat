5|$|Salt is {{processed}} from salt mines, {{and by the}} evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, only about 6% is used for human consumption. Other uses include <b>water</b> <b>conditioning</b> processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.|$|E
5|$|Only about 6% of {{the salt}} {{manufactured}} {{in the world is}} used in food. Of the remainder, 12% is used in <b>water</b> <b>conditioning</b> processes, 8% goes for de-icing highways and 6% is used in agriculture. The rest (68%) is used for manufacturing and other industrial processes, and sodium chloride {{is one of the largest}} inorganic raw materials used by volume. Its major chemical products are caustic soda and chlorine, which are separated by the electrolysis of a pure brine solution. These are used in the manufacture of PVC, plastics, paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds. Salt is also used as a flux in the production of aluminium. For this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. It is also used in the manufacture of soaps and glycerine, where it is added to the vat to precipitate out the saponified products. As an emulsifier, salt is used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, and another use is in the firing of pottery, when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material, forming a strong glaze.|$|E

500|$|Ionic {{compounds}} {{have long}} had {{a wide variety of}} uses and applications. Many minerals are ionic.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study on}} (Carbon Dioxide) CO 2 levels based on different ventilation systems. Three main types of buildings were considered in the study, such as educational, office buildings and hospitals. The effect of different systems of natural ventilation systems on CO 2 levels was studied. The measurements were taken by accommodating different situations in the open able condition of windows: fully opened, half opened and fully closed. It was found that, the size of windows, the number of windows and the positioning of windows have major impact on indoor air quality. CO 2 measurements were taken in both naturally ventilated buildings and mechanically ventilated buildings. And a comparison was made between mechanically and naturally ventilated systems. In mechanically ventilated buildings two types of air conditioning systems namely cold <b>water</b> air <b>conditioning</b> system and spit type air conditioning system were considered for the comparison. Cold <b>water</b> air <b>conditioning</b> system {{was found to be}} good than the split type air conditioning system under improper maintenance conditions.
