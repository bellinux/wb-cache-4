The irony of the digital age is that, as technology gets more invisible, people {{are more interested in}} being able to see it again, as in Apple Computer's iMac, with its translucent blues and milky plastics that simultaneously tease and reveal.|$|E
25|$|Until then, all {{results from}} the solar radio-spectrographs had been {{inferred}} from studying the Sun by looking at its spectrum with only very limited angular resolution. Wild wanted to actually see what these phenomena looked like on the Sun, actually get a moving picture of them. The frequency range that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> was around about the metre wavelengths. To get the resolution roughly equivalent {{to that of the}} human eye at these long wavelengths required an aperture some three kilometres in diameter. So I devised a method of synthesising a three kilometre aperture with 96 antennas in a ring.|$|E
500|$|Both Rachel and Janet are Detective Constables in the Major Incident Team of the Manchester Metropolitan Police Service, {{with the}} team headed by DCI Gill Murray (Amelia Bullmore), who is loosely based on Diane Taylor. Producers were {{undecided}} on what age DCI Murray would be, but had originally pictured an actress older than Bullmore. After auditioning, Bullmore returned a month later, intent on playing Murray [...] "tough", however, when meeting casting director Beverley Keogh in the toilets beforehand, Bullmore recounted that Keogh said to her: [...] "That's not what we've got you back for. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> seeing a warmer side".|$|E

500|$|While {{the draft}} {{followed}} Maguire's idea of retelling {{the story of}} the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation [...] "goes far afield" [...] from the novel. As Holzman observed in an interview with Playbill, [...] "It was [...] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops– and really the whole plot– is different onstage." [...] Schwartz justified [...] the deviation, saying [...] "Primarily <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the relationship between Galinda– who becomes Glinda– and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies." [...] In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda - and eventually becoming the Tin Woodman instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, and Doctor Dillamond not being murdered.|$|E
500|$|On February 4, 2008 a {{re-recording}} of [...] "You Should've Killed Me When You Had the Chance" [...] {{was posted}} on the band's Myspace. The album was reissued on February 19. The reissue has different cover artwork, as well as four bonus tracks – the track listing of which was revealed on February 1. The bonus tracks are: a new song recorded especially for the reiussue, titled [...] "Why Walk on Water When We've Got Boats", two re-recorded songs that were originally featured on their debut album, And Their Name Was Treason – [...] "Heartless" [...] and the aforementioned [...] "You Should've Killed Me When You Had the Chance" [...] – and a cover of the Kelly Clarkson song, [...] "Since U Been Gone". The new tracks were recorded at The Wade Studio. In addition to these bonus tracks, is a bonus DVD with footage of A Day to Remember's performance in Ocala, two music videos, as well as behind the scenes footage of recording and commentary on the re-release. The re-release came about after Victory asked the band whether or not {{if they were going}} to do a new album. Commenting about Victory's inquiry about a new album, Woodard [...] "We weren't ready to do it , so they asked if, you know, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> doing a re-release with new artwork and adding some new songs." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the {{wardrobe}} and the jewels, {{and in the}} silverware, and its grace of shape and beauty and delicacy of ornamentation. The silverware is kept locked up, except at meal-times, and none but the chief butler and the prince have keys to the safe. I did not clearly understand why, {{but it was not}} {{for the protection of the}} silver. It was either to protect the prince from the contamination which his caste would suffer if the vessels were touched by low-caste hands, or it was to protect his highness from poison. Possibly it was both. I believe a salaried taster has to taste everything before the prince ventures it--an ancient and judicious custom in the East, and has thinned out the tasters a good deal, for of course it is the cook that puts the poison in. If I were an Indian prince I would not go to the expense of a taster, I would eat with the cook.|$|E
6000|$|His {{acquaintance}} {{with books and}} his schooling began early. He learned his letters at a dame school. Mr. William Wells, an Englishman, opened a classical school {{in one of the}} spacious Tory Row houses near Elmwood, and, bringing with him English public school thoroughness and severity, gave the boy a drilling in Latin, which he must have made almost a native speech to judge by the ease with which he handled it afterward in mock heroics. Of course he went to Harvard College. He lived at his father's house, more than a mile away from the college yard; but this could have been no great privation to him, for he had the freedom of his friends' rooms, and he loved the open air. The Rev. Edward Everett Hale has given a sketch of their common life in college. [...] "He was a little older than I," [...] he says, [...] "and was one class in advance of me. My older brother, with whom I lived in college, and he were most intimate friends. He had no room within the college walls, and was a great deal with us. The fashion of Cambridge was then literary. Now the fashion of Cambridge runs to social problems, but then <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> literature. We read Byron and Shelley and Keats, and we began to read Tennyson and Browning. I first heard of Tennyson from Lowell, who had borrowed from Mr. Emerson the little first volume of Tennyson. We actually passed about Tennyson's poems in manuscript. Carlyle's essays were being printed at the time, and his French Revolution. In such a community--not two hundred and fifty students all told,--literary effort was, as I say, the fashion, and literary men, among whom Lowell was recognized from the very first, were special favorites. Indeed, there was that in him which made him a favorite everywhere." ...|$|E
