Several workers, mostly microbiologists, had already {{observed}} that microbial cells had the ability to concentrate, in their cellular mass, manyfold metals that existed in dilute concentrations in their aqueous environment.

In an indirect way biosorption of metals was also being used by microbiologists in the process of staining microbial cells in order to increase their electron density so they could be better studied under the electron microscope. During the 1970 's, the increasing awareness and concern about the environment motivated research for new efficient technologies that would be capable to treat,inexpensively, waste waters polluted by metals with emphasis to radionuclides.

At the time, he was working as an English teacher in Plzeň, Czech Republic, and had no professional experience with film editing. Instead, he taught himself as the project progressed, beginning with Photoshop skills that he had developed in college. To remove the post-1977 changes, Harmáček was required to go through the film frame-by-frame, correcting colors and rotoscoping. Undoing some shots took only an hour, while others took hundreds. Lightsabers were color-corrected, shots of the Millennium Falcon cockpit were cropped, Boba Fett's voice was changed, and CGI characters and backgrounds were removed. Most of the source material used for Harmy's Despecialized Edition was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray release, while other sequences were upscaled from GOUT. To create the cuts, source material was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray releases, HDTV broadcasts of the 2004 DVDs, GOUT, digital broadcasts of the 1997 Special Edition, the 1993 LaserDiscs, digital transfers of a Spanish 35 mm Kodak LPP and 70 mm film cels, a 16 mm print, and still images of the original matte paintings.

5000|$|In 1949, Hartley began freelancing for editor Stan Lee at Timely Comics, the {{progenitor}} of Marvel Comics.

Stan Lee knew my work and hired me. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>working</b> with Stan, he wrote most of my stories, although I later wrote all of my own stories.

It was my job to draw the story with as much excitement, surprise, and suspense as I could. Then, Stan would write the dialogue the manner of what would be called the [...] "Marvel Method". It's hard to put a time frame on it, but I'd guess we started working that way in the mid-1950s. As Timely segued into Atlas Comics, Marvel's 1950s predecessor, Hartley made his mark with a more than decade-long run on the Patsy Walker teen-girl titles. With writer-editor Lee, Hartley chronicled the redheaded high schooler's lightly comic adventures in her namesake series (which ran through 1964) and in its spin-offs, Patsy and Hedy (which ran through 1967) and the single-issue A Date with Patsy (Sept. 1957). Well into the Marvel era, Hartley also drew the [...] "Special Queen Size Annual" [...] publication Patsy Walker's Fashion Parade #1 (1966). Walker eventually would be integrated into mainstream Marvel Universe continuity in the 1970s as the supernatural superheroine Hellcat long after Hartley had left the character.Also for Atlas, Hartley co-created Leopard Girl with writer Don Rico in Jungle Action, and drew such features as [...] "The Black Rider" [...] in Wild Western, and [...] "Cliff Mason, White Hunter" [...] in Jungle Tales.

His {{effort to}} "Defuse the Nuclear Threat," (see NuclearRisk. org) {{includes}} applying {{quantitative risk analysis}} to a potential failure of nuclear deterrence. Dr. Hellman {{was inducted into the}} National Inventors Hall of Fame for co-inventing public key cryptography, a technology which secures literally trillions of dollars in financial transactions every day. His honors include election to the National Academy of Engineering, Fellow of the IEEE, Marconi International Fellow, the IEEE Hamming Medal, and being named one of only 23 Stanford Engineering Heroes thus far. Runtime: 80 : 01 minutes. Co-sponsored by: Daisy Alliance, Georgia Tech's Sam Nunn School of International Affairs (INTA), the Center for International Strategy,Technology, and Policy (CISTP), Nuclear & Radiological Engineering Program (NRE), and the General Ray Davis Memorial Fund. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> first <b>started</b> <b>working</b> in cryptography in the early 1970 's, almost all of my colleagues told me I was crazy because NSA had a huge head <b>start</b> and, if <b>I</b> did anything good, they would classify it. Those arguments had validity, but with hindsight, it was very wise to take on that “fool’s errand. ” This talk proposes that “tilting at windmills” might be applied to taking on the problems associated with nuclear deterrence.
