25|$|My {{favorite}} {{king was}} King Melchior, {{because he was}} the oldest and had a long white beard. My brother's favorite was King Kaspar. He insisted that this king was a little crazy and quite deaf. I don't know <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> positive about his being deaf. I suspect it was because dear King Kaspar never brought him all the gifts he requested. He was also rather puzzled by the fact that King Kaspar carried the myrrh, which appeared to him as a rather eccentric gift, for he never quite understood what the word meant.|$|E

25|$|Travis {{has been}} {{compared}} to other characters in fiction, primarily action characters. Game Revolution editor Jesse Constantino comments that while Grasshopper Manufacture tries to portray him as punk, he's no more punk than his grandmother's doll collection, comparing him to Sam Spade of The Maltese Falcon. He was also described as what the love child between Fight Clubs Tyler Durden and Kill Bills The Bride would be. Game designer Steve Gaynor compared Travis' clothing to Durden's as well. He {{has been compared}} to another character from Goichi Suda in the video game Flower, Sun, and Rain called Sumio Mondo. Gaming Nexus editor Matt Mirkovich praised the voice work of his voice actor Robin Atkin Downes, calling it one of the best works in gaming. Game Style editor Garry Webber described him as an unashamedly geeky otaku as well as an amoral contemptuous assassin, but added that this was <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> likable. G4 TV editor Matt Kiel stated that Travis is an especially noteworthy aspect of the quality plot, adding that while he's amoral and a jerk, {{he is one of the}} most likable video game characters in a long time. Fox News editor Lou Kesten described Travis as the Wii's most ridiculously violent hero. He was awarded best new character of 2008 by GamePro magazine, and was nominated by GameSpot for the same award.|$|E

25|$|Born 1 October 1900 in Gloucester, Goddard joined Gloucestershire in 1922 as a fast bowler, Goddard {{met with}} so little success in his first six years {{that he was not}} re-engaged by Gloucestershire for 1928. However, {{determined}} to succeed, he joined the ground staff at Lord's and switched to off spin. With his massive hands and steep bounce due to his height (about 190 centimetres or six feet three inches), he was an immediate success and Gloucestershire re-engaged him for 1929. Even on the best of wickets Goddard was able to turn the ball substantially, and when the turf was worn or sticky he could spin to a remarkable degree. He earned a reputation as a voracious appealer, a sworn enemy of batsmen. Owing to his high trajectory, he could be easy to hit (it is estimated he was hit for 70 sixes a season between 1934 and 1938), and it is probable that this is <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> expensive against the incomparable 1948 Australian side, and in some cases in county cricket. He played only once against Australia (in 1930) and only eight times against all countries – for much of Goddard's time, Hedley Verity was the preferred England spin bowler, and it is often thought that leg spinners rather than off spinners were favoured at this time in Tests. His successes in the matches he played (he did a hat-trick against South Africa in 1938–39) suggests he might have done well with more opportunities. He finished with six hat-tricks, the same as Parker and only one less than the all-time record of seven, held by D. V. P. Wright of Kent.|$|E
25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could {{be as bad as}} what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E

One evening, when the moon was full, the Maharishi arranged for everyone to cruise on the Ganges in two barges.

[...] Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in September 2002, Vieira was sent off for a late tackle on Gianfranco Zola; Arsenal's persistence nevertheless earnt them a point.

2500|$|Peter {{claims that}} the reason <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> {{successful}} on the badminton court was because of his studies of Bushido, an ancient Japanese philosophy and his mentor, Miyamoto Musashi, a great samurai. Miyamoto Musashi began his “warrior’s pilgrimage” at age 13 {{when he began to}} train as a swordsmen and as a practicing Bushido Warrior. Legend claims that he killed his first opponent at age 14 in one of the 60 duels he fought over his lifetime. It is said that he was never defeated, both in single combat and during the 6 wars, in which he took part. At age 35, Musashi sheathed his sword to become a mentor, an artist and finally a writer, who penned one of Japan’s most influential pieces of literature – “The Book of the Five Rings.” Rasmussen had to face the fact of losing before he can entertain the thought of winning. Peter proved that his philosophy of playing badminton was very successful.

2500|$|Australian {{hopes that}} they could set England a good target {{received}} an immediate double blow as Alec Bedser sent Morris and Burke straight back to the pavilion. Lindsay Hassett and Neil Harvey salvaged a stand of 81 from the wreckage of 6/2, with Harvey swashbuckling his way to 52 in what Bill O'Reilly thought was his best innings of the series. He was torpedoed by a shooter from Doug Wright (3/56) and Freddie Brown (1/32) caught and bowled Keith Miller for a duck to leave them 89/4. Hassett found another partner in Graeme Hole and saw out the day at 129/4, but was skittled {{in the morning for}} 48 – Doug Wright's 100th test wicket – when a leg-spinner zipped one past his bat and toppled his off-stump. Wright finally showed <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> feared on the county circuit when Ian Johnson lofted a googly to Brown at mid-off. Australia were now 142/6, a mere 39 runs ahead, but Hole stood steady for three hours making 63 until he was bowled by Trevor Bailey (1/32). Brown figured that if anybody deserved some easy wickets it was Bedser and the big Surrey bowler removed Lindwall, Johnston and Iverson for five runs and ending his superb tour with 5/59, [...] 10/105 in the match. His 30 wickets (16.06) was the most by an English bowler in Australia since Harold Larwood's 33 wickets (19.51) in 1932–33.|$|E

[...] Inspired by their experiences working on sit-coms, the writers also looked to create [...] "a network of strong characters" [...] to surround Parker with in the film. In October 2015, Watts said he was looking to make the film a coming-of-age story to see the growth of Parker, citing Say Anything..., Almost Famous, and Can't Buy Me Love as some of his favorite films in that genre. It was this aspect of the film that had initially got Watts interested in directing it, as he had already been looking to make a coming-of-age story when he heard that the new Spider-Man would be younger than previous incarnations. Watts re-read the original Spider-Man comics in preparation for the film, and [...] "came to a new realization about <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> popular originally: He gave a different perspective on this world that they were building.
