The standard of living is on the rise, with incomes {{among the highest in}} the Midwest, but median household income among minorities is below that of whites by over $17,000. Regionally, home ownership among minority residents is half that of whites though Asian home ownership has doubled. In 2000, the poverty rate for whites was 4.2%; for blacks it was 26.2%; for Asians, 19.1%; Native Americans, 23.2%; and Hispanics, 18.1%.|$|E
5|$|He later {{published}} {{two articles}} in the National Urban League's journal, , that discussed the difficulties faced by African-American mineworkers. His work in this field also addressed his concern about blacks and their <b>white</b> <b>counterparts.</b> Harris examined race prejudice of blacks by white workers. Meanwhile, Harris taught at West Virginia State University, a small historically black public college in Institute, West Virginia. During this year, he began a long and sustaining friendship with V. F. Calverton. He taught for a year, before he shifted directions and took the position {{as director of the}} Minneapolis Urban League. As director, he prepared a detailed report titled The Negro Population in Minneapolis: A Study of Race Relations dealing with the living conditions of African Americans in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Harris described the physical and socio-economic conditions of African Americans in Minneapolis in 1926.|$|E
5|$|St. Louis {{suffered}} {{as much or}} more than comparable cities {{in the early years of}} the Great Depression. Manufacturing output fell by 57 percent between 1929 and 1933, slightly more than the national average of 55 percent, and output remained low until World War II. Unemployment during the Depression was high in most urban areas, and St. Louis was no exception (see table). Black workers in St. Louis, as in many cities, suffered significantly higher unemployment than their <b>white</b> <b>counterparts.</b> To aid the unemployed, the city allocated funds starting in 1930 toward relief operations. In addition to city relief aid, New Deal programs such as the Public Works Administration employed thousands of St. Louisans. Civic improvement construction jobs also reduced the number of persons on direct relief aid by the late 1930s.|$|E
50|$|African Americans and Hispanics, {{compared}} to their <b>white</b> <b>counterpart,</b> experience a greater difference in income, education, and occupation levels. On the other hand, Asians experience a lesser {{difference in terms of}} income, education, and occupation levels when {{compared to}} their <b>white</b> <b>counterpart.</b> These factors, education and occupation, influence income and purchasing power of an individual. For African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics, higher income resulted in less segregation from their <b>white</b> <b>counterpart</b> whereas lower income resulted in greater segregation from their <b>white</b> <b>counterpart.</b> However, that an increase in socioeconomic status resulted in a greater decrease in segregation for Hispanics and Asians and a lesser decrease in segregation for African Americans suggests that socioeconomic status alone cannot explain residential segregation.|$|R

25|$|In 1965, the UIL {{agreed to}} admit PVIL member schools for competition. Black schools began UIL {{competitions}} {{beginning in the}} 1967-68 school year.

25|$|Along {{with the}} {{socioeconomic}} factor of health disparities, race is another key factor. The United States historically had large disparities {{in health and}} access to adequate healthcare between races, and current evidence supports the notion that these racially centered disparities continue to exist and are a significant social health issue. The disparities in access to adequate healthcare include differences {{in the quality of}} care based on race and overall insurance coverage based on race. A 2002 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association identifies race as a significant determinant in the level of quality of care, with blacks receiving lower quality care than their <b>white</b> <b>counterparts.</b> This is in part because members of ethnic minorities such as African Americans are either earning low incomes, or living below the poverty line. In a 2007 Census Bureau, African American families made an average of $33,916, while their <b>white</b> <b>counterparts</b> made an average of $54,920. Due to a lack of affordable health care, the African American death rate reveals that African Americans have a higher rate of dying from treatable or preventable causes. According to a study conducted in 2005 by the Office of Minority Health—a U.S. Department of Health—African American men were 30% more likely than white men to die from heart disease. Also African American women were 34% more likely to die from breast cancer than their <b>white</b> <b>counterparts.</b>|$|E
25|$|Residential {{segregation}} by {{race and}} economic class prevent low-skilled workers, especially minorities, from moving closer to suburban jobs. Female minority householders {{are twice as likely}} as their <b>white</b> <b>counterparts</b> to live in central cities. As more businesses have retreated to suburban areas, the inner-city, where most low-income minorities reside, often face a decline in employment opportunities.|$|E
50|$|A similar gambit can {{be tried}} by Black: after 4.g3, Black can play 4...Nxe4!? This line is arguably sounder than its <b>White</b> <b>counterpart</b> because <b>White's</b> 4.g3 has {{weakened}} his f3-square. Moreover, White cannot play the line recommended by Kaufman with colors reversed, because 5.Nxe4 d5 6.Nc3 d4 7.Bb5? dxc3 8.Nxe5? Qd5 9.Qe2? loses to 9...Qxh1+. However, with the pawn on g3, Nh4 {{is possible and}} it should be easier to castle.|$|R
2500|$|The new Park enjoyed instant popularity. For a time, county {{government}} honored the [...] "separate but equal" [...] status of Virginia Key Beach with its <b>white</b> <b>counterpart,</b> Crandon Park on Key Biscayne. The original temporary buildings {{were replaced by}} permanent construction, a miniature railroad carried beachgoers around the park, and a seaside merry-go-round whirled riders of all ages. Still, Crandon Park was over [...] with two miles (3km) of beachfront and Virginia Key [...] with a half-mile of beach.|$|R
5000|$|The {{beginnings}} of desegregation can be correlated {{to the decline}} in Bay Shore's popularity. This parallel is evident with other historically [...] "black", [...] "negro", or [...] "colored" [...] beaches around the nation such as American Beach of Florida, and Bruce Beach of Los Angeles (Manhattan Beach). Bay Shore beach ceased to exist by the early 1970s. Buckroe Beach, its <b>white</b> <b>counterpart,</b> continues to exist although its golden era ended with the upstart of Virginia Beach located {{in the city of}} Virginia Beach, Virginia. Currently, the property that was once Bay Shore Beach has been privately developed. To various degrees at developers.|$|R

25|$|Set in 1959, Coach Jackson (Terrence Howard) is lecturing his all-black {{basketball}} team before their first game against an all-white team. Worried about losing the game, the timid players are lectured by the coach about their superiority {{in the sport}} over their <b>white</b> <b>counterparts,</b> which he expresses vulgarly. When the game ensues, the all-white team loses miserably yet rejoices in a single point they earn.|$|E
25|$|The black soldier became another stock type {{during the}} Civil War and merged {{qualities of the}} slave and the dandy. He was {{acknowledged}} for playing some role in the war, but he was more frequently lampooned for bumbling through his drills or for thinking his uniform made him the equal of his <b>white</b> <b>counterparts.</b> He was usually better at retreating than fighting, and, like the dandy, he preferred partying to serious pursuits. Still, his introduction allowed for some return to themes of {{the breakup of the}} plantation family.|$|E
40|$|Existing work {{suggests}} that black-white gaps in potential wages are much larger among {{men than women}} and further that black-white differences in patterns of female labor supply are unimportant. However, panel data on wages and income sources demonstrate that the modal young black woman who does not engage in market work is a single mother receiving government aid whereas her <b>white</b> <b>counterpart</b> is a married mother receiving support from a working spouse. The median black-white gap in log potential wages among young adult women in 1990 was likely at least 60 percent larger than the gap implied by reported earnings and hours worked in the Current Populations Surveys. ...|$|R
40|$|In the U.

We show that a model combining employer taste-based discrimination, search frictions and skill complementarities can replicate these regularities, and estimate it {{using data from the}} U. S. manufacturing sector. We find that discrimination is quantitatively important to understand differences in wages and job finding rates across workers with low education levels, whereas skill differences are the main driver of those differences among workers with high education levels...|$|R

25|$|In December 1960, Edward Paget ordained Tutu as an Anglican {{minister}} at St Mary's Cathedral. Tutu was then appointed assistant curate in St Alban's Parish, Benoni, {{where he was}} reunited {{with his wife and}} children; they lived in a converted garage. He earned 72.50 rand a month, which was two-thirds of what his <b>white</b> <b>counterparts</b> were given. In 1962, Tutu was transferred to St Philip's Church in Thokoza, where he was placed in charge of the congregation and developed a passion for pastoral ministry. Many in South Africa's white-dominated Anglican establishment felt the need for a greater number of indigenous Africans in positions of ecclesiastical authority; to assist in this, Aelfred Stubbs proposed that Tutu be trained as a theology teacher at King's College London (KCL) in Britain. Funding was secured from the International Missionary Council's Theological Education Fund (TEF), and the government agreed to give the Tutus permission to move to Britain.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, {{numerous}} {{school districts}} in Kent and Sussex Counties, including Ellendale, continued to fight against desegregation after the ruling of Brown v. Board of Education. The protests which begin at the Milford School District, eventually bringing about a lawsuit {{that went to the}} Delaware Supreme Court which ruled that while segregation was unconstitutional, it did not require immediate desegregation. This was further bolstered by the findings of Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County. Bryant Bowles, President of the National Association for the Advancement of White People led several anti-desegregation rallies and boycotts in the area, including Ellendale, that resulted in decreased attendance at the schools. Ellendale School 125 and Ellendale Colored School 195C reached an agreement on consolidation, but attorney Louis L. Redding complained to the Department of Public Instruction that black teachers were being subjected to scrutiny that their <b>white</b> <b>counterparts</b> were not. After desegregation, all students were educated at Ellendale School 125.|$|E
500|$|The {{mobilisation}} {{of white}} British South Africa Police officers {{for military service}} led to black male and white female constables taking on higher responsibilities. The BSAP recruited more black patrolmen to accommodate {{the growth of the}} urban black population during the war, going from 1,067 black and 547 white personnel in 1937 to 1,572 blacks and 401 whites in 1945. This [...] "Africanisation" [...] led to higher appreciation for black constables among senior policemen and the public. The police remained rigidly segregated, but black constables received uniforms more similar to those of their <b>white</b> <b>counterparts,</b> and the nominal distinction between the BSAP [...] "proper" [...] and the British South Africa Native Police—the [...] "force within the force" [...] black personnel were traditionally regarded as members of—was abolished.|$|E
30|$|Other {{demographic}} {{differences may}} also be related to completion behaviour.

30|$|Accounting for {{shrinking}} grade variances {{and course}} selection also explains the convergence in grades {{for a group}} where we would expect catch up to not occur: legacies. Legacies at Duke start out behind their <b>white</b> non-legacy <b>counterparts</b> (though not {{as far back as}} blacks) with 65 % of the gape removed {{by the end of the}} senior year. Similar major-switching patterns occur for legacies as well, with large shifts away from the natural sciences, engineering, and economics towards humanities and social sciences. The different grading standards across courses legacies and blacks take, coupled with the tighter variances on the grade distributions of upper year courses, accounts for their catch up to their <b>white</b> non-legacy <b>counterparts.</b>|$|R
500|$|From {{the mid-1960s}} on, Waldron {{spent a lot}} of time in Europe: Paris, Rome, Bologna, and Cologne, before moving {{permanently}} to Munich in 1967. Waldron originally moved to France when film director Marcel Carné asked him if he wanted to compose the score for Three Rooms in Manhattan in New York or Paris; Waldron's 1958 experience touring Europe with Holiday made the decision an easy one. Waldron's stated reasons for settling in Europe were his disgust with the [...] "fierce, cutthroat competition, just to get a job" [...] and the fact that black musicians were paid less than their <b>white</b> <b>counterparts</b> in the U.S. The 1965 score for Three Rooms in Manhattan was followed by one for the American film Sweet Love, Bitter in 1967. Waldron also composed for theater (Amiri Baraka's The Slave and Dutchman), television, and short films. In Europe around this time he played with other expatriates, including Ben Webster and Kenny Clarke.|$|E
500|$|Throughout her career, Ayola {{has been}} outspoken {{on the subject}} of racial {{discrimination}} in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their <b>white</b> <b>counterparts,</b> explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] They are not being sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end." [...] In 2008, Ayola offered her support to the [...] campaign Dignity!
