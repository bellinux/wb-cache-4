25|$|The most {{remarkable}} common {{god of the}} Berbers and the Egyptians was Ammon. This god is hard to attribute to only one pantheon. Although most modern sources ignore the existence of Ammon in Berber mythology, he <b>was</b> <b>maybe</b> the greatest ancient Berber god. He was honored by the Ancient Greeks in Cyrenaica, and was united with the Phoenician god Baal due to Libyan influence. Early depictions of rams (related possibly to an early form of the cult of this deity) across North Africa have been dated to between 9600 BC and 7500 BC.|$|E
25|$|Ron Meyer’s {{recruiting}} {{strategy was}} very aggressive. He pursued and attracted the finest football players {{from all of}} Texas. Not all of his players were acquired the ethical way, however; his recruiting staff was paying recruits, and Meyer was letting it slide. According to Steve Endicott the first payments came at Kashmere High School in Houston, Texas. “... It was Ron, Myself, Rob (Robin Buddecke, Endicott’s assistant), and maybe another coach...I can’t pin it down it <b>was</b> <b>maybe</b> twenty or fifty bucks {{or something like that}} we gave”. the Kashmere football players would call the SMU recruiters “Santa Claus”. The little payments of 20 dollars turned into 500 dollars, Buddecke was said to have handed out 100-dollar bills to recruits when meeting them at airports.|$|E

25|$|In the {{inscription}} {{on the base}} of the statue he dedicated to his father-in-law, Quintus Fabius Memmius Symmachus calls Flavianus historicus disertissimus. In fact, Flavianus wrote a history of Rome entitled Annales ("Annals"), now lost; it was dedicated to Theodosius (probably when Flavianus was quaestor sacri palatii in the 380s) and written in annalist form. As the title suggests, {{it might have been a}} continuation of the Annals by Tacitus: in fact, in the often unreliable Historia Augusta, inside the book devoted to the life of the Roman emperor Aurelian (270–275), it is included a letter from Aurelian to queen Zenobia that the author claims reported by a Nicomachus; it is therefore possible that Nicomachus' work was a continuation of Tacitus' until, at least, Aurelian. Flavianus' Annals <b>was</b> <b>maybe</b> used by Ammianus Marcellinus as a source.|$|E
25|$|Naturally {{the fight}} for the top spots means that the most {{significant}} rivalries are with the other Top 14 big guns, Toulouse and Biarritz Olympique. Stade Français {{has been seen as}} the rising threat by the all-powerful Toulousains who had won four consecutive titles (1994–97), before Paris won the next one. The clubs alternated for four years, winning two titles each until 2001, though they never met in the final. When they finally did, Stade Français walked over Toulouse for a victory (32–18) in 2003. Toulouse got their revenge in 2005, when they won a tight Heineken Cup final in overtime (18–12 a.e.t.) at Murrayfield. The clubs often fight it out in the press, but there have never been any real tensions on the pitch, largely because many players have been playing together for France. Regular season games are rarely spectacular. In October 2005, Toulouse was the guest for the first ever regular season match at the Stade de France, but coach Guy Novès chose to leave key regular starters at home, so the Stade Français 29–15 victory <b>was</b> <b>maybe</b> not as significant.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I <b>was</b> <b>maybe</b> 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

[...] Unlike other consulting firms, which issued recommendations and then departed, Bain & Company [...] immersed itself in a clients' businesses and worked with them until changes were implemented. Romney became a vice-president of the firm in 1978, working with such clients as the Monsanto Company, Outboard Marine Corporation, Burlington Industries, and Corning Incorporated. Within a few years, the firm considered him one of its best consultants. In fact, clients sometimes preferred to use him rather than more-senior partners.|$|E

Fake Train reviewer Ken Hawk said the album <b>was</b> <b>maybe</b> [...] "one of the best fusions of metallic hardcore and melodic punk-rock", continuing with how the band were able to [...] "spring back-and-forth between booming chugga mosh breakdowns, melodic guitar thrashing, and driving upbeat rock…flawlessly" [...] in an easy manner. Scene It All's Anson said the band [...] "finally succeeded in rightfully earning that title" [...] of [...] "bridg the gap between hardcore and emo".

[...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the best! Not terrible by any means, but it felt lacking in certain ways, particularly when it came to the total lack of Piz and Dick. Where were they? Also this episode made it clear that Logan didn't have all that much to do on the show anymore." ...|$|E

500|$|Julia Louis-Dreyfus {{expressed}} interest in the role, but ABC executives felt she was not right for the part. Actors originally considered for the role include Courteney Cox, Calista Flockhart, Heather Locklear, Mary-Louise Parker, and Sela Ward. Cherry wrote the part with Parker in mind, but she rejected the offer, later explaining [...] "it just didn’t feel like I was gonna [...] serve {{it as well as}} someone else might". Teri Hatcher auditioned for the role in January 2004 and impressed Cherry immediately. After a second audition, Hatcher read for the role in front of network executives. Cherry praised her performance, saying [...] "it was the best audition I've ever seen in network". Hatcher later commented, [...] "I don't think they were hot to hire me for Susan... I <b>was</b> <b>maybe</b> on a B-list, certainly not an A-list". Despite her reservations, Hatcher was the third reported cast member to have been cast in the series on February 18, 2004.|$|E
500|$|The film's story {{originated}} from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmaker's mind {{over a period}} of time starting as early as 1973. The first idea was only [...] "a feeling" [...] and the title Blue Velvet, Lynch told Cineaste in 1987. The second idea was an image of a severed, human ear lying in a field. [...] "I don't know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body, a hole into something else... The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect," [...] Lynch remarked in an interview. The third idea was Bobby Vinton's classic rendition of the song Blue Velvet and [...] "the mood that came with that song a mood, a time, and things that were of that time." [...] Lynch eventually spent two years writing two drafts, which, he stated, were not very good. The problem with them, Lynch has said, was that [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>maybe</b> all the unpleasantness in the film but nothing else. A lot was not there. And so it went away for a while." ...|$|E
500|$|... "She is enigmatic but I {{must tell}} you I never had a bad {{experience}} because of her enigma. What it was, she explained this once, is that she did this on purpose.

She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she <b>was</b> <b>maybe</b> a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I would go up to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial." ...|$|E
