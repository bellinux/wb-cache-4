5|$|Berg {{station has}} seen many {{accidents}} and almost-accidents. In 1965, a deadly accident occurred between Ullevål and Berg stations, when a train ran over a 33-year-old man {{walking in the}} tracks. In 2002, a 24-year-old man was {{run over by a}} metro train approaching the station. The man survived the accident with minor <b>wounds.</b> <b>In</b> 2008, a 21-year-old drunk man was found crawling around on the tracks between the platforms. The police removed him from the station and sent him home in a taxi.|$|E
5|$|Boosted by this spiritual experience, Afonso won {{the battle}} against an outnumbering enemy. Legend has it that Afonso killed the five Moorish kings of the Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, Évora and Beja taifas, before decimating the enemy troops. Hence, in {{gratitude}} to Jesus, he incorporated five shields arranged in a cross—representing his divine-led victory over the five enemy kings—with each one carrying Christ's five <b>wounds</b> <b>in</b> the form of silver bezants. The sum of all bezants (doubling {{the ones in the}} central shield) would give thirty, symbolizing Judas Iscariot's thirty pieces of silver.|$|E

50|$|Puncture and {{penetration}} {{are similar}} however a puncture {{is different from}} a penetration <b>wound</b> <b>in</b> {{that there is no}} exit <b>wound</b> <b>in</b> cases of puncture.

5|$|On 23 January 2010, Gorrostieta Salazar was {{attacked}} by armed men in Ciudad Altamirano, Guerrero, while returning from a local event with four other people. Severely injured by bullet <b>wounds</b> <b>in</b> the abdomen, chest, and leg, she {{was taken to a}} local hospital. Also injured were the driver of the vehicle, who was shot twice; Marbella Reyes Ortoño, head of the Institute of Women in Tiquicheo; and Fanny Almazán Gómez, a journalist from El Sol de Morelia. In addition to the bullet wounds, Gorrostieta Salazar suffered further injuries when the vehicle crashed after the shooting. Her wounds left her in constant pain and she had to use a colostomy bag, but she refused to resign her post as mayor. She publicly displayed her <b>wounds</b> <b>in</b> photographs published in an issue of Contacto Ciudadano magazine, and repeated her statement that she would continue her work.|$|E
5|$|One skull, {{assigned}} to Triceratops, was observed {{to have a}} hole in the jugal which appears to be a puncture wound that was sustained while this individual was still alive. This is supported by signs of healing that are present in the bone around the supposed wound. When examined closely, the hole in the bone has a diameter that is very similar to diameter of the distal end of a Triceratops horn. This, and other apparent healed <b>wounds</b> <b>in</b> the skulls of ceratopsians, has been cited as evidence of non-fatal intraspecific competition in these dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|President Mutharika {{was seen}} by some as {{increasingly}} autocratic and dismissive of human rights, and in July 2011 protests over high costs of living, devolving foreign relations, poor governance {{and a lack of}} foreign exchange reserves erupted. The protests left 18 people dead and at least 44 others suffering from gunshot <b>wounds.</b> <b>In</b> April 2012, Mutharika died of a heart attack; the presidential title was taken over by former Vice-President Joyce Banda.|$|E

5|$|After {{ten more}} days, the ships spotted an inlet close Champotón, and a landing party {{discovered}} fresh water. Armed Maya warriors approached from the city, and communication was attempted with signs. Night fell {{by the time}} the water casks had been filled and the attempts at communication concluded. By sunrise the Spanish had been surrounded by a sizeable army. The massed Maya warriors launched an assault and all of the Spanish party received <b>wounds</b> <b>in</b> the frantic melee that followed, including Hernández de Córdoba. The Spanish regrouped and forced passage to the shore, where their discipline collapsed and a frantic scramble for the boats ensued, leaving the Spanish vulnerable to the pursuing Maya warriors who waded into the sea behind them. By the end of the battle, the Spanish had lost over fifty men, more than half their number, and five more men died from their <b>wounds</b> <b>in</b> the following days. The battle had lasted only an hour. They were now far from help and low on supplies; too many men had been lost and injured to sail all three ships back to Cuba, so one was abandoned. The ship's pilot then steered a course for Cuba via Florida, and Hernández de Cordóba wrote a report to Governor Diego Velázquez describing the voyage and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hernández died soon after from his wounds.|$|E
5|$|Between 13 January and 3 April 1943, an {{estimated}} 500,000 Red Army soldiers {{took part in}} what {{was known as the}} Voronezh–Kharkov Offensive. In all, {{an estimated}} 6,100,000 Soviet soldiers were committed to the area, with another 659,000 out of action with <b>wounds.</b> <b>In</b> comparison, the Germans could account for 2,200,000 personnel on the Eastern Front, with another 100,000 deployed in Norway. As a result, the Red Army deployed around twice as many personnel as the Wehrmacht in early February. However, {{as a result of their}} over-extension and the casualties they had taken during their offensive, at the beginning of Manstein's counterattack the Germans could achieve a tactical superiority in numbers, including the number of tanks present—for example, Manstein's 350 tanks outnumbered Soviet armor almost seven to one at the point of contact, and were far better supplied with fuel.|$|E
5|$|Hart was {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel while recovering from his <b>wounds</b> <b>in</b> England. He returned to the Dardanelles in September 1915 as commander of the Wellington Battalion, Malone having been killed in action in early August during the Battle of Chunuk Bair. The battalion had been decimated during the battle but remained in the line manning positions at 'The Apex', a knoll near Chunuk Bair. Along {{with the rest of}} the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, the battalion was transferred to the Greek island of Lemnos on 14 September for a period of rest and recuperation while it was also being built up with reinforcements from New Zealand. While on Lemnos, Hart commanded the brigade for a 12-day period when its nominal commander, Brigadier General Francis Earl Johnston, was hospitalised.|$|E

5|$|Hit points (HP) are {{a measure}} of a character's {{vitality}} and health and {{are determined by the}} class, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains <b>wounds</b> <b>in</b> combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game. Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{corporal}} on 21 September, he {{was placed}} {{in charge of the}} battalion's stretcher bearers, whom he led during the battle north of Bullecourt on 30 September. Corey attended to the wounded while exposed to fire, and continued to direct other bearer parties throughout the action until wounded himself, receiving <b>wounds</b> <b>in</b> the right groin and thigh. It was during this engagement that he was awarded a third bar to his Military Medal. Evacuated to a casualty station, Corey was operated on before receiving a transfer to a general hospital at Le Havre. Operated on again, he was sent to a hospital in Bristol, England. Repatriated to Australia on 30 April 1919, he was medically discharged in June.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that his}} advance {{was going to}} be contested, Bowen {{requested}} reinforcements. Consequently, as an interim measure, 59men from Warrego and Yarra were landed under Lieutenant G.A. Hill, until infantry could arrive from Berrima, which was still steaming towards Kabakaul from Karavia Bay. Meanwhile, Bowen pushed on and the Australians were again fired upon by the well concealed Germans and their Melanesian troops, as well as by snipers in the treetops. By 09:30the situation had become grave, and the Australians suffered their first casualty of the war, with Able Seaman Billy Williams mortally wounded. Also among the casualties was the medical officer, Captain Brian Pockley, who died of his <b>wounds</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon after being evacuated to Berrima.|$|E

5|$|Reports on {{the number}} of killed and wounded aboard Chesapeake during the battle vary widely. Broke's after-action report from 6July states 70killed and 100wounded. Contemporary sources place the number between 48–61killed and 85–99wounded. Discrepancies in the number of killed and wounded are {{possibly}} caused by the addition of sailors who died of their <b>wounds</b> <b>in</b> the ensuing days after the battle. The counts for Shannon have fewer discrepancies with 23killed; 56wounded. Despite his serious injuries, Broke ordered repairs to both ships and they proceeded on to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Captain Lawrence died en route and was buried in Halifax with military honors. The British imprisoned his crew. Captain Broke survived his wounds and was later made a baronet.|$|E
5|$|Sing {{returned}} to Australia on submarine guard duty in late July 1918. An army medical report from 23 November 1918 {{noted that he}} had gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>in</b> the left shoulder, back, and left leg, and had suffered gas poisoning. The report stated that his general health was 'good' but that he complained of coughing upon exertion. It recognised that Sing's disability {{were the result of}} service, was permanent, and recommended that he be discharged as permanently unfit for service. Following his departure from the army, he briefly turned his hand to sheep farming, but the land he was given was of poor quality. He then worked as a gold miner.|$|E
5|$|Theophilos {{found himself}} {{isolated}} with his tagmata and the Kurds {{on the hill}} of Anzen. The Arabs proceeded to surround the hill, but the Byzantines were saved by a sudden rain, which loosened the strings of the Turkish bows, rendering them useless. Afshin then sent for catapults to be brought up to batter the Byzantine position. At the same time, Theophilos's officers, afraid of treachery by the Kurdish troops, persuaded him to withdraw. Breaking through the Arab lines and suffering many <b>wounds</b> <b>in</b> the process (the sources variously credit Manuel, who was severely wounded and possibly died soon after, and Theophobos for saving the Emperor), Theophilos and his small escort managed to reach safety at Chiliokomon, where he gradually re-assembled the remnants of his army.|$|E

5|$|When the Chinese forces, {{numbering}} up to 1,000 {{and threatening}} to cut supply lines to Semarang, arrived in Tanjung in April 1741, Visscher told the regent to deal with them; however, the regent's forces stalled, refusing to move until they received a tribute of high quality rice. After Yonko sent the rice, the regent's men went to Tanjung, stood with the rebels outside of their range, then fired and left. The rebels soon occupied a sugar mill there. In Grobogan, Mertopuro, armed with weapons from the Dutch military command, staged {{an attack on the}} Chinese rebels, in which the Javanese troops opened fire on the Chinese before the Dutch came.

5|$|An evil sorcerer named Zarok plotted to {{take over}} the kingdom of Gallowmere with his undead army. It is told in legend that the champion, Sir Daniel Fortesque, led the King of Gallowmere's army to victory and managed to kill Zarok before he succumbed to his mortal <b>wounds.</b> <b>In</b> reality however, Dan was in fact struck down by the first arrow fired in the battle, with the king {{choosing}} to cover it up and declare Dan a hero. Zarok, meanwhile, went into hiding. 100 years later, Zarok reappears, casting a spell over Gallowmere to awaken his undead army and steal the souls of the living. However, in the process, he unwittingly revives the corpse of Dan, who has over time become a skeletal corpse, missing his jaw and the eye he lost in the battle of Gallowmere. Having been unable to ascend to the Hall of Heroes, Dan uses this opportunity to defeat Zarok, save Gallowmere and earn his place as a true hero.|$|E
5|$|As Bellerophon slowly drifted away, she was sighted by the 74-gun , {{approaching}} the centre. It was by now about 9 pm; {{in the darkness}} Swiftsures captain, Benjamin Hallowell, was unable to identify the dismasted ship and presumed {{that she was a}} damaged French ship attempting to escape. He debated firing into her, but decided to hold fire and press on to the French centre, where he eventually came to anchor astern of Orient, close to Bellerophons original position. Darby had by this time recovered sufficiently to resume command, and at his order the battered Bellerophon came to anchor at the east end of the bay, and her crew began making repairs. The battle raged throughout the night, and eventually ended in a decisive victory for the British. The next five days were spent repairing the ship and burying the dead. 49 men were killed and 148 wounded on Bellerophon. Eight more died of their <b>wounds</b> <b>in</b> the following week.|$|E
