25|$|Back in Arendelle, Kristoff (Scott Michael Foster) {{is talking}} to Sven <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> Anna appears. The two embrace and share a kiss.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E
25|$|Finally, all the {{characters}} of the parade began to walk inside the pool, around its center, mixing {{the past and the}} present in a single marching beat of the drums. The confluence of {{the past and the present}} is another main theme of the opening ceremony. The music began a crescendo with choruses, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> an olive tree was lifted from the center of the pool - symbolizing goddess Athena's preferred gift by the Greeks - land and food - over Poseidon's gift, the horse - a tool of warfare. At the music's climax, all {{the characters}} stopped and raised their arms as if worshipping the Tree, which was high above, surrounded also by the fragments of the deconstructed statues who resembled a mount.|$|E
50|$|A magic {{system that}} is limited by <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> spell slots will give a spellcaster <b>a</b> certain number <b>of</b> spells per day that may be cast. These spells may be divided by level, or limited to certain types <b>of</b> spells. <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spellcaster's slots are used up, {{he or she is}} no longer able to perform magic until steps are taken (usually {{sleeping}} and re-studying the spells) to recover the spell slots.|$|R

2500|$|Peliculas de Mi Vida also by Alberto Fuguet [...] "is a {{novel about}} cinema and about how the movies that we see become part of who we are" [...] The main character, Beltrán Soler, is on a plane ride home <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> fifty films that were greatly {{influential}} to him in adolescence and childhood come to his mind. [...] He reconstructs his history with memories of the movies and the events and people surrounding the cinema and realizes how much these films have come to impact who he is.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example of}} Verfremdungseffekt {{in the music}} is in the [...] "Alabama Song". This time, instead of the music {{sounding}} deeply disturbing compared to the stage action, it is the reverse. When the [...] "Alabama Song" [...] first appears, the {{women are going to}} Mahagonny. The second time the song appears is {{near the end of the}} opera, after Jimmy has been executed. Mahagonny is in decline, and there are street protests. The entire stage is singing about how rotten the world and man are, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> Jenny and the prostitutes come walking through singing the [...] "Alabama Song", a total departure from the previous mood. What is more, they are carrying Jimmy's corpse through the stage. The music refuses to set and keep the audience in a particular mood, and the conflict between the lighthearted [...] "Alabama Song" [...] and the imagery of the funeral procession is confusing. This tension serves to distance the audience from the action, even at an exceptionally powerful moment of the opera, giving the audience one last chance to digest all the contradictions and perversions of Mahagonny.|$|E

50|$|Beginning at dealer's left, players {{take turns}} drawing single cards {{from either the}} stock or discard piles. The drawn card may either be swapped for one of that player's 6 cards, or discarded. If the card is swapped {{for one of the}} face down cards, the card swapped in remains face up. If the card drawn is discarded, the player can then either flip a card or choose to make no move. The round ends <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> player's cards are face-up. Remaining players then have one turn to draw a card to improve their hands and then scores are totaled and {{recorded}} on a running score sheet.|$|R

30|$|The {{indicator}} value method (IndVal) {{was used}} to detect how strongly each species discriminated between Ri and TD groups.

2500|$|<b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> player's {{checkers}} {{are in that}} player's home board, that player {{may start}} removing them; this is called [...] "bearing off". <b>A</b> roll <b>of</b> 1 {{may be used to}} bear off a checker from the 1-point, a 2 from the 2-point, and so on. If <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> player's checkers are on points lower than the number showing on a particular die, the player may use that die to bear off one checker from the highest occupied point. For example, if a player rolls a 6 and a 5, but has no checkers on the 6-point and two on the 5-point, then the 6 and the 5 must be used to bear off the two checkers from the 5-point. When bearing off, a player may also move a lower die roll before the higher even if that means the full value of the higher die is not fully utilized. For example, if a player has exactly one checker remaining on the 6-point, and rolls a 6 and a 1, the player may move the 6-point checker one place to the 5-point with the lower die roll of 1, and then bear that checker off the 5-point using the die roll of 6; this is sometimes useful tactically. As before, if {{there is a way to}} use all moves showing on the dice, by moving checkers within the home board or bearing them off, the player must do so.|$|R

40|$|We propose in {{this paper}} a new public-key crypto-system, called the {{non-linear}} knapsack cryptosystem.

That is, an encrypted message can be decrypted only <b>when</b> <b>all</b> members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group agree to do so with their secret sub-keys. The secret sharing here is equivalent to access control, which establishes multiple identities. That is, when the verifier challenges the prover with encrypted messages with public sub-keys, the prover can prove multiple identities using the secret sub-keys. Some experimental results are given, which demonstrate the efficiency of our system...|$|R
