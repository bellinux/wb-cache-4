The highest wet-to-dry strength ratio of 35 % was obtained at 10 mg/g; above this addition level wet strength dropped slightly and then remained constant. The repulpability of strengthened paper was correlated directly with wet strength. The effect of electrolyte on <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> was also quantified by varying sodium chloride and calcium chloride concentration in the furnish stock.

By the addition of N-Cl-A-PAM (0. 5 % on pulp) containing 10 molar% of carboxyl groups at pH 4. 5, the dry tensile strength of formed sheets was increased {{at the level of}} 37 %, and <b>wet</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> was 12. 5 times larger than those of the blank sheets. N-Cl-A-PAM were much more effective on the improvement of paper strength than A-PAM. The content of carboxyl groups in N-Cl-A-PAM greatly influenced their effectiveness. The N-Cl-A-PAM with 10 molar% of carboxyl groups gave the maximum improvement of paper strength at pH 4. 5, while the N-Cl-A-PAM containing 5 % of carboxyl groups was the most effective at pH 7. 5. The higher the retention of N-Cl-A-PAM were, the larger the improvement of paper strength by the N-Cl-A-PAM were. It was suggested that the formation of ester bonds between hydroxyl groups on fibers and N-Cl groups of the N-Cl-A-PAM under acidic conditions was the {{one of the main reasons}} for the increases of paper strength. Under alkaline conditions, the improvement of paper strength was attributed to the formation of network by N-Cl-A-PAM themselves. It is found that improvement of <b>wet</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> by N-Cl groups of N-Cl-A-PAM decreased as the content of -COOH increased. This is explained by the decrease in reactivity of N-Cl group which connects with carboxylic group through neiboring group participation.

40|$|Various {{strength}} properties of paper are measured {{to tell how}} well it resists breaks in a paper machine or in printing presses. The most often measured properties are dry <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and dry tear strength. However, in many situations where paper breaks, it is not dry. For example, in web breaks after the wet pressing the dry matter content can be around 45 %. Thus, wet-web strength is often a more critical paper property than dry strength. Both wet and dry {{strength properties}} of the samples were measured with a L&W tensile tester. Originally this device was not designed for the measurement of the <b>wet</b> web <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> thus a new procedure to handle the wet samples was developed. The method was tested with Pine Kraft (never dried). The effect of different strength additives on the wet-web and dry paper <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> was studied. The polymers used in this experiment were aqueous solution of a cationic polyamidoamine-epichlorohydrin resin (PAE), cationic hydrophilised polyisocyanate and cationic polyvinylamine (PVAm). From all three used chemicals only Cationic PAE considerably increased the wet web strength. However it was noticed that at constant solids content all chemicals decreased the <b>wet</b> web <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> So, since all chemicals enhanced solid content {{it can be concluded}} that they work as drainage aids, not as wet web strength additives.

The tests were conducted on three industrially manufactured board specimens measuring 7. 8 mm, 11. 8 mm, 13 mm, 14. 8 mm and 22 mm thick supplied by Kronospan GmbH in Sandebeck, Germany. With few exceptions the tests resulted in relatively low wet strength values {{in spite of a}} high level of dry tensile strength perpencular to surface. This was due to microstructural damage with cracking, which was caused during the test-in-duced water absorption process but does not arise in practice. Such test-induced microstructural damage did not occur, however, when the specimens were first subjected to vacuum pretreatment in order to accelerate the saturation process. The strength values were then found to be up to 3 times higher. It is thus proposed to always conduct these tests with advance vacuum pretreatment. Temperature and moisture have the same effect on the stability of the gluing when vacuum pretreatment is performed. In the test of moisture resistance in accordance with the European standard for MDF the specimen is stored in the hot water without a yoke being glued on first. In this case there were no signs of microstructural damage with cracking. Advance vacuum pretreatment resulted in a relatively small increase of the strength values.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to identify the effects of different factors on the tension and tension relaxation of wet paper web after high-speed straining. The study was motivated by the plausible connection between wet web mechanical properties and wet web runnability on paper machines shown by previous studies. The mechanical properties of wet paper were examined using a fast tensile test rig with a strain rate of 1000 %/s. Most of the tests were carried out with laboratory handsheets, but samples from a pilot paper machine were also used. The tension relaxation of paper was evaluated as the tension remaining after 0. 475 s of relaxation (residual tension). The tensile and relaxation properties of wet webs {{were found to be}} strongly dependent on the quality and amount of fines. With low fines content, the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and residual tension of wet paper was mainly determined by the mechanical interactions between fibres at their contact points. As the fines strengthen the mechanical interaction in the network, the fibre properties also become important. Fibre deformations caused by the mechanical treatment of pulp were shown to reduce the mechanical properties of both dry and wet paper. However, the effect was significantly higher for wet paper. An increase of filler content from 10 % to 25 % greatly reduced the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of dry paper, but did not significantly impair <b>wet</b> web <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> or residual tension. Increased filler content in wet web was shown to increase the dryness of the wet web after the press section, which partly compensates for the reduction of fibrous material in the web. It is also presumable that fillers increase entanglement friction between fibres, which is beneficial for wet web strength. Different contaminants present in white water during sheet formation resulted in lowered surface tension and increased dryness after wet pressing. The addition of different contaminants reduced the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of the dry paper. The reduction of dry paper <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> could not be explained by the reduced surface tension, but rather on the tendency of different contaminants to interfere with the inter-fibre bonding. Additionally, wet web strength was not affected by the changes in the surface tension of white water or possible changes in the hydrophilicity of fibres caused by the addition of different contaminants. The spraying of different polymers on wet paper before wet pressing had a significant effect on both dry and <b>wet</b> web <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> whereas <b>wet</b> web elastic modulus and residual tension were basically not affected. We suggest that the increase of dry and wet paper strength could be affected by the molecular level interactions between these chemicals and fibres. The most significant increases in dry and wet paper strength were achieved with a dual application of anionic and cationic polymers. Furthermore, selectively adding papermaking chemicals to different fibre fractions (as opposed to adding chemicals to the whole pulp) improved the wet web mechanical properties and the drainage of the pulp suspension...|$|R

Cellulose nanofibrils possessing 0. 6 mmol/g carboxyl groups and a degree of polymerisation (DP) of ca. 550 were found to promote filler flocculation and retention in the fibre mat, whereas the same amount (3 wt%) of CNF having 1. 5 mmol/g of carboxyl groups, a DP of ca. 200 and a similar mean diameter exhibited the opposite effect. These results were interpreted {{with the help of}} flocculation studies of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) in the presence of CNF carried out by laser diffraction spectrometry. In addition, the mechanical and structural properties of the handsheets were analysed, revealing that the less charged CNF led to more closed matrices and, even increasing the filler retention, had a positive role on the tensile strength. A bonding mechanism among eucalypt fibres, PCC, CNF and a linear cationic polyacrylamide is proposed, consistent with the flocculation, retention and paper strength and structural property results. It is concluded that, to be used in papermaking, the CNF must not have a high charge (or a small length) to be able to flocculate the filler particles and, at the same time, to increase the filler-to-cellulosic fibres bonding. A complementary study on the wet-web resistance of handsheets produced with the less charged CNF was conducted for moisture contents between 10 and 70 %, showing that these CNF can significantly improve the handsheet <b>wet</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> (nearly 100 %) even for water contents above 50 %.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this master’ thesis was to develop techniques for recycled fiber pre-treatments {{in order to produce}} both continuous cellulosic filaments as well as other nanocellulose structures. This exploratory work, therefore, investigated the properties of these materials in applications such as technical filaments and strength enhancers for use in papermaking, respectively. Recycled fibers obtained from old cardboard was chemically pre-treated by either TEMPO oxidation or carboxymethylation and subsequently disintegrated into cellulose nanofibrils by using both homogenization and microfluidization. The surface hydroxyl groups (-OH) of the recycled, cellulosic fibers were successfully converted to carboxylic (-COOH) groups to different extent. The presence of carboxylic functional groups was confirmed by FTIR and conductometric titration. Homogenization and microfluidization were used in order to deconstruct the pretreated cellulosic fibers into small fibrils. The carboxymethylated fibers required higher mechanical energy than the TEMPO-oxidized ones. This was explained by the lower carboxylic group content introduced onto the fiber surface in the former system. The cellulose nanofibrils were examined via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and their size was assessed by the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The nanofibrils were found to be 10 - 50 nm in width and several microns in length. From these efforts, it was concluded that nanofibrils can be obtained relatively easily from recycled fibers. Two potential applications of the isolated cellulosic nanofibrils were addressed in this thesis. First, the production of continuous filaments by wet spinning and, secondly, the development of fibrils for deployment as additives for enhancing the mechanical strength of paper by addi-tion in the wet-end. The filaments produced from cellulosic nanofibrils from recycled cardboard displayed slightly lower tensile strength compared to those from cellulose nanofibrils obtained from bleached virgin fibers. The addition 0 f a co-adjuvant to the fibril hydrogel dope, namely, poly vinylalcohol, improved the dry and <b>wet</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> properties of the filaments. More remarkably, however, was our finding in relation to paper strength enhance-ment: a significant improvement in mechanical strength (tensile strength, stiffness, and TEA) was observed upon addition of the nanofibrils to fibrt disperions followed by drainage and drying.

Mechanical and physical properties including tensile properties, initial modulus, length, mass and diameter of brown and white coir fibre obtained from Kurunegala District have been used in the evaluation. Moisture absorption characteristics of coir fibres were also evaluated.

At different NaOH concentrations and different time periods at 25 °C, coir fibres were immersed in alkaline medium to find out whether the strength was affected. After 30 min in 10 % NaOH brown coir showed highest strength but white coir fibre showed highest strength in 25 % NaOH concentration after 30 min immersion. It was attempted to apply the idealized staple fibre yarn model to coir yarns. For this purpose coir-yarn initial modulus was calculated using results of strength tests for coir fibres and coir yarns. Calculated initial modulus is greater than experimentally obtain results but deviate considerably from the actual situvation. The durability of coir fibres was investigated by immersing in distilled water, acid medium, alkaline medium and saline solution at ambient temperature {{over a period of time}} and the results showed that brown coir fibre and white coir fibre had similar losses in strength in acidic medium after 3 months. White coir fibre lost strength significantly after 3 months in distilled water (pH= 5. 89) treatment. But both coir fibres do not lose strength significantly during 3 months time in alkaline medium or saline water. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis of selected treated coir fibres was carried out to investigate the effect on surface structure of fibres. This analysis explained the results of tensile strength tests between brown and white coir fibres and untreated and treated conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The hydroxyapatite/collagen (HAp/Col) {{nanocomposite}} membrane {{was prepared}} from the HAp/Col nanocomposite fibers. The HAp/Col membrane crosslinked by a vacuum heating showed 14 ± 2 (dry) and 1. 0 ± 0. 1 (<b>wet)</b> MPa in <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> that were enough strength {{to operate in}} both cell culture and surgical operations. Histological observation and total DNA amount analysis demonstrated that human osteoblastic cells, MG 63, derived from osteosarcoma on the HAp/Col membrane adhered and proliferated well as {{the same as those}} on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). Real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that alkaline phosphatase gene expression on the HAp/Col membrane was 1. 4 times greater than that on TCPS. These results suggested that the HAp/Col nanocomposite membrane can be utilized in bone tissue engineering scaffold as well as bone filler...|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cements (CPCs) {{are widely}} used in bone repair. Currently {{there are two main}} types of CPCs, brushite and apatite. The aim of this project was to evaluate the mechanical properties of particularly promising experimental brushite and apatite formulations in comparison to commercially available brushite- and apatite-based cements (chronOS™ Inject and Norian® SRS®, respectively), and in particular evaluate the diametral <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and biaxial flexural strength of these cements in both wet and dry conditions for the first time. The cements׳ porosity and their compressive, diametral tensile and biaxial flexural strength were tested in wet (or moist) and dry conditions. The surface morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Phase composition was assessed with X-ray diffraction. It was found that the novel experimental cements showed better mechanical properties than the commercially available cements, in all loading scenarios. The highest compressive strength (57. 2 ± 6. 5  MPa before drying and 69. 5 ± 6. 0  MPa after drying) was found for the experimental brushite cement. This cement also showed the highest <b>wet</b> diametral <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> (10. 0 ± 0. 8  MPa) and wet biaxial flexural strength (30. 7 ± 1. 8  MPa). It was also the cement that presented the lowest porosity (approx. 12 %). The influence of water content was found to depend on cement type, with some cements showing higher mechanical properties after drying and some no difference after drying...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} {{oxidative}} bleaching and mechanical dispersion in different conditions on the optical and mechanical properties of deinked recycled pulp was investigated. Industrial deinked pulp was treated in the different conditions, including dispersion, combined oxidative bleaching during dispersion, and separate dispersion and then oxidative bleaching. Handsheet papers were made from obtained pulps and then scanned and taken photos were analyzed by Digimizer software, version 4. 1. 1. 0 to analysis spot content. Optical and mechanical properties of obtained handsheets were determined and compared. Results indicated that mechanical dispersion decreased spot content and brightness and increased yellowing of the handsheets. Moreover, mechanical dispersion increased dry and <b>wet</b> <b>tensile</b> and burst <b>strengths,</b> water retention value (WRV), ash content and decreased tear strength of handsheet papers. This study revealed that combined dispersing and oxidative bleaching of de-inked pulp provided superior results in comparison to the separate dispersing and oxidative bleaching...|$|R
40|$|More than 20 {{bentonite}} deposits crop out on {{the islands}} of Milos, Kimolos and Chios, Aegean Sea, Greece {{many of which are}} currently under exploitation. The bentonite deposits have been formed at the expense of volcaniclastic rocks, probably pyroclastic flows in the majority of the deposits, under subaqueous conditions. The presence of abundant authigenic K-feldspar in most deposits suggests that alteration was diagenetic and took place at very low temperatures. Alteration of the glass involves mobilization of alkalis, and uptake of Mg and S. Al and Ti are essentially immobile while the behaviour of Si and Ca is controlled by both the nature of the parent rock and the composition of smectite. Fe displays small scale migration controlled by the prevailing redox conditions. Zr, Nb, Cr, Ni, V and the LREE are essentially immobile, while Ba, Sr, Rb, Zn, Y and the HREE are mobile. The behaviour of Th is controlled by the phase which hosts the LREE. The mobility of chemical elements has caused variation in the chemistry of the microenvironment in which smectites formed, resulting in large variations in the chemistry of smectites. Smectites might have been formed through an Ostwald Ripening-like process affecting the pore fluid chemistry and thus the chemistry of other phases like zeolites. Beidellites coexist with Cheto- but not with Wyoming-type montmorillonites. The crystal chemistry of smectites is affected {{by the nature of the}} parent rock, but the conditions prevailing during alteration might modify this "inherited" factor, as indicated by 1000 EPMA microanalyses which complement XRF, XRD, IR, DTA/TG, SEM, TEM and HRTEM data. Almost all deposits have been affected by a later hydrothermal alteration which has effectively "diluted" the original smectite content either by conversion of smectite to illite/smectite, kaolinite/halloysite and/or alunite or by precipitation of new phases (carbonates, phosphates, sulphides). Illitization of smectite probably proceeds by an Ostwald ripening-like mechanism characterized by low supersaturation conditions. The Greek bentonites have good swelling properties after Na-activation, and cation exchange capacity which ranges from 40 to 105 meq/ 100 gr. These properties are closely related in bentonites containing smectites with similar crystal chemistry. The bentonites with low CEC contain abundant opal-CT. The rheological properties vary and are probably related with the degree of disaggregation of the smectite tactoids. Low grade bentonites might be suitable for the drilling industry. Acid activation increased the surface area of the bentonites up to 5 times and rendered them suitable for decolourization of crude edible oils. However, the maximum bleaching efficiency is not associated with maximum surface area. Mg-smectites are activated easier, but their decolourization properties deteriorate faster than Al-smectites. High grade Greek bentonites have foundry properties comparable to those of commercial products after Naactivation. This treatment increases the <b>wet</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> but its effect on the other foundry properties is unpredictable. The properties of the bentonites have been degraded by the superimposed hydrothermal alteration, in general, although in some cases limited kaolinization of smectite seems to have a positive effect on the rheological properties...|$|E
40|$|Cold in-place {{recycling}} (CIR) {{has become}} an attractive method for rehabilitating asphalt roads that have good subgrade support and are suffering distress related to non-structural aging and cracking of the pavement layer. Although CIR is widely used, its use could be expanded if its performance were more predictable. Transportation officials have observed roads that were recycled under similar circumstances perform very differently for no clear reason. Moreover, a rational mix design {{has not yet been}} developed, design assumptions regarding the structural support of the CIR layer remain empirical and conservative, and there is no clear understanding of the cause-effect relationships between the choices made during the design/construction process and the resulting performance. The objective of this project is to investigate these relationships, especially concerning the age of the recycled pavement, cumulative traffic volume, support conditions, aged engineering properties of the CIR materials, and road performance. Twenty-four CIR asphalt roads constructed in Iowa from 1986 to 2004 were studied: 18 were selected from a sample of roads studied in a previous research project (HR- 392), and 6 were selected from newer CIR projects constructed after 1999. This report describes the results of comprehensive field and laboratory testing for these CIR asphalt roads. The results indicate that the modulus of the CIR layer and the air voids of the CIR asphalt binder were the most important factors affecting CIR pavement performance for high-traffic roads. For low-traffic roads, the <b>wet</b> indirect <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> significantly affected pavement performance. The results of this research can help identify changes that should be made with regard to design, material selection, and construction in order to improve the performance and cost-effectiveness of future recycled roads...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} green method was {{presented}} to embed TiO 2 on regenerated cellulose membranes via cellulose dissolution-regeneration process. The physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the composite membranes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier- Transform Infrared (FTIR), ultraviolet (UV) - visible spectroscopy and tensile test. The results indicated that cotton linter has been converted from cellulose I to cellulose II after the regeneration process, while the TiO 2 nanoparticles embedded inside the membrane maintaining its original crystal structures. The TiO 2 composite membranes possessed high ability of water absorption with total pore volume ranged from 0. 45 ± 0. 01 to 0. 53 ± 0. 02 cm 3 /g. The elongation at break of the prepared membranes increased 29 % averagely from dry state to <b>wet</b> state. The <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of the membranes remained at a minimum value of 0. 50 ± 0. 03 MPa in wet state thus enabled the films to withstand in wet for {{long period of time}} under weak UV irradiation. The regenerated cellulose membranes with TiO 2 performed well in photocatalytic activity while exhibiting distinct absorption abilities. This study provides a potential application in energy-saving decomposition system in which the dye compound can be easily removed via two simultaneous pathways: Absorption and photocatalytic decomposition...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the physical properties of lyocell fibers spun from an isotropic cellulose spinning dope in N-methyl morpholine N-oxide (NMMO) monohydrate (IPS lyocell fibers). Wide angle x-ray diffraction (WAXD) experiments on the crimped fibers exhibit little difference in the crystal structure of IPS and Tencel lyocell fibers: both fibers reveal a cellulose II structure. However, the IPS lyocell fibers have a lower tensile modulus than Tencel by about 12. 5 %, although they have a similar <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> <b>Wetting</b> and subsequent drying shift the loss tangent values higher, which is more remarkable for the IPS lyocell fibers dried under tension. Further, the IPS lyocell fibers dried under tension have a sharper α-transition peak than the fibers dried without tension. The IPS lyocell fibers exhibit excellent <b>wet</b> <b>tensile</b> strength: 90 % of <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> is retained after wetting twice in distilled water. In addition, the IPS lyocell fibers show good chemical stability to acids and alkalis, except for an extremely strong alkali-pH 14. Mercerization of the IPS lyocell fibers in the buffer solution of pH 14 notably decreases the tensile modulus but increases elongation. close 111...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tensile</b> <b>strength</b> is an {{important}} parameter in rock mechanics and is amongst other things used as a criterion for initiation and propagation of fractures in hydraulic fracture modeling. The <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> are determined for three sedimentary rock types using the standard test method for direct <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> from American Society of the international association for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> testing was done on Castlegate sandstone, Mancos shale and Mons chalk. For Castlegate sandstone and Mons chalk two different specimen sizes, 1. 5 inches and 2 inches in diameter, were used to study the size effect on the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> results. Both rock types showed a clear size effect, but as the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of Castlegate sandstone decreased for increasing specimen size, the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of Mons chalk increased with increasing specimen size. Mancos shale specimens were tested with different inclination angles relative to the bedding plane to study the anisotropy effect. The <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> for shale varied greatly with the inclination angle and the largest <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> were seen for samples with a 45 ° inclination angle relative to the bedding. Resulting <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> for all rock types was compared to existing <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> calculated from the Brazilian <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> method.
