Van pulls up, {{a bunch of}} guys come out with a table, crates of records. They unscrew the base of the light pole, take their equipment, attach it to that, get the {{electricity}} – Boom! We got a concert right here in the schoolyard and it's this guy Kool Herc. And he's just standing with the turntable, and the guys were studying his hands. There are people dancing, but there's as many people standing, just watching what he's doing. That was my first introduction to in-the-street, hip hop DJing." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post {{wrote that}} [...] "The Brothers Grimm looks terrific, yet it remains {{essentially}} inert. You keep <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> happen, {{and after a}} while your mind wanders from the hollow frenzy up there with all its filigrees and fretwork." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle felt [...] "despite an appealing actor in each role, the entire cast comes across as repellent. Will and Jake Grimm are two guys in the woods, surrounded by computerized animals, putting audiences to sleep all over America." [...] Peter Travers, writing in Rolling Stone magazine, largely enjoyed The Brothers Grimm. He explained that [...] "if you're a Gilliam junkie, as I am, you go with it, even when the script loses its shaky hold on coherence." [...] Travers added, [...] "even when Gilliam flies off the rails, his images stick with you." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday called the film [...] "a great compound of rip-snorting Gothic fantasy and Python-esque dark comedy".|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, Zawinul co-founded Weather Report with saxophonist and Davis alumnus Wayne Shorter. Their {{first two}} years {{emphasized}} a relatively open, group improvisation format not dissimilar to what Miles Davis was doing in a more rock oriented format. However, Zawinul started making changes with their third album, Sweetnighter, stating that he was [...] "tired of <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> happen". Funk elements such as electric bass, wah-wah pedal, etc. began to be introduced to the band's sound. With their 4th album, Mysterious Traveller, the musical forms were now through-composed similar to classical music, and the combination of jazz harmonies with 1970s groove elements helped launch the band into its most commercially successful period.|$|E

5000|$|We'd go {{down there}} every day, pick up our {{instruments}} and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> happen. And {{we spent a lot}} of days just sitting there, staring at each other. We'd set a standard for ourselves and I guess we were trying to meet that. Nothing was happening, we got really depressed and we hit a wall. I was spiralling down.|$|R
50|$|Timeouts {{allow for}} more {{efficient}} usage of limited resources without requiring additional interaction from the agent {{interested in the}} goods that cause the consumption of these resources. The basic idea is that in situations where a system must <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> happen, rather than waiting indefinitely, the waiting will be aborted after the timeout period has elapsed. This {{is based on the}} assumption that further waiting is useless, and some other action is necessary.|$|R
60|$|GERALD. I'm <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>{{something}}</b> <b>to</b> happen. I {{should like}} something to happen--very much--very much indeed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exciting? How do {{you make}} that out? I sat in the bleachers all afternoon, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> break loose. Doesn't {{anything}} ever happen at cricket?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is so much}} at stake," [...] rejoined Ralph. [...] "I feel as if a fuse {{had been}} lighted, and I was just <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> explode." ...|$|E
5000|$|While GTK+ {{applications}} remain mainloop driven (cf. Glib event loop), {{meaning the}} application is idle inside this main loop {{most of the}} time and just <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> happen and then calls the appropriate subroutine when it does, GdkFrameClock adds an additional mechanism, that gives a [...] "pulse" [...] to the application. It tells the application when to update and repaint a window. The beat rate can be synchronized with the monitor refresh rate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Miss Grower, [...] "I've had {{my eye on}} her. She has a history--most of 'em have. But this one's out of the common. When they're brazen like that, {{and have}} had good looks, you can nearly always tell. You've got <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> happen, and trust to luck {{to be on the}} spot, or near it. It's a toss-up, of course. One thing is sure, you can't make friends with that kind if they get a notion you're up to anything." ...|$|R
500|$|On August 30, Smith {{commanded}} one of {{the most}} complete Confederate victories of the war against an inexperienced Union force at the Battle of Richmond. Bragg also won a decisive victory at the September 13 Battle of Munfordville, but the delay there cost him the larger prize of Louisville, which Don Carlos Buell moved to occupy on September 25. Having lost Louisville, Bragg spread his troops into defensive postures in the central Kentucky cities of Bardstown, Shelbyville and Danville and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> happen, a move that historian Kenneth W. Noe called a [...] "stupendously illogical decision." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Doing! What do {{you suppose}} there is to do here?" [...] she exclaimed, reproachfully. [...] "We've been sitting still <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> happen. But--have you said {{anything}} to Mr. Brooks yet, papa?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Then I {{tell you}} what I’ll do, boys,” said Dunston Porter. “I’ll take a trip down to Florida with you and look into this matter. I’d rather be on the move than sitting still <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> turn up.” ...|$|E
60|$|All seemed <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{break up}} the party, {{and no one had}} the courage to do it. The major's {{decision}} took every one by surprise, and Amy and Casimer looked as if they had fallen from the clouds.|$|E
6000|$|Roderick made no {{immediate}} answer; {{but at last}} {{he spoke in a}} different voice. [...] "I came expressly to tell you that you need n't trouble yourselves any longer <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> turn up. Nothing will turn up! It 's all over! I said when I came here I would give it a chance. I have given it a chance. Have n't I, eh? Have n't I, Rowland? It 's no use; the thing 's a failure! Do with me now what you please. I recommend you to set me up there {{at the end of the}} garden and shoot me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Mark; then, {{with some}} hesitation, he added: 'Lady Ronnisglen, {{do you care}} whether I take to what people call a gentleman's profession? I could, of course, go on till I am called to the bar, and then <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> turn up; {{but that would be}} waiting indeed! Then in other {{directions}} I've taken things easy, you see, till I'm too old for examinations. I failed in the only one that was still open to me. Lord Kirkaldy tried me for foreign office work, and was appalled at my blunders. I'm not fit for a parson.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Junglepussy {{described}} it as [...] "an ode to my mother, to all mothers, to anyone who's ever planted a seed, to anyone who's ever created <b>something,</b> <b>to</b> anyone who's ever <b>waited</b> patiently <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> come into fruition." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{the people}} looked at one another, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do, not knowing where to begin. Their eyes were {{beginning}} to flame, and their hands to itch for destruction. Checco saw their feeling, and at once pointed to the Palace.|$|E
60|$|Well, on this night, broke, thirsty, {{but with}} the drinker's faith in the {{unexpected}} drink, Nelson and I sat in the Overland House <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> turn up, especially politicians. And there entered Joe Goose--he of the unquenchable thirst, the wicked eyes, the crooked nose, the flowered vest.|$|E
60|$|I overtook {{them in the}} Fraser River Valley, I {{found them}} in Hazleton. They were setting sail at Bennett, tugging oars on the Hotalinqua, and {{hundreds}} of them were landing every day at Dawson, there to stand with lax jaws <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> turn up--lost among thousands of their kind swarming in with the same insane purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Another kind of subjunctive, {{much less}} common {{than the two}} {{described}} above, is a tense with the aspect-marker -ba- (pronounced -baa- and with tones similar to the remote past tense), which means [...] "while <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> happen": ...|$|R
60|$|Herky-Jerky did not <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> permission; he untied me, {{and helped}} me to my feet. I was rather {{unsteady}} on my legs at first, and my injured arm felt like a board. It seemed dead; but after I had moved it a little the pain came back, and it had apparently come to stay. We ate breakfast, and then settled down to do nothing, or <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> turn up. Buell sat in the doorway, moodily watching the trail. Once he spoke, ordering the Mexican to drive in the horses. I fancied from this that Buell might have decided to break camp, {{but there was no}} move to pack.|$|R
50|$|The next part of {{the novel}} takes {{a bit of a}} break from the main plot and deals with a period of <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> bad <b>to</b> happen. Characters talk about fear. One chapter focuses on the life of a {{cheating}} husband.|$|R
60|$|Now Grandfather Frog {{is another}} who is very, very patient. He can sit still {{the longest time}} <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> come to him. Indeed, he can sit {{perfectly}} still so long, and Longlegs can stand perfectly still so long, that Jerry Muskrat and Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter have had many long disputes as to {{which of the two}} can keep still the longest.|$|E
6000|$|Leland smiled. [...] "I don't quite know, {{but it must}} be {{something}} good and beautiful. What is in all Nature is in us too. My dear," [...] and he made a little gesture, [...] "one can feel, and not quite understand. The wheat yonder doesn't know why and how it grows, but, since you gave me your promise at Barrock-holme, I have been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> come to me." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the white}} sands a whiter gig {{belonging}} to the yacht was drawn up, guarded {{by one of the}} white-ducked crew. Not far away in a pulperia on the shore-following Calle Grande three other sailors swaggered with their cues around Coralio's solitary billiard-table. The boat lay there as if under orders to be ready for use at any moment. There was in the atmosphere a hint of expectation, of <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> occur, which was foreign to the air of Coralio.|$|E
5000|$|Portrait of a {{woman in}} transit: Helen Foley, age 27. Occupation: schoolteacher. Up until now, the pattern of her life has been one of unrelenting sameness, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> {{different}} <b>to</b> happen. Helen Foley doesn't know it yet, but her waiting has just ended.|$|R
500|$|Menken and Slater had {{originally}} intended for [...] "I See the Light" [...] to sound more [...] "anthem-like". The songwriters eventually changed their minds, deciding to re-write [...] "I See the Light" [...] into a gentler, more folk-oriented song. Menken {{spoke of the}} creative writing process, [...] "we began throwing melodies up, doing songs and riffs and harmonies, and we <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> stick". Additionally, Menken later admitted that, out of Tangleds five songs and musical numbers, he is most proud of [...] "I See the Light" [...] because it [...] "is a great moment in the film and I am {{very happy with the}} beauty and simplicity of the song." ...|$|R
40|$|Two fugitives find {{themselves}} in a garden, a place clearly created by man, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> someone to pick them up and give them a new possibility, a new life. Two different people, with different expectations from life and very different dreams <b>for</b> the future, <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> happen, ready to seize the moment. That is what the whole play is about: sometimes people need to escape, to leave everything behind, it is all they crave for, but, sometimes, even if they have the chance to do so, they lack the courage to do it for real. When all you know is murder, theft and crime, it is difficult <b>to</b> dream of <b>something</b> better, and sometimes, the dream abruptly ends, revealing what is real and what is not...|$|R
60|$|They made no {{move towards}} {{travelling}} the quick but trying route which had commended itself to me. They seemed to be <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> happen. It {{was not long before}} I was made aware of what this something was. From the direction of the front door came the sound of one running. A sudden diminution of the noise of his feet {{told me that he had}} left the gravel and was on the turf. I drew back a pace or two and waited.|$|E
60|$|The {{wheel of}} the world swings through the same phases again and again. Summer passed and winter thereafter, and came and passed again. The daily paper {{continued}} and I with it, and upon the third summer there fell a hot night, a night issue, and a strained <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be telegraphed {{from the other side}} of the world, exactly as had happened before. A few great men had died in the past two years, the machines worked with more clatter, and some of the trees in the office garden were a few feet taller. But that was all the difference.|$|E
60|$|When I {{reached the}} junipers, the crows--half {{a hundred of}} them--were ranged in the pine tops along one edge of the open. They were quiet enough, save for an {{occasional}} scramble for position, evidently <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> happen. Down on my right, on the fourth or open side of the pasture, a solitary old crow was perched {{in the top of}} a tall hickory. I might have taken him for a sentry but for a bright object which he held in his beak. It was too far to make out what the object was; but whenever he turned his head it flashed in the sunlight like a bit of glass.|$|E
60|$|We twisted {{ourselves}} about, and lay {{as still}} as death, with every sense alert. In a little while I did not doubt that something was quietly ascending the cleft. Very slowly and quite noiselessly I assured myself of a good grip on my chain, and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> that <b>something</b> <b>to</b> appear.|$|R
60|$|Half-an-hour had passed, {{but he was}} not greatly disturbed. He had a {{touch of}} that {{beautiful}} faith which is the heritage of the born adventurer. He was content <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> turn up. He threw away the end of his cigar and walked slowly up and down the great vaulted room. The ceiling was of extraordinary height, and the wooden panels which covered the walls were black with age and beautifully carved. He paused before one of them to examine the design, and passed his fingers lightly over the figure of a priest who knelt by the side of a wounded man in armour. It was a rugged but wonderful representation. Suddenly he started back as though he had been shot. The priest was being split down the middle before his eyes.|$|R
500|$|This was {{followed}} by another report {{at the request of}} Churchill, this time by Admiral Tom Phillips. Phillips returned his report on 16 October, calling for standing patrols by Hawker Hurricane fighters guided by searchlights, the so-called cat's eye fighters. Dowding replied that the speed and altitude of modern aircraft made such efforts almost useless, stating that Phillips was proposing to [...] "merely revert to a Micawber-like method of ordering them to fly about and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> turn up." [...] He again stated that AI was the only solution to the problem. Phillips had not ignored AI, but pointed out that [...] "At the beginning of the war, AI was stated to be a month or two ahead. After more than a year, we still hear that in a month or so it may really achieve results." ...|$|R
