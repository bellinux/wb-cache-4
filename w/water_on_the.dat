5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} led {{to moderate}} to severe inland flooding, with high waters reported along U.S. Route 460 in Prince George County, U.S. Route 17, and several other roads. The rainfall led to river flooding, including minor to moderate flooding along the Rivanna and James Rivers, moderate flooding along the Appomattox River, and moderate to major flooding along the Meherrin, Nottoway, and Blackwater Rivers. In Isle of Wight County, a driver attempted to cross high <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> James River Bridge and was killed when the water washed the car off of the road.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, radar data {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} large quantities of water ice at the poles and at mid-latitudes.

5|$|A log {{portion of}} the {{original}} Oklahoma Row was moved north and now sits {{on the east side}} of Highway 94 in Monte Ne. It is used for storage. The three-story concrete-and-stone tower still stands and remains above <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of Beaver Lake. This section is often incorrectly referred to as the bank building and the honeymoon suite. Monte Ne was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 because of the historic significance of being so closely associated with Harvey and its unique architecture and engineering. Despite this, what is left of Monte Ne has fallen victim to severe neglect and vandalism. It is covered with spray paint and graffiti, as well as being cracked and full of debris. In 2011 the fire department was called to help a person who had climbed to the top floor and gotten stuck in the chimney. Because of this incident and the general state of the remains, the Army Corps of Engineers erected a temporary barbed wire fence around the tower.|$|E
5|$|At {{independence}} on 30 June 1960, {{the army}} {{suffered from a}} dramatic deficit of trained leaders, particularly in the officer corps. This was because the Force Publique had always only been officered by Belgian or other expatriate whites. The Belgian Government {{made no effort to}} train Congolese commissioned officers until {{the very end of the}} colonial period, and in 1958, only 23 African cadets had been admitted even to the military secondary school. The highest rank available to Congolese was adjutant, which only four soldiers achieved before independence. Though 14 Congolese cadets were enrolled in the Royal Military Academy in Brussels in May, they were not scheduled to graduate as second lieutenants until 1963. Ill-advised actions by Belgian officers led to an enlisted ranks' rebellion on 5 July 1960, which helped spark the Congo Crisis. Lieutenant General Émile Janssens, the Force Publique commander, wrote during a meeting of soldiers that 'Before independence=After Independence', pouring cold <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soldiers' desires for an immediate raise in their status.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{was born}} in 1916 in Annandale, an inner suburb of Sydney. However, in his autobiography, {{he claims to have}} been born in 1918 or 1919 in Queensland, and his {{military}} service record has his date of birth as 5 June 1917. He was the third child of Alfred Percival Barnes and Hilda May Barnes (née Jeffery), both from farming families near Tamworth in northern New South Wales. After marrying, the couple left Tamworth to take up a lease on a remote sheep station near Hughenden in North Queensland. Before Sid was born, Alfred died from typhoid fever, caused by drinking contaminated <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> family property. After his death, Hilda, widowed and pregnant with her latest child, moved to Sydney with her children and stayed with her sister, where Sid was born. From her husband's estate, Hilda Barnes mother was able to purchase and renovate real estate in Stanmore and Leichhardt,New South Wales, to let or sell. Later in life, Barnes would recount how, as a child, he used to collect the rents for his mother.|$|E
5|$|Further {{measures}} included pouring {{boiling water}} over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could {{be placed in the}} mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamuses {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos {{wanted to live in}} the water, but were refused out of fear that they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung {{so that it can be}} inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo lost most of his hair and was too embarrassed to leave the water.|$|E

5|$|Improvements {{were carried}} out between 1852 and 1856 {{at a cost of}} over £6,725. The keep was adapted to support 32-pounder (14.5kg) guns, the seaward-facing bastions and curtain walls were {{reinforced}} with brick casemates and new gun positions, and the moat was deepened to protect against any surprise attack. Two batteries were built to the west and east of the castle, protected by shingle and earth and linked to the old castle by covered passageways called caponiers; a defensible barrack block was built beside the western battery, to provide further protection against any attack from the land. The result was that Hurst was re-established as a powerful fortification, equipped with fourteen 32-pounder guns, fifteen 8-inch (203mm) shell guns and two 32-pounder carronades; in wartime, these required a team of 440 men, with a peacetime garrison of 105 soldiers. Fort Albert was built across the <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Isle of Wight to provide supporting fire. The old inn was first reused as the garrison canteen and then demolished.|$|E
5|$|In Kohala, the {{numerous}} dikes near the summit inhibit groundwater from seeping downslope to the northeast, where it naturally wants to go. Rather, the Kohala dike complex guides it northwest or southeast, down {{the axis of}} the rift zones, just like the surface <b>water.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, the three smaller valleys between the large ones - Honopue, Honokea, and Honokane Iki - {{as well as the}} many smaller gulches which are not yet valleys, are deprived of groundwater by the orientation of the rift zone and its dikes. Without the large amount of water that is received by the bigger valleys, these valleys grow far more slowly. Due to its topography as essentially a flat crater floor surrounded by cones and fault scarps, the main caldera is affected relatively little by erosion from water.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the fires, erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped millions of gallons of <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fires, and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E
