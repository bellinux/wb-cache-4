After an account of missionary endeavours in South Africa {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century (with the emphasis on the activities of the Berlin Missionary Society), an explanation is provided of how missionaries became involved in the <b>weal</b> <b>and</b> <b>woes</b> of the Balobedu tribe. This is followed by an indication of how Reverend Fritz Reuter took the initiative to provide basic education to the inhabitants of Ga-Kgapane and how education provision developed at Medingen since then. Reasons are advanced for the prominence Medingen Primary School currently enjoys and the study concludes with the assertion that Medingen Mission Station can be regarded as an important, though not exclusive source of the Balobedu’s present-day identity.

40|$|The upsurge of {{religious}} movements and independent {{churches in the}} Global South is bringing a new twist to world economic development not anticipated by many theologians and social scientists. With a syncretic soteriology geared toward the liberation of the whole person, religious movements and independent churches {{of the south are}} preaching to their adherents, mostly the poor and the marginalized, a message of faith in an omnipotent and compassionate God who is concerned for their <b>weal</b> <b>and</b> <b>woes</b> <b>and</b> who offers them an assured and holistic salvation. By placing their faith in God, the poor and marginalized people are discovering their true selves and are saved/liberated. This assured salvation (certitudo salutis), which is a total liberation of the physical and spiritual world, becomes, in turn, the motivational energy for capital development. The Zion Christian Church (ZCC) soteriological predicament stands at this juncture. Through processes of syncretization and purification, ZCC has managed to deconstruct the European/North American and African Traditional Religions soteriologies to construct a pure soteriology that is relevant to the socio context of its adherents. ZCC deconstructs these soteriologies by broadening, for example, the classic Christian soteriogical theory of Christus Victor in her notion of sin, death and the devil and the African traditional soteriological notion of uBuntu and spirit-power. The purity, or holistic salvation, generated out of these processes serves as grounds for identity and economic empowerment of its adherents. With a holistic salvation that centers on healing, personal integrity and spiritual power, ZCC members have been able to achieve considerable success in the labour market by becoming an army of potential employees. They have also distinguished themselves in their work ethic, where they are seen as hardworking, disciplined, obedient and sober. Empowering its adherents economically through a religious soteriology, the ZCC has become an example of a trend that is shaping the Global South and is reviving the interest of social scientists and theologians to further investigate the impact {{of religious}} and theological formulations on the economic conduct of individuals.

But they are not destined simply to take the regions of the heart for their dominion, they are not satisfied merely with interrupting her better feelings; but after a while you may see the blooming cheek beginning to droop and fade, her intelligent eye no longer sparkles with the starry light of heaven, her vibrating pulse long since changed its regular motion, and her palpitating bosom beats once more for the midday of her glory. Anxiety and care ultimately throw her into the arms of the haggard and grim monster death. But, oh, how patient, under every pining influence! Let us view the matter in bolder colors; see her when the dearest object of her affections recklessly seeks every bacchanalian pleasure, contents himself with the last rubbish of creation. With what solicitude she awaits his return! Sleep fails to perform its office--she weeps while the nocturnal shades of the night triumph in the stillness. Bending over some favorite book, whilst the author throws before her mind the most beautiful imagery, she startles at every sound. The midnight silence is broken by the solemn announcement of the return of another morning.

By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{concentrations}} were measured in dialysate from healthy human skin, in vivo, both at rest {{and during the}} inflammatory response to intradermal histamine or bradykinin. Changes in dialysate NO concentration, measured by electrochemical detection, were related to changes in dermal vascular perfusion, measured using scanning laser Doppler imaging. Basal NO concentration in dermal microdialysate was 0 · 60 ± 0 · 14 μM (mean ± s. e. m.). Following the intradermal injection of histamine, a transient, time-dependent increase in NO concentration was measured in areas of skin incorporating the <b>weal</b> <b>and</b> in others incorporating the flare. The increase in NO concentration was associated {{with an increase in}} dialysate cGMP concentration in both the <b>weal</b> <b>and</b> flare areas. Addition of NG-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME, 5 mM) to the probe perfusate resulted in an inhibition of the histamine-induced increase in NO and cGMP. Moreover, the reduction in dialysate NO concentration was associated with a reduction in dermal vascular flux, both under basal conditions <b>and</b> within the <b>weal</b> <b>and</b> flare response. These results demonstrate, by the use of microdialysis, that vasoactive mediators can be measured in healthy human skin in vivo. They provide direct evidence that endogenous concentration of NO increases during the inflammatory <b>weal</b> <b>and</b> flare response to histamine and that the increase in dermal NO concentration is associated with increases in cGMP concentration and dermal vascular perfusion, thus confirming a role for NO in vasoregulation in human skin...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{designed}} to explore the effect of cetirizine on mediator release secondary to intradermal bradykinin challenge in normal human skin. On intradermal injection, bradykinin produces a dose-dependant <b>weal</b> <b>and</b> flare response similar visually to that produced by histamine, suggesting that histamine release is involved in mediating the cutaneous response. This is further supported {{by the fact that}} premedication with cetirizine significantly inhibits both the bradykinin <b>and</b> histamine <b>weal</b> <b>and</b> flare. However microdialysis demonstrated that there is insignificant histamine release following bradykinin, and SLDI showed that the <b>weal</b> <b>and</b> flares produced by both histamine and bradykinin are different in nature, suggesting that other mediators, such as prostanoids or NO are involved. Although both prostanoid synthesis and NO release were observed following bradykinin, cetirizine failed to have any effect on the levels measured, suggesting that these are not the major mediators responsible for the bradykinin response. Cetirizine was shown to be able to inhibit the cutaneous responses induced by a number of agonists, namely bradykinin, histamine, and methacholine. All of these act via a specific GPCR, and each one having an alpha subunit of the Gq/ 11 variety. Therefore it is postulated that the bradykinin-induced <b>weal</b> <b>and</b> flare is mediated by activation of B 2 -kinin receptors located on sensory neurones, resulting in the release of neuropeptides, and that inhibition of this response is achieved by a direct inhibition of Gq/ 11 G-proteins, their regulatory proteins or modulation of a common second messenger system...|$|R
