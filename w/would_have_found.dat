5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen Clyde attending a football club, with his coach acting strange around him. After a few clues, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> out his coach was an alien.|$|E
5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{planned and}} {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen a new sweet shop opening near Sarah Jane's house, attracting many teenagers. Sarah, along with Rani, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> out the Trickster was behind it all, using teenagers' souls to gain more power to destroy earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Arsacid patronism of Zoroastrianism is debated in modern scholarship. The {{followers}} of Zoroaster <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> the bloody sacrifices of some Parthian-era Iranian cults to be unacceptable. However, {{there is evidence}} that Vologeses I encouraged the presence of Zoroastrian magi priests at court and sponsored the compilation of sacred Zoroastrian texts which later formed the Avesta. The Sassanid court would later adopt Zoroastrianism as the official state religion of the empire.|$|E

5|$|Around noon, Wallace {{began the}} journey along the Shunpike, a route {{familiar}} to his men. A member of Grant's staff, William R. Rowley, found Wallace between 2 and 2:30p.m. on the Shunpike, after Grant wondered where Wallace was {{and why he}} had not arrived on the battlefield, while the main Union force was being slowly pressed backward. Rowley told Wallace that the Union army had retreated, Sherman was no longer fighting at Shiloh Church, and the battle line had moved northeast toward Pittsburg Landing. If Wallace continued in the same direction, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> himself {{in the rear of}} the advancing Confederate troops.|$|E
5|$|Excluding a few {{controversial}} claims, scientists {{agree that}} all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. The dinosaur fossil record {{has been interpreted}} to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity {{during the last few}} million years of the Cretaceous, {{and it may be that}} the quality of the dinosaur fossil record is simply not good enough to permit researchers to distinguish between the options. There is no evidence that late Maastrichtian non-avian dinosaurs could burrow, swim, or dive, which suggests they were unable to shelter themselves from the worst parts of any environmental stress that occurred at the K–Pg boundary. It is possible that small dinosaurs (other than birds) did survive, but they would have been deprived of food, as herbivorous dinosaurs <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> plant material scarce and carnivores would have quickly found prey in short supply.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, it was {{reported}} that only 20% of the game was complete. Numerous features {{were not included in the}} final product due to time and budget constraints. The developers originally planned to add a special weapon designed to be used underwater and acquired from Chris at the end of the eight episode, but the plot of the game changed during development and the team had to discard it. Additionally, the land in the distance that can be seen from the ship in the first episode was originally going to be the setting of the last episode, where Jill <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> something from her past.|$|E

50|$|About the {{discovery}} and foundation of Fosca three different versions are given; Nikolaus Federmann <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>founded</b> the town on September 1, 1536, captain Pedro de Limpias reached and discovered Fosca on his expedition from the Llanos Orientales on February 5, 1627, or Juan de Valcárcel {{passed through the}} area and moved the town centre to a different location on February 5, 1627.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} opinion {{presented by the}} NTSB accident report determined {{that the cause of}} the accident was the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff procedures due to an excess of speed. The NTSB recommended revisions and expansions to airline abort procedures and new FAA regulations defining runway clearance and procedures, taking into account jet engine exhaust. In his minority report, Mr. McAdams' said that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> the probable cause of the accident to be the Delta crew's failure to adequately advise the tower of the proximity to the runway, and the tower's failure to request additional and precise information prior to clearing TWA 159 for takeoff.|$|E
25|$|This dialect {{has brought}} all {{borrowed}} words {{under its own}} laws of accidence; but its original vocabulary has been hopelessly impoverished and deprived of its finest elements. A Corfiote Jew visiting any part of Apulia <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> difficulty in understanding the spoken vernacular or the songs of the natives, although the grammatical structure {{is exactly the same}} as that of his own dialect.|$|E
25|$|Between 1783 and 1787, Bligh was {{a captain}} in the {{merchant}} service. Like many lieutenants, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> full-pay employment in the Navy; however, commissions were hard to obtain with the fleet largely demobilised {{at the end of}} the War of American Independence. In 1787, Bligh was selected as commander of Bounty. He rose eventually to the rank of vice admiral in the Royal Navy.|$|E

25|$|Absence of {{evidence}} {{is a condition}} in which no valid conclusion can be inferred from the mere absence of detection, normally due to doubt in the detection method. Evidence of absence is the successful variation: a conclusion that relies on specific knowledge in conjunction with negative detection to deduce the absence of something. An example {{of evidence}} of absence is checking your pockets for spare change and finding nothing, but being confident that the search <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> it if it was there.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it is clear}} from a {{comparison}} of Jung's writings and that of ancient Gnostics, that Jung disagreed with them on the ultimate goal of the individual. Gnostics in ancient times clearly sought a return to a supreme, other-worldly Godhead. In a study of Jung, Robert Segal claimed that the eminent psychologist <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> the psychological interpretation of the goal of ancient Gnosticism (that is, re-unification with the Pleroma, or the unknown God) to be psychically 'dangerous', as being a total identification with the unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Those {{witnesses}} and other witnesses from the Forensic Science Service told the Court of Appeal {{that this was}} not the right conclusion to draw from the discovery of the particle of FDR. It was instead no more likely that the particle had come from a gun fired by Barry George than that it had come from some other source. The Court of Appeal concluded that, if this evidence had been given to the jury at the trial, there was no certainty that the jury <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> George guilty. For this reason his conviction had to be quashed.|$|E
50|$|According to Vinci, the Achaeans <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{lived at}} the {{beginning}} of the 2nd millennium BC on the coasts of the Baltic Sea and, towards the middle of the millennium, since the climate had become harder, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> moved southward along the Dnepr, reaching the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. The newcomers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>founded</b> the Mycenaean cities (the most ancient Mycenaean graves are rich in amber, a typical Baltic product, whereas the latest ones are not) and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> named them with the names of their previous settlements in Scandinavia, although not exactly in correspondence of their location, because of the physical differences between the two areas.|$|R

50|$|In addition, {{the source}} {{materials}} for the Seinte Audree <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>found</b> in Ely, which is near Sawtry, the location of Marie's Latin sources for her Espurgatoire Seint Patriz.|$|R
25|$|This {{illustration}} {{serves to}} show that the work is not intended for scholars alone, but also for popular instruction; and that the statement, so often repeated since the time of Meiri, that the Sheiltot was a book merely for the instruction of youth, is also baseless. It is more probable that it is a collection of aggadic-halakic sermons, which Aḥa delivered in Palestine, where certainly he was held in high regard. With the decline of rabbinical knowledge in Palestine, Aḥa <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> but few pupils for pure halakic instruction; and he therefore endeavored to add aggadic elements to his lectures, in obedience to the general disposition of the Palestinians, who just then favored Aggadah.|$|E
25|$|While it was {{excellently}} {{adapted to}} swimming and diving, Baptornis {{is thought to}} have been clumsy on land, pushing itself along the rocks with its feet rather than actually walking. The natural position of the lower legs was flush against the body, with the feet stretched out sideways and thus it would have been unable to move upright without toppling over. As opposed to Hesperornis which almost certainly had to slide on its belly or galumph like an earless seal, Baptorniss lower leg was not as firmly placed along the body sides. Thus, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> it more easy to place its feet under its body with the toes pointing forwards and might have managed small hops or even an awkward waddle, body held low to the ground.|$|E
25|$|At Western discovery, Kiritimati was uninhabited. As {{on other}} Line Islands {{there might have}} been a small or {{temporary}} native population, most probably Polynesian traders and settlers, who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> the island a useful replenishing station on the long voyages from the Society Islands to Hawaiʻi, perhaps as early as AD 400. This trade route was apparently used with some regularity by about AD 1000. From 1200 onwards Polynesian long-distance voyages became less frequent, and had there been human settlement on Kiritimati, it would have been abandoned in the early-mid second millennium AD. Two possible village sites and some stone structures of these early visitors have been located. Today, most inhabitants are Micronesians, and Gilbertese is the only language of any significance. English is generally understood, but little used outside the tourism sector.|$|E
60|$|His {{presence}} in this silent state served, too, as a protection in Mrs. Langford's periodical visitations {{to stir the}} fire; but for him, she <b>would</b> assuredly <b>have</b> <b>found</b> fault, and probably Beatrice <b>would</b> <b>have</b> come to a collision with her, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{put an end to}} the whole scheme.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should hardly {{think that}} possible," [...] the captain said. [...] "Their remains <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>found,</b> and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been {{returned}} {{in the list}} as three persons unrecognized; but all the bodies {{seem to have been}} identified." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Simply {{because he}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>found</b> to be a thief," [...] said the doctor. [...] "You must excuse me, Mr. Toogood, but it's {{only for the}} sake of the argument." ...|$|R
25|$|Little {{is known}} about the pattern of land {{ownership}} before the Roman conquest, but {{there is no doubt that}} it radically changed after the Roman conquest. In particular, many free peasants who had farmed the same plots for generations (i.e. were owners under tribal customary law) <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> themselves reduced to tenants, obliged to pay rent to absentee Roman landlords or to the agents of the procurator, the chief financial officer of the province, if their land was now part of an imperial estate. Even where their new landlord was a local tribal aristocrat, the free peasant may have been worse off, obliged to pay rent for land which he might previously have farmed for free, or pay fees to graze his herds on pastures which might previously have been communal.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the Victorian era, there was a more or less {{negative}} view of women's styles of the 1795–1820 period. Some people would have felt slightly uncomfortable to be reminded that their mothers or grandmothers had once promenaded about in such styles (which could be considered indecent according to Victorian norms), and many <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> it somewhat difficult to really empathize with (or take seriously) the struggles of a heroine of art or literature if they were being constantly reminded that she was wearing such clothes. For such reasons, some Victorian history paintings of the Napoleonic wars intentionally avoided depicting accurate women's styles (see example below), Thackeray's illustrations to his book Vanity Fair depicted the women of the 1810s wearing 1840s fashions, and in Charlotte Brontë's 1849 novel Shirley (set in 1811–1812) neo-Grecian fashions are anachronistically relocated to an earlier generation.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of Anglo-Saxon kingship is little understood but the model proposed by Yorke, considered the {{development of}} kingdoms and writing down of the oral law-codes {{to be linked to}} a progression towards leaders providing mund and receiving recognition. These leaders who developed in the sixth century, were able to seize the initiative and to establish a position of power for themselves and their successors. Anglo-Saxon leaders, unable to tax and coerce followers instead extracted surplus by raiding and collecting food renders and 'prestige goods'. The later sixth century saw the end of a 'prestige goods' economy, as evidenced by the decline of accompanied burial, and the appearance of the first princely graves and high-status settlements. These centres of trade and production reflect the increased socio-political stratification and wider territorial authority which allowed seventh-century elites to extract and redistribute surpluses with far greater effectiveness than their sixth-century predecessors <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> possible. Anglo-Saxon society, in short, looked very different in 600 than it did a hundred years earlier.|$|E
5000|$|As {{an illegitimate}} child, Hughes/Shakespeare had a [...] "bar sinister" [...] and {{could never have}} {{inherited}} the crown, but was [...] "a glorious future for England that remained unrealised", as Helen Hackett puts it. Had he been able to claim the crown, the boy <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>founded</b> a line of kings that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> excluded the Stuarts, and thus protected England from the disasters brought about by that dynasty. The story of events is contained in the sonnets, which were written by Oxford to his actor son, who is the Fair Youth. The queen is the Dark Lady.|$|R
