500|$|Tim Sendra of Allmusic {{gave the}} album {{three out of}} five stars review, and said the album had the [...] "cheesy drum machines, samples, and off-kilter lyric {{approach}} that make [...] "Jerk" [...] so good", [...] "the duo stick to the template , considering {{the uniqueness of the}} sound they've created and also the fact that it's a debut record made by teenagers, and an impressive and unfailingly fun debut at that." [...] The review goes on to point out that [...] "the reliance on the [...] "Jerk" [...] sound can be a little monotonous, there are enough variations along the way to keep things interesting." [...] He also says [...] "The duo's flow is not incredible but they spit convincingly. If you were looking for undisputedly pop-rap with a fresh sound and a light lyrical touch, the New Boyz debut is a fine destination." [...] XXL said that the album delivered [...] "unexpected lyrical talent" [...] but that it lacked [...] "sonic variety". The review also {{goes on to say that}} the album [...] "is no hip-hop classic, but rather the breath of fresh air rap needs." [...] Jeff Weiss of The Los Angeles Times gave the album three stars, commenting that the album [...] "is a catchy and charismatic debut that should engender pleasant teen nostalgia in anyone old enough to vote and help explain why for the last six months, the kids have been saying out with the old, in with the New Boyz.". The review also said that the album [...] "successfully strikes a balance between introducing a new sound (the minimalist bass-heavy bounce of jerk music) and style (skinny jeans, Vans and [...] "colors that ain’t even on the rainbow"), with traditional teenage themes (girls, the desire for self-expression, adults who don’t understand, girls). The result is a West Coast antidote to the South’s veritable monopoly on homeroom rap—a relentlessly breezy and fun ride through the lives of a pair of class clowns bent on enjoying the face cards that fate dealt." [...] The Selby Times said that the album [...] "is about as happening as it gets for teenage music with an attitude, even if it makes adults' eyes roll in disgust." [...] Wendy Roby of BBC said that, [...] "But overall their sheer chutzpah wins you over – and with its day-glo tongue wedged so very firmly in its cheek, Skinny Jeanz and a Mic is hard to resist." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the album [...] "one of the year’s most charming rap debuts, and certainly the least expected." [...] In a separate review, he named the album the sixth best album of the year, commenting, [...] "Emerging from Southern California’s jerk scene, this teenage duo made an album that’s appealingly young, simultaneously wide-eyed and knowingly lewd." [...] DJBooth.net's Nathan Slavik was less positive, predicting that the album would be [...] "the last time <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> the New Boyz." ...|$|E
2500|$|Capitaine de Vaisseau Christy-Pallière - Introduced in Master and Commander, he is a French post captain with English cousins, {{who speaks}} fluent English that is {{slightly}} quaint from his habit of mangling quotations - [...] "Let us gather rose pods while we may" [...] as he says, for [...] "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may". Aubrey surrenders {{to him after}} HMS Sophie is taken, but Christy-Pallière, impressed with {{the resistance of the}} Sophie, refuses to take his sword and insists that he continue to wear it. He is apparently promoted to Admiral, as <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> his nephew Lt. Dumesnil (affectionately called Pierrot), lieutenant of the French frigate Cornélie in The Thirteen Gun Salute. When he appears again in The Hundred Days, he is again a post captain, who renounces Napoleon, declares his loyalty for King Louis XVIII and places his frigate at the disposal of the Royal Navy.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1989 posthumous book, The Global Village, McLuhan, {{collaborating with}} Bruce R. Powers, {{provided}} a strong {{conceptual framework for}} understanding the cultural implications of the technological advances associated {{with the rise of}} a worldwide electronic network. This is a major work of McLuhan's because it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of Acoustic Space, and it provides a critique of standard 20th century communication models like the Shannon–Weaver model. McLuhan distinguishes between the existing worldview of Visual Space – a linear, quantitative, classically geometric model – and that of Acoustic Space – a holistic, qualitative order with a complex intricate paradoxical topology. [...] "Acoustic Space has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or center is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere." [...] The transition from Visual to Acoustic Space was not automatic {{with the advent of the}} global network, but would have to be a conscious project. The [...] "universal environment of simultaneous electronic flow" [...] inherently favors right-brain Acoustic Space, yet we are held back by habits of adhering to a fixed point of view. There are no boundaries to sound. <b>We</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> all directions at once. Yet Acoustic and Visual Space are in fact inseparable. The resonant interval is the invisible borderline between Visual and Acoustic Space. This is like the television camera that the Apollo 8 astronauts focused on the Earth after they had orbited the moon.|$|E

6000|$|... "That don't {{make any}} difference, for it won't delay us. I'm {{going to start}} right out to buy the engine, {{and by the time}} <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> him, we shall be at work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course. We'd better {{write to}} the Hopetown {{authorities}} at once. Meanwhile, I suppose {{she might as well}} stay here for a few more days till <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> them. But keep your eyes and ears open, Mr. Meredith." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Not until <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> shots <b>from</b> them," [...] Charlie replied. [...] "We {{have but}} four charges left, {{and if the}} wolves made a sudden rush, {{we might want to}} use them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That'll hold Buck for a while,' was his comment. 'I guess <b>we</b> shan't <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> {{him for a}} week or two. That's {{the best}} cure for the {{headache}} I've ever struck.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some cow-puncher," [...] said Manning, [...] "that {{they caught}} out alone. Good boy! He {{put up a}} dandy scrap before they got him. So that's why <b>we</b> didn't <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> Don Sebastiano any more!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{more for}} me, thank you," [...] Fugger said with decision. [...] "As {{to the story}} being wrong, I have telegraphed to Rotterdam, and they have sent on a trusty man. He'll be weeks, however, before <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can {{do nothing}} until <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> the solicitor. In the {{meantime}} you may stay with us, if you wish. I did not expect a visit from you so soon; but your room has not been used since you went away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Tommy, {{you leave}} this matter to us," [...] said the doctor's son. [...] "I don't {{think they can}} compel you {{to go with the}} circus. We'll take you to Fairview, and you can remain with us until <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> your sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Edna, [...] "the same as ever. But it {{cannot be}} for long. As {{soon as the}} captain has made his arrangements, <b>we</b> shall <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> him, and then {{everything}} will be told." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, dear papa, {{it would}} indeed. But I am {{quite sure that}} the next time <b>we</b> shall <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> him will be when he arrives here, and makes the house ring with his own dear voice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose that's true," [...] Bland agreed. [...] "Anyway, I {{can promise}} that we'll {{do nothing about}} the matter until <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> you; I don't think there's any {{likelihood}} of our disputing about the price. You can fix that at what it's worth to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{taken care}} of it for a fortnight--and it has gained half a pound," [...] cried Rilla. [...] "I think we'd better wait until <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> its father anyhow. He mightn't {{want to have it}} sent to an orphan asylum, when he is {{fighting}} the battles of his country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor fellow! His time {{is getting}} very short, unless <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> Clinch; and {{there can be}} no harm in {{granting}} him every indulgence. I have been thinking of this matter, and do not possibly see how I can escape ordering the execution, unless it be countermanded from Nelson himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come along, Mr. Cheape!" [...] he said. [...] "You know my address, sir. Talk {{this matter}} over with your--with Mr. Walmsley, if you please. If <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> nothing <b>from</b> you on Monday morning a writ will be issued." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I can do that," [...] said Ralph, slowly, but doubting {{very much}} {{whether he could}} {{accomplish}} anything by it. [...] "But it will take {{three or four days}} at least before <b>we</b> can <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{things do}} {{not happen in}} real life {{as they do in}} story books," [...] said the parent. [...] "It is likely you will never hear of Dan Baxter again. But <b>we</b> may <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> his father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} on pins and needles, {{as the saying}} is, till <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> [...] you, and you know hew Genevieve and Mr. D. must be feeling.

6000|$|It is but {{a foolish}} shipman's tale, A theme for a poet's idle page; But still, when the mists of doubt prevail, And we lie {{becalmed}} by the shores of Age, [...] <b>We</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> the misty troubled shore [...] The voice of the children gone before, [...] Drawing the soul to its anchorage.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{had much}} better wait till <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> Lily. We cannot {{in the least}} tell whether she would wish the {{acquaintance}} to be kept up.

6000|$|... "They come now, for certain," [...] said Raleigh. [...] "Tressilian, {{that sound}} is grand. <b>We</b> <b>hear</b> it <b>from</b> this {{distance}} as mariners, {{after a long}} voyage, hear, upon their night-watch, the tide rush upon some distant and unknown shore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{general was}} right," [...] Captain Longmore, Vincent's {{companion}} exclaimed.

6000|$|... "That I can't tell you. Perhaps {{later in}} the day <b>we</b> shall <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> the police. It is {{scarcely}} the sort of murder which would remain long undetected, especially as he was robbed of a large sum in bank-notes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you'll {{write to}} the Princess after tea, Alfred? I'll write to Lady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might open it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there's the Duchess--about the school fete." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Damn you! <b>We</b> still <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> you such stupidity. We have borne {{it until}} our {{patience}} is exhausted." [...] He then incited {{a number of}} violent people to harass and persecute his nephew and make life extremely uncomfortable for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you be {{too sure}} of that," [...] went on his cousin. [...] "Asa Lemm is gone, it is true; but <b>we</b> may <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> him, nevertheless. When {{he went away}} he was an angry as ever, so Professor Brice said." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is none, {{except in}} God," [...] {{answered}} Godwin, [...] "Who {{can do all}} things--even free Rosamund and make her your wife. Also, if Masouda is at liberty, <b>we</b> shall <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> her ere long; so let us keep a good heart." ...|$|R
