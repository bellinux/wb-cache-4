5|$|During {{construction}} of the dam, it was anticipated that the large size and scenic location of the reservoir, coupled with its proximity to urban centers, <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> large tourist draw. A $40,000 plan was put forth to develop the reservoir for recreational activities. This entailed the {{construction of}} campsites, picnic areas, boat ramps, a landing strip, and hiking trails, including on 14 of the 33 islands in the lake. Don Pedro has become a popular summer destination in Central California, attracting 360,000–400,000 visitors each year.|$|E
5|$|The Captaincy General of Chile {{followed}} a process analogous {{to that of}} the May Revolution, and elected a Government Junta that inaugurated the brief period known as Patria Vieja. The Junta was defeated in 1814 at the Battle of Rancagua, and the subsequent Reconquista of Chile <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> royalist stronghold once more. The Andes provided an effective natural barrier between the Argentine revolutionaries and Chile, so there was no military confrontation between them until the Crossing of the Andes, led by José de San Martín in 1817, a campaign that resulted in the defeat of the Chilean royalists.|$|E

5|$|Haumea is a plutoid, a dwarf planet beyond Neptune's orbit. It is {{classified}} as a dwarf planet because it is presumed to be massive enough to have been rounded by its own gravity into a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium, but not massive enough to have cleared its neighbourhood of similarly sized objects. Haumea was initially listed as a classical Kuiper belt object in 2006 by the Minor Planet Center, but no longer. The nominal trajectory suggests that Haumea is in a weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune, which <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> resonant object instead. Although there are precovery images of Haumea dating back to March 22, 1955 from the Palomar Mountain Digitized Sky Survey, further observations of the orbit {{will be required to}} verify its dynamic status.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu {{praised the}} idea of making a game based around trials, which they found to be innovative, and found it exhilarating and fun to uncover witnesses' lies. Thomas Bowskill at Nintendo Life said that the game had changed his idea of what can make for a great game, and called it a masterpiece. Carrie Gouskos at GameSpot said that the game revitalized the {{adventure}} game genre. Michael Cole at Nintendo World Report said that the game's design and interface <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> good choice for non-gamers as well. Bowskill called the investigation sections tedious and boring at times, but said that they were outweighed by the feeling of accomplishment from solving the cases. Craig Harris at IGN felt that the main issues with the game were its linearity, and how the puzzles are simple because of how the player can stop a witness testimony at any time. Cole, too, felt that the game was very linear, and that it was unclear how to proceed at certain points. He said that, because of how story-driven it is, the game has low replay value; he still felt that players might want to replay it after a few years.|$|E

25|$|One {{option would}} be to build {{additional}} Polaris platforms and keep more of them at sea. Two Resolutions would throw 96 warheads and almost guarantee penetration, while three <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> certainty.

50|$|Another {{significant}} criticism {{stems from}} the lack of online multiplayer capabilities. The only online component of the game involves comparing high scores with other players. However, PixelJunk Racers does support up to seven players offline; GameSpot suggested this feature <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> enjoyable party game, even if organizing a seven-player session in one area could be considered a hassle.|$|R
25|$|The {{costs of}} {{bringing}} Karelia {{to the same}} level {{with the rest of}} Finland have been researched only by supporters of the idea. According to a survey conducted by ProKarelia, the area has natural advantages that, under Finnish rule, <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> centre of trade with Russia and industry and thus bring economic growth fast enough to solve the entire problem. According to both ProKarelian research and Arto Lahti's estimate, the price of return would be about 30 billion euro.|$|E
25|$|Such datation, {{as well as}} {{the general}} Hellenistic style and {{attitude}} of the Buddha on the Bimaran casket (himation dress, contrapposto attitude, general depiction) <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> possible Indo-Greek work, used in dedications by Indo-Scythians soon after the end of Indo-Greek rule in the area of Gandhara. Since it already displays quite a sophisticated iconography (Brahma and Śakra as attendants, Bodhisattvas) in an advanced style, it would suggest much earlier representations of the Buddha were already current by that time, going back to the rule of the Indo-Greeks (Alfred A. Foucher and others).|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} Queenborough railway station on 15 May 1876 by the LCDR which offered a sea {{link to the}} Dutch town of Flushing {{prompted}} the SER to investigate possibilities for a rival link to the continent. On 16 April 1878 the SER's engineer, Francis Brady, reported back to his employer on the feasibility of constructing a railway from a point near Gravesend and the North Kent Line {{to the village of}} Stoke, a distance of 9 miles. The estimated cost was £72,000. A 5% return was projected, the belief being that Gravesend's proximity to London <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> more desirable outlet for the distribution of goods intended for the Kent area, rather than the LCDR's Chatham station.|$|E
50|$|During 1903 and 1904, John Porter went to The Jockey Club {{several times}} with his {{proposals}} {{for a new}} racecourse at Newbury. He thought that Newbury’s easily accessible location and proximity to other popular establishments in the area <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> ideal place for a new racecourse. The Jockey Club rejected these proposals several times, stating that there were already enough racecourses in the country.|$|R

25|$|In 1925, Tatum {{moved to}} the Columbus School for the Blind, where he studied music and learned braille. He {{subsequently}} studied piano with Overton G. Rainey at either the Jefferson School or the Toledo School of Music. Rainey, who was also visually impaired, probably taught Tatum in the classical tradition, as Rainey did not improvise and discouraged his students from playing jazz. In 1927, Tatum began playing on Toledo radio station WSPD as 'Arthur Tatum, Toledo's Blind Pianist', during interludes in Ellen Kay's shopping chat program and soon had his own program. By the age of 19, Tatum was playing at the local Waiters' and Bellmens' Club. As word of Tatum spread, national performers passing through Toledo, including Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Joe Turner and Fletcher Henderson, <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> point to drop in to hear the piano phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|The Seahawks {{began their}} postseason run by {{traveling}} to Minneapolis {{to face the}} Vikings in the wild card round, {{in one of the}} coldest games in NFL history, as the temperature on the field at game time was -6° F. Minnesota held the Seahawks scoreless until the fourth quarter, but could not reach the end zone themselves and had to settle for field goals the whole game. The Seahawks managed to score a touchdown and a field goal deep in the fourth quarter to take a 10-9 lead, but the Vikings seemed poised to score a fourth field goal and win until Vikings kicker Blair Walsh missed a 27-yard chip shot, allowing the Seahawks to escape with the victory. However, the Seahawks' luck would run out in the Divisional round, against the #1 seed Carolina Panthers. In one of the most disastrous first halfs in team history, the Panthers ran the Seahawks off the field to the tune of a 31-0 halftime lead. The Seahawks <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> game in the second half, bringing the score {{all the way back to}} 31-24, but would fail to recover an onside kick in the final two minutes of play to seal their fate.|$|E

50|$|Another factor {{influencing}} {{rate of fire}} is {{the supply}} of ammunition. At 50 RPS, a five-second burst from the M134 would use approximately 6.3 kg of 7.62 mm ammunition; this alone <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> impractical weapon for infantry who have to carry a reasonable supply of ammunition with them. For this and other reasons, weapons with such high rates of fire are typically only found on vehicles or fixed emplacements.|$|R

5000|$|Further {{complicating the}} {{designation}} {{is that there}} is no consensus on who sponsored the attacks. A US court did find Iran responsible, which <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> attack by a nation-state on military personnel of two other nation-states. In 2001, former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger stated: [...] "But we still do not have the actual knowledge of who did the bombing of the Marine barracks at the Beirut Airport, and we certainly didn't then." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Bless Me Indeed" [...] was {{released}} {{as the first}} single from Almost There. Although the label anticipated the song's connection with The Prayer of Jaebz <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> success, it performed poorly on Christian radio. The song debuted at number 29 on the Radio & Records Christian AC chart for the week of August 31, 2001. The following week, it advanced to its peak of number 27. The song spent four {{weeks on the chart}} before dropping off. The poor performance of the song at radio led to initial album sales that were lower than anticipated, although the album would later be certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) following the success of the album's second single, [...] "I Can Only Imagine".|$|E
500|$|Help! {{publisher}} Jim Warren {{received a}} letter on 6 December 1961 accusing the magazine of copyright infringement and demanding removal of the offending issue from newsstands. [...] Warren's lawyer believed they could succeed if they fought the suit, but the legal costs <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Pyrrhic victory", and thus recommended settling out of court. [...] Warren could not have the magazine recalled, but he agreed to pay Archie Comics $1000 and ran a note of apology in a subsequent issue of Help!—the August 1962 issue, in which appeared another character franchise parody, [...] "Goodman Meets S*perm*n". Warren's action disappointed Kurtzman, who felt that giving in to such censorship set a [...] "terrible precedent", and amounted {{to a kind of}} prostitution.|$|E
500|$|In 1921, {{after years}} of {{pleading}} for proper schooling, Nancy was allowed a year's boarding at Hatherop Castle, an informal private establishment for young ladies of good family. Laura Thompson, in her biography of Nancy, describes Hatherop as not so much [...] a school, [...] "more a chaste foretaste of debutante life". Here Nancy learned French and other subjects, played organised games and joined a Girl Guide troop. It was her first extended experience of life away from home, and she enjoyed it. The following year she was allowed to accompany four other girls on a cultural trip to Paris, Florence and Venice; her letters home are full of expressions of wonder at the sights and treasures: [...] "I had no idea I was so fond of pictures... if only I had a room of my own I <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> regular picture gallery".|$|E
25|$|Could the {{woodland}} {{have survived}} {{this level of}} industrial use? The two resources that the Romans needed were ironstone and fuel. With both available on one site, this <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> attractive location, but to ensure continuity of fuel supply, it would seem most likely that they encouraged re-growth through a coppice-style system. That would mean that there was continuity of woodland trees and habitats throughout and after the Roman period, and possibly since the ice receded.|$|R
