5|$|We {{probably}} have more influences than {{we know what}} to do with. We have two main styles that have been influences. For instance, we like Black Flag as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr. as much as Hank Williams... To us, hard-core punk is also folk music. <b>We</b> <b>draw</b> a close parallel between the two. We'll play both in the same set if we get a chance. We don't have any biases as far as music is concerned.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{starting}} {{with just two}} distinct points, we can create a line or either of two circles (in turn, using each point as centre and passing through the other point). If <b>we</b> <b>draw</b> both circles, two new points are created at their intersections. Drawing lines between the two original points and one of these new points completes {{the construction of an}} equilateral triangle.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclusion}} <b>we</b> <b>draw</b> {{from the}} nuclear power plant accident in Japan is that the human community, acting for itself and as trustees for future generations, must exercise a far higher level of care globally in dealing with technologies capable of causing mass annihilation, and should phase out, abolish and replace such technologies with alternatives that do not threaten present and future generations. This applies to nuclear weapons {{as well as to}} nuclear power reactors.|$|E

25|$|From {{the above}} angle sum formula {{we can also}} see that the Earth's surface is locally flat: If <b>we</b> <b>draw</b> an {{arbitrarily}} small triangle {{in the neighborhood of}} one point on the Earth's surface, the fraction f of the Earth's surface which is enclosed by the triangle will be arbitrarily close to zero. In this case the angle sum formula simplifies to 180°, which we know is what Euclidean geometry tells us for triangles on a flat surface.|$|E
25|$|All {{the work}} {{related to the}} Parallel Postulate {{revealed}} that it was quite difficult for a geometer to separate his logical reasoning from his intuitive understanding of physical space, and, moreover, revealed the critical importance of doing so. Careful examination had uncovered some logical inadequacies in Euclid's reasoning, and some unstated geometric principles to which Euclid sometimes appealed. This critique paralleled the crisis occurring in calculus and analysis regarding the meaning of infinite processes such as convergence and continuity. In geometry, {{there was a clear}} need for a new set of axioms, which would be complete, and which in no way relied on pictures <b>we</b> <b>draw</b> or on our intuition of space. Such axioms, now known as Hilbert's axioms, were given by David Hilbert in 1894 in his dissertation Grundlagen der Geometrie (Foundations of Geometry). Some other complete sets of axioms had been given a few years earlier, but did not match Hilbert's in economy, elegance, and similarity to Euclid's axioms.|$|E
25|$|If <b>we</b> <b>draw</b> {{a square}} and divide each side into three {{so that the}} middle parts are greater than the others, and then divide the area into nine from these points, we {{approximate}} to the typical setting out of a plan of this time. Now add three apses {{on the east side}} opening from the three divisions, and opposite to the west put a narrow entrance porch running right across the front. Still in front put a square court. The court is the atrium and usually has a fountain in the middle under a canopy resting on pillars. The entrance porch is the narthex. Directly under the center of the dome is the ambo, from which the Scriptures were proclaimed, and beneath the ambo at floor level was the place for the choir of singers. Across {{the eastern side of the}} central square was a screen which divided off the bema, where the altar was situated, from the body of the church; this screen, bearing images, is the iconostasis. The altar was protected by a canopy or ciborium resting on pillars. Rows of rising seats around the curve of the apse with the patriarch's throne at the middle eastern point formed the synthronon. The two smaller compartments and apses at the sides of the bema were sacristies, the diaconicon and prothesis. The ambo and bema were connected by the solea, a raised walkway enclosed by a railing or low wall.|$|E

500|$|Marital {{infidelity}} features {{throughout the}} sections of the novel narrated by Sarah. Cleave discussed: [...] "When you are choosing a lover, you're choosing a philosophy; it's not about sex, it's not about marriage. With Sarah, her unfaithfulness {{is just one of}} the symptoms of the fact that she's torn and is going to have to make this strong moral choice." [...] Sarah's storyline also explores her moral culpability following Andrew's suicide. Personal accountability is a central theme of the novel, with Elkins of The New York Times opining that by not focusing on [...] "postcolonial guilt or African angst", Cleave is able to use the novel to challenge readers' conceptions of civility and ethical choice. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly feels that the book delivered a message of anti-complacency, however believes that is does so by [...] "bemoaning the normality of the First World in the face of the horrors of the Third." [...] She deemed The Other Hand essentially a novel about [...] "the borders <b>we</b> <b>draw,</b> and the real damage they inflict".|$|E
500|$|The season {{aired on}} Nickelodeon, {{which is owned}} by Viacom, and was {{produced}} by United Plankton Pictures and Nickelodeon. The season's executive producers were series creator Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt, who also acted as the series' showrunner. While most episodes consisted of two shorts that were about eleven minutes long or specials that lasted the whole episode, certain episodes were made of one full eleven-minute episode, and two shorts, one of which was seven minutes long and the other only four minutes long. The animation was handled overseas in South Korea at Rough Draft Studios. Throughout the series run, from 1999 to 2008, SpongeBob SquarePants was drawn and animated using pencils.
