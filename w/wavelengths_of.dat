Dichroic filters are multiple layer thin-film etalons. In telecommunications, wavelength-division multiplexing, the technology that {{enables the use of}} multiple <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> light through a single optical fiber, depends on filtering devices that are thin-film etalons. Single-mode lasers employ etalons to suppress all optical cavity modes except the single one of interest.|$|E

5|$|Green {{is common}} in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex {{chemical}} known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs the long <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> light (red) and short <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} report on La/B 4 C {{multilayer}} mirrors designed for an incidence angle of 45 ° with both maximum reflectivity at a <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> 6. 7 nm and reflectivity suppression at a <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> 20. 1 nm. These mirrors were deposited for the EIS-TIMER at the FERMI@Elettra Free Electron Laser. The multilayer structure and optical properties were characterized using grazing incidence X-ray reflectometry with Cu-Kα radiation and EUV reflectometry in the spectral region of 6. 5 - 21. 0 nm. An anti-reflective coating designed at the <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> 20. 1 nm {{had to be}} deposited {{on top of the}} high reflective La/B 4 C multilayer mirror optimized at a <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> 6. 7 nm. Measured reflectivities of 53. 4 % at the <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> 6. 72 nm and 0. 15 % at the <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> 20. 1 nm were simultaneously achieved. It is shown that the reflectivity loss at the <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> 6. 7 nm due to the utilization of antireflective coating designed at the <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> 20. 1 nm can be minimized up to 1. 0 %...|$|R

5|$|Jupiter is a {{powerful}} source of radio waves in the spectral region stretching from several kilohertz to tens of megahertz. Radio waves with frequencies of less than about 0.3MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1km) are called the Jovian kilometric radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3–3MHz (with <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> 100–1000m) are called the hectometric radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3–40MHz (with <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> 10–100m) {{are referred to as}} the decametric radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io–Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.|$|E
5|$|All {{images from}} Hubble are {{monochromatic}} grayscale, in which its cameras incorporate {{a variety of}} filters each passing specific <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> light. Color images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters. This process can also create false-color versions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels, where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue.|$|E
5|$|Gamma ray {{astronomy}} observes astronomical objects at {{the shortest}} <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites {{such as the}} Compton Gamma Ray Observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} for simultaneous measurement of strain and temperature {{with a single}} tapered fiber Bragg grating is proposed. This method {{is based on the}} fact that the reflectivity at central <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> FBG reflection changes with chirp (strain gradient). A diode laser is locked to the central <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> FBG reflection. Central <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> the FBG shifts with temperature.

50|$|Absorptivity, reflectivity, and {{emissivity}} of all {{bodies are}} dependent on the <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> the radiation. The temperature determines the <b>wavelength</b> distribution <b>of</b> the electromagnetic radiation. For example, fresh snow, which is highly reflective to visible light (reflectivity about 0.90), appears white due to reflecting sunlight with a peak <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> about 0.5 micrometers. Its emissivity at a temperature of about -5 C, peak <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> about 12 micrometers, is 0.99.|$|R
5|$|In the end, four {{broadband}} filters were chosen, centred at <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> 300 nm (near-ultraviolet), 450nm (blue light), 606nm (red light) and 814nm (near-infrared). Because the quantum efficiency of Hubble's detectors is quite low at 300nm, the noise in observations at this wavelength is {{primarily due to}} CCD noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{data sets}} may be {{necessary}} for certain phasing methods. For example, MAD phasing requires that the scattering be recorded at least three (and usually four, for redundancy) <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> the incoming X-ray radiation. A single crystal may degrade too much during the collection of one data set, owing to radiation damage; in such cases, data sets on multiple crystals must be taken.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{could be}} exploited industrially and commercially, and research {{that could lead}} to such applications is under way. A direct parallel would be to create active or adaptive military camouflage fabrics that vary their colours and patterns to match their environments, just as chameleons and cephalopods do. The ability to vary reflectivity to different <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> light could also lead to efficient optical switches that could function like transistors, enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and routers.|$|E

5|$|The team {{received}} {{a number of}} Western Electric Type 316A large acorn vacuum tubes in early 1937. These were suitable for building transmitter units of about 20W continual power for <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> 1 to 10m (300 to 30MHz). Percy Hibberd built a prototype transmitter with pulses {{of a few hundred}} watts and fitted it to the Heyford in March 1937.|$|E
5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{detection}} of a transit signal by Kepler, follow-up observations {{were taken to}} confirm the planetary nature of the candidate. Speckle imaging by the WIYN Telescope {{was used to determine}} the amount of light from nearby, background stars that was present. If not accounted for, this light would have made Kepler-6 appear brighter than it actually was. Consequently, the size of Kepler-6b would have been underestimated. Radial velocity data was taken by HIRES at the Keck I telescope {{in order to determine the}} mass of the planet. Independently, observations were made with the Spitzer Space Telescope at infrared <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> 3.6 and 4.5 micrometres. Along with additional data taken by Kepler, these observations detected the occultation and phase curves of Kepler-6b behind its star.|$|E
50|$|N44 is {{classified}} as an emission nebula because it contains large regions of ionized hydrogen. However, the three strongest emission lines in the nebula are singly ionized oxygen atoms, which emit at an ultraviolet <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> 372.7 nm, doubly-ionized oxygen atoms, which emit at a blue-green <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> 500.7 nm, and neutral hydrogen atoms, which emit the hydrogen-alpha line at a red <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> 656.2 nm.|$|R

5|$|An air-cuticle {{multilayer}} in {{the scales}} creates optical interference. Each scale contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that {{hold them in}} place and maintain an air gap between them. The layers and air gaps are narrower than the wavelength of visible light. The structure varies from one layer at the proximal end of each scale, to about six layers at the distal end. This multilayer structure strongly reflects certain <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> light, which {{are determined by the}} thicknesses of the layers and the angle at which the light hits the scale.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, the {{telescope}} surface was becoming badly corroded. In 2001–2003, {{the telescope}} was resurfaced, increasing its sensitivity at 5GHz {{by a factor}} of five. A holographic profiling technique was used on the surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> 5cm (compared to 18cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers.|$|E

30|$|The {{change in}} {{mitochondrial}} transmembrane potential (MTP) was determined using the cationic fluorescent indicator, JC- 1 (Molecular Probes Eugene, OR, USA).

The longer <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies.
