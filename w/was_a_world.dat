40|$|This paper {{discusses}} “inclusionism ” in {{the context}} of David Lewis’s modal realism (and {{in the context}} of parasitic accounts of modality such as John Divers’s agnosticism about possible worlds). This is the doctrine that everything <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world.</b> I argue that this doctrine would be beneficial to Divers-style agnosticism; that it suggests a reconfiguration of the concept of actuality in modal realism; and finally that it suffers from an as-yet unsolved difficulty, the problem of the unmarried husbands. This problem also shows that Stephen Yablo’s analysis of “intrinsic ” is inadequate. 1 Isolationism and inclusionism In his paper “Intrinsicness”, Stephen Yablo describes a revised version of David Lewis’s modal realism, incorporating the doctrine he calls inclusionism: that “Some worlds contain others as proper parts ” (Yablo 1999, p. 483). Which worlds might those be? Yablo’s inclusionist says that every world that properly contains anything has <b>a</b> <b>world</b> as <b>a</b> proper part; that is, every part of <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world,</b> every mereological fusion of <b>worlds</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world,</b> you <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>world,</b> I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>world,</b> for all intents and purposes, everything <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world.</b> 1 This view has several benefits. 1) Yablo is particularly interested in its surprising benefit of providing an anal-ysis of “intrinsic”.

5|$|At the New South Wales Championships in January 1997, Thorpe's time of 3min 59.43s in the 400m {{was eight}} seconds faster than his {{previous}} personal best; {{it made him}} the first 14-year-old to cover the distance {{in less than four}} minutes on Australian soil. Ranked fourth for the event countrywide, Thorpe went into the Australian Championships in Adelaide as a serious contender for selection in the national team for the 1997 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. With a top-three finish and a specific qualifying time required for selection, Thorpe focused on the 400m freestyle after injuries to world record holder Kieren Perkins and Daniel Kowalski; both had won Olympic medals in the event. Thorpe went on to win bronze behind 16-year-old Queenslander Grant Hackett, setting a new personal best of 3min 53.44s. The time <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> record for his age group and the race was the first of many battles with Hackett.|$|E

5|$|By a {{day after}} the storm made landfall, the record power outages were largely restored. However, salt damage {{prevented}} restoration in some areas for several days. The outages left residents temporarily without water after water pumps were shut down. In Hiroshima, lack of power caused traffic congestion, shut down banks, and disrupted hospitals. The widespread power outages related to Mireille prompted the government to reconstruct transmission towers with anemometer, or wind measurement devices. Following the storm, insurance companies paid $6billion to policy holders in Japan, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> record related to wind damage; this was surpassed {{less than a year later}} by Hurricane Andrew striking Florida. The typhoon still holds the title as the costliest non-Atlantic hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Cody Rhodes <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>World</b> Tag Team Champion {{throughout}} {{the beginning of}} 2008 alongside Hardcore Holly, who was acting as a mentor to him. Ted DiBiase made his first WWE appearance on the May 26 episode of Raw, in which he claimed that he and a mystery partner would take the World Tag Team Championship from Rhodes and Holly. At the Night of Champions pay-per-view event in June, DiBiase revealed his partner was running late and started the match without him, however Rhodes quickly betrayed Hardcore Holly by attacking him. This turned Rhodes into a villainous character and meant that he and DiBiase won the championship.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 16th century, the {{establishment}} of a harbour at the East Burn confirmed the town's early role as an important trading port. The town also began to develop around the salt, coal mining and nail making industries. The production of linen which followed in 1672 was later instrumental in the introduction of floorcloth in 1847 by linen manufacturer, Michael Nairn. In 1877 this in turn contributed to linoleum, which became the town's most successful industry: Kirkcaldy <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> producer until well into the mid-1960s. The town expanded considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, though the decline of the linoleum industry and other manufacturing restricted its growth thereafter.|$|E
5|$|It rained. The {{procession}} of weary soldiers became a bedraggled train, despondent and muttering, marching with churning effort in a trough of liquid brown mud under a low, wretched sky. Yet the youth smiled, for {{he saw that}} the world <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> for him, though many discovered it to be made of oaths and walking sticks. He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war. He turned now with a lover's thirst to images of tranquil skies, fresh meadows, cool brooks, an existence of soft and eternal peace.|$|E

The 9th Division boarded the ships during late January 1943, and the convoy operation began on 4 February. No contact was made between Allied and Japanese ships, and the 9th Division arrived in Australian ports during late February with no losses from enemy action.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> {{military}} and commercial power by 1625, {{competing in the}} Caribbean with the English. The Dutch wanted to establish a military stronghold in the area, and dispatched Captain Boudewijn Hendricksz (also known as Boudoyno Henrico or Balduino Enrico) to capture Puerto Rico. On September 24, 1625, Enrico arrived at the coast of San Juan with 17 ships and 2,000 men. Enrico {{sent a message to}} the governor of Puerto Rico, Juan de Haros, ordering him to surrender the island. De Haros refused; he was an experienced military man and expected an attack in the section known as Boqueron. He therefore had that area fortified. However, the Dutch took another route and landed in La Puntilla.|$|E
5|$|Trotsky and his {{supporters}} had been organised since 1923 as the Left Opposition. They opposed the bureaucratisation of the Soviet Union, which they analysed as being partly caused by the poverty and isolation of the Soviet economy. Stalin's theory of socialism in one country was developed in 1924 as an opposition to Trotsky's Theory of Permanent Revolution, which argued that capitalism <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> system and required a world revolution in order {{to replace it with}} socialism. Prior to 1924, the Bolsheviks' international perspective had been guided by Trotsky's position. Trotsky argued that Stalin's theory represented the interests of bureaucratic elements in direct opposition to the working class.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in 2008 when Dontnod Entertainment was formed. Initially called Adrift, the {{original}} concept {{of the game}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> flooded from global warming, with a key gameplay mechanic being the player character using jetskis to navigate a coastal city. Later, the team {{became interested in the}} concept of memory as a central theme and redesigned the game accordingly, although game director Jean-Maxime Moris was reluctant to set the game in Paris since the studio was based there. It was originally developed as a role-playing game with Sony publishing it exclusively for the PlayStation 3, starting full development in February 2010. Following creative disagreements between Dontnod and Sony, and the subsequent cancellation of the project in February 2011 because of budget cuts, the project was presented at the 2011 Gamescom trade fair in the hope that it would garner the attention necessary to secure another publishing deal. Capcom purchased the intellectual property in 2012 and provided funding for the project, reimagining it as an action-adventure game for release on multiple platforms.|$|E
