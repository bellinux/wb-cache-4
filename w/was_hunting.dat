5|$|A {{study of}} isotope data of La Brea dire wolf fossils dated 10,000YBP {{provides}} {{evidence that the}} horse was an important prey species at the time, and that sloth, mastodon, bison, and camel were less common in the dire wolf diet. This indicates that the dire wolf was not a prey specialist, and {{at the close of}} the late Pleistocene before its extinction it <b>was</b> <b>hunting</b> or scavenging the most available herbivores.|$|E
5|$|In the present, Carl {{has been}} accidentally {{shot by a}} man named Otis (Pruitt Taylor Vince), who <b>was</b> <b>hunting</b> for deer. Otis brings Rick, Carl and Shane to a {{veterinarian}} named Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson), for whom Otis works as a farm hand. Hershel lives with his daughters Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and Beth (Emily Kinney), Beth's boyfriend Jimmy (James Allen McCune), and Otis' wife Patricia (Jane McNeill). He treats Carl, but he reveals that the bullet was broken into six fragments. Rick must donate blood to Carl in order to keep him alive.|$|E

5|$|The Augustan History {{contains}} {{details of}} Zenobia's early life, although their credibility is doubtful. According to Augustan History, the queen's hobby {{as a child}} <b>was</b> <b>hunting.</b> Apparently not a commoner, she would have received an education appropriate for a noble Palmyrene girl. According to the Augustan History, {{in addition to her}} Palmyrene Aramaic mother tongue, Zenobia was reportedly fluent in Egyptian and Greek and spoke Latin. Around age 14 (c. 255) she became the second wife of Odaenathus, the ras (lord) of Palmyra.|$|E
5|$|The myth of Eshmun {{was related}} by {{the sixth century}} Syrian Neoplatonist philosopher Damascius and ninth century Patriarch of Constantinople, Photius. They recount that Eshmun, {{a young man from}} Beirut, <b>was</b> <b>hunting</b> in the woods when Astarte saw him and was {{stricken}} by his beauty. She harassed him with her amorous pursuit until he emasculated himself with an axe and died. The grieving goddess revived Eshmun and transported him to the heavens where she made him into a god of heaven.|$|E
5|$|Although Louis {{signed an}} {{alliance}} with the Republic of Genoa in October 1352, he did not intervene in the Genoese–Venetian War, because his truce of 1349 with Venice was still in force. Louis married Elizabeth of Bosnia, who {{was the daughter of}} his vassal, Stephen II, in 1353. Historian Gyula Kristó says that this marriage showed Louis's renewed interest in the affairs of the Balkan Peninsula. While he <b>was</b> <b>hunting</b> in Zólyom County (now in Slovakia) in late November 1353, a brown bear attacked him, inflicting 24 wounds on his legs. Louis's life was saved by a knight of the court, John Besenyő, who killed the beast with his sword.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Boone {{spent his}} early years on {{what was then the}} edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good {{relations}} with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone <b>was</b> <b>hunting</b> in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often that it became part of his popular image.|$|E
5|$|The Saw Mill River and its {{adjacent}} terrain conferred some tactical {{advantages to}} those who knew it. One skirmish began when a Patriot militiaman, Jake Acker, <b>was</b> <b>hunting</b> in a bushy area of the eastern flood plain at Elmsford. Spying {{a large group of}} British soldiers and Loyalist supporters on the road to Storm's tavern, Acker began sniping at them from his concealment. He fatally wounded one, changed his position amid the distraction, reloaded his musket, and killed another. Hearing the shots, other local Patriots came to Acker's aid, and eventually {{all but one of the}} larger force were killed or captured.|$|E
5|$|While Boone recovered, Shawnees kept {{up their}} attacks outside Boonesborough, {{destroying}} the surrounding cattle and crops. With {{the food supply}} running low, the settlers needed salt to preserve what meat they had, so in January 1778, Boone led a party of 30 men to the salt springs on the Licking River. On February 7, 1778, when Boone <b>was</b> <b>hunting</b> meat for the expedition, he was surprised and captured by warriors led by Blackfish. Because Boone's party was greatly outnumbered, Boone returned {{the next day with}} Blackfish and persuaded his men to surrender rather than put up a fight.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the American Revolutionary War continued. Boone joined General George Rogers Clark's {{invasion}} of the Ohio country in 1780, fighting in the Battle of Piqua on August 7. In October, when Boone <b>was</b> <b>hunting</b> with his brother Ned, Shawnees shot and killed Ned. Apparently thinking that they had killed Daniel Boone, the Shawnees beheaded Ned and took the head home as a trophy. In 1781, Boone traveled to Richmond to take his seat in the legislature, but British dragoons under Banastre Tarleton captured Boone and several other legislators near Charlottesville. The British released Boone on parole several days later. During Boone's term, Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown in October 1781, but the fighting continued in Kentucky unabated. Boone returned to Kentucky and in August 1782 fought in the Battle of Blue Licks, in which his son Israel was killed. In November 1782, Boone took part in another Clark expedition into Ohio, the last major campaign of the war.|$|E
5|$|On May 21, 1832, a small raiding party {{made up of}} some {{independent}} minded braves from Keokuk's village or the Fox {{village at}} Dubuque's Mines carried out a raid on the settlement at present-day Savanna, Illinois on the Plum River. The party originated west of the Mississippi River and were probably motivated {{by a desire to}} collect needed supplies. When the small raiding party arrived at the settlement they found it practically deserted: only three men were present. Of the six men originally at the settlement, three had left when the raiding party arrived: Blundell was away, Upton <b>was</b> <b>hunting</b> nearby, and Davidson had left the area in search of a horse. Of the three men left at the settlement, Hays and Goss were trying to round up livestock, while only Pierce remained at the blockhouse. Pierce heard a dog barking outside and looked up to see a small band of Native Americans creeping along the river's edge. He immediately sounded the alarm and Hays and Goss sprinted for the blockhouse. Gunshots started to explode behind the men as they approached the protection of their makeshift fortification.|$|E

Additionally, P. pallidus is known to cause extensive damage to rice crops.|$|R
50|$|Greater scaup are {{a popular}} game bird in North America and Europe. They <b>are</b> <b>hunted</b> in Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, and in Iran for both sport and {{commercial}} reasons. Greater scaup <b>are</b> <b>hunted</b> with shotguns because {{they must be}} shot on the fly, a challenging task, as they can fly at up to 121 km/h. Greater scaup <b>are</b> <b>hunted</b> from shorelines and in open water hunting blinds or layout boats, low-profile kayak-like boats that hunters lie inside. Hunters frequently use decoys to attract the birds, often arranged to simulate a raft of greater scaup and featuring an open area to attract the birds to land. In most countries where greater scaup <b>are</b> <b>hunted,</b> a duck stamp is required along with the normal <b>hunting</b> licences that <b>are</b> required to pursue other game. In America and Canada, waterfowl must <b>be</b> <b>hunted</b> with non-toxic shot.|$|R

25|$|At first Faringdon's {{relationship}} with King Henry VIII of England {{seems to have}} been supportive. King Henry was his guest on 30 January 1521, and he later became one of the royal chaplains. Among Henry's New Year gifts in 1532 was £20 in a white leather purse to the Abbot of Reading.

25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1904-1905, Wada <b>was</b> <b>hunting</b> seals along the Beaufort Sea. He was {{accompanied}} by several Indians. In August 1906, {{he was back in}} Nome. He promptly lost the money he'd made selling pelts in a card game, and he was arrested yet again, this time because some of the money he'd lost belonged to his Indian companions. The two Indians testified against him, but an all-white jury acquitted him anyway. Wada was arrested a third time, in Candle, on the same charges, and he {{spent the rest of the}} year in and out of court.|$|E

Animal pelts were exported in large numbers. In 1985 Mongolia exported more than 1 million small hides, which included some of the 763,400 marmot pelts, 23,800 squirrel skins, 3,700 wolf skins, and other furs. Marmot also <b>was</b> <b>hunted</b> for its fat, which was processed industrially. Mongolian gazelles <b>were</b> <b>hunted</b> for their meat, and red deer, for their antler velvet. Organized hunting of wild sheep was a foreign tourist attraction.|$|R
