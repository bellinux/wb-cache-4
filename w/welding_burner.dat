40|$|Iron sand is sand {{deposits}} containing {{particles of}} iron ore (magnetite) found along the coast. Sponge iron is obtained from direct reduction of iron ore at a temperature below its melting point, using natural gas or gas reductant of coal or solid reductant such as coal. Sponge {{is also known}} as DRI (Directly reduced Iron) or substitute scrap (scrap substitute) in accordance with its function substitute scrap-iron in the steel industry. Sponge is some product manufacture of steel through a direct reduction process, the steel-making process flow of sponge through the burner welding asitelin. In this study is made of sponge iron from iron sand beaches raw materials Asemdoyong, Pemalang. This process uses the raw material composite pellets are made from a mixture of fine iron ore, coal, slag-forming materials and adhesives. From sampling 15 kg of sand, iron sand obtained 3. 5634 kg, the percentage 23. 75 %. Sieving 100 mesh, obtained 2. 3630 kg, the percentage of 15. 75 %. Briquettes are made as much as 3 kg, with a composition of 75 % iron sand as 2. 25 kg, 20 % charcoal as much as 0. 6 kg, and aci 5 % as much as 0. 15 kg. Briquettes produced weighing 44. 47 grams per briquette. Carbon is used charcoal which serves as a reductant. Reduction of <b>welding</b> <b>burner</b> asitelin obtained sponge iron with varying weight, 12. 16 g, 15. 15 g and 16. 61 g. Results of testing the composition of the AAS method, the composition of the raw materials obtained 52. 12 % Fe, 8. 10 % C, 1. 94 % Si, and 2. 18 % Mg. While the sponge iron is composed of 62. 46 % Fe, 2. 70 % C, 0. 85 % Si, and 1. 43 % Mg. From the data shown a significant increase in Fe content of 10. 34 %, and is accompanied by a decrease in the levels of impurities in the iron sand...|$|E

40|$|Sponge iron is {{a product}} in the {{manufacture}} of steel that through the process of direct reduction of iron sand. Steel making process flow through the sponge starts from iron sand made pellet or briquettes {{in the shape of a}} reduction to sponge with the <b>welding</b> asitelin <b>burner.</b> In this research is made of sponge iron which raw materials iron sand from Suweru beach Jepara. Briquettes are made from a mixture of iron sand 75 %, 20 % carbon, and 5 % tapioca flour as gluten. From taking of sand beach Suweru 5 kg, obtained 3, 3875 kg of iron sand from extraction process with permanent magnet as much as 2 - 3 times. After the extraction process, sieving process is carried out using a 100 mesh, obtained 2. 2710 kg. So that it can be seen levels of iron sand beach Suweru was 67, 75 % and 45, 42 % are raw material that ready for production. Furthermore, the raw material mixing 2, 25 kg of iron sand, 0, 6 % carbon (charcoal) and 0. 15 kg of gluten (tapioca flour) with a total weight of 3 kg resulting in ± 70 briquette iron sand through the process of compacting the weight range of 43 grams per briquette. From sampling 3 briquette iron sand is reduced, resulting sponge iron by weight of 13, 98 grams, 14, 83 grams and 17. 97 grams that can be known percentage yield of 36. 68 % reduction process. Results of testing the composition of the AAS method, the composition of the raw materials obtained 1. 63 % Mg, 2. 63 % Si, 7. 30 % C, and 49. 90 % Fe. However, after the reduction process, the composition of the sponge iron 1. 4 % Mg, 1. 42 % Si, 1. 90 % C, and 64. 12 % Fe. From the data shown a significant increase in Fe content of 14. 22 %, and is accompanied by a decrease in the levels of impurities in the iron sand...|$|R

But the longer the engergy reserves dwindling oil is characterized by an increase in the price of LPG gas, it will trigger up its business costs among SMEs, as well as rising prices {{will have an impact on}} the economic {{needs of the}} community. The objective is to get a prototype of bioethol-fueled stoves for small industrial <b>burner.</b> <b>Welding</b> is the process of switching material by using heat energy to become one with or without pressure. The process of cutting these plates can be done in various cutting techniques according to their individual needs and cutting techniques according to their individual needs. The design of this stove is a stove under 3 inch diameter with a height of 3 cm which serves as a reactor / reagent which can already be used to cook over medium heat. Furnace for 3 inch diameter with a height of 3 cm donut-shaped, 1 inch diameter center hole, and there is a hole in the middle of the capillary tube measuring 3 mm in diameter serves to release the steam generated by the burner...|$|R
