It would have been important to know, for instance, how and <b>what</b> <b>on</b> terms she came to hold the estates mentioned in her will. Those at Newnham Murren and Linslade were previously granted to her by King Edgar and now returned to the royal family, but {{it is impossible to}} determine which of the other estates were part of her dower property and which were inherited or acquired otherwise. As noted earlier, a case has been made for Princes Risborough as having been passed on through the maternal line. If the other holdings were likewise her own, the rehabilitation of her position may have come at a great price, one which considerably enriched the royal family with land north of the Thames.|$|E

[...] His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase: [...] "Lena nearly flew at me for being so stupid. She says, 'Stroma? <b>What</b> <b>on</b> earth are you going to do with an island?'".

2500|$|As amended, Article 2 {{provides}} that everyone {{born on the}} island of Ireland has the right {{to be a part of}} the 'Irish Nation'. The apparent intention is partly to allow the people of Northern Ireland, if they wish, to feel included in the 'nation' without making what might be perceived as a revanchist claim. However, it has been argued that [...] "the new Article 2 of the Irish constitution gave northern nationalists nothing". After all, Article 9 of the Constitution of Ireland governs Irish citizenship. It {{provides that}} the [...] "future loss and acquisition of Irish nationality and citizenship shall be determined in accordance with law". Since it was [...] further amended in 2004, Article 9 now also provides that [...] "otwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution, a person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, who does not have, at the time of the birth of that person, at least one parent who is an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen is not entitled to Irish citizenship or nationality, unless provided for by law."
