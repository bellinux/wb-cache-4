5|$|With Misery we had {{the luxury}} of doing a two-day shoot, which is totally luxurious these days. And <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not having any rules. It was very much on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in there. We were there for two days and it was like an art project.|$|E
500|$|Hetrick {{felt that}} the move away from TNG gave Vash more independence, and she enjoyed the new {{relationship}} between Vash and Quark, calling them [...] "kindred spirits". [...] She was also pleased {{to be working with}} de Lancie again. [...] "I love the way they write for John, and I loved the stuff <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> together in 'Q-Less'", she said. Hetrick underwent ten hours of make-up for the sequence where Q shows Vash what could have happened if he did not save her life following an insect bite in the Gamma Quadrant. [...] The experience left her with a newfound appreciation for not having to wear prosthetics like other members of the cast.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the race, the Serbian team filed a protest claiming that Čavić touched the wall first but did not use enough force to trigger the timing sensor. Officials of the International Swimming Federation (FINA) watched the video in slow motion, and announced that Phelps' victory would be upheld. Ben Ekumbo, a FINA referee announced that [...] "It's very clear that the Serbian swimmer touched second after Michael Phelps." [...] Although Serbia conceded their protest, not everyone was convinced that Phelps had won the gold medal; Branislav Jevtić, Serbia's deputy chef de mission for all sports, was quoted as saying [...] "in my opinion, it's not right, but we must follow the rules. Everybody saw what happened." [...] In one interview following the race, Čavić said [...] "I am completely happy with where I am", while in another he revealed that he expects that [...] "people will be bringing this up for years and saying you (Čavić) won that race. If <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this again, I would win it". While the result is still controversial, a high speed photograph shows Phelps touching the wall, while Čavić is still a short distance away. In April 2015, Spitz said that he had been sent an email posted by Omega which stated that Phelps had lost the 100m butterfly final.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{evidence}} {{enough for}} us to go for Craig, though! What <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is <b>to</b> get a confession out of him, somehow!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess we}} are all too lame to go ashore among those snakes," [...] said Giant, with a short laugh. [...] "But <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something," [...] he added, seriously.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be so cheerful," [...] said Shep. [...] "Boys, <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{some nice}} {{work with the}} oars, or else ship a lot of water," [...] he added, gazing out on the black and angry lake.|$|R
2500|$|Now, Mr. President, / We haven't always {{agreed in}} the past, I know, / But that ain't at all {{important}} now. / What {{is important is}} what <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> / We got to lick Mr. Hitler, and until we do, / Other things can wait.// ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s, the Beatles were officially derided in the USSR as the [...] "belch of Western culture" [...] {{and in the}} 1980s McCartney was refused {{permission}} to play there. According to The Moscow Times, when McCartney finally got to play the song at his Back in the World tour in Moscow's Red Square in May 2003 {{at the age of}} 60, [...] "the crowd went wild". When asked about the song before the concert McCartney said he had known little about the Soviet Union when he wrote it. [...] "It was a mystical land then," [...] he said. [...] "It's nice to see the reality. I always suspected that people had big hearts. Now I know that's true." [...] "Finally <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that one here," [...] he said after the song.|$|E
6000|$|... "His connection!" [...] said Mrs. Coombes scornfully. [...] "That's what he's always a-saying. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lie down, lads," [...] Des Valles shouted, and {{all set to}} work to loop-hole the wall. [...] "Don't {{show your}} heads above it, unless they advance again. All <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is <b>to</b> hold our ground." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh!' {{said the}} boy, colouring. 'One of her romantic ideas! I tried to {{convince}} her so, but I didn't succeed. However, what <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> is, <b>to</b> succeed to-night, Mr Headstone, {{and then all the}} rest follows.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is a {{fortnight}} to-day since you came in, Cuthbert," [...] she answered, quietly. [...] "Thank God you are quite out of danger now, and the doctor says all <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is <b>to</b> build you up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What have <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with that}} now?" [...] he asked. [...] "You have made your {{inquiries}} {{to prove the}} correctness of my statement--haven't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Massie!" [...] exclaimed Bob, {{while the}} others looked at the {{documents}} in speechless astonishment. [...] "What have <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with him? We don't owe him any money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you be so}} good as {{to tell me what}} you're talking about?" [...] Delia enquired sternly. [...] "Where is it {{printed and}} what have <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Talk is helpful, talk is needful," [...] {{the young}} man was saying, [...] "but what <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is <b>to</b> lift the subject out of the furrow of indisciplined talk and place it on the threshing-floor of {{practical}} discussion." ...|$|R
60|$|STRAPPER. <b>We</b> aint <b>got</b> nothin <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with that. This is the man, aint he? [pointing to Blanco].|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, you, Liz. Why can't you let bygones be bygones? Why can't you, as Mr Headstone {{said to me}} {{this very}} evening about another matter, leave well alone? What <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> is, <b>to</b> turn our faces full in our new direction, and keep {{straight}} on.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We got to {{stay out}} here, Cap. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. They ain't no other way. The Governor wants to travel alone, and he's fixed so he can outvote us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get aht!" [...] said another. [...] "What's cover {{against this}} 'ere 'eat? Sticks to cook yer! What <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{is to go}} as near as the ground'll let us, and then drive a trench." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We needn't {{worry about}} thet," [...] said the other, positively. [...] "He's hard hit, I tell y'u. All <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is find thet bloody trail again an' stick to it--goin' careful. He's layin' low like a {{crippled}} wolf." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Reckon <b>we</b> haven't <b>got</b> much <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it," [...] said another, half laughing, half rueful. [...] "There's {{some things}} Abe won't stand." ...|$|R
6000|$|That evening Adeline {{said to her}} sister, {{at the end of}} the meagre dinner {{they allowed}} {{themselves}} in these days, [...] "Elbridge says the hay is giving out, and <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something about those horses that are eating their heads off in the barn. And the cows: there's hardly any feed for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid, Bill, that I can't {{explain all}} this to you, for I am not {{accustomed}} to talk about such things. My mother talks to me sometimes, and of course I went to church regularly; but that's different from my talking about it; {{but you know what}} <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is <b>to</b> try and please God, and love him because he loves us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's good, Huck. When {{they don't}} fight it's only {{a sign that}} there's trouble around, you know. All <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it. We'll drop this thing for to-day, and play. Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what have}} <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with either the}} Latin or the Greek pilgrims?" [...] Jack asked. [...] "I should have thought that we were quite bothered enough with Latin and Greek verses, without having {{anything}} to do with pilgrims. Besides, I didn't know there were any Latins now, and the Greeks ain't much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's that or go," [...] she said. [...] "There ain't a livin' {{for us on}} {{the farm}} any more, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> somethin'. If there was {{anything}} else I could do! But I've thought it out and thought it out, and I guess there ain't anything I can do but take boarders--if I can get them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon so, too," [...] {{the latter}} agreed. [...] "It {{will be a}} job to get our horses over; but <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it anyhow, {{if we have to}} carry them." [...] The animals, however, managed to {{scramble}} up the rocks that filled the cañon to the height of some thirty feet. The distance between the rock walls was not more than this in width.|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in this world, Robina," [...] I said, [...] "is to {{take people}} as they are, and {{make the best of}} them. We cannot expect {{everybody}} to be just as we would have them, and maybe we should not like them any better if they were. Don't bother yourself about how much nicer they might be; think how nice they are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't hurry," [...] James shouted. [...] "There is no {{occasion}} for haste. They can go {{faster than we}} can. All <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is <b>to</b> beat them off. Lay in all the oars, except the two bow oars, in each boat. All {{the rest of the}} men stand to their arms, and let the boats follow each other in file, the bow of one close to the stern of that ahead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain't pretty. It ain't right. D'ye {{know what}} we was fightin' for? A hundred bucks. Think of it! An' the game is <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> our best to put our man down for the count because of the fans has bet on us. Sweet, ain't it? Well, that's my last fight. It {{finishes}} me deado. Never again for yours truly.|$|E
6000|$|... "An' {{next week}} <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{it all over}} again," [...] he said sadly. [...] "An' what's the good of it all, hey? Sometimes I wish I was a hobo. They don't work, an' they get their livin'. Gee! I wish I had a glass of beer; but I can't get up the gumption {{to go down to}} the village an' get it. You'll stay over, an' send your books dawn by express, or else you're a damn fool." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You go----Nix, nix, Hawk, don't hit him; he ain't worth it. You go to hell, brother," [...] {{said the}} manager, mechanically. But he took Carl aside, and groaned: [...] "Gosh! <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something! It's worth two {{thousand}} dollars to us, you know. Besides, we haven't got enough cash in our jeans {{to get out of}} town, and we'll miss the big Riverport purse.... Still, suit yourself, old man. Maybe I can get some money by wiring to Chicago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will hit}} {{you in the}} eye, Tom Jackson, if you don't shut up; you are as bad as a girl; I am ashamed of you. Now, what <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> is <b>to</b> find some sort of shelter, either a wall or bush, and we must keep on until we come to something. Keep awake, Jimmy; we shan't have much farther to go, {{and then you can}} lie down quietly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} should push the boat off when we landed, {{and it would}} float down past the town before daylight. The chances are that the boatmen, finding that they are no losers by the affair, would make no {{complaint}} to the authorities; {{but even if they}} did, we should be far beyond their reach by that time. All <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is <b>to</b> choose a really dark night, with wind and rain.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll 'ave a quiet little life. Now go out a bit--now come 'ome again. Read a book {{perhaps if}} <b>we</b> <b>got</b> nothing else <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> 'Ave old Buggins {{in for an}} evening at times. 'Ave Sid down. There's bicycles----" ...|$|R
