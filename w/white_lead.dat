In contrast, the <b>white</b> <b>lead</b> found in Dutch paintings from 1600–1660 had polonium-210 values of 0.23±0.27 and radium-226 values of 0.40±0.47.|$|E
5|$|Han van Meegeren {{knew that}} <b>white</b> <b>lead</b> was used during Vermeer’s time, {{but of course}} he had to obtain his stocks through the modern colour trade, which had changed {{significantly}} since the 17th century. During Vermeer’s time, Dutch lead was mined from deposits located in the Low Countries; however, by the 19th century, most lead was imported from Australia and the Americas, and differed from the <b>white</b> <b>lead</b> that Vermeer would have used both in the isotope composition of the lead and in the content of trace elements found in the ores. Dutch <b>white</b> <b>lead</b> was extracted from ores containing high levels of trace elements of silver and antimony, while the modern <b>white</b> <b>lead</b> used by Van Meegeren contained neither silver nor antimony, as those elements are separated from the lead during the modern smelting process.|$|E
5|$|The main lead-bearing mineral is galena (PbS), {{which is}} mostly found with zinc ores. Most other lead {{minerals}} {{are related to}} galena in some way; boulangerite, Pb5Sb4S11, is a mixed sulfide derived from galena; anglesite, PbSO4, {{is a product of}} galena oxidation; and cerussite or <b>white</b> <b>lead</b> ore, PbCO3, is a decomposition product of galena. Arsenic, tin, antimony, silver, gold, copper, and bismuth are common impurities in lead minerals.|$|E

5|$|Forgeries {{in which}} modern lead or <b>white</b> <b>lead</b> pigment {{has been used}} can be {{recognized}} by using a technique called Pb(Lead)-210-Dating. Pb-210 is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of lead {{that is part of}} the uranium-238 Radioactive decay series, and has a half-life of 22.3 years. To determine the amount of Pb-210, the alpha radiation emitted by another element, polonium-210 (Po-210), is measured. Thus it is possible to estimate the age of a painting, within a few years' span, by extrapolating the Pb-210 content present in the paint used to create the painting.|$|E
5|$|Vinegar {{was known}} early in civilization {{as the natural}} result of {{exposure}} of beer and wine to air, because acetic acid-producing bacteria are present globally. The use of acetic acid in alchemy extends into the 3rd century BC, when the Greek philosopher Theophrastus described how vinegar acted on metals to produce pigments useful in art, including <b>white</b> <b>lead</b> (lead carbonate) and verdigris, a green mixture of copper salts including copper(II) acetate. Ancient Romans boiled soured wine to produce a highly sweet syrup called sapa. Sapa that was produced in lead pots was rich in lead acetate, a sweet substance also called sugar of lead or sugar of Saturn, which contributed to lead poisoning among the Roman aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|With the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, lead {{poisoning}} became {{common in the}} work setting. The introduction of lead paint for residential use in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead; for millennia before this, most lead exposure had been occupational. An important step {{in the understanding of}} childhood {{lead poisoning}} occurred when toxicity in children from lead paint was recognized in Australia in 1897. France, Belgium, and Austria banned <b>white</b> <b>lead</b> interior paints in 1909; the League of Nations followed suit in 1922. However, in the United States, laws banning lead house paint were not passed until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of <b>white</b> <b>lead,</b> Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E

25|$|In 1823, a local {{businessman}} {{had established}} a manufactory for <b>white</b> <b>lead</b> in the emerging city of Brooklyn.

Much of Leavitt's wealth derived from his early investment in lead manufacturing and importing.|$|E

25|$|Two of {{the first}} {{synthetic}} pigments were <b>white</b> <b>lead</b> (basic lead carbonate, (PbCO3)2Pb(OH)2) and blue frit (Egyptian Blue). <b>White</b> <b>lead</b> is made by combining lead with vinegar (acetic acid, CH3COOH) {{in the presence of}} CO2. Blue frit is calcium copper silicate and was made from glass colored with a copper ore, such as malachite. These pigments were used as early as the second millennium BCE Later premodern additions to the range of synthetic pigments included vermillion, verdigris and lead-tin-yellow.|$|E

25|$|To further {{enhance the}} desired pale complexion, women layered white make-up on their faces. This make-up, called Ceruse, {{was made up}} of <b>white</b> <b>lead</b> and vinegar. Women wearing ceruse {{achieved}} the white face, however, the <b>white</b> <b>lead</b> that was used to make it is poisonous. Women in this time often contracted lead poisoning which resulted in deaths before the age of 50. Other ingredients used as make-up were sulfur, alum, and tin ash. In addition to using make-up to achieve the pale complexion, women in this era were bled to take the color out of their faces.|$|E
5000|$|Leonardo da Vinci first coated {{the wall}} with a coat of plaster. [...] He then added {{a thin layer of}} calcium carbonate, magnesium, and animal glue to aid in binding. [...] After this, Leonardo added a primer coat of <b>lead</b> <b>white.</b> [...] <b>Lead</b> <b>white</b> was {{commonly}} used in Renaissance era paintings, but rarely used in frescoes. The issues with <b>lead</b> <b>white</b> in frescoes are that the large quantities can be highly toxic and, as it oxidizes, it turns a brownish color of lead dioxide. [...] Leonardo used red chalk and black paint on top of the <b>lead</b> <b>white</b> to sketch out his image, before adding countless layers of his custom mixed pigments. [...] Leonardo used a series of translucent glazes to finish the frescoes.|$|R

As a finely divided powder, it was also sprinkled on dielectric surfaces to study Lichtenberg figures.|$|E

25|$|The {{coloration}} of {{the facade}} has been altered several times since {{the completion of}} the new northern row in 1695. Tessin's first coloration was brick-red plater with white-painted sandstone details.

Carl Hårleman took over {{as the head of the}} building site when Tessin died in 1728.

25|$|In {{subsequent}} centuries, {{the city}} {{became a part}} of many states and civilizations including the Hittites, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, Seleucids and Lagids.

Apart from its natural harbor and strategic position along the trade routes of southern Anatolia, the city profited from trade in molybdenum (<b>white</b> <b>lead)</b> from the neighbouring mines of Coreyra. Ancient sources attributed the best molybdenum to the city, which also minted its own coins.|$|E
