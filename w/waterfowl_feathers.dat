40|$|Badminton {{shuttlecock}} {{is constructed}} of 16 goose feathers from a waterfowl with a hemispherical cork. The shuttlecock is light in mass (approximately 5. 2 g), {{with a highly}} specific air resistance. For professional badminton players, the highest initial speed of the shuttlecock by a smash shot exceeds over 80 m/s, which is the fastest speed in all ball sports. Generally, {{it is extremely difficult}} to get the shuttlecock to speeds of over 30 m/s with a launching machine without breaking the <b>waterfowl</b> <b>feathers.</b> In this study, a shuttlecock launching machine using two turn rollers for badminton exercises has been developed with a new launcher mechanism that includes an advanced holder device and a high rotational speed motor installed. In addition, a continuous launcher system which is able to discharge the 12 (maximum 96) shuttlecocks continuously at intervals of 1. 5 seconds was designed. The results of the launching experiments using the two roller-type badminton machine show that the machine can launch the shuttlecock at mean initial speeds of up to 81. 8 m/s, with a maximum flight distance of over 11 m. The standard deviation of the shot and lateral directions are approximately 0. 34 m and 0. 12 m, respectively. The launching performance of the badminton machine developed here has a performance far exceeding almost any commercial one, so the badminton machine can be used for harder practice by professional badminton players...|$|E

5000|$|Originally, Suisun Marsh {{was a vast}} {{stretch of}} tidal {{wetlands}} broken by branching tidal channels and ponds. The area alternately flooded and drained with {{the rise and fall}} of the tides. In winter, the ponds supported high numbers of migratory waterfowl. From the years of the Gold Rush to about 1880, the marsh was extensively used by market hunters to provide fresh <b>waterfowl</b> and <b>feathers</b> to San Francisco markets. From the 1880s until the 1930s, however, this area was gradually converted to agriculture, made possible by the construction of levees and dikes to hold back the water. Eventually, increasing soil salinity made cultivation and even cattle grazing unprofitable and cultivation ceased on all wetland areas. Most of the marsh was then purchased by public and private interests as habitat for waterfowl, mainly to support hunting. Later, the construction of water development projects (specifically, the federal Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project) in the Sacramento-San Joaquin watersheds altered the natural salinity regime of the marsh, making it more saline. In an effort to maintain the wetlands, the marsh landowners sought legislation to preserve the area from residential or commercial development. In addition, they pursued relief from the impacts of the water projects on the salinity regime of the marsh. As a result, the parties entered into agreements to offset the impacts of the water projects on the managed wetlands. Today, Suisun Marsh supports a diversity of fish, wildlife and plants, including a large population of river otters, a number of native fish species, and birds ranging from marsh wrens to American white pelicans. Rush Ranch has only been recently acquired and is managed for both historic and biological values.http://geolit.org/rushranch/rushranch.htm However, its habitats are being enhanced and many tidal marsh plants and animals can be seen there.|$|R
40|$|The ecology, behavior, {{and life}} history {{strategies}} of waterfowl are inseparably linked to that unique avian attribute, <b>feathers.</b> <b>Waterfowl</b> rely on flight capabilities to migrate, to fully exploit {{the resources of}} wetland and upland communities, and to escape life-threatening events. The insulation provided by contour and down <b>feathers</b> allows <b>waterfowl</b> to use {{a wide range of}} habitats and protects them from temperature extremes. Plumage is important not only for species recognition during courtship, but also for cryptic coloration of females during incubation. However, feathers become worn and must be periodically replaced. The process of feather renewal, or molt, is a critical event in the lives of birds. Despite the obvious importance of the molt, relatively little attention has been devoted to managing waterfowl during this period. Unlike most birds, ducks, geese, and swans share the unusual trait of a complete, simultaneous wing molt that renders them flightless for 3 to 5 weeks during the post-breeding period. Concurrently, these waterfowl also renew their tail and body feathers. In addition to this post-breeding molt, ducks undergo a second yearly molt to renew all but their flight feathers. Here, I describe the nutrition, energetics, and management of molting adult ducks and geese, with emphasis on the period of molt when birds are flightless...|$|R
