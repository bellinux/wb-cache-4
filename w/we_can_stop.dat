500|$|In an interview, Kiefer Sutherland {{revealed}} that Redemption {{was inspired by}} the Rwandan Genocide and the U.S. Government's response to it. [...] "The truth is, {{one of the things that}} was said in the prequel, which I think has been a massive problem with how the Western world has dealt with Africa, no one can justify going there, because they have no viable reason– meaning oil or money. Here [...] response is a human one. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> a genocide. I think that that's something that Bill Clinton apologized for not doing with Rwanda and we centered a show around that." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Aronofsky {{reflected}} on the reception of The Fountain, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} Fountain-haters out [...] The film's about the fact that it's OK that we die, and we should come to terms with it. But many, many people don't want to think about that, so why pay money for a meditation on losing someone you love? Everything about western culture denies that." [...] He also believed the film was released at the wrong time, [...] "It was pre-Obama, {{smack in the middle of}} Paris Hilton time. But there has been a serious turn now, people are starting to realise that the party's over, finally. So <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> thinking about the culture of superficiality, start to remember there are other things going on." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Women Under Siege Project {{was begun}} by Gloria Steinem in 2012 {{in order to}} {{document}} violence against women taking place during violent conflicts. The idea was inspired by two books: Sexual Violence Against Jewish Women During the Holocaust by Sonja M. Hedgepeth and Rochelle Saidel and At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape and Resistance - a New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to Black Power by Danielle McGuire. After reading these two books which addressed sexual violence, Steinem wondered if there were {{lessons to be learned}} from both history and current affairs; and also, if information were more widely available and people were aware of the issues, if rape and gender-based violence could be prevented in the future. She has said that [...] "suffering has to be visible and not called inevitable or blamed on the victim before <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yuan Shao {{had sent}} his general Chunyu Qiong to guard his army's supply depot at Wuchao (烏巢; {{southeast}} of present-day Yanjin County, Henan). One night, Cao Cao led {{a raid on}} Wuchao to destroy Yuan Shao's supplies. When news {{of the attack on}} Wuchao reached Yuan Shao's camp, Zhang He advised Yuan, [...] "Lord Cao's forces are well-trained so they'll definitely defeat Chunyu Qiong. If Chunyu Qiong is defeated, all is lost for you, General. You should immediately despatch forces to reinforce Wuchao." [...] Yuan Shao's adviser Guo Tu disagreed with Zhang He, [...] "Zhang He's idea isn't right. Why don't we attack Cao Cao's main camp instead? He'll definitely head back to defend his camp. In this way, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> the attack on Wuchao without having to send reinforcements there." [...] Zhang He replied, [...] "Lord Cao's camp is well-defended and can't be conquered easily. If Chunyu Qiong is taken captive, we'll all become prisoners-of-war." [...] Yuan Shao despatched a detachment of light cavalry to reinforce Wuchao and sent heavily armed forces to attack Cao Cao's main camp. Cao Cao succeeded in destroying Yuan Shao's supplies at Wuchao, while his main camp successfully resisted Yuan's attacks. Cao Cao scored an overall decisive victory over Yuan Shao in the battle.|$|E
