The cybernetic arguments of Stafford Beer in his 1974 CBC Massey Lectures, Designing Freedom – that intelligent adaptive planning can increase freedom – are of interest in this regard, as is the technical work of Herbert A. Simon and Albert Ando on the dynamics of hierarchical nearly decomposable systems in economics – namely, that everything in such a system is not tightly coupled to everything else.|$|E

He argued that dismissing Titanic as fodder for 15-year-old girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: [...] "that [...] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone—including teenage boys." [...] Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males {{under the age of}} 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like Iron Man, it is common for boys and men to deny liking Titanic. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. [...] "It's this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make) Titanic an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe," [...] he stated. [...] "Titanic has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe.</b> It's a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie for everyone else too." ...|$|E
500|$|Debut {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest albums of 1993 and the 1990s in general. In 2013, John Hamilton of Idolator called the album [...] "highly influential", and wrote [...] "in spite of its advancing age, Debuts futurism has aged exquisitely." [...] The album has also been credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic music into mainstream pop. Stereogum's Tom Breihan wrote: [...] "House music didn't quite have critical respect before Björk came along, and plenty of American writers didn't know what to make of the sound of Debut when it came out. [...] Debut didn't just establish Björk; it helped make sounds like that cool to a segment of the music-dork universe that might've remained deaf to its charms otherwise. At this point, it's virtually impossible to imagine a big publication slamming an adventurous dance-pop album for [...] "cheap electronic gimmickry," [...] and Debut is a big part of that change." [...] Celebrating the album's twenty-year anniversary, Emily Mackay of NME wrote the album [...] "put the lie to the post-grunge assumption that heartfelt, passionate solo artistry came in the form of acoustic guitar and heartbreak, creating a new breed of singer-songwriter." [...] Dubbing it an [...] "influential masterpiece", she found influences of the album in the work of musicians such as M.I.A., Grimes, These New Puritans and Tune-Yards, writing: [...] "It's in fascinatingly individual artists like those that you'll find [...] influence — not, as many <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe,</b> in every pretty-faced girl with a big voice." [...] Mackay also noted that the album's legacy echoes through dance-pop artists like Lady Gaga and Robyn.|$|E

[...] He wrote that [...] "Losts tradition of opening the year with a killer, capture-the-imagination sequence is honored and upheld, though the thing I loved most was how it was brazenly frank (and engagingly funny) about the heady high-concept conceit that will define the season." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety concluded that [...] "Lost … approaches its twists with {{what appears to be a}} greater degree of intellectual rigor than almost anything else on primetime. [...] Even when it's difficult to keep track of the myriad connections, a sense lingers that somebody knows—which is strangely reassuring." [...] Despite being more interested in the romantic aspirations of the show's characters, Jennifer Godwin of E! remarked that [...] "the Lost mythology is a miracle to behold. [...] It's grandiose, compelling, gaspworthy and, despite what the haters <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe,</b> altogether satisfying". [...] Katherine Nichols of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin enjoyed the opening scene, [...] "but the rest of it didn't capture [...] as [...] hoped it would", citing high expectations due to the eight-month hiatus after the fourth season finale and a possible [...] "yearning for more character-driven stories over machinations revolving around time travel, however clever they might be." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV said that [...] "the opening scene itself will leave your mouth wide open and you'll probably forget to close it for a few minutes." [...] He also wrote the premiere episodes [...] "are vintage Lost, full of some unbelievable twists and a whole lot of groundwork". [...] H.T.

2500|$|Telecom {{failed to}} reach their self-imposed goal of around 83,333 {{wholesale}} broadband customers {{by the end of}} 2005. During her opening address to parliament, Prime Minister Helen Clark criticised the state of the internet in New Zealand. This was followed by extensive criticism in the media such as in two high-profile television programmes, in two episodes of Campbell Live (whose past major sponsors include Telecom), during which CEO Theresa Gattung was challenged by host John Campbell, and an episode of the New Zealand edition of Sunday. Critical articles had been published by various magazines and newspapers, including the largest newspaper, The New Zealand Herald. Of significance, many of these were lengthy and high-profile articles compared to many previous articles critical of Telecom— among the most noticeable of these was published by the National Business Review, in which it was stated that [...] "Far from being 'Xtraordinary', as its multimillion dollar advertising <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe,</b> Telecom is strangling the nation’s advancement." [...] While in Wellington for an ICANN meeting, Vint Cerf was reported to have made a personal visit to David Cunliffe, the telecommunications minister where it is believed he recommended that Telecom be unbundled. The government investigated whether it needed to force Telecom to unbundle the network, thereby allowing other companies access and improving broadband service for consumers.|$|E

He was in that distant other world of Checkshill, the world of parks and gardens, the world of sunlit emotions and Nettie. His appearance here was disconcerting. I was taken by surprise. I was too tired and hungry to think clearly, and the hard implication of our antagonism prevailed with me. In the tumult of my passed emotions I had thought constantly of conflicts, confrontations, deeds of violence, and now the memory of these things took possession of me as though they were irrevocable resolutions.|$|E

6000|$|He {{stared at}} me in a rapture with the matchless music, and then uttered all his adoration and despair in one word. [...] "Damn!" [...] he said, and no more.

As I have suggested in my own case, it did not matter much whether you brought anything to the feast or not. If he liked you he liked being with you, not for what he got, but for what he gave. He was fond of one man whom I recall as the most silent man I ever met.

60|$|The point is, {{that because}} {{a thing is}} unusual or {{interesting}} {{it is not necessarily}} false, as my dogmatic critics <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe.</b> I have studied animals, not as species but as individuals, and have recorded some things which other and better naturalists have overlooked; but I have sought for facts, first of all, as zealously as any biologist, and have recorded only what I have every reason to believe is true. That these facts are unusual means simply that we have at last found natural history to be interesting, just as the discovery of unusual men and incidents gives charm and meaning to the records of our humanity. There may be honest errors or mistakes in these books--and no one tries half so hard as the author to find and correct them--but meanwhile the fact remains that, though six volumes of the Wood Folk books have already been published, only three slight errors have thus far been pointed out, and these were promptly and gratefully acknowledged.|$|E

[...] "Listen to this: 'Don't let the girls wear jewelry in public places, or display their watches openly; and take care, all of you, not to show much money. If you buy anything, have it sent to your hotel to be paid for by the hall porter. And it is wise not to let anyone know who you are or how long you intend to remain in any one place. This may strike you as an absurd precaution; but you must remember that you are not in America, but in an isolated Italian province, where government control is inefficient. The truth is that the terrible Mafia is still all powerful on this island, and brigandage is by no means confined to the neighborhood of Castrogiovanni, as the guide books <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe.</b> The people seem simple and harmless enough, but Kenneth and I always keep our revolvers handy, and believe it is a reasonable precaution. I don't want to frighten you, John; merely to warn you. Sicily is full of tourists, and few are ever molested; but if you are aware of the conditions underlying the public serenity you are not so liable to run yourself and your nieces into needless dangers.' How's that for a hair-curler, girls?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{to return}} to the {{observations}} we were making upon the ruinous effects in general of the successive governments which had been established at Benares by the prisoner at your bar. These effects, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe,</b> arose from the want of a constitution. Why, I again ask, did he destroy the constitution which he found established there, or suffer it to be destroyed? But he had actually authorized Mr. Markham to make a new, a regular, an official constitution. Did Mr. Markham make it? No: though he professed to do it; it never was done: and so far from there being any regular, able, efficient constitution, you see there was an absolute and complete anarchy in the country. The native inhabitants, deprived of their ancient government, were so far from looking up to their new masters for protection, that, the moment they saw the face of a soldier or of a British person in authority, they fled in dismay, and thought it more eligible to abandon their houses to robbery than to remain exposed to the tyranny of a British governor. Is this what they call British dominion? Will you sanction by your judicial authority transactions done in direct defiance of your legislative authority? Are they so injuriously mad as to suppose your Lordships can be corrupted to betray in your judicial capacity (the most sacred of the two) what you have ordained in your legislative character? ...|$|E

This is the manner in which he treats an act of Parliament! In the place of acts of Parliament he substitutes his own arbitrary will. This he contends is the sole law of the country he governed, as laid down in what he calls the arbitrary Institutes of Genghis Khân and Tamerlane. This arbitrary will he claims, to the exclusion of the Gentoo law, the Mahometan law, and the law of his own country. He claims the right of making his own will the sole rule of his government, and justifies the exercise of this power by the examples of Aliverdy Khân, Cossim Ali Khân, Sujah Dowlah Khân, and all those Khâns who have rebelled against their masters, and desolated the countries subjected to their rule. This, my Lords, is the law which he has laid down for himself, and these are the examples which he has expressly told the House of Commons he is resolved to follow. These examples, my Lords, and the principles with which they are connected, without any softening or mitigation, he has prescribed to you as the rule by which his conduct is to be judged.|$|E
