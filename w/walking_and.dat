40|$|Every {{year there}} are {{thousands}} of pedestrians in Sweden who are injured because of slippery pavements and roadways.

The anti-skid devices were described according to the subjects' perception of walking safety, <b>walking</b> balance <b>and</b> priority for own use.

40|$|To date no review {{has been}} {{published}} that analyzes the efficacy of assistive devices on the walking ability of ambulant children and adolescents with spina bifida and, differentiates between the effects of treatment on gait parameters, <b>walking</b> capacity, <b>and</b> <b>walking</b> performance. To review the literature for evidence of the efficacy of orthotic management, footwear, <b>and</b> <b>walking</b> aids on gait <b>and</b> <b>walking</b> outcomes in ambulant children and adolescents with spina bifida. Systematic literature review. A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies that evaluated the effect of any type of lower limb orthoses, orthopedic footwear, or walking aids in ambulant children (≤ 18 [*]years old) with spina bifida. Outcome measures and treatment results for gait parameters, <b>walking</b> capacity, <b>and</b> <b>walking</b> performance were identified using International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth (ICF-CY) as the reference framework. Six case-crossover studies met the criteria and were included in this systematic review. Four studies provided indications of {{the efficacy of the}} ankle-foot orthosis in improving a number of kinematic and kinetic properties of gait, stride characteristics, and the oxygen cost of walking. Two studies indicated that walking with forearm crutches may have a favorable effect on gait. The evidence level of these studies was low, and none of the studies assessed the efficacy of the intervention on <b>walking</b> capacity <b>and</b> <b>walking</b> performance. Some data support the efficacy of using ankle-foot orthosis and crutches for gait <b>and</b> <b>walking</b> outcomes at the body functions and structures level of the ICF-CY. Potential benefits at the activities and participation level have not been investigated. This is the first evidence-based systematic review of the efficacy of assistive devices for gait <b>and</b> <b>walking</b> outcomes for children with spina bifida.

40|$|To {{review the}} {{influence}} of physical capacity on regaining <b>walking</b> ability <b>and</b> the development of walking ability after lower limb amputation. A systematic search of literature was performed. The quality of all relevant studies was evaluated according to a checklist for statistical review of general papers. Lower limb amputees. Physical capacity (expressed by aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, muscle force, flexibility <b>and</b> balance) <b>and</b> <b>walking</b> ability (expressed by the <b>walking</b> velocity <b>and</b> symmetry). A total of 48 studies that complied with the inclusion criteria were selected. From these studies there is strong evidence for deterioration of two aspects of physical capacity (muscle strength and balance) and of two aspects of walking ability (<b>walking</b> velocity <b>and</b> symmetry) after lower limb amputation. Strong evidence was found for a relation between balance <b>and</b> <b>walking</b> ability. Strong evidence was only found for a relation between balance <b>and</b> <b>walking</b> ability. Evidence about a relation between other elements of physical capacity <b>and</b> <b>walking</b> ability was insufficient.
