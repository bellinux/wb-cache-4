The other brother Waldemar, <b>who</b> she <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very close <b>to,</b> had married in 1877. The reason for ending her career might also have been the harsh criticism she had met before, but she never withdrew completely from the art circles.

25|$|While serving {{prison time}} {{together}} in 1990, Merlino met Ralph Natale. Natale {{was an older}} mobster <b>who</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> friends with deceased boss Angelo Bruno. It was in prison with Natale that Merlino first discussed taking over the Philadelphia family. The plan was for Merlino to start a war {{for control of the}} crime family, then have Natale named boss when he was released {{with the support of the}} Genovese crime family. When Merlino was released from prison, he recruited his best friend Michael Ciancaglini and his other childhood friends into the plan. Stanfa was aware of the divide in his family and tried to find a peaceful solution. He named Michael's older brother Joseph, Jr., as his new underboss. Stanfa hoped that this would appease the Merlino faction and bring them under his banner. However, tensions escalated and by 1992 another war for control of the Philadelphia crime family was underway. Merlino loyalists shot and incapacitated Joseph Ciancaglini, Jr. while Stanfa's faction killed Merlino's top lieutenant Michael Ciancaglini. They continued attacking each other for months, including a freeway ambush Stanfa survived and several failed attempts on Merlino's life. Being the boss of the Philadelphia crime family, Stanfa had a larger army at his command and also recruited a lot of outside hitmen to fight in the war. The Merlino/Natale faction was much smaller, but was just as ruthless. They allied with other Philadelphia criminal organizations including the Pagan's Motorcycle Club and the Junior Black Mafia while also convincing some members of the Philadelphia crime family to switch sides.|$|E

500|$|The score {{remained}} 1–0 at half-time, {{and it was}} {{the same}} story in the second half: England missed a multitude of easy chances, hit the woodwork numerous times and had one effort that appeared to cross the line not given.

No England goal came—the United States won 1–0 in what entered English football history as the national team's most embarrassing upset. Ramsey, who was fiercely patriotic, took the result as an acute personal humiliation. One journalist recalled that on hearing the match mentioned years later, [...] "his face creased and he looked like {{a man who had been}} jabbed in an unhealed wound". England could remain in the competition if they beat Spain in their last group game, but a 1–0 defeat saw them crash out.|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics have}} {{negatively}} responded to RuPaul's use of {{humor in the}} album.

40|$|Most gunshot victims do not die. In some estimates, 80 percent live to {{see another}} day. Yet social {{scientists}} {{continue to focus on}} gun homicide. What happens to individuals who get shot and survive? How do they experience life after the shooting? This article examines how gunshot injuries transform the lives of victims. In practical ways, gunshot injuries complicate sleeping, eating, working, and other previously taken-for-granted activities. These disruptions also have much larger exis-tential significance to victims. Indeed, daily experiences with a wounded body become subjective reminders that individuals are no longer <b>who</b> they <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> Ironically, in some interactions, being wounded becomes attrac-tive and advantageous to victims. Together, these themes illustrate the need for more sustained ethno-graphic work on the foreground of violent crime vic-timization...|$|R

Akane is ashamed of {{shooting}} Kogami under her watch during her first mission when she judges him a threat to an apprehended criminal's life. Kogami thanks her for intervening in what could've been a murder, which influences Akane to stay.

Makishima is a [...] – he is persistently assessed as having a low crime coefficient by the Sybil System in spite of his actions and plans, thus protecting him from Dominator shots.|$|E
500|$|Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said [...] "Fifteen" [...] {{was one of}} Swift's best-written songs.

Sean Dooley of About.com named it the best track on Fearless and said it showcased Swift's growth as a songwriter. Josh Love of The Village Voice called the song a [...] "standout" [...] on the album and found it a refreshing contradiction to typical, idealistic country songs. Prior to its single release, Kate Kiefer of Paste magazine suggested for the song be released as a single from Fearless, adding that she loved it. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called the track a fantastically good song that broadened [...] "her potential market from teenage girls to anyone <b>who</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a teenage girl". Petridis continued, [...] "You applaud her skill, while feeling slightly unsettled {{by the thought of}} a teenager pontificating away like Yoda."

500|$|Beginning {{early in}} 1968, the group largely retired from touring, instead {{focusing}} on {{work in the}} studio. As the band was not available to promote their material, subsequent releases met with little success. The Kinks' next single, [...] "Wonderboy", released {{in the spring of}} 1968, stalled at number 36 and became the band's first single not to make the UK Top Twenty since their early covers. In the face of the band's declining popularity, Davies continued to pursue his personal song-writing style while rebelling against the heavy demands placed on him to keep producing commercial hits, and the group continued to devote time to the studio, centring on a slowly developing project of Ray's called Village Green. In an attempt to revive the group's commercial standing, the Kinks' management booked them on a month-long package tour for April, drawing the group away from the studio. The venues were largely cabarets and clubs; headlining was Peter Frampton's group The Herd. [...] "In general, the teenyboppers were not there to see the boring old Kinks, who occasionally had to endure chants of 'We Want The Herd!' during their brief appearances", commented Andy Miller. The tour proved taxing and stressful—Pete Quaife recalled, [...] "It was a chore, very dull, boring and straightforward... We only did twenty minutes, but it used to drive me absolutely frantic, standing on stage and playing three notes over and over again." [...] At the end of June, the Kinks released the single [...] "Days", which provided a minor, but only momentary, comeback for the group. [...] "I remember playing it when I was at Fortis Green the first time I had a tape of it", Ray said. [...] "I played it to Brian, <b>who</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> our roadie, and his wife and two daughters. They were crying at the end of it. Really wonderful—like going to Waterloo and seeing the sunset.... It's like saying goodbye to somebody, then afterwards feeling the fear that you actually are alone." [...] "Days" [...] reached number 12 in the United Kingdom and was a Top 20 hit in several other countries, but it did not chart in the United States.|$|E

40|$|This project {{studies the}} {{relation}} between existential psychology and the main character Ole Jastrau’s existential crisis and use of alcohol in the novel by Tom Kristensen Hærværk. We use theorists Rolle May and Irvin D. Yalom to study Ole Jastrau’s deroute throughout the book. Yalom introduces an existential perspective on human life themes, which can create an existential crisis. In this sense Rollo May introduces his theory on anxiety, which is a possible consequence of several existential factors – e. g. lack of acknowledgement of the life themes Yalom describes. We conclude that Jastrau’s anxiety is based on his lack of acknowledgement of meaninglessness and the human freedom to create its own life. Jastrau’s existential crisis sets off when he meets Steffensen, who reminds him of <b>who</b> he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> when he was young. Furthermore Jastrau <b>uses</b> alcohol <b>to</b> soothe his anxiety, concurrently using alcohol in his identity search through his inner existential self...|$|R
