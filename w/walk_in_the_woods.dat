He patented it in 1955 and subsequently refined and developed its practical manufacture until its commercial introduction in the late 1950s.|$|E

500|$|American novelist Rick Skwiot {{enjoys the}} [...] "blithely {{confident}} Brit's" [...] narrative style, finding echoes of its concept, structure and humour in Bill Bryson's A <b>Walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Woods.</b> Skwiot notes {{the hazards of}} the journey as crevasses, precipices, thieves, bears, disease, thirst, hunger. [...] "Somehow they blunder on toward their whimsical destination", he remarks, the [...] "seductive and tickling narrative" [...] told with [...] "understatement, self-effacement, savage wit, honed irony, and unrelenting honesty." [...] The reader is drawn in [...] "by his endearingly flawed humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|Thompson's {{first film}} of 2015 was A <b>Walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Woods,</b> a comedy {{adapted from the}} book by Bill Bryson, where she {{appeared}} opposite Robert Redford and Nick Nolte. She next starred with Robert Carlyle in his directoral debut The Legend of Barney Thomson. Her role was his 77-year-old mother, a Glaswegian foul-mouthed, chain-smoking former prostitute. Neither film was a critical success, although the latter received some positive reviews and Empire magazine wrote that Thomson was [...] "unforgettable". Later that year, she had a supporting role in John Wells' restaurant-based film Burnt, alongside Bradley Cooper. In 2016, she starred with Brendan Gleeson in the World War II-drama Alone in Berlin, based {{on the story of}} Otto and Elise Hampel. She also co-wrote the screenplay for Bridget Jones's Baby and appeared in the comedy as a doctor.|$|E

500|$|In Southey's tale, three {{anthropomorphic}} bears [...] "a Little, Small, Wee Bear, a Middle-sized Bear, and a Great, Huge Bear" [...] {{live together}} {{in a house in}} the woods. Southey describes them as very good-natured, trusting, harmless, tidy, and hospitable. Each of these [...] "bachelor" [...] bears has his own porridge bowl, chair, and bed. One day they make porridge for breakfast, but it's too hot to eat, so take a <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> while their porridge cools. An old woman approaches the bears' house. As she has been sent out by her family, she is a disgrace to them. She is [...] impudent, bad, foul-mouthed, ugly, dirty, and a vagrant deserving of a stint in the House of Correction. She looks through a window, peeps through the keyhole, and lifts the latch. Assured that no one is home, she walks in. The old woman eats the Wee Bear's porridge, then settles into his chair and breaks it. Prowling about, she finds the bears' beds and falls asleep in Wee Bear's bed. The dark end of the tale is reached when the bears return. Wee Bear finds his empty bowl, his broken chair, and the old woman in his bed and cries, [...] "Somebody has been lying in my bed, and here she is!" [...] The old woman starts, runs away, breaks her neck and goes to the hospital.|$|E

A well-tended path leads to a pet cemetery (misspelled [...] "sematary" [...] on the sign) where the children of the town bury their deceased animals. This provokes a heated argument between Louis and Rachel the next day. Rachel disapproves of discussing death, and she worries about how Ellie may be affected by what she saw at the [...] "sematary". (It is explained later that Rachel was traumatized by the early death of her sister, Zelda, from spinal meningitis—an issue that is brought up several times in flashbacks.) ...|$|E

He received very high acclaim for his performance in the film, in which he is its only cast member and there is almost no dialogue. [...] In April 2014, Redford {{appeared in}} the Marvel Studios super hero film [...] playing Alexander Pierce, the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. and leader of the Hydra cell operating the Triskelion.

After breakfast, the Chief said that {{he wanted to go to}} church. A car was brought around, loaded to capacity, and the old Chief, in full dress and just a little paint on his face to cover his wrinkles, took place beside his host for a trip of two miles to the big Catholic edifice on State Street in the city's First Ward. Throughout the service the Chief responded with dignity to every detail of the long and solemn ceremony--and it may be said too that he attracted the gaze of everyone present. When formal service ended, the popular Father McGivney came to take his hand in welcome and gave his blessing, but it was long before the Chief was permitted to take leave of his friends and neighbors gathered about him to shake hands. The Chief was visibly agitated and frequently referred to his disappointment in having to go. He said he would not likely ever come again; he felt that he would soon go to join his friends in the Sand Hills." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chief American Horse {{was always}} welcome guest at The Wigwam, Major Israel McCreight’s home in Du Bois, Pennsylvania.
