40|$|Exposure {{to large}} organic aerosol {{particles}} may cause respiratory and skin reactions. The use of human exposure chambers offers possibilities for experimental exposure challenges {{carried out with}} patients, in research and for investigations {{of the effects of}} exposure on the skin and in the respiratory tract. The present aim was to study the performance of modern human <b>whole-body</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>chambers</b> during generation of large organic particles, and to develop and test new measuring techniques for use in exposure studies of the respiratory tract or on the skin. The work reported in the present thesis was based primarily on studies in a whole-body human exposure chamber located at Karolinska University Hospital in Solna, Stockholm, Sweden. This chamber was specially constructed for challenges with aerosols. Dynamically controlled, the chamber is easy to operate. Since human exposure chamber set-ups and designs may vary and yield different performance and dust characteristics, the performance of another human chamber was also evaluated. Performance as a measure of temporal and spatial variability of the aerosol concentration, and aerodynamic particle size, was evaluated for these two chambers based on different airand dust-mixing principles. Temporal and spatial variability close to the breathing zone during exposure was typically < 10 % in the chamber at Karolinska University Hospital. In a larger section around a human, only slightly higher spatial variation was found. The variability between exposure sessions was also low (< 10 %). Only limited influence of relative humidity on chamber performance for the evaluated aerosols was observed. Similar performance characteristics with pinewood dust were obtained in both chambers. The particle size distribution curves differed slightly, but some were comparable to those found in occupational environments. Performance as measured with a heated mannequin was almost the same as with humans, indicating that a mannequin can be used in preparatory tests. The temporal variation during an exposure session varied considerably if a neutralizer device for removing static charges in the dust was not connected; here over 20 30 % variation was not unusual. A neutralizer greatly decreased this variation to values near 10 % as measured in one of the chambers. The same outcome was also found for spatial variation, which was high (over 20 %) with no neutralizer. Exposure to wood dust within the woodworking industry causes various respiratory disorders. A study of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from eleven healthy individuals exposed to pinewood dust in one of the chambers revealed an accumulation of eosinophils and T-lymphocytes in the lungs after exposure. Skin exposure to aerosols of allergens and irritants may cause dermatitis. There are few methods for assessing skin exposure to such particles. A vacuuming sampler for removing particles from the skin was constructed and was tested in one of the chambers. This sampler was compared with two other skin and surface sampling techniques, one based on interception (a patch sampler - adhesive tape on an optical cover glass) and one using a tape stripping procedure. All three methods measure the mass of dust on skin. Healthy subjects were exposed to dust of wheat flour and cornstarch. Samples were taken from forearms and shoulders and analysed using optical microscopy. Small differences in the results were obtained. Agreement between the vacuuming sampler and the tape stripping technique was good. The three techniques are applicable for assessing skin exposure to particles and for dose/effect studies.

Despite this association, the mechanisms by which cigarette smoke exposure diminishes host defense against S. pneumoniae infections are poorly understood. In this study, we compared the responses of BALB/c mice following an intratracheal challenge with S. pneumoniae after 5 weeks of exposure to room air or cigarette smoke in a <b>whole-body</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber</b> in vivo and the effects of cigarette smoke on alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae in vitro. Bacterial burdens in cigarette smoke-exposed mice were increased at 24 and 48 h postinfection, and this was accompanied by a more pronounced clinical appearance of illness, hypothermia, and increased lung homogenate cytokines interleukin- 1 (IL- 1), IL- 6, IL- 10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-). We also found greater numbers of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid recovered from cigarette smoke-exposed mice following a challenge with heat-killed S. pneumoniae. Interestingly, overnight culture of alveolar macrophages with 1 % cigarette smoke extract, a level that did not affect alveolar macrophage viability, reduced complement-mediated phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae, while the ingestion of unopsonized bacteria or IgG-coated microspheres was not affected.

The present study was performed to determine if exposure to sidestream cigarette smoke (SSCS), a surrogate of environmental tobacco smoke, promotes atherogenesis in a mouse model of human atherosclerosis. Female ApoE-deficient mice, maintained on a Western diet, were exposed to SSCS in a <b>whole-body</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber</b> {{for a total of}} 6 h each day, 5 days a week for 7, 10 and 14 weeks. Animals exposed to filtered ambient air served as controls. Elevated concentrations of blood carboxyhemoglobin and pulmonary CYP 1 A 1 ascertained effective exposure of animals to SSCS. There were no consistent changes in serum concentrations of cholesterol between control and SSCS-exposed mice. Morphometric assessment of grossly discernible lesions covering the intimal area of aorta showed remarkable increases in SSCS-exposed mice at all three exposure durations studied. Increases in the lesion area defined by en face measurements were accompanied by parallel increases in the levels of esterified and unesterified cholesterol in the aortic tissues of SSCS mice. These results clearly demonstrate promotion of atherosclerotic lesion development by tobacco smoke in an atherosclerosis-susceptible mouse model. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Exposure to {{wood dust}} within the {{woodworking}} {{industry has been}} shown to cause a variety of respiratory disorders. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the cellular effects in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and peripheral blood from healthy individuals exposed to pinewood dust. Eleven healthy volunteers were exposed to pinewood dust for 1 h in a <b>whole-body</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber.</b> BAL fluid and blood cells were differentially counted and the expression of activation, adhesion and subset markers on alveolar macrophages and T-lymphocytes was determined 2 – 6 weeks before and 20 h after the exposure. Following pinewood dust exposure, the total BAL fluid cell concentration increased from 81. 4 (64. 1 – 97. 5) 6106 cells?L- 1 (median (interquartile range)) to 195. 3 (154. 6 – 341. 2) 6106 cells?L- 1. The BAL fluid T-lymphocyte concentration increased from 3. 8 % (3. 5 – 6. 5 %) to 7. 6 % (4. 9 – 11. 2 %), and BAL fluid eosinophil concentration from 0. 0 % (0. 0 – 0. 2 %) to 1. 8 % (0. 6 – 3. 5 %). Inhalation of pinewood dust leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the airways of healthy individuals. The increase in numbers of eosinophils, T-lymphocytes and mast cells, i. e. cells of crucial importance to airway inflammation, in the lungs may be related to the increased risk of developing respiratory disorders among woodworkers...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to examine the lung injury and inflammation caused by manual metal arc stainless steel (MMA-SS) welding fume inhalation and to evaluate the recovery process. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to MMA-SS welding fumes for 2 h per day in a <b>whole-body</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber,</b> with a total suspended particulate (TSP) concentration of 51. 4 ± 2. 8 mg/m 3 (low dose) or 84. 6 ± 2. 9 mg/m 3 (high dose) for 30 days. The animals were sacrificed after 30 days of exposure as well as after a 30 -day recovery period. To assess the inflammatory or injury responses, cellular and biochemical parameters as well as cytokines were assayed in the bronchoalveolar lav-age fluid (BALF). MMA-SS welding fume exposure led to a significant elevation in the number of alveolar macrophages (AM) and polymorphonuclear cells (PMN). Additionary, the values of β-n-acetyl glucosaminidase (β-NAG) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the BALF were increased in the exposed group when compared to controls. After 30 days of recovery from exposure, a signifi-cant reduction in inflammatory parameters of BALF was observed between the exposed and recov-ered groups. Slight, but significant elevations were noted in the number of AM and PMN in the recovered groups, and AM that had been ingested fume particles still remain in the lungs. In conclu-sion, these results indicated that welding fumes induced inflammatory responses and cytotoxicity in the lungs of exposed rats. Fume particles were not fully cleared from lungs even after a 30 -day recovery period. Key words: Welding fume inhalation, Manual metal arc stainless steel, Bronchoalveolar lavage...|$|R

Little {{is known about the}} effect of low-dose methanol exposure. It is controversial whether or not formate, the main metabolite responsible for methanol's acute toxicity, is a sensitive biological marker of toxicity or exposure. We studied the effect of a 4 -hr exposure at rest to 200 ppm of methanol vapors on endogenous serum formate and on urinary formic acid excretion. A randomized, double-blind study of human exposure to a constant concentration of methanol was performed in a <b>whole-body</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber.</b> Twenty-six healthy volunteers, each serving as his or her own control, participated in sham and methanol exposures. Urine (at 0, 4, 8 hr) and serum specimens (15 time points over 8 hr) collected before, during, and after the exposure were measured for formate. We found no significant differences in serum formate concentration between exposure and control conditions either at any time point or for area under the curve. Mean concentrations {{at the end of the}} exposure were: exposed 14. 28 +/- 8. 90 mg/l and control 12. 68 +/- 6. 43 mg/l. A slight, but nonsignificant (p = 0. 08), increase in urine formate excretion rate was found at 4 hr (exposed 2. 17 +/- 1. 69 mg/ 4 hr and control 1. 67 +/- 1. 02 mg/ 4 hr). Age, sex, folic acid level, and smoking were not significant covariates. At 200 ppm, methanol exposure does not contribute substantially to endogenous formate quantities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} and evaluate the performance of a <b>whole-body</b> human <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber</b> for controlled test atmospheres of gases and particulates. The chamber was constructed from Plexiglass, has a volume of 75 ft 3, operated at a flowrate of 33. 8 CFM, and both the makeup and exhaust air are HEPA filtered. Fly ash dust was generated using a Wright Dust Feeder. An elutriator was used to eliminate particles larger 8 μm aerodynamic diameter from the airstream. A direct reading instrument, the Rupprecht and Patashnick PM- 10 TEOM, was used for determination of particle concentration. Particle size distributions were determined by a QCM cascade impactor. Data from gravimetric analysis were used to test for the evenness of dust concentrations in the chamber. CO 2 is used as a representative gas and its concentration was measured using the Metrosonics aq- 5000. Total dust concentrations as measured by the TEOM, in μg/m 3, at 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 and 1. 6 RPMs of the Wright Dust Feeder, were 110 + 2. 8, 173 + 8. 5, 398 + 20 and 550 + 17, respectively. For these RPMs, particle size distributions were associated with a MMD of 1. 27 μm and a GSD of 2. 35, a MMD of 1. 39 and a GSD of 2. 22, a MMD of 1. 46 and a GSD of 2. 08, a MMD of 1. 15 and a GSD of 2. 2, respectively. Total dust concentrations as measured by gravimetric analysis, in μg/m 3 for the respirable fraction. Dust concentrations measured at different points within the chamber showed uniform distribution with a variability less than 10 %. Similarly, the particle size distributions were found to be consistent across the different RPMs settings. Regarding carbon dioxide, its concentration was straightforward and the measured and theoretical maximum concentration levels were in agreement.

The goal of the present study was to identify early molecular changes in the lung induced by exposure to tobacco smoke and thus identify potential targets for chemoprevention. Female A/J mice were exposed to either tobacco smoke or HEPA-filtered air via a <b>whole-body</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber</b> (6 h/d, 5 d/wk for 3, 8, and 20 weeks). Gene expression profiles of lung tissue from control and smoke-exposed animals were established using a 15 K cDNA microarray. Cytochrome P 450 1 b 1, a phase I enzyme involved in both the metabolism of xenobiotics and the 4 -hydroxylation of 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)), was modulated to the greatest extent following smoke exposure. A panel of 10 genes were found to be differentially expressed in control and smoke-exposed lung tissues at 3, 8, and 20 weeks (P < 0. 001). The interaction network of these differentially expressed genes revealed new pathways modulated by short-term smoke exposure, including estrogen metabolism. In addition, E(2) was detected within murine lung tissue by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry and immunohistochemistry. Identification of the early molecular events that contribute to lung tumor formation is anticipated to lead to the development of promising targeted chemopreventive therapies. In conclusion, the presence of E 2 within lung tissue when combined with the modulation of cytochrome P 450 1 b 1 and other estrogen metabolism genes by tobacco smoke provides novel insight into a possible role for estrogens in lung cancer.
