By June 16, the company had traveled , with [...] to go before Fort Laramie, Wyoming. They had been delayed by rain and a rising river, but Tamsen Donner wrote to a friend in Springfield, [...] "indeed, if I do not experience something far <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> have yet done, I shall say the trouble is all in getting started." [...] Young Virginia Reed recalled years later that, during {{the first part of the}} trip, she was [...] "perfectly happy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{staff at}} Idolator {{selected}} [...] "Million Reasons" [...] to review {{as part of}} their 'Rated & Reviewed' column series. Robbie Daw from the publication congratulated the singer for creating a [...] "super-produced" [...] country version of her 2011 single [...] "You and I". Rachel Sonis agreed and found it to be simple and sweet, awarding the track a rating of 8.5 out of 10. However, both Carl Williott and Mike Wass were disappointed, with the latter claiming: [...] "this era is shaping up to be even <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> imagined." [...] It ultimately received an average score of 6.1/10 from the writers. Similarly, Bowman from the same website called it one of Joannes [...] "more forgettable tracks". Although The Atlantics Spencer Kornhaber found it to be a [...] "sturdily crafted" [...] single, he found Gaga to be neglectful of the song's details and claimed that American singer Taylor Swift could excel exceptionally better at the same craft.|$|E
500|$|Even {{with the}} {{armistice}} in November 1918, the war-related trials continued. The Socialist Party of America, like the IWW, had opposed the war, and {{had also been}} raided by federal authorities. Seven Socialist Party leaders, including Victor Berger, who was elected to Congress in November 1918, were indicted for alleged anti-war activities. The defendants were charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, which made it illegal [...] "to utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language" [...] about the armed forces, the flag, the Constitution, or democracy. The defendants, who were mostly of German birth or descent, moved {{for a change of}} venue away from Landis's courtroom, alleging that Landis had stated on November 1, 1918, that [...] "f anybody has said anything about the Germans that is <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> have said, I would like to hear it so I could use it myself." [...] Landis, however, examined the transcript of the trial in which the statement was supposedly made, failed to find it, declared the affidavit in support of the motion [...] "perjurious", and denied the motion. While the jury was being selected, Berger was indicted on additional espionage charges for supposedly violating the law during an earlier, unsuccessful political campaign. At the conclusion of the case, Landis took an hour to dramatically charge the jury, emphasizing the secretive nature of conspiracies and pointing at the jury box as he noted, [...] "the country was then at war". At one point, Landis leapt out of his seat, twirled his chair around, then sat on its arm. Later in his charge, he lay prone upon the bench. The jury took less than a day to convict Congressman-elect Berger and his four remaining codefendants. Landis sentenced each defendant to twenty years in federal prison. Landis denied the defendants bail pending appeal; but they quickly obtained it from an appellate court judge. [...] The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declined to rule on the case itself, sending it on to the Supreme Court, which on January 31, 1921, overturned the convictions and sentences by a 6–3 vote, holding that Landis should have stepped aside once he was satisfied that the affidavit was legally sufficient, leaving it for another judge to decide whether it was actually true. Landis refused to comment on the Supreme Court's decision, which ordered a new trial. In 1922, charges against the defendants were dropped by the government.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1990 Hepburn went to Vietnam, in {{an effort}} to {{collaborate}} with the government for national UNICEF-supported immunisation and clean water programmes. In September 1992, four months before she died, Hepburn went to Somalia. Calling it [...] "apocalyptic", she said, [...] "I walked into a nightmare. I have seen famine in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, but I have seen nothing like this – so much <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> could possibly have imagined. I wasn't prepared for this." [...] Though scarred by what she had seen, Hepburn still had hope. [...] "Taking care of children {{has nothing to do with}} politics.

2500|$|Hitler's {{relationship}} with Voss {{was not as}} warm as with Posse. [...] The two men met only on several occasions, and Voss was not given authority over books, armour and coins, as Posse had been. [...] Voss {{is said to have}} remarked after one meeting with the Führer, [...] "He's even <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> thought." [...] Voss attempted to mend his fences with Hitler with an elaborate gift for his birthday in 1944, accompanied by a list of his acquisitions in which he claimed to have bought 881 items, compared to 122 paintings that Posse had collected the year before. [...] Voss did indeed spend money more profligately than Posse had, and his budget was later reduced {{near the end of the}} war. Under interrogation after the war he claimed to have acquired 3000 painting for the Führermuseum between 1943 and 1944, although the records do not support this figure, and many of the artworks were of distinctly secondary importance.|$|E
2500|$|By {{this stage}} Wood was so deaf that Wolseley complained {{he had become}} hoarse from {{shouting}} at him. Wolseley wrote of Wood that “he has done <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> expected” and in his journal described him as “the vainest {{but by no means}} the ablest of men. [...] He is as cunning as a first class female diplomatist … (but has not) real sound judgement…… intrigues with newspaper correspondents … he has not the brains nor the disposition nor the coolness nor the firmness of purpose to enable him to take command in any war … a very second rate general … whose two most remarkable traits (a)re extreme vanity & unbounded self-seeking" [...] although a letter to his wife (complaining that Wood was “a very puzzle-headed fellow”, wanting in method [...] and vain) suggests that Wolseley still bore Wood a grudge about the peace after Majuba Hill. [...] Ill once again, Wood handed over the job of Sirdar to Francis Grenfell. [...] To his annoyance, he received no (British) honours from the Nile expedition. Wood returned to the UK in June 1885.|$|E

2500|$|Chatfield is {{also noted}} for being seriously injured on the cricket field, in a Test match against England in the 1974/5 season. England {{were at the}} end of a long and {{difficult}} tour in which they had been defeated in the Ashes by Australia, chiefly by the Australian fast bowlers Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee. Chatfield, a number 11 batsman, was holding up England with a last wicket partnership with his future captain, Geoff Howarth. English fast bowler Peter Lever decided to test Chatfield with a bouncer. At the time helmets and other now common protective gear were not in use. The ball struck Chatfield on the temple, rendering him unconscious and not breathing. Watching English physiotherapist Bernard Thomas was the first to realise what had happened: Chatfield had swallowed his tongue. He flicked it back into place (and managed to revive Chatfield with a heart massage. Lever was distraught and Chatfield later joked that when he was visited by Lever in hospital, that [...] "he looked <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> did". A couple of years later helmets were introduced into cricket and Chatfield wore one thereafter.|$|E
