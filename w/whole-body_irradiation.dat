40|$|The {{estimation}} of the dose and the irradiated fraction {{of the body is}} important information in the primary medical response in case of a radiological accident. The PCC-R assay has been developed for high-dose esti-mations, but little attention has been given to its applicability for partial-body irradiations. In the present work we estimated the doses and the percentage of the irradiated fraction in simulated partial-body radiation expo-sures at high doses using the PCC-R assay. Peripheral whole blood of three healthy donors was exposed to doses from 0 – 20 Gy, with 60 Co gamma radiation. To simulate partial body irradiations, irradiated and non-irradiated blood was mixed to obtain proportions of irradiated blood from 10 – 90 %. Lymphocyte cultures were treated with Colcemid and Calyculin-A before harvest. Conventional and triage scores were performed for each dose, proportion of irradiated blood and donor. The Papworth’s u test was used to evaluate the PCC-R distribution per cell. A dose-response relationship was fitted according to the maximum likelihood method using the frequencies of PCC-R obtained from 100 % irradiated blood. The dose to the partially irradiated blood was estimated using the Contaminated Poisson method. A new D 0 value of 10. 9 Gy was calculated and used to estimate the initial fraction of irradiated cells.

40|$|<b>Whole-body</b> <b>irradiation</b> of mice with 300 or 400 R {{causes a}} precipitous fall in thymus weight, {{followed}} {{by an increase in}} the mitotic index and an almost complete restoration of thymus mass. This phase is followed by a secondary fall in thymus weight and gradual recovery. This secondary fall can be prevented by intravenous injection of bone marrow or shielding of the hind limbs during irradiation. The hypothesis is proposed that the thymus depends on the migration of cells from the bone marrow to the thymus for the maintenance of its cell population. Bone marrow cells with chromosome markers injected intravenously into normal or lightly irradiated (150 R) animals do not populate the host bone marrow to any significant degree. After <b>whole-body</b> <b>irradiation</b> with heavy doses (400 R), donor cells dominate the marrow. There may be a competition between dividing cells in the bone marrow which regulates proliferation of hemic cells. Bone marrow cells with marker chromosomes do not repopulate the thymus in irradiated animals until long after repopulating the bone marrow. It is possible that these cells have to pass through the marrow or the blood-marrow barrier to acquire characteristics needed for entering the thymus. After <b>whole-body</b> <b>irradiation</b> with 500 R or more, the first phase of regeneration of the thymus, represented by an increase in the mitotic index, does not occur to a significant degree. Apparently cells in the thymus capable of proliferation have been largely eliminated, and restoration of organ mass depends chiefly on seeding from other sources, probably the bone marrow. After <b>whole-body</b> <b>irradiation</b> with 200 R, only the first phase of thymus weight loss and regeneration takes place.

This impaired immune response results from a selective loss of antigen-presenting cell function in the splenic adherent cell (SAC) population of the UV-treated mice. SACs from UV-irradiated mice are unable to reconstitute a PFC response when added to normal splenocytes passed through Sephadex G- 10 (which depletes adherent cells), whereas normal SACs, when added to Sephadex G- 10 -passed splenocytes from UV-treated mice, do restore a PFC response. The effect of in vivo UV irradiation on the SAC population is indistinguishable functionally from the effect of in vitro UV irradiation of SACs from normal mice.

Further investigations were made on the mitochondria on the 3 rd day after irradiation at 650 R in regard to fatty acid compositions and Fe(++) -induced peroxidation of total or fractionated mitochondrial lipids. The results are represented as follows. 1) Fatty acid composition of the mitochondria after lipid peroxidation showed the decrease of polyenoic acids (C- 20 : 4, C- 22 : 6), suggesting the polyenoic acids are substrate of the reaction. 2) Changes of fatty acid composition of mitochondria after <b>whole-body</b> <b>irradiation</b> at 650 R were shown decreasing of unsaturated fatty acid due to the decrement of C- 18 : 1 and C- 18 : 2, but the component of polyenoic acid increased relatively.

Effect of <b>whole-body</b> <b>irradiation</b> on the peroxidation activities of the phospholipid was not observed significantly, despite of the difference seen in their fatty acid compositions. 5) Peroxidation of subfractionated phospholipid by a thin-layer chromatography showed marked activity in the fractions of lecithin and aminophosphatide containing large amounts of C- 20 : 4 and C- 22 : 6 : Recovery of {{the activity of the}} subfractions increased markedly comparing to the total phospholipid, and effect of <b>whole-body</b> <b>irradiation</b> appeared significantly in these subfractions.

To further elucidate the p 53 -signalling network, we performed transcriptome analysis on 24 tissues in p 53 +/+ or p 53 −/− mice after <b>whole-body</b> X-ray <b>irradiation.</b> Here we found transactivation of a total of 3551 genes in {{one or more of the}} 24 tissues only in p 53 +/+ mice, while 2576 genes were downregulated. p 53 mRNA expression level in each tissue was significantly associated with the number of genes upregulated by irradiation. Annotation using TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database revealed that p 53 negatively regulated mRNA expression of several cancer therapeutic targets or pathways such as BTK, SYK, and CTLA 4 in breast cancer tissues. In addition, stomach exhibited the induction of Krt 6, Krt 16, and Krt 17 as well as loricrin, an epidermal differentiation marker, after the X-ray irradiation only in p 53 +/+ mice, implying a mechanism to protect damaged tissues by rapid induction of differentiation. Our comprehensive transcriptome analysis elucidated tissue specific roles of p 53 and its signalling networks in DNA-damage response that will enhance our understanding of cancer biology...|$|R
40|$|High-energy, high-charge (HZE) radiation, {{including}} iron ions (56 Fe 26 �), is {{a component}} of the space environment. We recently observed a profound loss of trabecular bone in mice after <b>whole-body</b> HZE <b>irradiation.</b> The goal {{of this study was to}} examine morphology in bones that were excluded from a 56 26 � Fe beam used to irradiate the body. Using 10 -week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats and excluding the hind limbs and pelvis, we irradiated animals with 0, 1, 2 and 4 Gy 56 Fe 26 � ions and killed them humanely after 9 months. Animals grew throughout the experiment. Trabecular bone volume, connectivity and thickness within the proximal tibiae were significantly lower than control in a dose-dependent manner. Irradiated animals generally had less body mass than controls, which largely accounted for the variability in bone parameters as determined by ANCOVA. Likewise, lower cortical parameters were associated with reduced mass. However, lesser trabecular thickness in the 4 -Gy group could not be attributed to body mass alone. Indicators of bone metabolism were generally unchanged, suggesting stabilized turnover. Exposure to 56 26 � Fe ions can alter trabecular microarchitecture in shielded bones. Reduced body mass seems to be correlated with these deficits of trabecular and cortical bone. � 2008 by Radiation Research Societ...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{presented}} here {{were aimed at}} the description of hematopoiesis repair and in vivo homing of transplanted separated CD 117 +B 220 – bone marrow cells after <b>whole-body</b> lethal <b>irradiation</b> at LD 9 Gy. ROSA 26 mice were used as donors of marrow cells for transplantation [B 6; 129 S/Gt (ROSA) 26 Sor] and were tagged with lacZ gene, and F 2 hybrid mice [B 6129 SF 2 /J] were used as recipients of bone marrow transplanted cells. Hematopoiesis repair was provided by transplantation, both suspension of whole bone marrow cells (5 x 106) and isolated CD 117 +B 220 – cells (5 x 104). Mice survived up to thirty days after irradiation. We demonstrated that transplantation of suspension of whole bone marrow cells led to faster recovery of CFU-GM (Granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units) in bone marrow and in the spleen too. It {{is not clear what}} the share of residential and transplanted cells is in the repair process. Our results demonstrate that sufficient hematopoietic repair occurs after transplantation of CD 117 +B 220 – (lacZ+) in lethally irradiated mice, and the difference in CFU-GM numbers in the bone marrow and spleen found on day 8 posttransplant has no influence on the survival of lethally irradiated mice (30 days follow-up) ...|$|R
