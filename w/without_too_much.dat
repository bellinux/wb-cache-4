5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of the chamber wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side of the chamber is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced <b>without</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E
5|$|Dr.Dre {{has stated}} {{that he is a}} perfectionist and is known to {{pressure}} the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances. In 2006, Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr.Dre had made new artist Bishop Lamont re-record a single bar of vocals 107times. Dr.Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his similar work ethic. He gives a lot of input into the delivery of the vocals and will stop an MC during a take if it is not to his liking. However, he gives MCs that he works with room to write lyrics <b>without</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> instruction unless it is a specifically conceptual record, as noted by Bishop Lamont in the book How to Rap.|$|E

5|$|Further east, the strongpoint {{defenses}} were effective. On the Dog Red / Easy Green boundary, {{the defenses}} around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy {{toll on the}} remaining 2nd Battalion, with H/116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there. The survivors joined the remnants of F/116 behind the shingle, and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the shingle. A further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins {{was too weak to}} have any effect and was forced back down. To their left, mainly between the draws on the Easy Green / Easy Red boundary, the 116th RCT's support battalion landed <b>without</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on the bluffs.|$|E

He clashed with the makers (including director Sam Peckinpah) of what could have been a triumphant comeback, on Ride the High Country (1962). He closed out his film career with Mail Order Bride (1964), and saw several of his scores (including one for Bonnie and Clyde) rejected.|$|E
25|$|The flugelhorn {{is built}} in the same B pitch as many {{trumpets}} and cornets.

It can thus be played <b>without</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> trouble by trumpet and cornet players, though some adaptation to their playing style may be needed. It is usually played with a more deeply conical mouthpiece than either trumpets or cornets (though not as conical as a horn mouthpiece).|$|E

The weak French defending forces were pushed back <b>without</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> trouble, except for Mortier's guardsmen near Langres. These crack troops made a fighting withdrawal to Bar-sur-Aube where they offered battle in a strong position. Two days after the clash, Emperor Napoleon joined his reeling forces and the major fighting began.|$|E

25|$|The 1923 San Pedro Maritime {{strike was}} the biggest {{challenge}} to {{the dominance of the}} open shop philosophy that controlled Los Angeles until the 1930s. It was defeated <b>without</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a struggle because of the strength the shop owners, use of the Los Angeles Police Department, KKK, and others as enforcers to try and break the strike. Another factor which helped defeat the strike was the high amount of strikebreakers who were brought into the city from all other parts of the state, which helped keep the docks open enough to allow commercial business to take place. The open shop would remain the ideology that ran Los Angeles for another 15 years.|$|E
25|$|The British {{defenders}} suffered little interference {{during the}} evacuation, perhaps because on 15 August, the Duke of Aosta had ordered Nasi {{to allow the}} British to evacuate <b>without</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fighting, {{in the hope of}} a peace agreement being mediated through the Vatican. On 19 August, the Italians took control of Berbera and then moved down the coast to complete their conquest of British Somaliland and the colony was annexed by Mussolini to the Italian Empire as a part of Italian East Africa. The British air contingent tried to ease the evacuation; Blenheims from 11 Squadron left Aden at 5:35 p.m. on 18 August and carried out a high-level bombing attack on Italian vehicles near Laferug but lost a bomber to CR.42s from 410a Squadriglia, one crewman surviving. While the Italian fighter unit was distracted, Wellesley bombers from 223 Squadron took off from Perim Island to attack the airfield at Addis Ababa and destroyed the Duke of Aosta's personal aircraft. One SM.79, one Savoia-Marchetti SM.75 and three Ca.133 aircraft were destroyed according to Italian records and a SM.79 and SM.81 were badly damaged.|$|E
25|$|The Greenside smelt mill {{was built}} in 182728, down in the Glenridding valley {{at the bottom of}} the Swart Beck, where there was a good water supply and where fuel could be brought up the valley <b>without</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> difficulty. Inside the mill there was {{probably}} a furnace to prepare the ore and a single ore hearth. The air blast was produced by bellows powered by a water wheel. Further buildings were erected in the 1830s, to house a slag hearth furnace, and a silver refinery. There was no extended chimney: clouds of toxic lead oxides and acid sulphurous fumes would have made the valley an unhealthy place. The flue {{was built in}} 1841 to a chimney 150m up the hillside; in 1855 it was extended to a chimney on the ridge above. Later, loops were added to increase its length. This long flue not only removed the noxious fumes, it also enabled the lead-rich dust to be recovered and returned to the smelter. The flue was built as a stone-arched cutting, following or cut into the bedrock. This served as a giant prospecting cross-cut and proved there was no extension to the Greenside Vein to the south.|$|E

25|$|German beacons {{operated}} on the medium-frequency band and the signals involved a two-letter Morse identifier {{followed by a}} lengthy time-lapse which enabled the Luftwaffe crews to determine the signal's bearing. The Meacon system involved separate locations for a receiver with a directional aerial and a transmitter. The receipt of the German signal by the receiver was duly passed to the transmitter, the signal to be repeated. The action did not guarantee automatic success. If the German bomber flew closer to its own beam than the Meacon then the former signal would come through the stronger on the direction finder. The reverse would apply only if the meacon were closer. In general, German bombers were likely {{to get through to}} their targets <b>without</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> difficulty. It was to be some months before an effective night fighter force would be ready, and anti-aircraft defences only became adequate after the Blitz was over, so ruses were created to lure German bombers away from their targets. Throughout 1940, dummy airfields were prepared, good enough to stand up to skilled observation. An unknown number of bombs fell on these diversionary ("Starfish") targets.|$|E

[...] Kitty Empire for The Guardian wrote, [...] "Lewis' voice is impressively elastic throughout but lacks any grit or style.
