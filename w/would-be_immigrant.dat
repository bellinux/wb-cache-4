50|$|The <b>would-be</b> <b>{{immigrants}}</b> to Palestine were {{housed in}} Nissen huts and tents at Poppendorf and Am Stau (near Lübeck) but inclement weather made the tents unsuitable. The DPs were then moved in November 1947 to Sengwarden near Wilhelmshaven and Emden. For {{many of the}} illegal immigrants this was only a transit point as the Brichah managed to smuggle most of them into the U.S. zone, from where they again attempted to enter Palestine. Most had successfully reached Palestine {{by the time of}} the Israeli Declaration of Independence. Of the 4,500 <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> to Palestine there were only 1,800 remaining in the two Exodus camps by April 1948.|$|R

30|$|This {{leaves a}} broad {{residual}} category of potential migrants towards whom {{states do not}} have any positive admission duties. From a liberal perspective this does not entail that states can turn away such <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> {{in the same way as}} the owner of a house may turn away a stranger by simply not answering the doorbell. Liberal democracies derive their legitimacy not only from representing the will of their people, but also from governing according to the rule of law. As pointed out by Schotel (2011), the coercion that states exercise over <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> through their immigration control qualifies as legally binding for those who are turned away only if these persons have some legal standing. This means that liberal states have to answer when the doorbell rings and provide reasons if they keep the door shut.|$|R
50|$|At hearings, {{asylum seekers}} and <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> are usually, but not invariably, {{represented}} by legal representatives including barristers, advocates, solicitors, and those {{registered with the}} Office of the Immigration Service Commissioner.

For some significant cases, the Home Office instructs a barrister from TSol to conduct the case.|$|R
50|$|Britain {{established}} the Aliens Act 1905 {{as a means}} of immigration control, restricted the immigration of the poor and Jews from eastern Europe and there was a steady decrease in alien admissions, partly because Jews chose other countries, like the United States, as well as the law having the effect of deterring <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants.</b> The Aliens Restriction Act 1914 allowed for deportation and had stricter immigration provisions. See also British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914.|$|R
40|$|Referendum 2002 : {{gender and}} the Bahamian citizenry. On February 27, 2002 Bahamians voted in a {{referendum}} {{to amend the}} country's constitution. There were several issues to be decided, but the one that caused the most debate was the question of citizenship. Under the present constitution, {{the way in which}} Bahamian citizenship is conferred on the spouses and children of Bahamian women, is, to say the least, irregular. The wives of Bahamian men are entitled to Bahamian citizenship; the husbands of Bahamian women are not granted any such entitlement and have to apply for citizenship like any other <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrant.</b> Similarly, the children of Bahamian men, whether born in the Bahamas or not, are Bahamians at birth; the children of Bahamian women have a far more complex fate. If a woman is unmarried, and has a child outside the Bahamas, her child is born Bahamian. But if she is married to a non-Bahamian, and gives birth outside the country, that child is merely entitled to apply for citizenship between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one, and may be refused. If offered citizenship, the child is then forced to renounce any other citizenship in order to receive Bahamian status. The recent referendum has generated plenty of political hay and I have no intention of adding straw to the pile. What interests me about this state of affairs is what is suggests about the way in which gender figures in the imagination of the Bahamian nation, and as such, I shall use it as a case study to test the ideas I raise in my discussion...|$|E
50|$|Australia {{has also}} sub-contracted {{with other nations}} to detain <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> offshore, {{including}} Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Nauru. Australia also maintains an offshore detention facility on Christmas Island. In July 2008, the Australian government announced it was ending its policy of automatic detention for asylum seekers who arrive in the country without visas. However, by September 2012, offshore detention was reinstated. Following the Australian federal election, 2013 policies have been toughened and Operation Sovereign Borders has been launched.|$|R
5000|$|Gana la Verde was a {{controversial}} game show which first aired in 2004 that promised the contestants (<b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> to the US) legal help with getting a green card.

50|$|In 1987, President Ronald Reagan {{appointed}} her to {{the federal}} bench as a United States District Judge in the Eastern District of New York.

50|$|In {{the period}} between World War I and World War II, {{conditions}} in Russia worsened, especially following the Revolution and the Great Famine of 1921. Many Volga Germans sought to leave the USSR, but faced opposition from a government that {{did not wish to}} see so large a portion of its population leave. The Russian government imposed a fee for obtaining a passport, which lead to protests as many <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> flooded the streets of Moscow. Many Mennonites were eventually able to leave, and between the World Wars, over 20,000 left destined for Canada.|$|R
50|$|Continuing his {{exploration}} of serious issues about society, Pirie researched Eastern Europe's Black Triangle for the Screen Two presentation Black Easter (BBC, tx. 4 June 1995). Although the drama {{was set in}} a near future world, in an immigrant exclusion zone guarded by advanced electronics, the real-life background was that Polish landscape which adjoins the eastern border of Germany and the EU, populated by a mass of refugees and dislocated people. The dark thriller focused on an investigation of an apparent race murder, leading to a disturbing underworld of <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants,</b> border police, corruption and cover-ups.|$|R

Could Cuba’s international solidarity program become, for <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> to the U. S., a means to that end? As an oral historian, I decided {{to go beyond the}} competing discourses presented in the press and seek the views of Cuban medical professionals themselves...|$|R
50|$|The Exodus 1947 {{passengers}} were successfully {{taken off the}} vessels in Germany. Relations between the British personnel on the ships and the {{passengers were}} afterwards said by the passengers to have been mostly amicable. Everyone realized {{there was going to}} be trouble at the forced disembarkation beforehand and some of the Jewish passengers even apologized in advance for this. A number were injured in confrontations with British troops that involved the use of batons and fire hoses. The <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> were sent back to DP camps in Am Stau near Lübeck and Pöppendorf. Although most of the women and children disembarked voluntarily, the men had to be carried off by force.|$|R

25|$|At {{the same}} time, however, {{concerns}} regarding immigration from Asian sources revealed overtly xenophobic and racist attitudes among Canadians, particularly English Canadians on the Pacific coast. At {{the time for}} many Canadian identity, whatever it was to be, did not include non-Europeans. While inexpensive Chinese labour had been needed to complete the transcontinental railway, {{the completion of the}} railway led to questions {{of what to do with}} the workers who were now no longer needed. Further Chinese immigration was limited and then banned by a series of restrictive and racially motivated dominion statutes. The Komagata Maru incident in 1914 revealed overt hostility towards <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants,</b> mainly Sikhs from India, who attempted to land in Vancouver.|$|R
50|$|Immigrants from {{countries}} {{that do not}} have automatic visa agreements, or who would not otherwise qualify for a visa, often cross the borders illegally in some areas like the United States-Mexico border, the Mona Channel between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, the Strait of Gibraltar, Fuerteventura, and the Strait of Otranto. Because these methods are illegal, they are often dangerous. <b>Would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> have been known to suffocate in shipping containers, boxcars, and trucks, sink in shipwrecks caused by unseaworthy vessels, die of dehydration or exposure during long walks without water. An official estimate puts {{the number of people who}} died in illegal crossings across the U.S.-Mexican border between 1998 and 2004 at 1,954 (see immigrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border).|$|R

40|$|What does it {{mean that}} rights are {{territorial}}? Do states have territorial rights? Do these rights justify the exclusion of <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants?</b> This paper will address these questions and explore the problems associated. The objective is to show how the right to exclude can be justified {{on the grounds that it}} is functionally related to the idea of territorial rights and collective self-determination. In doing so, the paper does not aim at covering the entire field of global redistributive justice and migration ethics. Its focus is on the justification and scope of the state’s territorial rights as well as, for analytical convenience, on the relation between territorial rights and the rights of non-forced migrants. By virtue of this focus, the key issue addressed will be what states can reasonably do as territorial states rather than what they owe others...|$|R
40|$|Trachoma is {{an ancient}} scourge, {{described}} in the Egyptian Ebers papyrus in 1900 BC and well known to Hippocrates. The disease was endemic in Europe until well into this century, and <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> to the USA were screened for trachoma by examination of the everted upper eyelid on arrival at Ellis Island, New York. Those in whom the characteristic follicles were seen were put on the next boat back to Europe so great was the fear of what was clearly recognised to be a contagious condition. 1 2 Many of the eye hospitals in Europe, including Moorfields, were founded specifically to treat trachoma, and in 1937 Duke-Elder stated that “its importance {{as a source of}} human suf-fering, as a cause of blindness, and as a national economic loss over large tracts of the world’s surface, is second to none among diseases of the eye”. ...|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the high}} profile of the Exodus 1947 {{emigration}} ship it was decided by the British government that the emigrants were to be deported back to France. Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin suggested this and the request was relayed to General Sir Alan Cunningham, High Commissioner for Palestine, who agreed with the plan after consulting the Navy. Before then, intercepted <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> were placed in internment camps on Cyprus, which {{was at the time}} a British colony. This new policy {{was meant to be a}} signal to both the Jewish community and the European countries which assisted immigration that whatever they sent to Palestine would be sent back to them.Not only should it clearly establish the principle of [...] as applies to a complete shipload of immigrants, but it will be most discouraging to the organisers of this traffic if the immigrants ... end up by returning whence they came.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to the ways and means to justify a ‘more’ {{cosmopolitan}} realization of certain policy implications, in the case of immigration. The raison d’être of this study is the idea that the contemporary debate over open borders suffers from indeterminate discussions on whether liberal states are entitled to restrict immigration. On the other hand, most of the liberal cosmopolitan accounts neglect the detrimental consequences of their open borders argument – which take it as a means to compensate people in need –, such as brain drain and the effects of brain drain on the opportunity sets of members of sending countries. Therefore I offer a moral cosmopolitan account of immigration which takes the interests of <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants,</b> the residents in receiving, along with the residents in sending countries in respect to their opportunity sets because of the way arbitrary border control represents the inequality of opportunity. I do not provide a well-formed immigration policy here, yet I believe the account provided here is more feasible in considering phenomena such as brain drain...|$|R
40|$|At {{the turn}} of the millennium, we are {{witnessing}} intense new worldwide migration and refugee flows. There are now some 100 million transnational immigrants plus an estimated 30 million refugees displaced from their homelands. These flows are largely structured by the intensification of globalization [...] a process of economic, social, and cultural transformation rapidly accelerating in the last decade. Globalization has increased immigration in a variety of ways. First, transnational capital flows (roughly a trillion dollars cross national boundaries every day) tend to stimulate migration because where capital flows, immigrants tend to follow. Second, the new information and communication technologies that {{are at the heart of}} globalization tend to stimulate migration because they encourage new standards of consumption and life-style choices. <b>Would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> imagine better opportunities elsewhere and mobilize to achieve them. Third, the affordability of mass transportation [...] last year approximately 1. 5 billion airline tickets were sold [...] has put the migration option within the reach of millions who heretofore could not consider it. Fourth, globalization has stimulated new migration because it has produced uneven results [...] big winners and losers. Demography; Economic conditions; Emigration and immigration...|$|R
40|$|Up until 1989 Australian {{immigration}} policy {{was based on}} Ministerial discretion. This gave the executive the power to decide policy without review either by parliament or the courts. But during the 1980 s the context changed. Many more <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> were already on Australian soil on a temporary basis and, if they were rejected, they could appeal to the courts. Ministerial discretion was hard to defend in court and selection criteria were progressively widened by court judgments. The Hawke Government compounded these difficulties {{by a number of}} unwise policy decisions. By 1996 the immigration program that the Howard Government inherited lacked a clear economic rationale, was dominated by family reunion, brought in many migrants who needed welfare support and was open to fraud It was also unpopular. The Howard/Ruddock reforms sharpened the program's economic focus, reduced the size of the family-reunion component, restricted new migrants 'access to welfare and increased the program's integrity. The new Government also took a firm stance on border control and tried to limit the role of the courts. Many of these reforms have been controversial but, by 2002, immigration was much less unpopular {{than it had been in}} 1996...|$|R
5000|$|Generally, those {{immigrants}} who were approved spent {{from two to}} five hours at Ellis Island. Arrivals were asked 29 questions including name, occupation, {{and the amount of}} money carried. It was important to the American government that the new arrivals could support themselves and have money to get started. The average the government wanted the immigrants to have was between 18 and 25 dollars ($600 in 2015 adjusted for inflation). Those with visible health problems or diseases were sent home or held in the island's hospital facilities for long periods of time. More than three thousand <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> died on Ellis Island while being held in the hospital facilities. Some unskilled workers were rejected because they were considered [...] "likely to become a public charge." [...] About 2 percent were denied admission to the U.S. and sent back to their countries of origin for reasons such as having a chronic contagious disease, criminal background, or insanity. Ellis Island was sometimes known as [...] "The Island of Tears" [...] or [...] "Heartbreak Island" [...] because of those 2% who were not admitted after the long transatlantic voyage. The Kissing Post is a wooden column outside the Registry Room, where new arrivals were greeted by their relatives and friends, typically with tears, hugs and kisses.|$|R
5000|$|Filming used {{conventional}} Super 16mm film, {{which was}} then processed and edited in England. The cinematographer, David Higgs, had been keen to try the new Red One high resolution digital camera. However, the team were concerned by the potentially limited contrast ratio using digital - a serious consideration in strong Mediterranean light - and that its potential bulkiness might inhibit Kosminsky's trademark hand-held cameras following the action. It was also felt that relying on comparatively simple well-known technology would be sensible operating so far from home. Ironically, however, the reliance on film led {{to a number of}} scenes having to be re-mounted after fogging went undetected for a week when it was impossible to get daily film rushes back to London because of the air travel disruption caused by the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland. [...] Extensive use was also made of CGI and digital post-production, including for the café explosion, the destruction at the King David Hotel, and the refugee ship of <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants.</b> [...] A particular challenge was how to realise the events at Bergen-Belsen. The film-makers considered and rejected a number of options, including live-action and CGI, before reluctantly deciding to fall back on black-and-white library footage from the Imperial War Museum in London, only to come to the view that the resulting sequence had more artistic and moral power than anything they {{might have been able to}} create.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to question, from the {{perspective}} of a principled theory of criminalization, the legitimacy of making irregular immigration (IM) a crime. In order to do this, I identify three main ways in which the political decision to introduce a crime of IM may be defended: according to the first, IM is a malum in se the wrongness of which resides in its being a violation of states’ territorial sovereignty; according to the second, IM is a justified malum prohibitum the wrongness of which resides in its being a violation of a justified immigration regulation; according to the third, IM is a malum in se the wrongness of which resides in its harmful consequences for receiving states’ citizens. My thesis is that none of these arguments succeeds in providing us with sufficiently good reasons to justify the use of criminal punishment to enforce the closure of state borders. As regards the first, I argue that it relies on a misleading conception of what is entailed by states’ territorial sovereignty, and that therefore it is unsound as an argument for the state’s right to control immigration (even though, were it sound, it would show IM to be a public malum in se, and thus a potential candidate for criminalization). With regard to the second, I argue that, be they legitimate or not, immigration regulations enacted by states cannot provide those <b>would-be</b> <b>immigrants</b> they aim to exclude with content-independent reasons to comply with them; and this is a necessary pre-condition to conclude that IM is a justified malum prohibitum. As regards harm-based approaches, I argue that the notions they rely on (such as collective/cultural harmfulness and precautionary responsibility) are completely unfit as criteria for criminalization. This leads me to the conclusion that, unless other more convincing arguments are provided for, IM should not be criminalized...|$|R
