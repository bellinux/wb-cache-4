5|$|The {{extent of}} the solar wind's {{influence}} on the dynamics of Jupiter's magnetosphere is currently unknown; however, it could be especially strong at times of elevated solar activity. The auroral radio, optical and X-ray emissions, as well as synchrotron emissions from the radiation belts all show correlations with solar <b>wind</b> <b>pressure,</b> indicating that the solar wind may drive plasma circulation or modulate internal processes in the magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|In 1881 Barlow sat {{as member}} of the <b>Wind</b> <b>Pressure</b> (Railway Structures) Commission {{established}} at {{the recommendation of the}} Tay Bridge report. He led the design of the replacement Tay Bridge (188287) with his son Crawford Barlow as engineer. The new design used large monocoque piers to support a double railway track. The old brick and masonry piers from the first bridge were retained as breakwaters for the new piers upstream. They can still be seen today as a forlorn reminder of the tragedy of 1879.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{radio and}} {{particle}} emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation, {{which makes the}} planet somewhat similar to a pulsar. This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment {{with respect to the}} rotational axis as well as by high-latitude magnetic anomalies. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions {{is similar to that of}} radio pulsars. They differ only in the scale, and Jupiter can be considered a very small radio pulsar too. In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar <b>wind</b> <b>pressure</b> and, hence, on solar activity.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the proper}} {{orthogonal}} decomposition (POD) and the autoregressive (AR) process {{is applied to}} simulate large <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> due to strong gusts on a tall structure. The POD is employed to identify the coherent structure characterizing strong <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> of the random pressure field. The eigenfunctions and the principal coordinates are computed using the covariance of the ensemble of large <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> in the POD analysis. The parametric autoregressive modeling technique is next employed to investigate and model the POD principal coordinates, and the fitted AR models are used to generate the new principal coordinates. The generated principal coordinates are used to simulate large <b>wind</b> <b>pressures.</b> It is shown that time series with large <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> are well reconstructed by the dominant modes obtained from the POD analysis, and that <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> with large peak values are simulated very well using both the principal coordinates generated by the AR models and the dominant POD modes...|$|R
40|$|As a {{pneumatic}} structure is always affected by dynamic <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> {{and a large}} defor-mation of its roof membrane is liable to occur, the dynamic as well as static behaviors of themembrane in natural winds must be studied. But the characteristics of <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> actingon the membrane and the response of this are very complicated. Therefore nowadays theseproblems are not enough understood. In this paper, regarding the low-rise pneumatic struc-ture, the relation between <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> acting on the membrane and the static and dynamicdisplacements is qualitatively examined...|$|R
40|$|The <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> on 3 -dimensional square prism {{models with}} various aspect ratios (h/b) were {{measured}} in a turbulent boundary layer. The models with {{the height of}} 40 cm and thewidths of 2, 4, 10 and 20 cm were used not to change the flow characteristics at the same heightof them. In the windward surfaces the <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> were not so much influenced by aspect ratios. In the other surfaces the <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> were influenced and to be distributed more uniformlyalong the height with decreasing aspect ratio...|$|R
5|$|Using these {{metal frames}} for taller buildings, however, meant exposing them to {{increased}} <b>wind</b> <b>pressure.</b> As a consequence, protective wind bracing {{had to be}} introduced, enabled {{by the work of}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel who produced equations for calculating the loads and moments on larger buildings. Metal-framed buildings were also vulnerable to fire and required special fireproofing. French engineers had made advances in this area in the early 19th century, and major breakthroughs came with the work of architect Peter Wight in the 1860s. Spurred on by the catastrophic fires in Chicago in 1871 and Boston in 1872, his findings were turned into a wide variety of patented fireproofing products during the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|Research programs, {{including}} field {{projects such}} as the VORTEX projects (Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment), deployment of TOTO (the TOtable Tornado Observatory), Doppler On Wheels (DOW), {{and dozens of other}} programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. Universities, government agencies such as the National Severe Storms Laboratory, private-sector meteorologists, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the National Science Foundation. The pace of research is partly constrained by the number of observations that can be taken; gaps in information about the <b>wind,</b> <b>pressure,</b> and moisture content throughout the local atmosphere; and the computing power available for simulation.|$|E
5|$|Saturn has an {{intrinsic}} magnetic field {{that has a}} simple, symmetric shape – a magnetic dipole. Its strength at the equator – 0.2gauss (20µT) – is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth's magnetic field. As a result, Saturn's magnetosphere is much smaller than Jupiter's. When Voyager 2 entered the magnetosphere, the solar <b>wind</b> <b>pressure</b> was high and the magnetosphere extended only 19 Saturn radii, or 1.1 million km (712,000mi), although it enlarged within several hours, and remained so for about three days. Most probably, the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of Jupiter – by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen layer called a metallic-hydrogen dynamo. This magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the Sun. The moon Titan orbits within the outer part of Saturn's magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in Titan's outer atmosphere. Saturn's magnetosphere, like Earth's, produces aurorae.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of unsteady aerodynamic force on structures related to gusty winds has been investigated. However, {{there is very}} little observation of gusty winds which damage structures and so their actual features haven 2 ̆ 7 t been clear yet. In this paper, we analyzed the statistical information of gusty winds to estimate unsteady <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> acting on actual structures. We matched the selected gusty winds with experimental results and calculated wind speeds equivalent to generate estimated unsteady <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> on actual structures. Then the equivalent wind speeds were compared with observed values. Our results showed that the estimated <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> were approximated with probability density function and the equivalent wind speeds generating <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> associated with return period of 10 years are stronger than observed wind speeds...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the mean <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> acting on side faces of the rectangular prismoscillating transversely in a uniform flow were examined in the previous paper. The purpose of thispaper is to investigate {{the behavior of the}} fluctuating <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> acting on the oscillating rectan-gular prism with side ratio 2 under the same experimental conditions as the previous study. Thefollowing main results are obtained. 1) It is considered that the restricted oscillation observed near the lower reduced wind velocity lessthan one half of the resonant wind velocity is caused by the fluctuating <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> acting onthe side surfaces near the windward edges of the prism. 2) The galloping oscillation for the higher reduced wind velocity is seemed to be caused by thefluctuating <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> acting on the side surfaces near the leeward edges at the middle heightof the prism while the phase angles of the pressures relative to the displacement move forwardas the reduced wind velocity becomes higher...|$|R
50|$|The Cathedral's organ {{was built}} by Lewis & Co. of Brixton, and {{completed}} in 1897. Thomas Christopher Lewis, the company's founder, was renowned for building instruments that had a bright, vibrant tone which, in part, was due to his use of low <b>wind</b> <b>pressures.</b> Consequently, he was somewhat out-of-step with the trend at the time, which was tending towards high <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> and rather thicker tone. The instrument's action was, and is, electro-pneumatic with slider chests, and the main case was designed by Arthur Blomfield.|$|R
5|$|The {{extent of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons {{of the solar}} wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar <b>wind</b> <b>pressure</b> compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind {{is greater than the}} speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.|$|E
25|$|The {{wind loading}} on a {{skyscraper}} is also considerable. In fact, the lateral wind load imposed on super-tall structures is generally the governing {{factor in the}} structural design. <b>Wind</b> <b>pressure</b> increases with height, so for very tall buildings, the loads associated with wind are larger than dead or live loads.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of his evidence, he was {{appointed}} a member of the subsequent Royal Commission into the effect of <b>wind</b> <b>pressure</b> on structures. The effects of high winds on large structures had been neglected at that time, and the commission conducted a series of measurements across Britain to gain an appreciation of wind speeds during storms, and the pressures they exerted on exposed surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Hope-Jones {{believed}} that higher <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> would allow pipes to more accurately imitate orchestral instruments by causing the pipes to produce harmonic overtones which, when mixed with other pipe ranks, produced tones more imitative of actual instruments. The high <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> {{also led to}} the development of instruments that are unique in theatre organs (such as the diaphone and tibia clausa), and allowed any rank in the organ to function as a solo instrument. These higher pressures were possible due to the development of high-velocity, motor-driven blowers and wind regulators.|$|R

It was {{showed that the}} occurrence condition of <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> on the prism model was that the radius r of curvature of stream path s was longer than 5 times of {{the width of the}} prism model. In this case, the severe suctions was observed to move downward and leeward on the side face of the prism model, when the incident wind perpendicularly attacked upon the front face of the prism model...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{an ongoing}} inter-laboratory {{comparative}} study of approach flow and <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> on low buildings are presented. The wind tunnel data generated at six wind engineering laboratories during a pilot project initiated and coordinated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology was employed. Variability in the laboratory wind loading on low buildings was investigated. The largest variability in the laboratory <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> and in the associated wind-induced internal loading in structural frames of generic low buildings was found for suburban wind exposure, for which an average coefficient of variation of 26. 6 % was observed. This variability was primarily attributed to differences in the approach flows employed in physical modeling of <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> on tested buildings, {{carried out by the}} participating laboratories. The variability in the approach flows resulted in a large measure from the differences in the along-wind turbulence intensity implied by different empirical models, defining the target wind exposures and used by the laboratories...|$|R
25|$|The aurorae of Saturn {{are highly}} variable. Their {{location}} and brightness strongly {{depends on the}} Solar wind pressure: the aurorae become brighter and move closer to the poles when the Solar <b>wind</b> <b>pressure</b> increases. The bright auroral features are observed to rotate with the angular speed of 60–75% that of Saturn. From time to time bright features appear in the dawn sector of the main oval or inside it. The average total power emitted by the aurorae is about 50GW in the far ultraviolet (80–170nm) and 150–300GW in the near-infrared (3–4μm—H3+ emissions) parts of the spectrum.|$|E
25|$|In the magnetodisk region, beyond 6Rs, {{the plasma}} within the corotating sheet exerts a {{significant}} centrifugal {{force on the}} magnetic field, causing it to stretch. This interaction creates a current in the equatorial plane flowing azimuthally with rotation and extending as far as 20Rs from the planet. The total strength of this current varies from 8 to 17MA. The ring current in the saturnian magnetosphere is highly variable and depends of the solar <b>wind</b> <b>pressure,</b> being stronger when the pressure is weaker. The magnetic moment associated with this current slightly (by about 10nT) depresses the magnetic field in the inner magnetosphere, although it increases the total magnetic moment of the planet and causing {{the size of the}} magnetosphere to become larger.|$|E
25|$|Airy was {{consulted}} about wind {{speeds and}} pressures {{likely to be}} encountered on the proposed Forth suspension bridge being designed by Thomas Bouch for the North British Railway in the late 1870s. He thought that pressures no greater than about 10 pounds per square foot could be expected, a comment Bouch took to mean also applied to the first Tay railway bridge then being built. Much greater pressures, however, can be expected in severe storms. Airy was called to give evidence before the Official Inquiry into the Tay Bridge disaster, and was criticised for his advice. However, little was known {{about the problems of}} wind resistance of large structures, and a Royal Commission on <b>Wind</b> <b>Pressure</b> was asked to conduct research into the problem.|$|E

50|$|The Tibia may be voiced on <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> from 10&Prime; to 25&Prime;. The Tibia is {{generally}} {{used as a}} chorus stop, with or without tremulant; it is not normally used as a solo stop due to its relatively dull tone.|$|R
25|$|Areas such as Indonesia {{where the}} main crop {{consists}} of rice {{will be more}} vulnerable to the increased intensity of ENSO effects {{in the future of}} climate change. University of Washington professor, David Battisti, researched the effects of future ENSO patterns on the Indonesian rice agriculture using 's 2007 annual report and 20 different logistical models mapping out climate factors such as <b>wind</b> <b>pressure,</b> sea-level, and humidity, and found that rice harvest will experience a decrease in yield. Bali and Java, which holds 55% of the rice yields in Indonesia, will be likely to experience 9–10% probably of delayed monsoon patterns, which prolongs the hungry season. Normal planting of rice crops begin in October and harevest by January. However, as climate change affects ENSO and consequently delays planting, harvesting will be late and in drier conditions, resulting in less potential yields.|$|E
25|$|The {{electro-pneumatic}} {{action was}} invented by Robert Hope-Jones, and {{is considered by many}} to be the single most significant development in pipe organs. Up to the turn of the 20th century, all pipe organs were operated by a tracker, tubular pneumatic, or pneumatic Barker-lever action, where the keys and pedals were physically connected to the pipe valves via wooden trackers, except in the case of tubular pneumatic, where all actions were operated by air pressure. Hope-Jones' electro-pneumatic action eliminated this by using <b>wind</b> <b>pressure,</b> controlled by electric solenoids, to operate the pipe valves, and solenoids and pistons to control and operate the various stop tabs, controls, keys and pedals on the console. This action allowed the console to be physically detached from the organ. All signals from the console were transmitted by an electric cable to an electro-pneumatic relay, and from there to the pipes and effects in the organ chambers.|$|E
25|$|Saturn is {{the source}} of rather strong low {{frequency}} radio emissions called Saturn kilometric radiation (SKR). The frequency of SKR lies in the range 10–1300kHz (wavelength of a few kilometers) with the maximum around 400kHz. The power of these emissions is strongly modulated by the rotation of the planet and is correlated with changes in the solar <b>wind</b> <b>pressure.</b> For instance, when Saturn was immersed into the giant magnetotail of Jupiter during Voyager 2 flyby in 1981, the SKR power decreased greatly or even ceased completely. The kilometeric radiation is thought to be generated by the Cyclotron Maser Instability of the electrons moving along magnetic field lines related to the auroral regions of Saturn. Thus the SKR is related to the auroras around the poles of the planet. The radiation itself comprises spectrally diffuse emissions as well as narrowband tones with bandwidths as narrow as 200Hz. In the frequency–time plane arc like features are often observed, much like {{in the case of the}} Jovian kilometric radiation. The total power of the SKR is around 1GW.|$|E
50|$|Projected area is {{two-dimensional}} {{area measurement}} of a three-dimensional object by projecting its shape {{on to an}} arbitrary plane.

40|$|The <b>wind</b> induced <b>pressures</b> on a roof {{may reduce}} the {{efficiency}} of a pressurization system. A simple model building {{was used to determine}} the pressure coefficients on the roof surface for several wind directions with and without a parapet. The model was placed in an open jet wind tunnel for the measurement of pressure and the observation of flow(s).

40|$|The {{lower part}} of the {{atmospheric}} boundary layer (strong wind conditions) was simulated in low speed wind tunnel for the modeling of wind loads on low-rise structures. The turbulence characteristics of the turbulent boundary layer in the wind tunnel are compared with full scale measurements and with measurements made at NASA Wallops Flight Center. <b>Wind</b> <b>pressures</b> measured on roofs of a 1 : 70 scale model of a small single family dwelling were compared with results obtained from full scale measurements. The results indicate a favorable comparison between full scale and model pressure data as far as mean, r. m. s. and peak pressures are concerned. In addition, results also indicate that proper modeling of the turbulence is essential for proper simulation of the <b>wind</b> <b>pressures...</b>|$|R
500|$|During the Romantic period, {{the organ}} became more symphonic, capable of {{creating}} a gradual crescendo. New technologies {{and the work of}} organ builders such as , Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, and Henry Willis made it possible to build larger organs with more stops, more variation in sound and timbre, and more divisions. Enclosed divisions became common, and registration aids were developed {{to make it easier for}} the organist to manage the great number of stops. The desire for louder, grander organs required that the stops be voiced on a higher <b>wind</b> <b>pressure</b> than before. As a result, a greater force was required to overcome the <b>wind</b> <b>pressure</b> and depress the keys. To solve this problem, Cavaillé-Coll configured the English [...] "Barker lever" [...] to assist in operating the key action.|$|E
500|$|Tracker {{action has}} been used from antiquity to modern times. Despite the extra effort needed in playing, many organists prefer tracker action because of a feel and a control of the pipe valve operation. Before the pallet opens, <b>wind</b> <b>pressure</b> augments tension of the pallet spring, but once the pallet opens, only the spring tension is felt at the key. This {{provides}} a [...] "breakaway" [...] feel.|$|E
500|$|Large organs {{such as the}} one {{installed}} in 1361 in Halberstadt, Germany, the first documented permanent organ installation, likely prompted Guillaume de Machaut to describe the organ as [...] "the king of instruments", a characterization still frequently applied. The Halberstadt organ was the first instrument to use a chromatic key layout across its three manuals and pedalboard, although the keys were wider than on modern instruments. It had twenty bellows operated by ten men, and the <b>wind</b> <b>pressure</b> was so high that the player had to use the full strength of his arm to hold down a key.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-20th century, organ {{builders}} {{began to}} build historically inspired instruments modelled on Baroque organs. They returned to building mechanical key actions, voicing with lower <b>wind</b> <b>pressures</b> and thinner pipe scales, and designing specifications with more mixture stops. This {{became known as the}} Organ reform movement.|$|R
40|$|Solar cycle {{variations}} of auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) observed by the Akebono satellite have been {{compared with the}} {{variations of}} F 10. 7 and solar <b>wind</b> dynamic <b>pressure.</b> F 10. 7 and solar <b>wind</b> dynamic <b>pressure</b> show different solar cycle variations: F 10. 7 increases during solar maximum and decreases during solar minimum. Solar <b>wind</b> dynamic <b>pressure</b> suddenly increases in the declining phase of solar activity and gradually decreases. The pressure minimum occurs during solar maximum. Statistical analysis of the Akebono data has shown that AKR occurrence minimum occurs during solar maximum, however AKR occurrence maximum coincides not with solar <b>wind</b> dynamic <b>pressure</b> peak but with F 10. 7 minimum. Up-flowing ion (UFI) events and ambient plasma density, which are associated with generation conditions of AKR, also show similar behavior. They are dependent not on solar <b>wind</b> dynamic <b>pressure</b> but on F 10. 7. These results suggest the anti-correlation between discrete aurora and solar activities, which has been never recognized through the studies on secular variations of auroral phenomena mainly based on old auroral records obtained in mid-latitude regions...|$|R
