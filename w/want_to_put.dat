5|$|In a {{telephone}} interview with Today's Zaman, in 2009, Finkelstein stated:I think Israel, {{as a number of}} commentators pointed out, is becoming an insane state. And we have to be honest about that. While {{the rest of the world}} wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding out}} that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true {{feelings}} about the accident and more is revealed about how they actually have felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she {{shows up at the}} office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie, who is at the fundraiser, tells people that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all they did was dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in the waiting room, and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later.|$|E

25|$|Phil is told by Ian that Ben {{has died}} after a {{homophobic}} attack following a night out, however this {{turns out to}} be Paul, Ben's boyfriend. Ben struggles to grieve for Paul's death and asks Phil for a gun to take revenge, but he refuses and Ben disappears. When Grant returns to Walford again, he accuses Phil of killing Peggy and still orders him to return all of the money Phil owes to him. After going through Sharon's bag, Phil learns that Grant has a son, Mark Fowler (Ned Porteous), with Sharon's best friend Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully/Jenna Russell) following a one-night stand 21 years previously. After agreeing to drop the truth, Phil denies speaking to Mark. Unbeknownst to Phil, Denise discovers she is five months pregnant by him {{as a result of a}} one-night stand they had. Ben and Jay are kidnapped by Paul's killers and he attempts to go after them, however when he collapses Grant offers to help him get Ben and Jay back. In gratitude for Grant rescuing Ben, Phil tells Grant that Mark is his son. Grant persuades Phil to attend Paul's funeral for Ben's sake, which he does. Phil lends Grant money to support him financially and Grant tells him to fight his liver condition. Later, Ben tells Phil that he will donate part of his liver. Phil advises against it but Ben is adamant, however, Ben's psychiatric test results mean that it is unlikely he will be able to. Phil is hospitalised again with an infection and Sharon discovers that Phil has changed his will to leave everything to Louise so she forces him to have the will amended to include her. When Jay returns, Sharon allows him back into the Mitchell household, and when Phil is discharged and returns home, he eventually allows Jay to live there. When Phil has been sober for six months, he refuses to have the transplant, devastating his family, though Sharon supports his decision. However, after one of Dennis's friends at school is stabbed and dies, Dennis is visibly upset, and therefore Phil decides to go on the transplant list after realising he does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his family through the upset of his death. Phil decides he wants to spend Christmas alone and Sharon reluctantly agrees. Phil is taken to hospital when a liver is found and changes his mind about being alone at Christmas, and he does not change his mind after tests show that the liver is not suitable. Jay has a visit from his police public protection officer, who says Jay will have to move out as Louise is underage. Phil refuses to make Jay leave, despite being told that Louise could be taken into care. On Christmas Day 2016, a matching liver is found and Phil at last has the operation.|$|E
500|$|In May, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) was released. Sammy Siegler {{took over}} {{drumming}} duties {{for the band}} {{for much of the}} album, which featured a more experimental sound, described by Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine as [...] "neo-prog alt-metal". At Durst's insistence, the album was released as an underground album, without any advertising or promotion. Borland disagreed with the decision, suggesting that it was [...] "self-sabotage": [...] "Maybe he was already unhappy with the music, and he didn't really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it out there." ...|$|E

[...] Growing up, Schenn patterned his play after fellow defencemen Chris Pronger and Rob Blake.|$|E
500|$|Chabon was {{ambivalent}} about his new-found fame. He turned down offers {{to appear in}} a Gap ad and to be featured as one of Peoples [...] "50 Most Beautiful People."

500|$|The {{movie and}} Close were praised by The New York Times: [...] "Ms. Close, lean and more mature, hints that {{a touch of}} desperation lies in Nellie's cockeyed optimism." [...] The review also commented that the movie [...] "is beautifully produced, better than the stagy 1958 film" [...] and praised the singing. Kenrick, however, dislikes the adaptation: [...] "You {{certainly}} won't ever <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> this disaster in your player, {{unless you want to}} hear the sound of Rodgers and Hammerstein whirling in their graves. Glenn Close is up to the material, but her supporting cast is uniformly disastrous. [...] A pointless and offensive waste of money, time and talent." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{deciding}} the band's next single, Ray Davies pushed for [...] "Come Dancing" [...] {{to be released}} rather than [...] "Don't Forget to Dance," [...] which had been suggested by the record company as the first single from State of Confusion. The UK branch of Arista Records approved this decision, releasing 7-inch and 12-inch versions of the new single on 19 November 1982 with [...] "Noise" [...] as the B-side. However, Clive Davis initially had reservations; Davies recalls that Davis [...] "didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it out {{because it was too}} much of an English subject matter". Davis also thought it was just a [...] "ditty" [...] and did not have enough substance to be a single.|$|E
500|$|Derulo {{explained}} {{that he did not}} believe in the possibility of [...] "It Girl" [...] to be the next single from Future History. However, his peers believed that it was very distinct from the lead single, [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] and that response motivated him to pick it as the second single. He believed that showing the difference in the new album was important in picking the single. He did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> another dance song so that his fans do not assume that the entire album consisted of uptempo songs. He concluded that [...] "growing up has definitely taken place. My music has always been a representation of who I am and I guess I speak differently, my demeanour is different." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{composing}} {{tracks for}} Meet Miley Cyrus, Cyrus was originally very apprehensive {{in regards to}} adding [...] "See You Again" [...] to the album. [...] "I'm not sure about this song. I don't think I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it on the album. I don't really like it that much. It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once {{she listened to the}} finished product, she changed her mind. She thought it was odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E

500|$|... "Faith Won't Fail" [...] was {{inspired}} by faith always sufficing in Bible situations and chapters; and Hudson commented on [...] "Search Me": [...] "I was struggling {{with the fact that}} I would have the huge responsibility of how others would be affected through what I was doing or saying on stage. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on some kind of front that everything is good when it's not. I wanted to keep it real, but still give people hope." [...] The record closes with [...] "When There's Nothing Left", which {{has been described as a}} [...] "crisp and clean 'love note' to God". The album was described as not being in the vein of the bubble gum pop variety rather evoking comparisons to the Christian pop songstresses Rachel Lampa and Jaci Velasquez.|$|E
500|$|Both [...] "Permanent Record" [...] and [...] "Al in the Box" [...] were titles {{proposed}} by Yankovic; however, he favored the former, whereas his label preferred the latter. Both parties, being unwilling to yield, eventually decided to compromise and name the release Permanent Record: Al in the Box. The album {{also included a}} detailed booklet, written by Yankovic's long-time associate, Dr. Demento. When Yankovic's recording contract was transferred from Scotti Brothers to Volcano in the late 1990s, the artwork for the set was lost, forcing the set {{to go out of}} print; although Yankovic noted that the label [...] "could just scan existing booklets and CD art and crank out boxed sets with slightly inferior graphics," [...] he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out a product that was not up to his usual standards.|$|E
