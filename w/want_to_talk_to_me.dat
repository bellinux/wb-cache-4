As he released George, he said, 'Anytime you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> just pick up the phone and come over.' It was a vintage LBJ performance." ...|$|E

60|$|Then I {{would find}} myself {{thinking}} {{with the utmost}} particularity of her face. Had it changed at all? Was it altogether changed?

50|$|Professor Kreiner agreed: “One of the {{problems}} that everybody has with PISA is that they don’t want to discuss things with people criticising or asking questions concerning the results.

I find they are perfectly willing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people, but they don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people who are shocked by their ideas, nor do they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people who are not realistic." ...|$|R

5000|$|Eugen Doga’s concerts {{took place}} in the biggest concert halls. They [...] "gathered huge audiences”, and they still do so today. [...] "...There were so many offenses because of Eugen Doga’s concerts; people just did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> They told me: [...] "I have been asking you for three years, and you can’t arrange Eugen Doga’s concert." [...] And I really couldn't, because he was very busy. In Leningrad there was a concert {{orchestra}} conducted by Anatoly Badhen, a wonderful orchestra, unequaled in the Soviet Union, which played high-quality music. This orchestra for many years gave a lot of concerts with Eugen Doga’s music everywhere, throughout the Soviet Union" [...] - Mikhail Murzak. Philharmonic Director of Chișinău (1972-1988 years).|$|E

5000|$|While commentating the 1986 Indianapolis 500, {{as there}} was a yellow flag out very {{near the end of}} the race, Posey used a two-way radio to ask an impromptu {{question}} to race leader Kevin Cogan. Posey was trying to ask Cogan about his thoughts in leading the Indianapolis 500 at this stage. Cogan tried to stave off the conversation once, but Posey persisted a second time, at which time Cogan politely replied to Posey that he was [...] "a little busy now," [...] but would talk to him later. Posey understood the circumstances and told the audience if that were he, [...] "I wouldn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> either." [...] Moments later, on a restart with two laps remaining, Bobby Rahal jumped Cogan on the restart and went on to win.|$|E
5000|$|Aslan-Levy {{was quoted}} in The Jewish Chronicle as saying: [...] "Galloway refused to share a {{platform}} with me for no reason other than my nationality: not because of anything I had done or said, {{but because of the}} passport I hold. One of the grounds for discrimination, as defined in the Race Relations Act, is nationality". Aslan-Levy later told the Daily Mail [...] "I'm sure he would have talked to an Israeli Arab, he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> because I am an Israeli Jew." [...] Julian Huppert, the Liberal Democrat MP for Cambridge, stated: [...] "It is pretty pathetic that George Galloway walked out of the debate when he found out that another speaker was Israeli." [...] Joan Smith wrote: [...] "It was a typical Galloway performance, characterising himself as the victim of what was actually very bad manners on his part". The Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) National Committee subsequently released a statement indicating that while it does support a [...] "boycott of Israel", the campaign rejects boycotting an individual [...] "because she or he happens to be Israeli or because they express certain views." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Bravado" [...] {{was written}} by Lorde (credited under her birth-name Ella Yelich-O'Connor) and Joel Little, while {{production}} for the song was handled by the latter. The track was written and recorded in 2012 at Little's Golden Age Studios in Auckland. Within a week, Lorde had finished recording [...] "Bravado" [...] alongside [...] "Royals" [...] and [...] "Biting Down" [...] during a school break. Chris Schulz, from The New Zealand Herald, described [...] "Bravado" [...] as a chamber pop piece, while The Village Voices Brittany Spanos called it an electropop song. Running for a duration of [...] (three minutes and 41 seconds), the track is composed on electronic beats in the key of B minor and plays in common time at a moderate tempo of 88 beats per minute. Lorde's vocal range on the song spans from F3 to D5. The lyrics of [...] "Bravado" [...] address the idea [...] "of false confidence delivering real confidence" [...] and of Lorde stepping into a line of work where, she said, [...] "everyone would be watching me, and everyone would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and confront me". Lorde cited the line [...] "Me found bravery in my bravado" [...] from Kanye West's song [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] as an influence. Simon Collins, of The West Australian, called [...] "Bravado" [...] a particularly prescient song, preempting Lorde's rise to prominence. At a point of the song, Lorde confesses [...] "to a battle between shyness and show-business aspirations"::I learned not to want:The quiet {{of the room with}} no one around to find me out:I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go.|$|E
