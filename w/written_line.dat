50|$|The {{handwriting}} in {{the body}} of Shakespeare’s last will and testament indicates that it is written all by one person in at least two sessions: First the entire will of three pages, then a revision on {{the lower half of the}} first page that runs over onto page 2, and finally the additions or bequests that are inserted between the lines.

Uncle Tupelo was inspired by bands such as Jason & the Scorchers and the Minutemen, influencing the recording of Wilco's A.M.. Tweedy and O'Rourke enjoyed free jazz artists such as Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, and Derek Bailey; they also listen to mainstream jazz by artists such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane. The lyrical structure of Wilco's songs was dictated by classic literature and cadavre exquis—an exercise where band members take turns writing lines on a typewriter, but are only allowed to see the previously <b>written</b> <b>line.</b> Among the books that the band has cited as being stylistically influential include William H.

40|$|Unruly Lines {{argues that}} writers in early modern England use {{the figure of}} the line as a tool in {{developing}} new modes of representation, and that their written lines are an index for political, aesthetic, and epistemological issues surfacing in the period. Asserting that textual materiality and the technical practices of playing were crucial to the development of literary form, this dissertation proposes that the poetic line and the line of dialogue find literary art reflecting broad early-modern cultural assumptions. By looking beyond literature to discourses as varied as the visual arts, mathematics, architecture, and law, the project offers a variety of different ways to see the <b>written</b> <b>line</b> anew. Examining moments wherein lines introduce ways of meaning distinct from verbal semantics, this project claims that early modern writers began perceiving in the <b>written</b> <b>line</b> a means to challenge and disrupt habituated strategies for apprehension. Evenly divided into sections on poetry and drama, this project proposes that the inventiveness and self-reflexivity for which the early modern period's literature is known stem from the line's ability to challenge ordered systems of representation-to contest the presumed "rules" of art. The first two chapters, which consider poetry by King James, John Donne, and William Shakespeare, argue that the shape and structure of verse lines mark poetry as a specialized mode of discourse capable of figuring forth ideas unattainable in other media. Visually ragged, uneven, or blatantly artful and ornamental lines, I argue, start to diagrammatically supplement and juxtapose vivid verbal images. The second half of the project then considers how players use lines of dialogue, and focuses on works by John Lyly, George Peele, and Shakespeare. These chapters explain how lines drawn into individual actors' parts (indicating their cues) function as technical devices for building-and breaking up and challenging-the limits of theatrical space. As each chapter demonstrates, poets and playwrights take advantage of the verbal line's inability to offer only semantic meaning by cultivating self-consciously disruptive and unruly representations. These texts take into account the experiences of readers and audiences, and strive to actively build, rather than simply report, knowledge. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Improvements in {{distributed}} computing, and {{the technologies}} that enable them, {{have led to}} significant advancements in middleware functionality and quality, mainly through networking and protocols. However, the distributed programing style has changed little over the years. Most programs are still <b>written</b> <b>line</b> per line of code in languages such as C, Cþþ, and Java. These conventional programs that can provide grid operations and grid data {{can be considered as}} common grid resources and shared by research and education communities worldwide. However, there are no relevant programing methodologies to utilize efficiently these shared service providers as a potentially vast grid repository, except through the manual writing of code. Realization of the potential of grid computing requires significant improvements in grid programing methodologies. The Grid interactive service-oriented (GISO) methodology presented provides a programming environment with development tools that permit true interactive grid programming. The GISO approach permits the different elements of programming to be stored, reused, aggregated, and executed with concurrency and a grid-level control strategy not achievable in the conventional programming languages...|$|E

40|$|Liquid {{dispensing}} {{and writing}} in the extremely small size regime are important for applications in many current technologies, such as micro/nano fabrication, biological/chemical patterning and analysis, and drug discovery. Most of current dispensing/writing methods can be sorted into a category of liquid flowing through tiny tubes or nozzles that requires inputting an impulse energy, which leads to complex procedures, expensive equipment and narrow material applicability, especially for biomaterials. Here, we report a method {{that may lead to}} a new category: liquid flows over the tapered surface of a pin with longitudinal nano grooves on the surface to uninterruptedly perform droplet dispensing and direct writing. The dispensed droplet diameters were controllable from several microns down to 150 nm, and the <b>written</b> <b>line</b> heights were as low as 5 nm. The mechanism underlying automatic liquid storage on conical surface and spontaneous liquid transport through nano grooves is revealed and well modeled by a simple relationship. Furthermore, the nano-grooved pins are much simpler and cheaper in fabrication than nanoscale tubes and nozzles, and pins have much depressed clogging problems that are typically troublesome for tubes and nozzles. Our new strategy may constitute a basis for creating liquid dispensing/writing technologies that are simultaneously smaller, simpler, faster and applicable for more types of materials.

40|$|A departing {{assumption}} {{in my work}} is {{the idea}} about {{a particular kind of}} conflict inherent in the theatrical line, produced by its situatedness in the specific relational doubt created in the speaking, performing voice and body, a space articulated already in the <b>written</b> <b>line,</b> as writing intended to be spoken. To the inherent self-contradiction in such utterances are added the layers of conscious and unconscious intent, discrepancies and dissonances emerging in relation to those who witness the act of speaking. The theatrical line thus entails a very particular kind of poetic possibility, that of the self listening to the premises for its own existence: attempting, questioning, reverting, resisting, and repositioning herself in doing so; the mythical is operating on the level of the line. My exploration of these specific aspects of the dramatic line unfolds in three parts: »Voices«, »The Negotiations of Antigone« and »Prescripts«, each applying different literary modes and methods to the exploration. These parts nevertheless all use and constitute the repetitions and variations to be experienced, which are essential to the specific subject – lines written to be spoken by actors. Voice, situation, difference, myth, non-presence, polyphony, identity and time are investigated and set into action in the first part »Voices«, thinking with, among others Gertrude Stein, Walter Benjamin and Nathalie Sarraute. In »The Negotiations of Antigone« I use Sophocles drama as well as different readings and interpretations of the actions and lines of Antigone as a prism through which to further explore and complicate the notion of doubt and reflection inherent in a dramatic conflict. »prescripts«, finally, in dialogue with Inger Christensen’s Det (1969) probes the spatial and relational frameworks suggested by the theatrical concepts the stage, the action and the text in 533 subsequent lines for us who listen and observe, for her who acts and speaks; entangled in constitutive transformations...|$|E

40|$|The {{travelling}} scholar’ is {{an essay}} published in Rodney Graham’s artist’s book British Weathervanes (2009, reprinted 2011), produced {{in conjunction with}} the inauguration of Graham's weathervane on the cupola of the Whitechapel Gallery, London. Slyce’s essay explores the legacy of Erasmus and Humanism through the prism of Passmore Edwards and his efforts to establish a public library in Whitechapel. This text continued Slyce’s experiments with alternative modes of writing and art criticism. Early plans for the Whitechapel Library included provision for an unrealised weathervane. Graham based the weathervane on an anecdote which claimed that Erasmus wrote his most well-known work, The Praise of Folly, on horseback during a journey from Italy to England, around 1510. The form and content of Slyce’s text mirrors Graham’s own chameleon-like art practices, through the adoption of an anachronistic style and tone more closely associated with humanist literature of the 19 th century. Although Graham is only mentioned by name once, each <b>written</b> <b>line</b> can be read as a statement about his work and practice. Slyce took a similar approach in his essay ‘Becky Beasley: Vermischte Bemerkungen: correspondences’, in the limited-edition artist’s book Thomas Bernard Malamud (2009). In this context, Slyce weaved a set of 32 quotations (being the number of Bach’s Goldberg Variations as performed by Glenn Gould in 1955; 1981) from Ludwig Wittgenstein’s writings gathered together posthumously in Culture and Value (1977; 1985). The quotations were ordered and adjusted to produce a complementary set of propositions about Beasley’s own practice and the writings she draws upon. Slyce presented his research into prevalent modes of critical theory at the ‘Contemporary Painting in Context’ symposium December 2013 at the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in conjunction with Tate Britain...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} significance of a concept known as yphos among the last remaining psaltes (chanters) of the millennium-old tradition at the Patriarchal church of Constantinople, in Istanbul, Turkey. Collaborating with Stilianos Floikos, the youngest [...] and possibly the last [...] of these psaltes, I take as my point of departure his beliefs and practices regarding yphos, which he conceives as manifest through complex processes of melodic interpretation as he chants from contemporary traditional neumatic scores. These interpretations, through which Stilianos manifests yphos, directly contradict the melody explicitly written on the scores from which he chants. While this may appear to reflect a break with tradition I demonstrate, by conducting comparative analyses between contemporary and older neumes, that Stilianos' processes of melodic interpretation are rooted in oral practices associated with these older neumes. Informed by this historical background, I identify elements of yphos in Stilianos' processes of interpretation by comparing seven of his performances of a single score. My melographic and formal analyses, combined with Stilianos' explanations, demonstrate that his interpretations involved a process of reconstruction based on underlying implicit musical structures. Having explicated this process, I am able to address directly the central focus of this dissertation: the phenomenology of yphos. From Stilianos' description of his experience, {{it becomes clear that}} when chanting a <b>written</b> <b>line</b> he perceives multiple layers of remembered melody, together with people and events associated with them. By chanting with and against these melodies he creates resonances. These resonances create for him an environment of constant recontextualization, imbuing his every act with multiple meanings while bringing him into dialogue with psaltes of the past. Borrowing the term from literary theorist Sarah Dillon, I describe this experience of interaction with multiple layers, paradoxically discrete yet inseparable, as "palimpsestuous. " From this, I develop a palimpsest theory, which not only provides a framework that renders transparent Stilianos' experience of yphos, but also can inform studies of musical style and affect, oral and written transmission, and processes of human memory. Like a space resounding with echoes, Stilianos' community continues to reflect, transmit, and reshape the echoing resonances of its pas...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a comparative}} {{investigation of the}} work of two subtitlers of Swedish films translated into French in the last decade of 20 th century. It is a look at how they try to render the illusion of spoken language in the <b>written</b> <b>line</b> that is a subtitle. This effect has to be created despite the constraints of time, synchronisation, readability, and the limited number of characters available to work with. We have shown that the subtitles examined in this work include many of the characteristics typical of spoken French. These characteristics can be classified as belonging to the Phonetic, the Lexical or the Syntactic level. At the lexical level we can see that the translators use expressions with a lower style-level than the originals but manage to avoid being too shocking, innovative or destabilizing for the audience. We have also shown diastratic language differences in translation: our subtitlers strengthen characters of social differences by using a different language style depending on the status that the person in question has. Because of the polysemiotic nature of film it is not the primary purpose of a subtitler to translate everything. Typically verbal speech characteristics such as repetition, hesitation, incomplete phrases and non-informational expressions that are often seen as less acceptable in the written word are normally sacrificed in subtitles. On the other hand, we could not show that the original language (Swedish) had a sizable impact on the style and construction of the subtitles. We also looked at possible stylistic differences between the two subtitlers translations and tried {{to find out if the}} “voice” of the subtitler shone through. If so, we were interested in attempting to see if a difference could be caused by the fact that one of the subtitlers has French as her native language while the other translates from his second language. We were not able to relate the cause of the difference of style we observed to anything other than the original dialogue’s changing style-levels. In which direction the verbal content in subtitles will develop is an interesting and relevant question. In this work we have identified a development of style that has taken place during recent years in French subtitles to Swedish films. This development goes from a previous situation where the style of the spoken word was practically unused compared to today’s more frequent and systematic use...|$|E
