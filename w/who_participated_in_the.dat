5|$|Five {{days after}} the British surrendered, Congress passed a {{resolution}} agreeing to erect a structure dedicated to commemorating those <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle. Construction of the monument was delayed, however, {{as the federal government}} had several other financial obligations that were considered to be of a more urgent nature. The battle's centennial sparked renewed enthusiasm in the resolution and prompted the government to begin building the monument in 1881 amid national support. The structure was formally erected in 1884 and currently resides within Colonial National Historical Park.|$|E

5|$|When a {{new type}} of film {{allowing}} the photographing of faster moving action was introduced in 1931, Cronjager was one of the cinematographers <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ASC's field testing of the product. In 1932 Cronjager worked with two other well-known cinematographers, Lucien Andriot and Clyde De Vinna, on King Vidor's film, Bird of Paradise. The individual results of the three photographers was very high quality, but the integration of their work, all with very different styles, proved less than desirable to critics. Cronjager worked with Dix again in 1933, on the film The Lost Squadron, which also starred Mary Astor, and was directed by George Archainbaud.|$|E
