Jealous, Gruntilda creates a machine that can transfer a person's level of beauty to another, which she intends to use with Tooty. She then abducts Tooty from Banjo's house while he is sleeping. In response to the kidnapping, Kazooie wakes Banjo up and the two set out to rescue her.

Cherry stated that casting the two roles was difficult because of their limited involvement in the first few episodes of the series.

25|$|Rogers {{suggested}} that the incongruent individual, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> on the defensive and cannot be open to all experiences, is not functioning ideally and may even be malfunctioning. They work hard at maintaining/protecting their self-concept. Because their lives are not authentic {{this is a difficult}} task and they are under constant threat. They deploy defense mechanisms to achieve this. He describes two mechanisms: distortion and denial. Distortion occurs when the individual perceives a threat to their self-concept. They distort the perception until it fits their self-concept.|$|E

25|$|In the {{original}} Shower series from 1965, {{a man is}} depicted standing under a shower but with no water. Kabakov interpreted the work as a simple but universal metaphor about the individual <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> waiting for something, but never receives anything. Instead, the Italians and critics of communism interpreted the work as signifying Soviet culture and its lack of material reward. The publicity Kabakov received prevented him from getting work as an illustrator for four years, forcing him to work under someone else’s name. The use of an alter ego would become a common tool in Kabakov’s unofficial artwork.|$|E

25|$|After {{receiving}} the Gunzo Award for his 1979 literary work Hear the Wind Sing, Murakami did not aspire {{to meet other}} writers. Aside from Sarah Lawrence's Mary Morris, whom he briefly mentions in his memoir What I Talk About When I Talk About Running alongside Joyce Carol Oates and Toni Morrison, Murakami was never {{a part of a}} community of writers, his reason being that he was a loner and was never fond of groups, schools, and literary circles. When working on a book, Murakami states that he relies on his wife, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> his first reader. While he never acquainted himself with many writers, Murakami enjoys the works of Ryu Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto.|$|E

However, there is something that intrigues him and so he catches the train that Sir Gervase wanted him to. On arrival, it is clear that no-one was expecting him, and, {{for the first time in}} memory, Sir Gervase himself, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> punctual, is missing. Poirot and guests go to his study and find him there dead, having apparently shot himself. Poirot is not convinced, however, and soon starts to prove that Sir Gervase was murdered because of various improbable factors surrounding the death, including the position at which the bullet is believed to have struck a mirror and the many different moods that Chevenix-Gore exhibited during the day.|$|E
25|$|Sir Oliver of Olivers is an English nobleman and a TNT member. He {{is an avid}} kleptomaniac: {{in every}} issue he is shown stealing. Due to his charming and witty personality, he is very {{successful}} in his field, always managing to steal anything, from range of cinema tickets, spare change, wallets, and even larger items and vehicles with success. Running gag is that, whenever he steals {{a large number of}} goods, he phones his never-seen friend Bing to sell him the goods (and asks about Bing's brother, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> in some kind of trouble). He wears a monocle, a bowler hat and stripped pants with a long coat, vest and a tie, maintaining a stoic, noble appearance, which helps him in his various schemes. He can be described as a gentleman thief.|$|E
25|$|Peggy Bundy (Katey Sagal)—Al's wife <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> on {{his case}} {{about money and}} refuses to clean or cook. She is a lazy, big-haired redhead who spends {{most of her time}} {{parked in front of the}} TV {{watching}} talk shows such as Oprah or robbing Al blind to go shopping; a famously inattentive mother and nagging wife who uses every opportunity to humiliate Al about his job, his meager earnings, and even sexual abilities. Her big taste for things like clothes and male strippers have run Al into debt on numerous occasions. A recurring joke in the series is Al's regret of having married Peggy in the first place; the union was forced on him at shotgun-point. Peggy's best friend is Marcy, with whom she occasionally conspires against Al. Her family is a stereotypical backwoods clan of degenerates whom she often forces the other Bundys to endure, especially her morbidly obese mother whom Al finds intolerable.|$|E
