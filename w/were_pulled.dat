5|$|About 20officers then marched {{him away}} from Pearl Roundabout. Alekry said that while walking him, riot police also broke his nose and damaged his left eye so badly in the process that he {{temporarily}} lost his sight.

5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1935, the golden domes of the monastery <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> down. The cathedral's silver royal gates, Mazepa's reliquary (weighing two poods of silver) and other {{valuables}} were sold abroad or simply destroyed. Master Hryhoryi's five-tier iconostasis was removed (and later destroyed) from the cathedral as well. St. Barbara's relics were transferred to the Church of the Tithes and upon that church's demolition, to the St Volodymyr's Cathedral in 1961.|$|E

5|$|In 1544 Henry VIII bequeathed {{the castle}} to Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, but the {{property}} continued to decline. By the 1570s the castle and its earthworks {{had been allowed}} to become infested with rabbits, whose warrens caused extensive damage; a survey suggested that fully renovating the castle would cost £2,000, and that even if it <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> down and sold for the value of its materials, it would only realise £66. At the end of the century, the inner bailey was finally cleared of most of its buildings; the new lodgings <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> down, along with most of the west range and the old Norman chapel, leaving only the ruined keep, alongside the latrines and the newer chapel, although what these last two were then used for is uncertain. The foundations of the old chapel were slowly covered up by the earth defences.|$|E
5|$|New Inn {{was founded}} in the late 15th century on the {{premises}} of Our Lady Inn, a hostel. Noted students included Sir Thomas More, who attended New Inn before going to Lincoln's Inn. The buildings of New Inn <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> down in 1902 {{to make way for}} a road between Holborn and the Strand. After the destruction of Strand Inn, New Inn was the only Inn of Chancery left attached to the Middle Temple.|$|E
5|$|The German {{pilots were}} {{increasingly}} lacking in quantity and quality. Galland recognised this {{but could not}} correct it without stepping outside his own authority. Galland noticed that the highly educated engineers and trainees were selected for the bomber arm in the early war years. Most of the brightest youth <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> by expert campaigners, toward the Waffen SS and Kriegsmarine. The Luftwaffe did not match this effort.|$|E
5000|$|Event 5 - Hang Tough: Melanie was {{up against}} Lightning and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> off between the silver ring and the red ring scoring herself no points while Tracey {{was up against}} Jet and despite holding between the silver ring and the red ring after being caught by Jet for 23.4 seconds, she <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> off with 20.6 seconds {{remaining}} scoring herself no points. Geoff was up against Saracen and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> off scoring himself no points while Brian was up against Wolf and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> off scoring himself no points.|$|R

Statler and Waldorf {{comment on the}} parody.|$|R
5|$|A salvage {{attempt was}} ordered by Secretary of State William Paget only {{days after the}} sinking, and Charles Brandon, the king's brother-in-law, took charge of {{practical}} details. The operation followed the standard procedure for raising ships in shallow waters: strong cables were attached to the sunken ship and fastened to two empty ships, or hulks. At low tide, the ropes <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> taut with capstans. When the high tide came in, the hulks rose and with them the wreck. It would then be towed into shallower water and the procedure repeated until the whole ship could be raised completely.|$|E
5|$|Ariadne {{served with}} the {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet {{for the majority of}} her career. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was used to patrol the Heligoland Bight. On 28 August, the British Royal Navy attacked the patrol line, and in the ensuing Battle of Heligoland Bight, a pair of battlecruisers attacked and sank Ariadne. Some 200 of her crew were killed in the battle; only 59 survivors <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> from the sea.|$|E
5|$|As Aldenham {{was making}} a turn at a {{position}} north of the islet of Škrda, to sail between islands of Planik and Olib, she hit a mine that exploded under her engine room. The ship broke in two and her bow sank quickly, followed by her stern a little later, at 15:29. Cold weather hampered rescue efforts by Atherton and accompanying motor launches ML 238 and HDML 1162, and only 58 seamen and five officers, including Farrant, <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> out of the sea. 126 crewmen died, {{as well as a}} wounded Yugoslav Partisan transported from Pag for medical treatment and Yugoslav Partisan liaison officer, Colonel Ivan Preradović. Aldenham was the last Royal Navy destroyer lost in World War II.|$|E
5000|$|Event 2 - Hang Tough:Mandy was {{up against}} Jet and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> down between the red ring and the silver with 29.3 seconds to go scoring herself no points while Kay {{was up against}} Lightning and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> down between the red ring and the silver ring scoring herself no points.

5000|$|Sprung seam - A sprung seam is a {{condition}} where the seam <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> {{away from the body}} wall. In extreme cases, the seam <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> away from the body wall {{all the way around the}} can.|$|R
5|$|Barges {{were also}} used to {{transport}} ice, particularly along the Hudson River, doubling on occasion as storage units as well. These barges could carry between 400 and 800 tons (400,000 to 800,000kg) of ice and, like ice carrying ships, windmills were typically installed to power the barge's bilge pumps. Barges were believed to help preserve ice from melting, as the ice was stored beneath the deck and insulated by the river. Charlie Morse introduced larger, seagoing ice barges in the 1890s in order to supply New York; these <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> by schooners and could each carry up to 3,000 tons (three million kg) of ice.|$|E
5|$|Caversham has no {{secondary}} schools, {{although it}} does contain two primary schools and a special needs school. Caversham Primary School, {{at the corner of}} South Road and Surrey Street, has been at its present site since 1921. The school dates back to the early 1860s, and has a current enrollment of around 80 pupils. The school's two-storey 1920s brick buildings <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> down and replaced in 1961, because of their structural unsoundness. The school's main gate– the only surviving remnant of the earlier structure– is the suburb's war memorial.|$|E
5|$|Demolition {{began in}} August 1967. The {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Nordman Construction after an unsuccessful tender process. The company brought in the Magnus II, a floating crane with a lifting capacity of 400tons, which could remove {{all but two of}} the spans. These longer spans <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> sideways off the piers, expecting that they would break into manageable pieces under their own weight. They proved stronger than this and remained intact, needing to be broken up in the river, with much sinking into the bed instead of being recovered.|$|E
50|$|Another {{noteworthy}} event {{occurred in}} November 1965, when, {{for the last}} time, the North train <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> by a steam engine. It was the last passenger train in the North Island to <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> by a steam locomotive.|$|R
25|$|Iver Johnson made {{an unusual}} model from 1940 to 1947, called the Trigger Cocking Double Action. If the hammer <b>was</b> down, <b>pulling</b> the trigger would cock the hammer. If the trigger <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> with the hammer cocked, it would then fire. This meant that {{to fire the}} {{revolver}} from a hammer down state, the trigger must <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> twice.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Hurricanes Kirsten and Ione interacted in a Fujiwara interaction, as Ione <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> north east, while Kirsten <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> to {{the north}} west. In the same year,Francesca and Gretchen interacted with each other, until they merged on July 19.|$|R
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of April 19, 2013, while in Atlanta, Georgia filming The Good Lie, Witherspoon and Toth <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> over after the car in which they were {{traveling}} was seen weaving across a double line on Peachtree Street. Toth, who was driving, was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.139 and {{was arrested and charged with}} driving under the influence and failing to maintain a lane. Witherspoon was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for disobeying the arresting officer's instructions to remain in the vehicle and arguing with him, asking if he knew who she was. Witherspoon pleaded no contest and was fined $313, including court costs.|$|E
5|$|Floating, serene aliens {{known as}} Engineers, or Huragok, <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> from Combat Evolved, but made later {{appearances}} in the Halo novels. They also appeared in Halo Wars, Halo 3: ODST, and Halo: Reach. They serve no actual combat role, although in Halo 3: ODST, Halo Wars and Halo Reach they can aid players or enemies. They are actually artificial lifeforms created by the vanished technologically superior race known as the Forerunners, and are enslaved by the Covenant to build, repair and maintain their technology.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} inaugurated {{a system of}} {{handcart}} companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different companies, made the trip over the trail to Salt Lake City. While {{not the first to}} use handcarts, they were the only group to use them extensively.|$|E
50|$|Tom Savage {{started at}} {{quarterback for the}} Texans, but <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> from {{the game in the}} 1st quarter due to a {{possible}} concussion. After Savage <b>was</b> <b>pulled,</b> Brock Osweiler, who had been benched 2 weeks prior, came in as quarterback.|$|R
5000|$|Event 4 - Hang Tough:Mandy was {{up against}} Jet and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> down14.7 seconds in scoring herself no points while Janet {{was up against}} Lightning and was cut down 20.7 seconds in scoring herself no points. Regan was up against Wolf and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> off {{eighteen}} seconds in scoring himself no points while Mark was up against Cobra and almost made it across but <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> down with 23.4 seconds to go scoring himself no points.|$|R
50|$|The {{contraction}} of these adductor/extensor muscles can indirectly depress and downwardly rotate the scapulae; {{this is only}} required when they <b>are</b> <b>pulled</b> into elevation and upward rotation by the {{contraction of}} muscles that attach to the scapulae. If the weight <b>were</b> being <b>pulled</b> solely by the lats, for example, the scapulae would simply <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> down by gravity, along for the ride.|$|R
