After Latham's father went to Mexico to make films, he went to Bonniebrook in 1896. Concerned with the welfare of her family, O'Neill sent much of her paycheck home.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May, Prince of Wales, {{along with}} the battleships Implacable, London, and Queen, was {{transferred}} to the Adriatic to form the 2nd Detached Squadron and Prince of Wales arrived at her new base on 27 May.

Returning to Britain {{towards the end of}} the wars, she was laid up in ordinary, and in 1813 became a temporary prison ship. She was finally broken up in 1818.|$|E

5|$|Whelp {{was sold}} to the South African Navy (SAN) in 1952 and renamed Simon van der Stel. She was {{subsequently}} converted into a fast anti-submarine frigate in the early 1960s {{and served as a}} training ship from 1968 until 1972 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> back into reserve. Simon van der Stel was recommissioned in 1975 for a refit, but that proved to be uneconomical and she was scrapped the following year.|$|E
5|$|During their active service, {{the boats}} of the U-20 class {{suffered}} from unreliable engines which compounded the already poor handling {{characteristics of the}} boats. None of the class had any successes and two of their number were sunk during the war. U-23 was the first sunk <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> down on 21 February 1918 from an explosive paravane in the Straits of Otranto. U-20, the lead boat of the class, sank in July 1918 when she was torpedoed by the Italian submarine F-12 in the Tagliamento estuary. The remaining two boats were surrendered at war's end, with U-21 being ceded to Italy in 1920, and U-22 to France; both were broken up.|$|E
5|$|In early August, Lerch and U-12 set {{out from}} Pola for Venice to look for enemy ships to sink. On 6 August, the Italian {{destroyer}} Rosolino Pilo rammed U-12, probably by chance, at about 05:00 in the Lido inlet of the Venetian Lagoon. Two days later, when Italian workers were dredging to try to determine the object Rosolino Pilo had hit, they heard a heavy explosion. When divers {{went down in the}} area, they discovered the wreck of U-12 with her stern blown off. U-12s entire complement of 17 men was lost <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> down. U-12 was the first Austro-Hungarian submarine sunk during the war.|$|E

5|$|Irene Garza (1934 – April 1960) was a South Texas {{teacher and}} beauty queen whose death {{has been the}} subject of {{investigation}} for several decades. Garza was last seen alive on April 16, 1960, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> to confession at a church in McAllen, Texas. She was reported missing the following morning. Following the largest volunteer search to that date in the Rio Grande Valley, Garza's body was discovered in a canal on April 21. An autopsy concluded that she had been sexually assaulted before being killed; the cause of death was suffocation.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E

In , she was {{diagnosed}} with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer where plasma cells secrete abnormal antibodies known as Bence-Jones proteins, which can cause bones to disintegrate and dump toxic amounts of calcium into the bloodstream. She did not publicly disclose the illness until , <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> to Washington to successfully press in Congressional hearings for passage of the Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act.

5|$|Virginia then {{proceeded}} to Norfolk, where she coaled before continuing on to Tompkinsville, Staten Island. She then steamed to the New York Navy Yard {{and went into the}} drydock to have the bottom of her hull painted. The ship returned to the Norfolk Navy Yard for periodic maintenance from 3 November 1906 to 18 February 1907. A fire control device was installed between 19 February and 23 March.

Weeks later, Candice was beginning to receive more air-time and higher profile matches, and she won tag matches that pitted her with Mickie James against Victoria and Melina.
