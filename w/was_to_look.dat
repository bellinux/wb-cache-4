5|$|Brooks {{was born}} on 23 February 1876 at Draycott Moor near Faringdon, {{the son of a}} farm labourer. He grew up near Windsor, Berkshire, where his father {{afterwards}} worked in the Great Park, and as a child frequently encountered members of the Royal Family. After leaving school in 1890, he worked as a boy on the estates, where one of his duties <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after a mule given to Queen Victoria by Lord Kitchener. In 1892 he enlisted in the 3rd Dragoon Guards, and after leaving the army joined the Glamorganshire Yeomanry as a volunteer.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of Nemausus (Nîmes) was somewhat inconvenient {{when it came}} to providing a water supply. Plains lie to the city's south and east, where any sources of water would be at too low an altitude to be able to flow to the city, while the hills to the west made a water supply route too difficult from an engineering point of view. The only real alternative <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> to the north and in particular to the area around Ucetia (Uzès), where there are natural springs.|$|E
5|$|Their {{training}} schedule {{consisted of}} individual training {{two or three}} times a week and two days a week of coordinated tandem training during the Olympic year. Marchant's main tactical responsibility <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> to the outside for impending attacks while Browne patrolled the inside. Marchant devised a signal system, such as a head bump on Browne's hip, or even a verbal shout when the opposition made a move.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin and {{his group}} arrived at Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of the king; perhaps it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out for the king's {{interests}} while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead {{to look after the}} king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death {{on the way to the}} Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|In India, {{unaware of}} the delayed {{shipment}} and confident {{of being able to}} rally the Indian sepoy, the plot for the mutiny took its final shape. Under the plans, the 23rd Cavalry in Punjab was to seize weapons and kill their officers while on roll call on 21 February. This was to be followed by mutiny in the 26th Punjab, which was to be the signal for the uprising to begin, resulting in an advance on Delhi and Lahore. The Bengal cell <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for the Punjab Mail entering the Howrah Station the next day (which would have been cancelled if Punjab was seized) and was to strike immediately.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E

5|$|In January 2011, Gannon was one {{of three}} {{candidates}} reported to have impressed in interviews for the vacant Port Vale job, making him one of the favourites for the position. However, Paul Simpson's dismissal at Stockport County led to hopes of a return to the club for some County fans. Therefore, he was installed as the bookies favourite to become the next Port Vale manager, and also the bookie's favourite for the Stockport job. Gannon was confirmed as the manager of Port Vale on 6 January 2011, succeeding Micky Adams {{at the helm of the}} promotion chasing club, signing a contract that lasted until summer 2012. Saying that finishing outside of the top seven would be a failure, the Cheshire-based manager's first task after 'burying the hatchet' with Gareth Owen <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for a new striker. Two weeks into his reign club captain Tommy Fraser left the club by mutual consent, as signs of what would be an unhappy relationship between club and manager quickly came to the surface. Gannon then brought in Romaine Sawyers and Kayleden Brown on loan from West Bromwich Albion, Jay O'Shea on loan from Birmingham City, Exodus Geohaghon on loan from Peterborough United, and striker Tom Pope on loan from Rotherham United.|$|E
25|$|In {{the end of}} the 1920s, the {{international}} recession spread over Europe, and things came to a head when Ivar Kreuger died in Paris in March 1932.

25|$|Recording and {{preserving}} history {{had been an}} important part of the mission of BYU even before an official archive was established. Documentation of the university began in 1875 and has grown since then. Early efforts to collect included a Brigham Young Academy expedition to South America in 1900–1901. The purpose of the expedition <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for evidences to support The Book of Mormon; collectors gathered field notes, photos, botany samples, and correspondences.|$|E

The latter <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like a soundstage backdrop, with a movie theater-style entrance {{in the middle and}} would have sat between the Land and Journey Into Imagination pavilions. When newly appointed CEO Michael Eisner saw the plans for the pavilion, he requested that, instead of placing the ride in an already existing park, it should be the anchor for a new park themed with Hollywood, entertainment, and show business.|$|E
25|$|Bloomberg's successor, Bill de Blasio, {{concurrently}} {{proposed a}} tax on wealthy residents to fund the subway, though a similar tax for universal prekindergarten had previously failed in the state legislature. He also clarified that he opposed Cuomo's plan because his Pre-K tax {{would be more effective}} in raising money. De Blasio's opposition came as some of his supporters in the 2017 mayoral election announced support for the plan, including the Working Families Party and Union Local 32BJ. Later in August 2017, it was clarified that de Blasio did not oppose congestion pricing specifically, and that his office <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at any congestion pricing proposal by Cuomo's administration.|$|E

Already set on helping the poor whenever possible, she included the other farm children on the Cameron estate as well. This brought her into contact with Fr Woods, who had been the parish priest in the south east since his ordination to the priesthood in 1857 after completing his studies at Sevenhill.|$|E

25|$|The current tomb keeper is Lim Geok Qi, who {{has been}} working in the Cemetery and for the Japanese Association for over 50 years. He was born in 1938, and lived most of his life in the Cemetery. His father found {{difficulty}} to find work when he first arrived in Singapore from China but was soon recommended to a job as a tomb keeper at the Japanese Cemetery. Lim grew up in the cemetery assisting his father in the cremating bodies and arranging burials at the cemetery. When the young Lim came of age, he tried to seek other forms of employment but in 1960, his father fell sick, and requested him to take over his duties as tomb keeper. And so the young man in his 20s took over his father's duties to become the second generation tomb keeper. Like his father, Lim was paid a minimal salary for the job, but given free accommodation and transportation. As he was thrifty in nature, he was able to start his own family, and expanded his living quarters when his family size grew. In 1973, new burials was not allowed, so Lim's main duties <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after and maintain the Japanese cemetery, as well as serving as a cemetery guide for visitors from Japan.|$|E
