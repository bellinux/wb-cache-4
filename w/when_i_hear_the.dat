2500|$|Moreno's lyrics were {{described}} by Time as [...] "suggesting emotions rather than announcing them". Moreno himself described his lyrics as ambiguous and sometimes impersonal, saying: [...] "I {{like to be}} ambiguous when writing to a certain extent, and throwing something so brash [...] against that and playing with it. And also making it sound dimensional. Giving the feeling off that it is raw and it is emotional, but it's not just connected with our personal story. It's not merely about our career and our lives, it's bigger than that. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> music, I get inspired to paint the lyrical pictures you describe, but I'm not always talking about myself". The band's legacy {{has been compared to}} alternative rock group Radiohead, with some dubbing Deftones [...] "The Radiohead of metal".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Christian Post on April 21, 2013, Osteen expressed his sentiments on being perceived as {{being part of the}} prosperity gospel. [...] "I get grouped into the prosperity gospel and I never think it's fair, but it's just what it is. I think prosperity, and I've said it 1,000 times, it's being healthy, it's having great children, it's having peace of mind. Money is part of it; and yes, I believe God wants us to excel ... to be blessed so we can be a bigger blessing to others. I feel very rewarded. I wrote a book and sold millions of copies; and Victoria and I were able to help more people than we ever dreamed of. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> term prosperity gospel, I think people are sometimes saying, 'Well, he's just asking for money'." ...|$|E

That's one of the {{advantages}} of our profession. You can go about. It was a second-rate sort of place, and one evening, just before lighting-up time, I had the salle-a-manger all to myself, and had just taken up a paper <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hears</b> <b>the</b> door open, and I turns round.|$|R

5000|$|There {{were further}} {{indications}} {{of changes in}} taste in France: Saint-Saëns, organist at the Madeleine from 1857 to 1877, refused to perform operatic arias {{as part of the}} liturgy, on one occasion replying to such a request, [...] "Monsieur l'Abbé, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> from <b>the</b> pulpit the language of the Opéra Comique, I will play light music. Not before!" [...] Saint-Saëns was nevertheless reluctant to use Bach's music in services. He regarded the preludes, fugues, toccatas and variations as virtuosic pieces for concert performance; and the chorale preludes as too Protestant in spirit for inclusion in a Catholic mass. The St Anne prelude and fugue was often used by Saint-Saëns for inaugurating Cavaillé-Coll organs; in Paris; he played for the inaugurations at St Sulpice (1862), Notre Dame (1868), Trinité (1869), the chapel in Versailles (1873) and the Trocadéro (1878).|$|R

This version of the I Ching was the first complete English translation and had been published by Wolff's father, Kurt Wolff of Pantheon Books in 1950. The I Ching is commonly used for divination, but for Cage it became a tool to compose using chance. To compose a piece of music, Cage would come up with questions to ask the I Ching; the book would then be used {{in much the same way}} as it is used for divination.

The song begun with Butch Vig creating both the acoustic riff that opens the track and title. Some time after he showed it to his bandmates, Manson wrote lyrics, inspired by a viewing of the movie Thirteen, which she considered [...] "so much like how my 13-year-old life was - apart from the unstable home life, which I didn't have." [...] Butch Vig: [...] "Musically it's very simple, it's basically this little hypnotic riff on the acoustic guitar and it builds a little bit, but the song never gets too big musically. It stays pretty simple. Really it's all about her vocals. She said 'I want to sound like a girls choir' and we're like 'Cool, let's just do it now'. She went in singing 'You should see my scars' and it just floored me. Still <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> that <b>the</b> hairs on the back of my neck go up.
