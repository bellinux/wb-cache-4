5|$|Although {{the wood}} {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> heated tanks in a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing {{the water in the}} wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E
