5000|$|In his autobiography, The Golden Rule In Business, Nash wrote; [...] "For four or {{five years}} I wandered about the Middle West, doing odd jobs here and there... I never cared two straws which <b>way</b> a <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> was headed... or what it was I did to keep body and soul together." [...] He lugged bricks, did {{plastering}} work, labored in a broom factory, and with a bridge-construction gang—all the while studying Thomas Paine and Robert Ingersoll, endeavoring to bolster his contempt for religion. Eventually Nash found his way back to Detroit, where, with the help of some locals, he opened a laundry, and then married Y.W.C.A. boarding school superintendent, Maude Lena Southwell, calling her his [...] "life partner." [...] Described by Nash as being [...] "possessed by a strong, robust faith," [...] under Maude's influence, Nash came to view his arguments as being not against Christianity itself, but against its misinterpretation. He reentered the ministry with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and in 1900, accepted the pastorate of a small church in Bluffton, Ohio. But Nash's rekindled career in religious work ended with [...] "bewildering suddenness," [...] when, in a funeral sermon, he extolled the many virtues of a kindhearted but professedly unreligious man, recently departed. The Disciples of Christ called for Nash's resignation forthwith.|$|R

40|$|In many countries, <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> have {{to share}} a rail network with {{passenger}} trains. In this paper, we consider a situation where passenger trains must adhere to a strict published schedule, whereas <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> movements can be inserted at any convenient time, without disrupting scheduled passenger trains. We propose an algorithm for the problem of routing and scheduling of a single <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> in a passenger rail network. However, the multiple <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> routing and scheduling problem is shown to be NP-complete, even for simplified instances. Specifically, we show that both routing and scheduling of <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> are difficult, even when only two <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> are considered. It is also difficult when <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> movements are restricted to reach their destinations with no idling permitted at intermediate stations. We have developed a Stepwise Dispatching Heuristic for routing and scheduling multiple <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> in a passenger rail network. Computational results confirm the efficacy of our algorithm for single <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> routing and of the proposed Stepwise Dispatching Heuristic. <b>Freight</b> <b>train</b> scheduling, passenger rail network, computational complexity, stepwise dispatching heuristic...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{applications}} for train paths has increased during the last years, often leading to conflicts between <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> and passenger trains. The objective {{of this research is}} therefore to develop options for improving the capacity allocation process with regard to <b>freight</b> <b>trains.</b> For two <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> corridors case studies are done: Kijfhoek – Venlo and Amersfoort – Bad Bentheim. For both corridors different timetable constructions are designed in DONNA with four different <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> paths. Conclusion of the research is that the timetable can be improved by scheduling faster <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> paths than the current ones. This is especially useful on corridors with limited infrastructure. Most <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> can operate faster than the current <b>freight</b> <b>train</b> paths.

The cost elasticity with respect to output is found to be higher for passenger <b>trains</b> than for <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> in the case of mixed lines. The cost elasticity for <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> on dedicated lines is higher than for <b>freight</b> <b>trains</b> on mixed lines.
