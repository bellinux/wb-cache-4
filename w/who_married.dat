3000|$|... 19 I {{refer the}} {{sub-sample}} of migrants <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> after coming to Germany but before entry into SOEP, {{as it is}} more similar to the sub-sample of migrants <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> after entering SOEP than that of migrants <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> before coming to Germany.|$|R
30|$|Figure  1 {{shows that}} {{migrants}} <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a German have lower intensions to return {{both before and}} after marriage than their counterparts <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a non-German spouse. Among women <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a German spouse, we actually observe a drop in intentions to return a few years before marriage. For women <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a non-German spouse, intentions to return slightly increase for a few years subsequent to marriage. We see a similar increase in intentions to return in the years around marriage for male migrants <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a non-German, and their intentions to return remain high (about 87 % intend to return). In comparison, far fewer men <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a German spouse intend to return throughout the 15 -year period (roughly 77 %).|$|R
30|$|While {{intentions}} to return are generally higher among married migrants than singles, migrants <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a native spouse {{not only are}} less likely to intend to return than those <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a non-native, but also less likely than singles. Male migrants <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a native before migration have (0.098 – 0.143)[*]=[*]− 0.045 or 5 percentage points lower expected {{intentions to}} return than singles (or 6 %). The difference is, however, not significant at the 10 % level. Males <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> after migration have (0.103 – 0.183)[*]=[*]− 0.08 or about 8 percentage points lower intentions to return (or 13 %). This difference is significant at the 10 % level. For female migrants, the difference in intentions to return is 15 and 18 percentage points, respectively. The results suggest that migrants <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a native have lower intentions to return than those <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a non-native and singles. Moreover, the effect of intermarriage is stronger for female than for male migrants.|$|R

30|$|Ceteris paribus, married {{migrants}} {{have higher}} intensions to return {{than those who}} are single (Columns 1 and 4). There is an expected difference of about 10 -percentage points between married and single migrants for males and females. All estimates are economically and statistically significant. But among married migrants, intermarried migrants are associated with lower intentions to return. Male migrants <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a German rather than a non-German spouse before migration have an expected 14 percentage point lower intention to return, all else equal (or 20 % lower intentions) 17. Similarly, {{the difference between the two}} groups is 18 -percentage points for males <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> after migration (or 29 %). This means that among male migrants <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a native, intentions to return are roughly a fourth lower than among their counterparts <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a non-native. Among female migrants, the effect of intermarriage is stronger with 26 -percentage points. That is, among women <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a German spouse, intentions to return are an expected 38 % or, roughly speaking, a third lower than for women <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a non-German. All differences are statistically significant.|$|R

30|$|For {{both male}} and female migrants, the effect of {{intermarriage}} is similar for the three outcomes. Among men <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a German, a fifth realise a return, and roughly a quarter less intend to return or remit than among their counterparts <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a non-German. For female migrants, about a third fewer intend to return, and only half as many report sending remittances among women <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a native, while about a third fewer <b>who</b> <b>marry</b> a native return to the home country. This suggests that an intended return and remittance behaviour are good predictors of an actual return to the home country. Moreover, I find that the effect of intermarriage is stronger for women on all three indicators of home country preference.|$|R
