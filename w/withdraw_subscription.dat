50|$|However soon due {{to higher}} postal rates {{as well as}} distant readership, the {{newspaper}} ran into financial difficulties. The publication expected some funding from the government, which didn't come through, and eventually closed on December 4, 1827. A year later in 1828, government <b>withdrew</b> government <b>subscription</b> for newspapers, started during the liberal period of Governor-General Lord William Bentinck, which led to several small newspapers closing.|$|R
5000|$|As of 12 January 2011, the Northern and Shell group (often {{referred}} to as the Express Group) of publications <b>withdrew</b> its <b>subscription</b> to the PCC. According to the PCC, [...] "a refusal to support the self-regulatory system financially means that a newspaper publisher effectively withdraws from the PCC's formal jurisdiction, which the PCC considers regrettable". Consequently, the Daily & Sunday Express, Scottish Daily & Sunday Express, Daily & Sunday Star, OK!, New magazine and Star magazine are no longer bound by the PCC's code of practice, and the public no longer has recourse to making complaints through the PCC.|$|R
5|$|By April 1896 the Welsh Football Union had sanctioned a {{subscription}} of 1,000 shillings to be {{contributed to the}} Gould testimonial. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) complained and the IRFB reacted by informing the WFU that only a plate up {{to the value of}} a hundred pounds sterling could be given to Gould, and that the remaining funds should be donated to charity; otherwise Wales would lose their international fixtures. The WFU stood down and <b>withdrew</b> their <b>subscription.</b> The reaction in Wales was one of anger, with the people feeling that the WFU had bowed to English pressure, and had been bullied into a decision against the people's wishes.|$|R
5000|$|The initial {{reaction}} to Howe running the Novascotian was poor. Many of its readers <b>withdrew</b> their <b>subscriptions,</b> believing that Howe was too young, unskilled and inexperienced {{to run a}} newspaper. [...] Howe indeed was only 23 {{years old when he}} purchased the Novascotian and had had no regular education as it had not been possible for him to walk to school in the winter. [...] However, Howe had been working {{in the office of the}} Royal Gazette since he was 13 years old, and during the months he could not go to school he had books to study, and his father, who for many years worked in the offices of the Kings Printer and Postmaster-General of the Lower Provinces, to talk to.|$|R

I believe poor papa said {{something}} about letting Robert have an evening school for the boys and young men at the distillery, but when he claimed it, Mervyn said he knew nothing about it, and wouldn't hear of it, and got affronted, so he <b>withdrew</b> all the <b>subscriptions</b> from the charities and everything else, and the boys have been mobbing the clergy, and Juliana says it is all Robert's fault.' ...|$|R
50|$|Soon after Benjamin Loder {{was chosen}} {{president}} of Erie in 1845, ne invited twenty-two {{of the richest}} men in New York City to meet him in conference at the New York Hotel. They met, and he at once declared to them that among them they must subscribe sufficient money to start up {{the work on the}} railroad and keep it going, a sum which he placed at S3,ooo,ooo. To set an example to the others, he himself subscribed ยง250,000, his entire fortune. Stephen Whitney, the millionaire cotton-merchant, was one of the men present at the meeting. He pulled at Mr. Loder's coat-tail to attract his attention, and admonished him not to risk his all in the enterprise. It will ruin you, the cautious cotton-merchant whispered in his ear. But President Loder shook his head, and refused to <b>withdraw</b> the <b>subscription.</b> Aroused by his confidence in the enterprise, the twenty-two men there and then subscribed the required amount.|$|R
50|$|With the {{development}} of Swansea harbour from the 1760s, consideration was given {{as to how the}} rich mineral resources of the Tawe valley could be moved to the coast. In 1790, William Padley surveyed the valley for a possible canal route, and in 1791, the passing of an Act of Parliament to authorise the nearby Neath Canal resulted in calls for a public meeting. A meeting held on 5 April 1793 appointed the canal engineer Thomas Sheasby to conduct a survey. The plans were opposed by the Duke of Beaufort and other traders, who wanted the canal to terminate further up the river near Landore and Morriston, where they already had wharfs. Swansea Corporation favoured the route into Swansea, and offered to contribute towards its cost, whereupon the Duke, his son the Marquess of Worcester and the Duke's agent <b>withdrew</b> their <b>subscriptions.</b> This action stirred others to subscribe, and ยฃ52,000 was raised almost immediately.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the outset}} the Review {{did not have}} an editor. The first three numbers were {{effectively}} edited by Sydney Smith. On his leaving for England the work devolved chiefly on Jeffrey, who, by an arrangement with Archibald Constable, the publisher, was eventually appointed editor at a fixed salary. Most of those involved were Whigs; but, although the general bias of the Review was towards social and political reforms, it was at first so little of a party organ that it numbered Sir Walter Scott among its contributors; and no distinct emphasis was given to its political leanings until the publication in 1808 of an article by Jeffrey himself on the work of Don Pedro Cevallos on the French Usurpation of Spain. This article expressed despair {{of the success of the}} British arms in Spain, and Scott at once <b>withdrew</b> his <b>subscription,</b> the Quarterly being soon afterwards started in opposition. According to Lord Cockburn the effect of the first number of the Edinburgh Review was [...] "electrical." [...] The English reviews were at that time practically publishers' organs, with articles by hack writers instructed to obey the publishers' interests. The Edinburgh Review, on the other hand, enlisted a brilliant and independent staff of contributors, guided by the editor, not the publisher. They received sixteen guineas a sheet (sixteen printed pages), increased subsequently to twenty-five guineas in many cases, instead of the two guineas earned by London reviewers. The review was not limited to literary criticism but became the accredited organ of moderate Whig public opinion. The particular work which provided the starting-point of an article was in many cases merely the occasion for the exposition, always brilliant and incisive, of the author's views on politics, social subjects, ethics or literature. These general principles and the novelty of the method ensured the success of the undertaking even after the original circle of exceptionally able men who founded it had been dispersed. It had a circulation of 12,000. Jeffrey's editorship lasted about twenty-six years, ceasing with the ninety-eighth number, published in June 1829, when he resigned in favour of Macvey Napier.|$|R
6000|$|Whereas, {{notwithstanding}} I am {{in great}} pain, To hear {{we are making}} a peace without Spain; But, most noble senators, 'tis a great shame, There should be a peace, while I'm Not-in-game. The duke show'd me all his fine house; and the duchess From her closet brought out a full purse in her clutches: I talk'd of a peace, and they both gave a start, His grace swore by G--d, and her grace let a f--t: My long old-fashion'd pocket was presently cramm'd; And sooner than vote for a peace I'll be damn'd. [...] But some will cry turn-coat, and rip up old stories, How I always pretended {{to be for the}} Tories: I answer; the Tories were in my good graces, Till all my relations were put into places. But still I'm in principle ever the same, And will quit my best friends, while I'm Not-in-game. [...] When I and some others subscribed our names To a plot for expelling my master King James, I <b>withdrew</b> my <b>subscription</b> by help of a blot, And so might discover or gain by the plot: I had my advantage, and stood at defiance, For Daniel[2] was got from the den of the lions: I came in without danger, and was I to blame? For, rather than hang, I would be Not-in-game. [...] I swore to the queen, that the Prince of Hanover During her sacred life would never come over: I made use of a trope; that [...] "an heir to invite, Was like keeping her monument always in sight." [...] But, when I thought proper, I alter'd my note; And in her own hearing I boldly did vote, That her Majesty stood in great need of a tutor, And must have an old or a young coadjutor: For why; I would fain have put all in a flame, Because, for some reasons, I was Not-in-game. [...] Now my new benefactors have brought me about, And I'll vote against peace, with Spain or without: Though the court gives my nephews, and brothers, and cousins, And all my whole family, places by dozens; Yet, since I know where a full purse may be found, And hardly pay eighteen-pence tax in the pound: Since the Tories have thus disappointed my hopes, And will neither regard my figures nor tropes, I'll speech against peace while Dismal's my name, And be a true Whig, while I'm Not-in-game.|$|R
