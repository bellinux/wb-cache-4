5|$|Because Jacob {{mentioned}} {{hearing a}} plane in the woods, Carl asks the brothers to assist an FBI agent, Neil Baxter, {{in a search for}} the missing aircraft. Hank and Jacob meet with Baxter and Carl at the police station. Sarah grows skeptical of Baxter, whom she later discovers to be an impostor; she contacts and warns Hank, who steals a handgun from Carl's office. The four men head into the woods and split up. When he finds the plane, Baxter kills Carl, and engages in a gunfight with Hank. Hank manages to kill Baxter with the gun he had stolen. Hank starts to concoct another story to tell the authorities. Jacob however announces that he does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> these bad memories; he threatens to shoot himself to end it.

25|$|There is {{also the}} overall loss of privacy and peace when Agnes and Tobias are invaded by Claire, Julia, Harry, and Edna, who all <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> them. The {{crowding}} of the house, the battles for space and understanding, the irritations and frustrations of trying to compromise, all eventually lead to the ultimate loss of balance. Where patience and social sensibility once were the rule, chaos and emotionalism reign. And the play ends with Agnes once again contemplating {{the loss of her}} sanity.|$|E
25|$|In Season 2, Lucas and Keith {{return to}} Tree Hill after Dan {{has a heart}} attack. Lucas tries {{to make up for}} his {{behavior}} with Peyton and Brooke and becomes friends with both of them. He also starts seeing a new girl named Anna Taggaro, but they break up amicably when Anna accepts that she is a lesbian. Lucas realizes that he has romantic feelings for Brooke and begins to focus on building on a relationship with her, even though she is seeing Anna's brother Felix. Lucas discovers that he has inherited Dan's heart condition, but does not tell anyone except Dan. After discovering that Keith's new girlfriend Jules was actually hired by Dan to break Keith's heart, Lucas agrees to move in with Dan if he leaves Keith alone and pays for Lucas's heart medication. This sets Lucas at odds with his mother, as she cannot believe that Lucas would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> Dan rather than her. It also causes a new rift between Lucas and Nathan, as Nathan feels that Lucas is replacing him and is bitter about Haley's departure to go on tour singing. Lucas and Karen are reconciled when she learns half of the reason he is staying with Dan, which is to protect Keith. This plan to protect his uncle fails when Jules leaves Keith at the altar and Keith leaves town after discovering that Lucas and Karen knew that she was hired by Dan. Lucas discovers Deb's painkiller addiction and decides to avenge all of Dan's victims. He finds a stash of cash and an incriminating ledger in the attic at Dan's dealership and plans to expose Dan's illegal dealings, but ultimately fails as Dan has also incriminated Deb. Dan then reveals that the whole thing was a set-up to test Lucas's loyalty, which Lucas failed. As a result, he loses Dan's college fund for him (which Dan had been saving since Lucas was a baby) and even his heart medication. Nathan also ends his friendship with Lucas after discovering that Lucas had planned to bring Dan down and visited Haley behind his back in an attempt to patch up her and Nathan's marriage. Lucas does, however, kiss Brooke in the season finale and confesses that he wants to be with her, but she still leaves for California to spend the summer with her parents. Ultimately, it is just Lucas and a broken-hearted Peyton (after boyfriend Jake left her) for the summer and the last shot is {{of the two of them}} sharing a meaningful hug on the beach.|$|E

500|$|Brooks tolerated Barney's casual affairs {{well enough}} to tease her about them, and had {{a few of her}} own over the years, but could become jealous when a new love became serious. [...] Usually she simply left town, but at one point she gave Barney an {{ultimatum}} to choose between her and Dolly Wilde—relenting once Barney had given in. At the same time, while Brooks was devoted to Barney, she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> her as a full-time couple; she disliked Paris, disdained Barney's friends, hated the constant socializing on which Barney thrived, and felt that she was fully herself only when alone.

500|$|The talisman connects these precepts to {{the theory}} of vitalism; it {{physically}} represents the life force of its owner, and is reduced with each exercise of the will. The shopkeeper tries to warn Valentin that the wisest path lies not in exercising his will or securing power, but in developing the mind. [...] "What is folly", he asks Valentin, [...] "if not an excess of will and power?" [...] Overcome with the possibilities offered by the skin, however, the young man throws caution to the wind and embraces his desire. Upon grabbing the talisman, he declares: [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> excess." [...] Only when his life force is nearly depleted does he recognize his mistake: [...] "It suddenly struck him that the possession of power, no matter how enormous, did not bring with it the knowledge of how to use it... had had everything in his power, and he had done nothing." ...|$|E

500|$|When Charles {{became ill}} in the 1390s, Isabeau was 22; {{she had three}} {{children}} and had already lost two infants. During the worst of his illness Charles was unable to recognize her, and caused her great distress by demanding her removal when she entered his chamber. The Monk of St Denis wrote in his chronicle, [...] "What distressed her above all was to see how on all occasions... the king repulsed her, whispering to his people, 'Who is this woman obstructing my view? Find out what she wants and stop her from annoying and bothering me. As his illness worsened {{at the turn of}} the century, she was accused of abandoning him, particularly when she moved her residence to the Hôtel Barbette. Historian Rachel Gibbons speculates that Isabeau wanted to distance herself from her husband and his illness, writing, [...] "it would be unjust to blame her if she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> a madman." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aligning {{himself with}} the Nation of Islam, its leader Elijah Muhammad, and a {{narrative}} that labeled the white race as the perpetrator of genocide against African Americans made Ali a target of public condemnation. The Nation of Islam was widely viewed by whites and some African Americans as a black separatist [...] "hate religion" [...] with a propensity toward violence; Ali had few qualms about using his influential voice to speak Nation of Islam doctrine. In a press conference articulating {{his opposition to the}} Vietnam War, Ali stated, [...] "My enemy is the white people, not Viet Cong or Chinese or Japanese." [...] In relation to integration, he said: [...] "We who follow the teachings of Elijah Muhammad don't want to be forced to integrate. Integration is wrong.

2500|$|On April 20, Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley met Truman at the White House {{and each}} showed him their {{positions}} in the flag-raising picture.

Ernest Thomas raised that flag. In 1985, he did another interview about the flag-raising (second raising) at the urging of his wife, who had told him to do it for the sake of their grandchildren. During that interview, Bradley [...] said incorrectly that he would not have raised the flag if he had known how famous the photo (Rosenthal photograph) would become. He stated that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> the pressures of the media and desired to live a normal life.

2500|$|Pouncequick, after healing {{from the}} loss of his tail, decides to return to Firsthome, the seat of the court, and stay there. Roofshadow wants to {{accompany}} him, and thus, Tailchaser is left on his quest. Firefoot appears to him in a dream, confirms that Hearteater's power is broken, and encourages Tailchaser to continue his quest for Hushpad. He goes east to Bigwater (Qu'cef) and sneaks into a boat, which seems to him like a large nut-husk. A man approaches and rows across, taking him to an island called Villa-on-Mar. There he finds none other than Hushpad, herself. Hushpad wishes to stay, though, so Tailchaser, too, stays for a time. [...] Gradually, Tailchaser realizes that he is still a feral cat, and does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> man. He begins to see that being domestic has made Hushpad fat and lazy. Realizing that he does not belong, Tailchaser sets out to return home, to see his Meeting Wall friends, to hunt, to see Pouncequick and Roofshadow once more. The ending may be seen only as the beginning of a longer saga, but, to-date, Tad Williams has yet to revisit his feline homage to Tolkien with additional writings.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2010, it was {{reported}} that Lisa would return for a single episode later in the year in a bid to retrieve Louise from Phil, who gained custody of her earlier in the year. Benjamin said of her return: [...] "I'm really looking forward to returning to EastEnders for this episode. It will be great to see some familiar faces and work alongside old friends again." [...] Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood commented [...] "Lucy's character Lisa was responsible for one of the biggest cliffhanger episodes in EastEnders, so it's a real treat to have her back on screen," [...] while a spokesperson for the show added [...] "Lisa Fowler was a major part of Phil's life– she knows him as well as anyone, so she won't be happy about him looking after his daughter. With their history, you know that this storyline {{is going to be an}} explosive episode in the Mitchells' history." [...] The episode was broadcast on 5 August 2010. Discussing her brief return, Benjamin said, [...] "What I liked about doing this storyline was that it did explain where Lisa had been. When I was watching it, I was thinking 'Where's her mother? Where is Lisa? It's just ridiculous'. But it does make sense. She is mentally unstable and she does have times like that and the little girl is old enough to make her own decisions and say, 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> my dad now'. So she had to let her go. I liked that I was able to come back and defend myself because Lisa was kind of being slaughtered in the Square for being a rubbish mum!" ...|$|E
