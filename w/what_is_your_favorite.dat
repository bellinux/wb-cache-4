40|$|The {{problem of}} loss of meaning in {{schooling}} and teaching-learning of mathematics is explored in a study with adolescent students at two grade eight classes in Sweden with five frames of reference: deploying CHAT theoretical perspectives, incorporating student agency and identity, conduct of an action strategy, the design of meaningful mathematical tasks and the situatedness of these in local contexts of classroom and school. Exemplary of second-order action research, the conduct of five mathematical tasks enables reformulating the situated social practice in the classrooms, evidencing overt display of student identity in the fifth and final task. The addressing of problems posed by students in this open-ended task e. g. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>favorite</b> sport? Have you tested smoking? allows students to combine mathematical knowing {{and a sense of}} achievement, along with their selves as perceived in their local contexts. The inclusion of problems/mathematical tasks related to students' self is thus sought for in the curriculum of mathematics for adolescent students.  Teaching and problem-solving in whole and small-group at grades eight and nin...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of a series of {{laboratory}} experiments that focus on a two-person, sequential trust game. Two persons at different locations are paired for a single play of the game. Participants also complete two risk-assessment instruments: a survey and a decision task. The treatments involve the manipulation of the information available to the subjects about their counterparts. In one treatment, subjects are told the sex of their counterpart along with answers to several preference questions (<b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>favorite</b> color?, etc.) In the other, each subject sees a photograph of his/her counterpart. Our two-site design means that we can control the information subjects have about their counterparts without compromising anonymity or deceiving the participants. We conjecture that people are strategic actors whose trusting behavior is conditional on the decision context, including the characteristics of a partner, and we are able to test the effect of observable characteristics on trust and reciprocity. In a second component of the experiment, the photographs are rated by a separate set of subjects using survey items that ask subjects to choose between descriptive word pairs. These items scale into three factors that measure trustworthiness/reliability; friendliness/cooperativeness, and mood. Trusting behavior is significantly related to risk attitudes, friendliness/cooperativeness, race and sex. Reciprocity is related to the trustworthiness of the recipient...|$|E
40|$|Modern machine {{learning}} attempts to erase all distinctions between {{various kinds of}} induction from data, as if all learning from cases can be expressed as the selection of features followed by the determination of an appropriate set of separating hyperplanes in that feature space, {{on which to build}} a statistically effective classifier. In this recent research programme that has been dominating AI (artificial intelligence), the intellectual question is no more than what is the preferred mathematical transformation of feature space that permits convenient re-representation of data, e. g., <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>favorite</b> kind of nonlinear support vector kernel? Few things could be more historically or intellectually insulting to the student of theory-formation in the grand tradition of Nagel, Carnap, Hempel and Popper (see [10]). There are different purposes for different kinds of induction and in a few cases, notably, the cases of scientific induction and legal induction, the modeling of the nuances has led to great ideas in the history of logic and reasoning. Many philosophers will not know the work of Hart, Raz, MacCormick, and Schauer on legal theory-formation (the “positivists ” in law, see [14]), but the domain-specific complexities are arguably even more interesting there. AI at one time had more interest in these nuances, for example, in the works of Simon [15], Lena...|$|E

40|$|Medical School is {{conducting}} {{an evaluation of}} CFFC. Domains measured include child symptoms and functional impairment, parental stress, child strengths, time spent in out-of-home placements (e. g. inpatient hospitalization), and school disciplinary information, e. g. attendance, suspensions. As part of the evaluation, caregivers completed semi-structured telephone interviews three and nine months after enrollment into CFFC, during which standardized measures of fidelity, involvement in services, and parent empowerment were administered. In addition, CMHSR evaluators asked caregivers three open-ended questions to assess satisfaction with the CFFC program. Questions included: 1. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>favorite</b> thing about the program? 2. What would you change, if you could? 3. Do you have anything else {{to say about the}} team? Responses to these questions, as well as spontaneous comments offered by caregivers during the telephone interview protocol, were recorded. These data were coded into thematic categories by two raters: inter-rater reliability of 93 % was computed. RESULTS Four themes emerged from the analysis of the data. 4 Identified themes included: encouragement to participate in treatment planning; support during the wraparound process; focus on child and family strengths; and concerns surrounding discharge.

40|$|How did {{you become}} {{involved}} in doing research? I became involved in exploring this topic following a Study Abroad program to Matazano in 2013. I noted the environmental conditions prevalent that were directly influencing community health. It was during this trip that I recognized my desire to work with developing communities to find sustainable methods to live in cooperation with their environment while improving their collective health. I {{was introduced to the}} Community Health Club method by a fellow student and was intrigued by their success record in Africa. I felt {{it might be a good}} fit for the ongoing Engineers Without Borders project in Matazano. How is the research process different from what you expected? I expected the research process for this project to be mostly reading and disseminating information. However, translating the method and trying to understand how it would fit with the conditions experienced in Matazano raised more questions than I was initially prepared to answer. This meant that I had to spend more time researching the history of development projects and the region in particular. Overall, the research process raised more questions than concrete answers, and that surprised me. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>favorite</b> part of doing research? Visiting with the community and getting a first-hand experience of the conditions under which they must function as part of their daily lives was definitely my favorite part of the research. Corresponding with the author of the Community Health Club method was also great, as it allowed me to get a better feel for aspects of her work. The other aspect that was important was working closely with my mentor on the final paper and getting his feedback; this reinforced the direction that I’ve taken in my academic career...|$|E
