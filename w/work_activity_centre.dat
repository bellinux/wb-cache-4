The article looks at the link between participation in five distinct youth <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> (youth <b>centres,</b> hobby education, youth projects, youth organisations, counseling) and three outcome variables: labor market orientation, multiculturalism and youth voting. The empirical analysis is based on a database of 1061 elementary and secondary school pupils that was collected in Tallinn in spring 2010. Analysis results indicate a positive relationship between youth work participation and levels of the outcome variables.

50|$|Melbourne’s {{housing needs}} {{have been a}} focus of <b>activity</b> <b>centre</b> {{policies}} and planning policies ever since the city’s future growth potential was realised.

That plan however did address roads, transport forms, compactness, economic activity, investment and liveability, and appeared to take the view that community facilities would follow without the need for particular attention in their own right. A number of historical policies, whilst not directly linking housing and <b>activity</b> <b>centres,</b> shaped the suburbs Melbourne has today, and hence are relevant in Melbourne’s 2030 <b>Activity</b> <b>centre</b> policy.|$|R

50|$|Many {{cities like}} Melbourne {{have had to}} deal with {{population}} growth, which has brought about an increase in travel movements. This growth has also increased concerns for the environment, congestion and sustainability. It is the goal of <b>activity</b> <b>centre</b> policy to reduce individual car usage and encourage people to use public transport. This idea also means that there is a reduction in fuel consumption, saving money and time and is more efficient in the long term.In order to make public transport an attractive option to get to <b>activity</b> <b>centres</b> without the correct transport infrastructure in place, people turn back to their private forms of transport. This can be seen in a study into <b>Activity</b> <b>Centres</b> under taken by P. McNabb and the University of Melbourne research team in 2001 showed that “75% of trips to Melbourne <b>activity</b> <b>centres</b> were by car”. The use of public transport to access <b>activity</b> <b>centres</b> {{is one of the key}} principles outlined in Melbourne 2030 and in many other international <b>activity</b> <b>centre</b> policies. If such policies are to succeed, authorities will need to take responsibility and show a united front to developers and the community by reinforcing this policy, or risk losing another policy to the private sector.|$|R
