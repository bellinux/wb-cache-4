5|$|Cuarón {{wanted to}} do {{tracking}} shots, {{in part because the}} producers wanted to film it like an IMAX-style Discovery Channel documentary. Like his previous films, Emmanuel Lubezki did not use prior footage as the starting point of his work on Gravity. Instead, he carried out a search of images from NASA and Roscosmos. He and his team put together a large collection of photographs and picked <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> the movie. Lubezki said that they based the visuals on descriptions from astronauts, with some artistic license in depicting how the stars looked during the daytime in space. He wanted to incorporate the stars as much as possible to feel as deep as possible and avoid plain darkness and two dimensional feeling.|$|E

He excused racially discriminatory legislation as a protective measure and generally supported Aboriginal self-determination at least partly as striking a blow against the monolithic centralism of Canberra under Labor.|$|E

25|$|Jellicoe {{was rather}} {{abruptly}} dismissed by Geddes in December 1917. Before {{he left for}} leave on Christmas Eve he {{received a letter from}} Geddes demanding his resignation. Geddes’ letter stated that he was still in the building and available to talk, but after consulting Admiral Halsey Jellicoe replied in writing that he would “do <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> the service”.

25|$|For {{a period}} of twenty years (1860–1880), Darbhanga Raj was placed under the Court of Wards by the British Raj. During this period, Darbhanga Raj was {{involved}} in litigation regarding succession. This litigation decided that the estate was impartible and succession was to be governed by primogeniture. Zamindari estates in the region, including Darbhanga, actually sought intervention of the Court of Wards {{from time to time}} because the stewardship of the British authorities, who invested funds wisely, had a tendency to boost their economic position. The estate had in any event been badly run prior to this time: a complex system influenced by both nepotism and sycophancy had dramatically affected the family's rental income. The bureaucratic system introduced by the Court, whose appointed officials had no ties to the area, resolved the issue although, being focussed entirely on <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> the owners, it did so without considering the consequences for the tenants.|$|E
25|$|Just {{prior to}} the Canucks' 23-man roster being set {{following}} the end of preseason, they claimed defenceman Ryan Stanton off waivers. Stanton had played only one NHL game but was brought in as a possible replacement for Alberts in order to keep a balance between right and left handed defencemen. The youth movement failed to take hold. Guance was sent back to the Belleville Bulls. Despite having a good camp, he was outplayed by fellow prospects, Horvat and Shinkaruk. Tortorella felt Gaunce needed to improve the tempo and the pace of his game and he would benefit from playing more minutes. Due to the injuries and suspensions, it appeared that Horvat and Shinkaruk would start the season with the Canucks. However, just days before the roster was set, Vancouver acquired forwards Zac Dalpe and Jeremy Welsh from the Carolina Hurricanes. Following the trade Horvat was sent back to the London Knights, Shinkaruk remained with the team, but was returned to the Medicine Hat Tigers to make room for Stanton. As {{with the rest of the}} prospects, Vancouver was pleased with their play, but wanted to do <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> their development. Helping to make the decision to return the prospects to their junior teams was the emergence of Mike Santorelli who had a strong camp, where he was one of Vancouver's best forwards. He earned Tortorella's trust and was played in all situations helping him to make the team.|$|E

500|$|In September, Finn Green, a {{recovering}} alcoholic {{with his own}} story of triumph over adversity, began working for Reeves. A knowledgeable horseman, Green insisted that {{as a condition of}} employment he had the right to advocate for <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> a horse under his management, even if that meant expressing disagreement and imposing [...] "tough love" [...] on the owners.

He had lost his [...] "babyish" [...] look, put on weight, and as Ritvo put it, [...] "His shoulders [...] up with his behind." [...] Ritvo and Green then mapped out a 2012 workout and racing schedule for Mucho Macho Man, intending to run him every six to ten weeks with recovery time after each race.|$|E
500|$|It took Watts {{three months}} into {{his first season}} before he made his debut with the club {{choosing}} their biggest match {{of the year to}} name him for his debut, the Queen's Birthday clash against Collingwood. The fanfare and expectation the club placed on him for his debut has led to long-term criticism of the club about how they mismanaged his first match; five years after his debut, Paul Roos said he was appalled at how the club handled him for his debut. His first touch of the football saw him [...] "gang tackled" [...] by three Collingwood players, with some suggesting the tackle [...] "ruined him"; teammate on the day, Russell Robertson, dispelled these thoughts and said the team did not do enough to protect him, with the Collingwood captain at the time, Nick Maxwell, admitting in 2016 that the hype surrounding Watts did lead them to purposely be rougher with him than a standard player to ensure they limited his impact. Despite then-senior coach, Dean Bailey, claiming he was ready to play and keeping him in the team for three weeks, the football industry disagreed and scrutinised the club for using him as a marketing tool to provide a sense of hope for fans rather than doing <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> Watts' development.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the failure}} of the Royal Expedition, General Espartero {{received}} an official letter signed by Queen Isabella II's Secretary of War, in which he was given responsibility for the termination of the war along with 25 million reales for the proceedings. General Isidro de Alaix Fábregas, in the name of Espartero, communicated this letter to Maroto. Maroto insisted that he would do <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> the good of Spain. The result was a meeting between the two opposing generals {{that took place in the}} hermitage of San Antolín de Abadiano near Durango. The English colonel Wylde attended the Abadiano conference as an observer, because of Britain's recent role as mediator; also present was brigadier Francisco Linage, secretary to Espartero. But the negotiations were stymied by the matter of fueros: Maroto had promised to [...] defend the fueros and Espartero held that they were unconstitutional.|$|E
2500|$|Bell and Cazares later {{spoke about}} {{their reasons for}} {{excluding}} Herrera and Wolbers. Cazares said Bell wanted to reunite the classic Fear Factory lineup of himself, Cazares, Herrera, and Wolbers, but that Herrera and Wolbers refused {{to be part of}} any reunion with Cazares. Bell also said he wanted to fire the band's manager Christy Priske, who was also Wolbers' wife, and Herrera and Wolbers refused. Herrera and Wolbers threatened to sign a new record deal without Bell, prompting him to form a new version of Fear Factory without them. In some interviews, Wolbers said Bell had made [...] "growing unacceptable demands", which were declined. He said, [...] "Ray and I wanted <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> the business and what he [...] was trying to change wasn't really good for the business. It was only bad for the business, so that's why he went into that whole phase of hijacking the name and trying to run with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Historians {{since the}} late 20th century have debated how women shared in the French Revolution and what {{long-term}} impact it had on French women. Women had no political rights in pre-Revolutionary France; they were considered [...] "passive" [...] citizens; forced to rely on men to determine <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> them. That changed dramatically in theory as there seemingly were great advances in feminism. [...] Feminism emerged in Paris {{as part of a}} broad demand for social and political reform. The women demanded equality for men and then moved on to a demand for the end of male domination. Their chief vehicle for agitation were pamphlets and women's clubs, but the clubs were abolished in October 1793 and their leaders were arrested. The movement was crushed. Devance explains the decision in terms of the emphasis on masculinity in a wartime situation, Marie Antoinette's bad reputation for feminine interference in state affairs, and traditional male supremacy. A decade later the Napoleonic Code confirmed and perpetuated women's second-class status.|$|E
