40|$|User {{interfaces}} are {{a prominent}} part of applications that manipulate graphic data (geography, cartography, CAD/CAM, [...] .). Although some {{work has been}} done recently in this area, each system usually has its own ad hoc user interface built from scratch, and there is no user interface model general enough for customizing the presentation of a specific application which handles graphic data. This paper presents a conceptual model for describing user interfaces of systems manipulating maps in an object-oriented environment. The model proposed here is split into two levels: (i) the Interaction level and (ii) the External Spatial level. The Interaction level deals with high level interface objects, such as windows, as well as the interaction with the end user. In particular, we see the necessity of introducing a new kind of <b>window</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> map editing. The External Spatial level deals with objects which come from a mapping of the database objects onto objects manipulated by the end user. Th [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The left wing, {{composed}} of the pavilion of the Foster Shrine, is entered from {{the left of the}} building's foyer, which serves as the lobby of the Charity Randall Theatre, and through an entrance corridor that features Foster artifacts, a Foster bust, and five small casement windows featuring Connick stained glass <b>windows</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> symbols of Stephen Foster and his songs. Moving along the corridor to the shrine, on the right is the entrance to the Foster Reading Room and library, which is home to much of the Foster collection, including its more fragile contents, that can be examined by appointment. Continuing on, the corridor opens into a 12-sided gothic chamber with lancet windows containing Connick stained glass medallions which illustrate various Foster songs. On display in the Shrine in and around Gothic-arched alcoves are Foster's piano, sheet music, broadsides, recordings, and other personal items and memorabilia. The 2003 renovation left the memorial shrine untouched, except for the addition of an unobtrusive fire suppression systems.|$|R

5000|$|St Michael's church {{may have}} been one of the two churches in the barony of Manchester which were {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book, 1086. It was certainly in existence by 1262 when the advowson was held by the lord of the manor of Manchester. There is some uncertainty about the dedication: it is sometimes referred to as St Helen's but it is unclear whether the series of stained glass <b>windows</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> St Helen is the source of confusion. Rebuilding was undertaken in the 15th century (according to tradition in 1413) by Sir John Assheton who then held the advowson. His great-grandson Sir Thomas (died 1516) gave much of the surviving glass and left money to rebuild the tower. In 1792 after storm damage the interior was pewed and the screen and rood were removed. In 1821 the north side was rebuilt and in 1841 the south wall was also rebuilt. Richard Tattersall did restoration work in 1843 and 1843-45 to the interior piers and the carved oak pews and galleries. In the late 19th century the tower was rebuilt by J. S. Crowther. The only remains of the 15th century church are now the base of the north wall, the arcades, the chancel arch and the ceiling.|$|R
60|$|The village boys used to loiter round all day {{to watch}} the fights, and angry housewives would be {{constantly}} charging into our kitchen to fling dead cats upon the table, and appeal to Heaven and myself for justice. Our kitchen became a veritable cat's morgue, and I had to purchase a new kitchen table. The cook said it would make her work simpler if she could keep a table entirely to herself. She said it quite confused her, having so many dead cats lying round among her joints and vegetables: {{she was afraid of}} making a mistake. Accordingly, the old table was placed under the <b>window,</b> and <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> the cats; and, after that, she would never allow anyone to bring a cat, however dead, to her table.|$|R
50|$|Stained glass, or vitrail, the use {{of small}} plaques of colored glass joined by lead to depict {{historic}} events and figures, was not invented in Paris. It was recorded in texts {{in other parts of}} Europe in the late 9th century, but in Paris of the 12th and 13th centuries, it reached new heights of drama and artistry. Advancements in architecture, particularly at the Abbey of Saint-Denis and the Cathedral of Notre Dame, allowed stone walls to be replaced by walls of stained glass that flooded churches with colored light. In medieval theology, light was considered divine, and the windows gave a theological and moral message, particularly since most people attending church could not read. The smaller windows, closer to the viewer, told familiar bible stories. The larger and higher <b>windows</b> were <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> images of saints and patriarchs, while the immense rose windows on the transepts or facades of the churches portrayed epic stories; the last judgement, or the life of the Virgin Mary.|$|R
