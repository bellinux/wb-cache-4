5|$|The chromosphere, {{transition}} region, and corona {{are much}} hotter than {{the surface of}} the Sun. The reason is not <b>well</b> <b>understood,</b> but evidence suggests that Alfvén waves may have enough energy to heat the corona.|$|E
5|$|Every finite {{group is}} {{isomorphic}} to a matrix group, {{as one can}} see by considering the regular representation of the symmetric group. General groups can be studied using matrix groups, which are comparatively <b>well</b> <b>understood,</b> by means of representation theory.|$|E
5|$|Like most arthropods, spiders lack {{balance and}} {{acceleration}} sensors {{and rely on}} their eyes to tell them which way is up. Arthropods' proprioceptors, sensors that report the force exerted by muscles {{and the degree of}} bending in the body and joints, are <b>well</b> <b>understood.</b> On the other hand, little is known about what other internal sensors spiders or other arthropods may have.|$|E

Learning, as you <b>well</b> <b>understand,</b> Master Jacopo, {{is divided into}} reading, writing, and figures; and a man may <b>well</b> <b>understand</b> one, without knowing a word of the others. It is not {{absolutely}} necessary to be a bishop to have a shaved head, or a Jew to wear a beard." ...|$|R

5|$|Metamorphs weigh about 2g, {{while the}} largest adults can reach 50g. Individual frogs can vary {{substantially}} in body weight due {{to changes in}} the amount of stored fat, recent eating, and egg formation. While it is known to live 10–15 years in captivity, the frog's lifespan in the wild is not <b>well</b> <b>understood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mutations in lamin genes {{leading to}} defects in {{filament}} assembly cause {{a group of}} rare genetic disorders known as laminopathies. The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria, which causes the appearance of premature aging in its sufferers. The exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged phenotype is not <b>well</b> <b>understood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, male tigers {{participate}} in raising cubs, usually their own, {{but this is}} extremely rare and not always <b>well</b> <b>understood.</b> In May 2015, Amur tigers were photographed by camera traps in the Sikhote-Alin Bioshpere Reserve. The photos show a male Amur tiger pass by, followed by a female and three cubs within the span of about two minutes.|$|E

60|$|I come so <b>well</b> to <b>understand</b> tree-worship. All the old Aryans worshiped the tree. My ancestors. The tree of life. The tree of knowledge. Well, one {{is bound}} to sprout out some time or other, chip of the old Aryan block. I can so <b>well</b> <b>understand</b> tree-worship. And fear the deepest motive.|$|R

5|$|The {{biodiversity}} {{of local}} oceanic fauna is not <b>well</b> <b>understood.</b> Sea turtles and mammals, including monk seals, fin whales (only 1 sighting and 5 strandings {{have been documented}} in Turkish waters), and dolphins are considered to reside in the park area, although regularity of occurrences are unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} that confines the narrow rings is not <b>well</b> <b>understood.</b> Initially {{it was assumed}} that every narrow ring had a pair of nearby shepherd moons corralling them into shape. However, in 1986 Voyager 2 discovered only one such shepherd pair (Cordelia and Ophelia) around the brightest ring (ε).|$|E
5|$|The primary {{threats to}} red pandas are direct harvest from the wild, live or dead, {{competition}} with domestic livestock resulting in habitat degradation, and deforestation resulting in habitat loss or fragmentation. The {{relative importance of}} these factors is different in each region, and is not <b>well</b> <b>understood.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ultimately all {{of these}} {{problems}} {{were considered to be}} <b>well</b> <b>understood,</b> and a much larger design emerged, NIF. NIF was designed to provide about twice the required driver energy, allowing some margin of error. NIF's design was finalized in 1994, with construction to be completed by 2002. Construction began in 1997 but took over a decade to complete, with major construction being declared complete in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{evolutionary}} history—what the forerunner to {{the species}} {{was and how}} the close relatives branched off—is not <b>well</b> <b>understood,</b> the painted turtle is common in the fossil record. The oldest samples, found in Nebraska, date to about 15million years ago. Fossils from 15million to about 5million years ago are restricted to the Nebraska-Kansas area, but more recent fossils are gradually more widely distributed. Fossils newer than 300,000years old are found in almost all the United States and southern Canada.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} risk factors {{for the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not <b>well</b> <b>understood.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although {{water is}} vital for life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol is not <b>well</b> <b>understood,</b> mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale. Even the structure of pure water is poorly understood, due {{to the ability of}} water to form structures such as water clusters through hydrogen bonds.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, his {{reputation}} and fame were waning, and his passing was little noticed within the artistic community. His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art, his work was too original and personal to be <b>well</b> <b>understood.</b> By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had been moving away from the early idealism that the artist had helped found.|$|E
5|$|Compounds {{that feature}} {{scandium}} in the oxidation state other than +3 are rare but well characterized. The blue-black compound CsScCl3 {{is one of}} the simplest. This material adopts a sheet-like structure that exhibits extensive bonding between the scandium(II) centers. Scandium hydride is not <b>well</b> <b>understood,</b> although it appears not to be a saline hydride of Sc(II). As is observed for most elements, a diatomic scandium hydride has been observed spectroscopically at high temperatures in the gas phase. Scandium borides and carbides are non-stoichiometric, as is typical for neighboring elements.|$|E

5|$|Early fur {{traders and}} explorers noted {{regional}} trading centers, and archaeological evidence has shown {{some to be}} of considerable antiquity. One such trading center in the Weiser area existed as early as 4,500 years ago. The Fremont culture {{may have contributed to}} the historic Shoshones, but it is not <b>well</b> <b>understood.</b> Another poorly understood early cultural component is called the Midvale Complex. The introduction of the horse to the Snake River Plain around 1700 helped in establishing the Shoshone and Northern Paiute cultures.|$|E
5|$|Gunpowder weapons {{had begun}} to be {{introduced}} into England in the early 14th century, initially being used as offensive siege weapons but rapidly being adapted for defensive purposes during the 1360s. Although they were expensive, by the 1380s their potential value in defending castles and city walls was <b>well</b> <b>understood</b> and specialised facilities {{had begun to}} be built. Norwich had acquired gunpowder weapons {{and a team of}} gunners by 1355, and by 1385 had fifty gunpowder pieces for use along its city walls. Typically, these would have been small guns called hand cannons, rather than the heavier pieces termed bombards.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis: During the 1940s the cause, {{method of}} {{communication}} and treatment of infectious hepatitis was not <b>well</b> <b>understood.</b> Experimentation began with COs working at psychiatric hospitals and was expanded to a major research project with 30 to 60 test subjects at the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University. The men were inoculated with infected blood plasma, swallowed nose and throat washings and the human body wastes of infected patients, and drank contaminated water.|$|E
