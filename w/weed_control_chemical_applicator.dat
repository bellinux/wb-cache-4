40|$|Rapeseed {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} plants for oil worldwide and <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> is an important aspect of its cultivation. Among the various methods for <b>weed</b> <b>control,</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>control</b> is often preferred because it is less weather dependent, less costly and less labor intensive than other methods. This experiment was done to test the effects of separated and combined applications of the herbicides Treflan, Nabo-S, Super Gallant and Lontrel on rapeseed and associated weeds. The experiment was done in 2009 - 2010 at the research site of Islamic Azad University-Khorasan (Isfahan) in a completely randomized block design. Dominant weeds on the farmland were wild mustard, dill, mallow and canary grass. These tests demonstrated the most effective control from the herbicide combination Treflan +Nabo-S + Lontrel. Results showed that the highest grain yield was from Treflan +Super Gallant +Lontrel. Considering these results, it was determined that use of Treflan plus Super Gallant and Lontrel was an appropriate chemical treatment for weeds associated with rapeseed crops and as such can be recommended for rapeseed cultivation in Isfahan province and similar agronomic regions...|$|R

Some agronomic practices, such as weed management, are fundamental to cultivation, {{as a means of}} obtaining a high crop yield. However, some studies have shown that weed management may alter the function of the cultivar cycle. Thus, this study aimed at determining the optimal phenological stage in early-maturing common bean cultivars to perform the <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> without providing reductions in yield and seed quality. The experimental design was randomized blocks with 20 treatments and four replications, in a 2 × 2 × 5 (cultivars × types of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> × periods of <b>weed</b> <b>control)</b> factorial scheme. The periods of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> for both cultivars (Carioca Precoce and IPR-Colibri) consisted of full cycle <b>weeded</b> (<b>control),</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> at the V 4 - 3 stage (first three nodes on the main stem with trifoliate leaves), at the R 5 stage (beginning of bloom) and at the R 8 stage (appearance of pods) and full cycle unweeded (no <b>weed</b> <b>control).</b> The types of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> used were <b>chemical</b> (fluazifop-p-butyl + fomesafen) and mechanical (hoe). The Carioca Precoce cultivar demonstrated higher agronomic performance and yield than the IPR-Colibri cultivar, although the IPR-Colibri seeds had a higher vigor. The type of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> (<b>chemical</b> or mechanical) did not affect the agronomic characteristics, yield and seed physiological potential of the cultivars. The ideal period for <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> in early-maturing common bean cultivars to obtain a higher yield and seed physiological potential was observed at the V 4 - 3 phenological stage...|$|R
5000|$|Mowing and {{properly}} labeled herbicides are recommended for <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> {{can be used}} in the fall prior to establishment, or before or after planting. Weeds should be mowed just above the height of the growing switchgrass. Hormone herbicides, such as 2,4-D, should be avoided as they are known to reduce development of switchgrass when applied early in the establishing year. [...] Plantings that appear to have failed due to weed infestations are often wrongly assessed, as the failure is often more apparent than real. Switchgrass stands that are initially weedy commonly become well established with appropriate management in subsequent years.Once established, switchgrass can take up to three years to reach its full production potential. Depending on the region, it can typically produce 1/4 to 1/3 of its yield potential in its first year and 2/3 of its potential in the year after seeding.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Among {{the methods}} of <b>weed</b> <b>control,</b> stands out <b>chemical</b> <b>control.</b> However, even selective, {{herbicides}} can trigger the production of reactive species of oxygen and cause oxidative stress. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate changes in photosynthetic parameters, oxidative damage, antioxidant enzyme activity and altered metabolism of rice plants after applying pre-emergent herbicides. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse and herbicides used were oxadiazon, pendimethalin and oxyfluorfen, beyond the control without herbicide. There was a reduction of photosynthetic rate and efficiency of carboxylation, compared to the control, when applied herbicides oxyfluorfen and pendimethalin. The major lipid peroxidation and proline accumulation was observed for the herbicide oxyfluorfen. The oxyfluorfen and oxadiazon herbicides also resulted in increased activity of superoxide dismutase, compared to control. When evaluated ascorbate peroxidase activity, there was a higher enzyme activity in plants treated with oxadiazon and pendimethalin. Even selective herbicides registered for <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> in rice crops cause phytotoxicity, reduce height and alter the metabolism of plants, generating reactive oxygen species, which activate enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense systems and result in the degradation of photosynthetic pigments and in reduced protein content...|$|R

30|$|<b>Weed</b> <b>control</b> {{represents}} {{a major issue}} in plant cultivation [1]. Indeed, weeds can compete with cultivated plants for resources (light, water, nutrients, etc.) [2] and can represent a secondary host for crop pests [3]. In container cultivation, most of these negative effects may be amplified compared to open-field cultivations because of the reduced availability of growing media. Furthermore, the high fertility of the growth substrate often enhances weed growth rate compared to open-field cultivations [4]. Padgett and Frazier [5] estimated that manual <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> in nursery container cultivation requires 1542  h of labor per hectare. Currently, <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> is mainly <b>chemical,</b> but the most widely used herbicides, including those with broad-spectrum activity, cannot guarantee complete coverage against weeds [6]. This lack of full coverage forces operators to perform expensive manual weeding before marketing [1]. In addition, herbicides are phytotoxic [7] and dangerous for both the environment [8] and people [9]. Nowadays, plastic sheets are largely used for mulching in both open-field and container cultivations [10]. However, there is large concern about the use of plastic in agriculture, because of environmental issues [11]. It was estimated that around 700, 000  tons of plastic are used annually for agriculture [12] and these materials are often incorrectly disposed of, being dumped in marginal areas or even burned in bonfires.|$|R

The {{aim of this}} work was to evaluate, in two sugar beet breeding lines charaterized by high (L 1) and low (L 2) yield, some root morpho-functional traits (root elongation rate, total root length and number of root tips) that might be useful for sugar beet competitiveness against weeds. The above traits were evaluated on eleven-day old seedlings grown on a hydroponic nutrient solution whereas root length density and weed density were measured in field trials. The most productive line L 1 was characterized by superior root elongation rate, total root length and number of root tips as compared to L 2 and the main sugar beet weeds. L 1 also showed, under field condition, a higher root length density and a lower weed density highlighting a superior competitive ability against weeds (less number of weeds per area unit) and overall productivity.

The low likelihood of new herbicides {{in the foreseeable future}} increases the impact of herbicide resistance on the Australian rice industry. Allelopathy, chemical interactions between plants, is an alternative <b>control</b> option. <b>Weeds</b> could be <b>controlled</b> by using crops which have been developed to exert their own <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> by releasing <b>chemicals</b> into the soil.

40|$|The agronomic {{importance}} of knowing weed emergence patterns {{has been recognized}} {{for many years and}} several studies have been conducted on weed emergence dynamics with various approaches. Predictive weed emergence models can estimate, in a given moment, the percentage of weeds that have already emerged and the successive seedling emergence dynamics. Therefore they may be useful to achieve well-timed and efficient <b>weed</b> <b>control,</b> both <b>chemical</b> and mechanical. There is no universal best approach to create an accurate model, since it depends on many factors, such as climatic characteristics of the area, cultivation practices, etc. A commonly used approach is the hydrothermal time concept, {{based on the idea that}} seeds need a certain amount of hydrothermal time to germinate. The aim of the this research was to model weed emergence of Polygonum lapathifolium L. and Solanum nigrum L. to enrich and improve the information provided by the predictive emergence model AlertInf. Base temperature required for the hydrothermal time calculation of these weed species was calculated with an innovative method using alternating temperatures. Base water potential was empirically derived from field data using an iterative process. Emergence dynamics were modelled using data of seedling emergence collected from 2005 to 2012 in maize fields at two sites located in northeastern Italy. Simulating emergence dynamics based on hydrothermal time of species which germinate only with alternating temperature is fundamental to increase number of species predicted by AlertInf and consequently the richness of information provided by the model for more effectively timed weed management...|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{measurement}} of tire-road friction coefficient is extremely valuable for winter road maintenance operations {{and can be}} used to optimize the kind and quantity of the deicing and anti-icing chemicals applied to the roadway. In this project, a wheel based tire-road friction coefficient measurement system is first developed for snowplows. Unlike a traditional Norse meter, this system is based on {{measurement of}} lateral tire forces, has minimal moving parts and does not use any actuators. Hence, it is reliable and inexpensive. A key challenge is quickly detecting changes in estimated tire-road friction coefficient while rejecting the high levels of noise in measured force signals. Novel filtering and signal processing algorithms are developed to address this challenge including a biased quadratic mean filter and an accelerometer based vibration removal filter. Detailed experimental results are presented on the performance of the friction estimation system on different types of road surfaces. Experimental results show that the biased quadratic mean filter works very effectively to eliminate the influence of noise and quickly estimate changes in friction coefficient. Further, the use of accelerometers and an intelligent algorithm enables elimination of the influence of driver steering maneuvers, thus providing a robust friction measurement system. In {{the second part of the}} project, the developed friction measurement system is used for automated <b>control</b> of the <b>chemical</b> <b>applicator</b> on the snowplow. An electronic interface is established with the Force America applicator to enable real-time control. A feedback control system that utilizes the developed friction measurement sensor and a pavement temperature sensor is developed and implemented on the snowplow.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} 3 -year {{field study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of some stubble crops and <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> methods on the species composition, number and air-dry weight of weeds in a spring barley crop grown in short-term monoculture. The {{study was conducted in}} the period 2009 – 2011 at the Uhrusk Experimental Farm, on mixed rendzina soil classified as very good rye soil complex. It included stubble crops which were ploughed under in each year (control treatment without cover crop, white mustard, lacy phacelia, a mixture of legumes – narrow-leaf lupin + field pea) and 3 <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> methods used in spring barley crops (mechanical, mechanical and <b>chemical,</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control).</b> Veronica persica was the weed species that occurred in greatest numbers in the spring barley crop sown after stubble crops. All cover crops reduced the numbers of Avena fatua which was the dominant species in the <b>control</b> treatment. <b>Chemical</b> as well as <b>chemical</b> and mechanical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> significantly reduced the numbers of Avena fatua compared to the treatment where only double harrowing was used for <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> The stubble crops did not reduce weed infestation of spring barley. Compared to the control treatment, the ploughing-in of white mustard and the mixture of legumes reduced the dry weight of weeds by 49. 1 and 22. 7 %, respectively. Mechanical weed management proved to be less effective in reducing the number and dry weight of weeds compared to the other <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> methods. A significant negative correlation was found between the dry weight of weeds in the spring barley crop and the dry weight of the ploughed-in white mustard cover crop under the conditions of <b>chemical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> {{as well as in the}} case of the mixture of legumes when complete mechanical and <b>chemical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> was used...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in winter wheat grown under organic conditions in Denmark on fields with different weed pressure. The treatments were sowing strategy (normal sowing time, late sowing and false seedbed), row distance (12 cm and 24 cm row distance) and <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> method (untreated, mechanical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> (<b>weed</b> harrowing at 12 cm supplemented with row hoeing at 24 cm), and herbicide <b>weed</b> <b>control).</b> <b>Weed</b> biomass was largest at the normal sowing time and was reduced by mechanical or <b>chemical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> Row distance alone did not generally influence weed biomass, but mechanical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> reduced <b>weed</b> biomass at a row distance of 24 cm. Normal sowing time gave rise to about 10 % higher yield. The effect of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> on yield was dependent on the weed pressure.
