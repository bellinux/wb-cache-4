5|$|At birth, infants {{are unable}} to wait for their <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> needs to be met and exhibit a {{defining}} lack of impulse control. With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification. Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that {{are closely related to}} attention deficits and behavior problems.|$|E

Characters can be made as strong or as fast as the user <b>wants,</b> <b>and</b> allows the player to experience the game {{in a way that would}} not normally be possible within the game's mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy may be {{combined}} with palliative care {{in the treatment of}} the NSCLC. In advanced cases, appropriate chemotherapy improves average survival over supportive care alone, as well as improving quality of life. With adequate physical fitness maintaining chemotherapy during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, symptomatic relief, and an improvement in quality of life, with better results seen with modern agents. The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy should be considered in advanced NSCLC.|$|E
50|$|Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory (1993) {{proposed}} that reward contains separable psychological components: <b>wanting</b> (incentive) <b>and</b> liking (pleasure). To explain increasing {{contact with a}} certain stimulus such as chocolate, there are two independent factors at work - our desire to have the chocolate (<b>wanting)</b> <b>and</b> the pleasure effect of the chocolate (liking). According to Robinson <b>and</b> Berridge, <b>wanting</b> <b>and</b> liking are two aspects of the same process, so rewards are usually <b>wanted</b> <b>and</b> liked to the same degree. However, <b>wanting</b> <b>and</b> liking also change independently under certain circumstances. For example, rats that do not eat after receiving dopamine (experiencing a loss of desire for food) act as though they still like food. In another example, activated self-stimulation electrodes in the lateral hypothalamus of rats increase appetite, but also cause more adverse reactions to tastes such as sugar and salt; apparently, the stimulation increases wanting but not liking. Such results demonstrate that our reward system includes independent processes of <b>wanting</b> <b>and</b> liking. The <b>wanting</b> component {{is thought to be}} controlled by dopaminergic pathways, whereas the liking component is thought to be controlled by opiate-benzodiazepine systems.|$|R

40|$|Rationale: {{incentive}} sensitisation theory (IST) {{claims that}} the mechanism of reward is comprised of separate neurobiological systems of <b>wanting</b> <b>and</b> liking, that dependent drug use {{occurs as a result}} of sensitisation of the system controlling <b>wanting,</b> <b>and</b> that the two systems can be dissociated. Objective: to test the IST prediction that <b>wanting</b> <b>and</b> liking for alcohol can be dissociated in humans. Methods: measures of <b>wanting</b> <b>and</b> liking for alcohol were obtained in three experiments. Experiment 1 examined whether liking for alcohol was associated with levels of wanting, as indexed by self-reported weekly alcohol intake. Experiments 2 and 3 also assessed the association between liking <b>and</b> <b>wanting</b> but in these experiments wanting was also indexed by alcohol consumption in the laboratory. Experiment 2 increased wanting for alcohol using an alcohol priming dose to determine whether liking would be similarly affected. Experiment 3 reduced liking for alcohol by adulterating drinks with Tween to see whether wanting would also be reduced. Results: little evidence for an association between liking <b>and</b> <b>wanting</b> for alcohol was found in Experiments 1 – 3 but, collapsing across all experiments, a weak positive correlation between liking <b>and</b> <b>wanting</b> was found. However, in Experiment 2, wanting was increased by the alcohol priming dose whereas liking was not and in Experiment 3 liking was reduced without a concurrent reduction in wanting. Conclusions: although correlations between <b>wanting</b> <b>and</b> liking can be observed these results support the contention of the IST that <b>wanting</b> <b>and</b> liking for alcohol can be dissociated in human participants...|$|R
5|$|While {{disagreeing with}} Nehru about socialist {{economic}} model, Gandhi also critiqued capitalism that {{was driven by}} endless <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> a materialistic view of man. This, he believed, created a vicious vested system of materialism {{at the cost of}} other human needs such as spirituality and social relationships. To Gandhi, states Parekh, both communism and capitalism were wrong, in part because both focussed exclusively on materialistic view of man, and because the former deified the state with unlimited power of violence, while the latter deified capital. A better economic system is one which does not impoverish one's culture and spiritual pursuits.|$|E

5|$|However, Han {{beliefs in}} the afterlife were not uniform across the empire and changed over time. Not only were there many {{different}} burial customs and views on how one journeyed through the afterlife, but even the names hun and po for spirit-soul and body-soul could be substituted with demon (gui 鬼) and spirit (shen 神). Demons, or gui, {{were thought to be}} partial manifestations of the deceased which lacked their essential vital energy (qi 氣) that had to be exorcised when they maliciously caused the living to become ill; however, a demon could also be considered a neutral 'ghost'. Spirits, or shen, were usually associated with the animalistic spirits embodying certain places, such as the Earl of the Yellow River (He Bo 河伯). If proper sacrifices were made to these spirits, it was believed to bring good fortune; if ritual sacrifices were neglected, the spirit could inflict bad fortune on individuals and local communities. In the Western Han, texts left behind in tombs illustrate that the living took a more sympathetic view towards the dead than in the Eastern Han, when spirits were generally more feared as dangers to the living. The Western Han 'letters informing the underground' (gaodishu 告地書) were written to 'inform the Ruler of the Underground' 告地下王 about the deceased's <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> needs for clothing, vessels, and implements. However, 'tomb-quelling texts' (zhenmuwen 鎮墓文) that appeared during the 1st century CE acted as passports for the dead so that they did not disturb or bring danger to the living. Both Western Han and Eastern Han tombs contained 'land contracts' (diquan 地券) which stated that the deceased owned the land they were buried in.|$|E
