It is operated by E.ON UK, and was completed in 2014.

5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and labour costs were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 stone) of Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy savings of between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 pipes that were drilled 100m below ground, so that during cold spells, water is pumped through the pipes and heated to 14Â°C by geothermal energy. The hot water is then pumped {{back up to the}} slate floor to warm the building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A biomass boiler was installed to use wood chips from recycled <b>waste</b> <b>wood</b> to heat the building, and rainwater is collected from the roof to flush the toilets in the building.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the city}} has {{developed}} its own {{combined heat and power}} station, using <b>waste</b> <b>wood</b> biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source.

Coal and petroleum coke are used as primary feedstocks for many large gasification plants worldwide. Additionally, a variety of biomass and waste-derived feedstocks can be gasified, with wood pellets and chips, <b>waste</b> <b>wood,</b> plastics and aluminium, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Refuse-derived fuel (RDF), agricultural and industrial wastes, sewage sludge, switch grass, discarded seed corn, corn stover and other crop residues all being used.|$|E
25|$|There are {{at present}} a few {{industrial}} scale biomass gasification plants. Since 2008 in Svenljunga, Sweden, a biomass gasification plant generates up to 14 MWth, supplying industries and citizens of Svenljunga with process steam and district heating, respectively. The gasifier uses biomass fuels such as CCA or creosote impregnated <b>waste</b> <b>wood</b> {{and other kinds}} of recycled wood to produces syngas that is combusted on site. In 2011 a similar gasifier, using the same kinds of fuels, is being installed at 's CHP plant. The CHP plant will generate 2 MWe (electricity) and 8 MWth (district heating).|$|E
25|$|When {{solid biomass}} {{is already in}} a {{suitable}} form (such as firewood), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When solid biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban <b>waste</b> <b>wood,</b> agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from , which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce wood pellets, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product. The other types of densification are larger in size compared to a pellet and are compatible with {{a broad range of}} input feedstocks. The resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems, such as boilers.|$|E
40|$|Issue: A {{priority}} in recovering <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> from any source is to minimize additional contaminants {{in the course}} of preparing the material for processing. Handling or storing <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> on bare ground, crushed rock, or asphalt paved surfaces are common practices. However, these practices introduce dirt, grit, rock, and other contaminants into the <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> material. Even the quality of the cleanest materials are downgraded. This degradation is more detrimental to the cleaner and higher value <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> than the lower value <b>wood</b> <b>waste.</b> Lower quality <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> leads to lower market value and greater contamination removal requirements for the facility and end-user. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends using clean concrete surfaces for front-end storage and material handling of <b>wood</b> <b>waste.</b> A well maintained concrete surface minimizes dirt, grit, rock, and other contaminants to downgrade the quality of the material. Consider the following issues when handling and storing <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> materials on concrete surfaces: Operational. Concrete surfaces are ideal for <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> dumping, rough sorting, bulk reduction (by means of rolling stock compaction), and storage because the smooth surface prevents unwanted dirt and rock to mix with the <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> material. A slight surface slope assists in the drainage and keeps the material clean and dry. A well designed concrete surface allows processing operations to continue even during rain...|$|R

2500|$|Newer wood drying {{technologies}} {{have included the}} use of reduced atmospheric pressure to attempt {{to speed up the}} drying process. [...] A variety of vacuum technologies exist, varying primarily in the method heat is introduced into the wood charge. [...] Hot water platten vacuum kilns use aluminum heating plates with the water circulating within as the heat source, and typically operate at significantly reduced absolute pressure. [...] Discontinuous and SSV (super-heated steam) use atmosphere to introduce heat into the kiln charge. [...] Discontinuous technology allows the entire kiln charge to come up to full atmospheric pressure, the air in the chamber is then heated, and finally vacuum is pulled. [...] SSV run at partial atmospheres (typically around 1/3 of full atmospheric pressure) in a hybrid of vacuum and conventional kiln technology (SSV kilns are significantly more popular in Europe where the locally harvested wood is easier to dry versus species found in North America). [...] RF/V (radio frequency + vacuum) kilns use microwave radiation to heat the kiln charge, and typically have the highest operating cost due to the heat of vaporization being provided by electricity rather than local fossil fuel or <b>waste</b> <b>wood</b> sources.|$|E

60|$|At length {{the winter}} set in good earnest, just as I had {{finished}} plastering, {{and the wind}} began to howl around the house {{as if it had}} not had permission to do so till then. Night after night the geese came lumbering in the dark with a clangor and a whistling of wings, even after the ground was covered with snow, some to alight in Walden, and some flying low over the woods toward Fair Haven, bound for Mexico. Several times, when returning from the village at ten or eleven o'clock at night, I heard the tread of a flock of geese, or else ducks, on the dry leaves in the woods by a pond-hole behind my dwelling, where they had come up to feed, and the faint honk or quack of their leader as they hurried off. In 1845 Walden froze entirely over {{for the first time on}} the night of the 22d of December, Flint's and other shallower ponds and the river having been frozen ten days or more; in '46, the 16th; in '49, about the 31st; and in '50, about the 27th of December; in '52, the 5th of January; in '53, the 31st of December. The snow had already covered the ground since the 25th of November, and surrounded me suddenly with the scenery of winter. I withdrew yet farther into my shell, and endeavored to keep a bright fire both within my house and within my breast. My employment out of doors now was to collect the dead wood in the forest, bringing it in my hands or on my shoulders, or sometimes trailing a dead pine tree under each arm to my shed. An old forest fence which had seen its best days was a great haul for me. I sacrificed it to Vulcan, for it was past serving the god Terminus. How much more interesting an event is that man's supper who has just been forth in the snow to hunt, nay, you might say, steal, the fuel to cook it with! His bread and meat are sweet. There are enough fagots and <b>waste</b> <b>wood</b> of all kinds in the forests of most of our towns to support many fires, but which at present warm none, and, some think, hinder the growth of the young wood. There was also the driftwood of the pond. In the course of the summer I had discovered a raft of pitch pine logs with the bark on, pinned together by the Irish when the railroad was built. This I hauled up partly on the shore. After soaking two years and then lying high six months it was perfectly sound, though waterlogged past drying. I amused myself one winter day with sliding this piecemeal across the pond, nearly half a mile, skating behind with one end of a log fifteen feet long on my shoulder, and the other on the ice; or I tied several logs together with a birch withe, and then, with a longer birch or alder which had a hook at the end, dragged them across. Though completely waterlogged and almost as heavy as lead, they not only burned long, but made a very hot fire; nay, I thought that they burned better for the soaking, as if the pitch, being confined by the water, burned longer, as in a lamp.|$|E

TrÃ¤avfall kommer frÃ¥n skogsbruk, trÃ¤â och byggbranschen och rivningsplatser. Bland dem kan tre typer av trÃ¤avfall identifieras: obehandlat trÃ¤avfall (obehandlat trÃ¤ betraktas som biomassa), lÃ¤tt behandlat trÃ¤avfall (frÃ¥n belÃ¤ggning eller limning) och hÃ¶gbehandlat trÃ¤avfall (frÃ¥n impregnering med CCA och kreosot, betraktas som farligt avfall). Enligt avfallsfÃ¶rordningen, Ã¤r hantering av avfall i Europa inriktad mer mot Ã¥tervinning och mindre mot eliminering. Bland de franska kraven, kan tre huvudsakliga tendenser iakttas fÃ¶r Ã¥tervinning av trÃ¤avfall: endast behandlat avfall kan behandlas i fÃ¶rbrÃ¤nningsanlÃ¤ggningar fÃ¶r energiutvinning, hÃ¶gbehandlat trÃ¤avfall mÃ¥ste elimineras genom fÃ¶rbrÃ¤nning och lÃ¤tt behandlat avfall kan antingen Ã¥tervinnas som spÃ¥nskivor eller elimineras. I detta sammanhang uppgÃ¥r mÃ¤ngden trÃ¤avfall frÃ¥n byggâ och rivningsplatser till 7 miljoner ton i Frankrike. Bland dem, motsvarar 5 % obehandlat trÃ¤, och 25 % Ã¤r lÃ¤tt behandlat. Den hÃ¶ga fÃ¶rbrÃ¤nningspotentialen fÃ¶r trÃ¤avfall ger dessutom en mÃ¶jlighet att ersÃ¤tta konventionellt brÃ¤nsle som anvÃ¤nds i fÃ¶rbrÃ¤nningsanlÃ¤ggningar. De fyra huvudsakliga metoder som anvÃ¤nds fÃ¶r att behandla trÃ¤avfall Ã¤r Ã¥tervinning i spÃ¥nskivor, fÃ¶rbrÃ¤nning med energiutvinning, fÃ¶rbrÃ¤nning och deponering. PÃ¥ grund av olika typer av trÃ¤avfall, krÃ¤vs ett konditioneringsteg innan Ã¥tervinning. Ãven om fÃ¶rbrÃ¤nningen Ã¤r fÃ¶rdelaktigt pÃ¥ grund av sitt neutrala kol, visar livscykelanalyser utslÃ¤pp av andra fÃ¶roreningar. Dessutom visas att kontrollerade elimineringsmetoder har mindre miljÃ¶pÃ¥verkar Ã¤n Ã¥tervinningsmetoder som ej har rÃ¤tt utrustning. Ãtervinning Ã¤r alltsÃ¥ inte alltid att fÃ¶redra om man beaktar de effekter som gjorts vid denna undersÃ¶kningen. Konkurrensen mellan olika behandlingsmetoder och lÃ¥ga priser pÃ¥ trÃ¤avfall Ã¤r specifika ekonomiska aspekter som skulle kunna pÃ¥verka utvecklingen inom omrÃ¥det. Dessutom, den Ã¶kande acceptansen av mÃ¤nniskor fÃ¶r Ã¥tervinning och lokala avfallshanteringsmetoder, liksom behovet av inhemska energikÃ¤llor Ã¤r faktorer som sannolikt kan frÃ¤mja brÃ¤nsle frÃ¥n trÃ¤avfall. Dessa drivkrafter utvecklas pÃ¥ ett mycket snabbt sÃ¤tt. AvfallsfÃ¶rordningen Ã¤r pÃ¥ vÃ¤g mot infÃ¶randet av standarder fÃ¶r att frÃ¤mja utvecklingen av lÃ¤tt behandlat trÃ¤avfalls brÃ¤nsle. Tekniska och sociala fÃ¶rbÃ¤ttringar, exempelvis kÃ¤llsortering och utveckling av Ã¥tervinningsmetoder ger ocksÃ¥ sannolikt positiva effekter.
