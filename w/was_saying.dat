Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood of protest, the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity, the little guy fighting for his rights.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} since Jock Stein's death, some, {{including}} Alex Ferguson, {{have said that they}} noticed changes in him {{in the days and weeks}} prior to the game against Wales. The night before, Stein had invited Ferguson and Andy Roxburgh to his hotel room, where he reminisced with them about his time in football, something that he rarely if ever did; he also persuaded his family not to make the trip to Cardiff to watch the game. Further, Ferguson noted that, during the half-time interval, Stein did not dominate the dressing room in the way he normally did, while Gordon Strachan found it difficult to understand precisely what Stein <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> during his team-talk. However, Strachan came to accept that the final decision Stein made, to replace him with Davie Cooper, was the correct one given Cooper's subsequent impact on the game.|$|E

The following day, while the priest <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> mass, Canek raised a false alarm of fire, apparently to empty the church {{so that he could}} kill the priest. The priest, however, was not killed.|$|E

25|$|West's {{friend and}} fellow artist Tammy Wynette stated that she had put aside visiting her in the hospital, saying that she planned {{to allow her to}} heal first, {{something}} she admitted to later regretting. In his autobiography, Kenny Rogers, who maintained a close friendship with West, stated that he did pay a visit her in hospital a few times prior to her death. On his last visit (the day of West's death), Rogers recalled that although he was told it was unlikely that West could hear him, he still spoke to her for a considerable amount of time in the hope she could hear what he <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{contemporary}} Shia scholar Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei {{provides a}} counter argument to this belief. He states {{that even if}} Ali’s Quran incorporated additions that {{are not part of}} the existing Quran, this does not mean that these additions comprised parts of the Quran and have been dropped from it due to alteration. Rather, these additions were interpretations or explanations of what God <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> or were in the form of revelations from God, explaining the intention of the verses in the Quran. These additions were not part of the Quran and not part of what the Messenger of God was commanded to convey to the Muslim community.|$|E
25|$|Exactly {{how and why}} did Merezhkovsky {{found himself}} on the German radio in June 1941 nobody was quite sure of. Gippius (according to Yury Terapiano who was quoting Nina Berberova) was blaming her own {{secretary}} Vladimir Zlobin who, using his German connections, allegedly persuaded the elderly man {{to come to the}} studio {{in the early days of}} the Nazi invasion into the USSR. In his speech (if its printed version entitled Bolshevism and Humanity is to be believed) Merezhkovsky, comparing Hitler to Joan of Arc, called for the anti-Bolshevik crusade, reiterating, among other things, what he <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> all through the 1920s and 1930s:Bolshevism will never change its nature... because right from the start it's been not a national, but international phenomenon. From the very first day Russia has been – and remains to this very day – only a means to the end: that of its conquering the whole world.|$|E

25|$|By November 1951, Watson had {{acquired}} little training in X-ray crystallography, {{by his own}} admission, and thus had not fully understood what Franklin <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> about the structural symmetry of the DNA molecule. Crick, however, knowing the Fourier transforms of Bessel functions that represent the X-ray diffraction patterns of helical structures of atoms, correctly interpreted further one of Franklin's experimental findings as indicating that DNA was {{most likely to be}} a double helix with the two polynucleotide chains running in opposite directions. Crick was thus {{in a unique position to}} make this interpretation because he had formerly worked on the X-ray diffraction data for other large molecules that had helical symmetry similar to that of DNA. Franklin, on the other hand, rejected the first molecular model building approach proposed by Crick and Watson: the first DNA model, which in 1952 Watson presented to her and to Wilkins in London, had an obviously incorrect structure with hydrated charged groups on the inside of the model, rather than on the outside. Watson explicitly admitted this in his book The Double Helix.|$|E
25|$|Later {{attempts}} at discovering whether Lucas had actually killed anyone apart from Powell and Rich were complicated by Lucas's {{ability to make}} an accurate deduction that seemed to substantiate a confession. In one instance, he explained how he had correctly identified a victim in a group photograph through her wearing spectacles; a pair of glasses were {{on a table in}} a crime scene photo shown to him earlier. There were also suggestions that the interview tapes showed that, despite Lucas's supposedly low IQ, he had adroitly read the reactions of those interviewing him and altered what he <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> thereby making his confessions more consistent with facts known to law enforcement. The most serious allegation against investigators, that they had let Lucas read case files on unsolved crimes and thus enabled him to come up with convincingly detailed confessions, made it virtually impossible to determine if, as some continue to suspect, he had been telling the truth to the Lucas Task Force about a relatively large number of the murders.|$|E
25|$|In the testy Game 3 of the 2003 ALCS, after {{allowing}} single {{runs in the}} 2nd, 3rd, and 4th innings, Martínez hit Yankees {{right fielder}} Karim García near the shoulders with a pitch, sparking a shouting match between Martínez and the New York bench. Directing his attention at Yankees catcher Jorge Posada, Martínez jabbed a finger {{into the side of}} his own head, which some, including an enraged Yankee bench coach Don Zimmer, interpreted as a threatened beanball. Emotions remained high {{in the bottom of the}} inning, which was led off by Boston slugger Manny Ramírez. Ramirez became irate over a high strike from Roger Clemens, and both benches cleared. During the ensuing commotion, the 72-year-old Zimmer ran towards Martínez in an attempt to knock him down; Martínez sidestepped Zimmer and threw him to the ground. Later, Martínez claimed that he was not indicating that he would hit Posada in the head, but that he would remember what Posada <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> to him. In 2009, Martínez claimed that he regretted the incident but denied being at fault. Zimmer did not give much credence to Pedro's statements. Martínez wrote in 2015 that the altercation with Zimmer was his only regret of his entire career.|$|E

25|$|Eden's major mistake {{had been}} not to strike in July 1956 {{when there was}} {{widespread}} anger at Nasser's nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company, as {{by the fall of}} 1956 public anger had subsided, with many people in Britain having come to accept the fait accompli, and saw no reason for war. This was especially the case as Eden's claims that the Egyptians would hopelessly mismanage the Canal had proven groundless, and that by September 1956 {{it was clear that the}} change of management had not affected shipping. Even more importantly, Eden's obsession with secrecy and his desire to keep the preparations for war as secret as possible meant that the Eden government did nothing in the months running up to the attack to explain to the British people why it was felt that war was necessary. Many of the reservists who were called up for their National Service in the summer and fall of 1956 recalled feeling bewildered and confused as the Eden government started preparing to attack Egypt while at the same time Eden insisted in public that he wanted a peaceful resolution of the dispute, and was opposed to attacking Egypt. The British author David Pryce-Jones recalled that as a young officer, that after the ultimatum was submitted to Egypt he had to explain to his troops why war with Egypt was necessary without believing a word that he <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b> Only one British soldier, however, refused to fight.|$|E
500|$|Cage {{underwent}} {{an artistic}} {{crisis in the}} early 1940s. His compositions were rarely accepted by the public, and he grew more and more disillusioned {{with the idea of}} art as communication. He later gave an account of the reasons: [...] "Frequently I misunderstood what another composer <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> simply because I had little understanding of his language. And I found other people misunderstanding what I myself <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> when I <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> something pointed and direct". At the beginning of 1946, Cage met Gita Sarabhai, an Indian musician who came to the United States concerned about Western influence on the music of her country. Sarabhai wanted to spend several months in the US, studying Western music. She took lessons in counterpoint and contemporary music with Cage, who offered to teach her for free if she taught him about Indian music in return. Sarabhai agreed and through her Cage became acquainted with Indian music and philosophy. The purpose of music, according to Sarabhai's teacher in India, was [...] "to sober and quiet the mind, thus rendering it susceptible to divine influences", and this definition became one of the cornerstones of Cage's view on music and art in general.|$|E
500|$|Two {{versions}} exist of how Tatsuguchi died. [...] One {{version is}} that he did not participate in the attack. [...] Later in the day on May 30, two American soldiers, Charles W. Laird and John Hirn, who were searching for remaining Japanese forces following the defeat of Yamasaki's attack, approached the cave containing Tatsuguchi's field hospital. Tatsuguchi emerged from the cave, waving his Bible {{in the direction of the}} Americans and yelling in English, [...] "Don't shoot! [...] I am a Christian!" [...] Laird heard and understood what Tatsuguchi <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> and withheld fire. [...] Hirn, however, shot and killed Tatsuguchi. [...] Hirn later stated that he could not hear what Tatsuguchi <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> over the wind and noise of battle and that he thought that the Bible Tatsuguchi was holding was a weapon.|$|E
