While most of the German garrison quickly surrendered, it was necessary to deal with some diehard elements <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> to surrender to either the New Zealanders or the Yugoslav partisans also present in the city.

5|$|Between 1945 and 1950 the US {{fleet of}} battleships had been entirely decommissioned; however, Missouri was spared this fate {{due to the}} {{influence}} of President Harry S.

Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship and partly because the battleship had been christened by his daughter. As a result, Missouri was involved in various training and flag waving exercises at home and abroad between World War II and the Korean War.|$|E

In his 14seasons, Olmstead appeared in the Stanley Cup final 11times. He won five times, four of them with the Montreal Canadiens, and once with the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
