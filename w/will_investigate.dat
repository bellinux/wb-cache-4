5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Jayanthi (Andrea Jeremiah) arrives in Kochi from Mumbai {{in search of}} her missing husband, Ramesh (Ashvin Mathew), an Indian Revenue Service officer who {{frequently}} disappeared from home for various reasons, but is now {{a suspect in the}} gold smuggling. Jayanthi arranged for a taxi to drive her to various locations in her quest to find Ramesh. The taxi driver Raju (Mohanlal) appears to have an interest of his own in the circumstances surrounding Ramesh's disappearance. At Jayanthi's bidding, Raju drives her to the home of her mother-in-law (KPAC Lalitha) where he cooks for them and interacts in such a way to earn their trust. Jayanthi then asks Raju to drive her to Kochi to the office of her friend, Chandrasekharan (Vijayaraghavan), assistant commissioner of police. Chandrasekharan promises Jayanthi he <b>will</b> <b>investigate</b> the disappearance of Ramesh. After leaving Chandrasekharan's office, Raju drives Jayanthi to see Chandrasekharan's wife, Advocate Rekha (Muthumany), who is also her friend. During their chat, Jayanthi receives a surprise phone call from Ramesh. He explains that he is in Kovalam for an official meeting but will return home the next day, and insists that Jayanthi return home as well. Chandrasekharan later informs Jayanthi that the phone number Ramesh called from was actually in Kochi, not Kovalam. It is also revealed that Sudheer, Ramesh's brother is involved in the smuggling operation.|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 2008, Bellaire police {{officers}} confronted Robbie Tolan, {{the son of}} former Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan, in the driveway of his house at the 800 block of Woodstock. Officers suspected Tolan, who was unarmed, of stealing a sports utility vehicle in the driveway and shot Tolan in the chest; Tolan's family owned the vehicle. Tolan was hospitalized with injuries to one lung and a liver. The incident sparked allegations of racial profiling. Members of minority groups reported that Bellaire police racially profiled people. In 2002, José Cruz, Jr., son of baseball player José Cruz, was stopped since his vehicle was missing a front license plate. He was arrested by Bellaire police and spent one night in jail after Bellaire law enforcement {{told him that he}} had a warrant for his arrest. The Houston Chronicle said that the Bellaire police decision to arrest Cruz was a mistake. In January 2009, Cruz accused the police of racial profiling. Mayor Cindy Siegel said that she was unaware of racial profiling by police. Siegel announced that the city <b>will</b> <b>investigate</b> racial profiling and hire an independent consultant to look at traffic stop data. The local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) branch said that it established a pact with the City of Bellaire; people may report civil rights violations from Bellaire Police to the branch if the people do not wish to contact the City of Bellaire. However, the NAACP branch has not yet provided the city with any civil rights violations. On April 6, 2009, a Harris County grand jury indicted Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton, the police officer, for aggravated assault by a public servant. If convicted, Cotton could face up to life in prison. In addition the family sued the police department and the police officer. The upcoming trial in Harris County District Court on criminal felony charges against Cotton began on January 25, 2010. Jury selection was scheduled to begin on May 3, 2010. The officer was found not guilty in his criminal trial in May 2010.|$|E

25|$|The {{momentum}} {{to create a}} new honour typically originates at either the Chancellery of Honours or the Department of National Defence, though private organisations or individuals may also make proposals. The chancellery <b>will</b> <b>investigate</b> whether or not the suggested honour is necessary and if it will conform within the national honours structure. Should it meet these criteria, the notion is put before the Honours Policy Committee—a group of senior public servants, formed in 1980 within the Privy Council Office—and then, if approved, is moved before the Cabinet for an Order in Council to be drawn up. On the prime minister's advice, via the governor general, the documents and drawings for the new honour are presented to the Queen for her consideration; only with her signature on the relevant letters patent and the design sketches does the new honour officially become extant. Any future amendments to the honour's appearance or award criteria do not need the monarch's approval; the governor general will perform such tasks instead.|$|E

25|$|Three {{recent studies}} by the Washington Department of Ecology showed that toxic {{chemicals}} banned decades ago continue to linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish collected from 45 sites. The toxic substances included PCBs; dioxins, two chlorinated pesticides, DDE and dieldrin, and PBDEs. As {{a result of the}} study, the department <b>will</b> <b>investigate</b> the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the Washington State Department of Health is advising the public not to eat mountain whitefish from the Wenatchee River from Leavenworth downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs. Study results also indicated high levels of contaminants in fish tissue that scientists collected from Lake Washington and the Spokane River, where fish consumption advisories are already in effect.|$|E

Among the subjects which SNCF <b>will</b> <b>investigate</b> is whether there was a dereliction of duties by an SNCF employee that resulted in the unauthorized children riding on the train. The president of SNCF has exclaimed: [...] "This is not a practice that SNCF recognizes. A test train is a test train."

500|$|Adult coconut crabs feed on fruits, nuts, seeds, and the pith {{of fallen}} trees, but will eat carrion and other organic matter opportunistically. Anything left {{unattended}} {{on the ground}} is a potential source of food which they <b>will</b> <b>investigate</b> and may carry away - thereby getting the alternative name of [...] "Robber crab." [...] The species is popularly associated with the coconut palm, yet coconuts are not a significant part of its diet. Although it lives in a burrow the crab has been filmed climbing coconut and pandanus trees. There is no film showing a crab selectively picking coconut fruit, though they might dislodge ripe fruit that otherwise would fall naturally. [...] Climbing is an immediate escape route (if too far from the burrow) to avoid predation (when young) by large sea birds, or cannibalism (at any age) by bigger, older crabs.|$|E

500|$|Doggett has Duffy's {{fingerprints}} examined, {{and finds}} that {{they belong to}} a man who died thirty years previously. Doggett contacts an old military partner, Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin) to find Duffy's real identity. Although Rohrer assures Doggett he <b>will</b> <b>investigate,</b> the agent is not convinced, believing that Duffy is a CIA agent. He confides this to Skinner, who tells him to aid Scully at the military hospital. As Scully and Hendershot sneak out of the building, they are found by Rohrer and several marines, claiming Doggett has sent them to rescue her. Scully and Hendershot are driven away, but Hendershot enters labour. The women are separated, and Scully is drugged. When she wakens, Doggett informs her that Hendershot's baby was delivered and is normal. However, Scully is convinced something is amiss, but nothing more can be done about it. In another flashback, Scully tells Mulder that her attempt at in vitro fertilization has failed, but he tells her to [...] "never give up on a miracle".|$|E
