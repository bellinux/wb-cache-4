40|$|To better {{understand}} {{the origins of the}} problems occurring during Mozzarella <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> concentration, lactose crystallization, and spray-drying steps, a physicochemical characterization was achieved. For this purpose, Mozzarella <b>cheese</b> <b>wheys</b> were sampled and their content in different compounds such as total nitrogen, noncasein nitrogen, nonprotein nitrogen, lactate, citrate, chloride, sulfate, phosphate anions, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium cations, and the sugars glucose and galactose were measured. In a second step, the results were compared with the corresponding content in Cheddar <b>cheese</b> <b>wheys,</b> Raclette <b>cheese</b> <b>wheys,</b> soft <b>cheese</b> <b>wheys,</b> and Swiss-type <b>cheese</b> <b>wheys.</b> At the end of this survey, it was shown that Mozzarella <b>cheese</b> <b>wheys</b> were more concentrated in lactate and in minerals-especially phosphate, calcium, and magnesium-than the other <b>cheese</b> <b>wheys</b> and that they contained galactose. These constituents are known to be hygroscopic. Complementary surveys are now necessary to compare the hygroscopicity of galactose and lactate and discover whether the amounts of these compounds found in Mozzarella <b>cheese</b> <b>wheys</b> are a factor in the problems encountered during the concentration, lactose crystallization, and spray-drying steps...|$|R

Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 populations in the <b>whey</b> <b>cheeses</b> at the end of the 12 degreesC storage period had grown with an increase of approx. 1. 3 log(10) cfu g(- 1) E. coli O 157 :H 7 populations in <b>whey</b> <b>cheeses</b> at the end of the 2 degreesC storage period did not grow and decreased with an approx. 2. 5 log(10) cfu g(- 1) reduction. Results showed that E. coli O 157 :H 7 can grow at 12 degreesC and survive at 2 degreesC storage in Myzithra, Anthotyros and Manouri <b>whey</b> <b>cheeses,</b> and therefore post-manufacturing contamination with this pathogen must be avoided by employing hygienic control programmes such as HACCP.

Different CWW existing treatments have also been critically analyzed. The advantages and drawbacks in aerobic/anaerobic processes have been evaluated. The benefits of physicochemical pre-stages (i. e. precipitation, coagulation–flocculation) in biological aerobic systems are assessed. Pre-treatments based on coagulation or basic precipitation might allow the application of aerobic biodegradation treatments with no dilution requirements.

40|$|Summary- Whey protein was {{concentrated}} from milk microfiltration permeate or Cheddar <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> using batch ultrafiltration and diafiltration. Permeate flux declined {{more rapidly}} for milk microfil-trate during concentration, but similar flux profiles were observed on both wheys during diafiltration. Protein contents in concentrates from milk microfiltrate and <b>cheese</b> <b>wheys</b> were respectively 95 and 74 % on a dry matter basis, while their fat contents were respectively 0. 2 and 15 %. Protein solubility of the milk microfiltrate isolate was over 95 % between pH 3 and 8, while protein solubility of <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> concentrate varied between 75 and 90 % {{over the same}} pH range. J 3 -Lactoglobulin in <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> concentrate showed ex 1 ensive structural alteration {{as evidenced by the}} low proportion of SH groups in native position. J 3 -Lactoglobulin structural alteration was less severe in protein isolated from milk microfiltrate, but still significant. Milk microfiltrate protein isolate showed better gelling properties than <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> protein concentrate. <b>Cheese</b> <b>whey</b> protein concentrate did not foam at ail, while stiff and stable foams were produced from milk microfiltrate protein isolate. Gelation and foaming were very sensitive to the ionic environment and were controlled by a balance between the pH and the calcium concentration. Reduction of calcium content in milk microfiltrate protein isolate, using saline solution during diafiltration, had only slight effects of protein functional properties...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} capsular and ropy exopolysaccharide-producing Streptococcus thermophilus starter bacteria on Mozzarella <b>cheese</b> functionality and <b>whey</b> viscosity. Mozzarella <b>cheeses</b> were manufactured with Lactobacillus helveticus LH 100 paired with one of four S. thermophilus strains: MR- 1 C, a bacterium that produces a capsular exopolysaccharide; MTC 360, a strain that secretes a ropy exopolysaccharide; TAO 61, a nonexopolysaccharide-producing commercial cheese starter; and DM 10, a nonencapsulated, exopolysaccharide-negative mutant of strain MR- 1 C. As expected, cheese moisture levels were significantly higher in Mozzarella cheeses made with exopolysaccharide-positive versus exopolysaccharide-negative streptococci, and melt properties were better in the higher moisture <b>cheeses.</b> <b>Whey</b> viscosity measurements showed that unconcentrated and ultrafiltered, fivefold concentrated <b>whey</b> from <b>cheeses</b> made with S. thermophilus MTC 360 were significantly more viscous than <b>whey</b> from <b>cheeses</b> made with MR- 1 C, TAO 61, or DM 10. No significant differences were noted between the viscosity of unconcentrated or concentrated <b>whey</b> from <b>cheeses</b> made with S. thermophilus MR- 1 C versus the industrial cheese starter TAO 61. These data indicate that encapsulated, but not ropy, exopolysaccharide-producing S. thermophilus strains can be utilized to increase the moisture level of cheese and to improve the melt properties of Mozzarella cheese without adversely affecting whey viscosity...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cheese</b> <b>whey</b> {{utilization}} is {{of major}} concern nowadays. Its high organic matter content, {{in combination with}} the high volumes produced and limited treatment options make <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> a serious environmental problem. However, the potential production of biogas (methane), hydrogen or other marketable products with a simultaneous high COD reduction through appropriate treatment proves that <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> must be considered as an energy resource rather than a pollutant. The presence of biodegradable components in the <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> coupled with the advantages of anaerobic digestion processes over other treatment methods makes anaerobic digestion an attractive and suitable treatment option. This paper intends to review the most representative applications of anaerobic treatment of <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> currently being exploited and under research. Moreover, an effort has been made to categorize the common characteristics of the various research efforts and find a comparative basis, as far as their results are concerned.

40|$|Second <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> (SCW) is a whey {{by-product}} {{resulting from}} the production of ovine <b>whey</b> <b>cheeses,</b> by thermal aggregation of proteins. It constitutes a natural source of valuable compounds, such as proteins, small peptides, oligosaccharides, lactose and minerals. In this work, ultrafiltration was used for fractionation of second <b>cheese</b> <b>whey.</b> Three commercial membranes with similar cut-off (10 kDa), made from different hydrophilic materials: RC 70 PP (cellulose regenerated acetate), ETNA 10 PP (composite fluoro polymer) and UFX 10 pHt (polysulphone permanently hydrophilic) were tested. The performance of the three membranes was studied in terms of permeate fluxes, reversible and irreversible fouling resistances, water recovery fluxes and rejection factors. Membrane RC 70 PP showed better performance, because it had the highest permeate fluxes, the lowest irreversible fouling, with good selectivity (compared with that of membrane ETNA 10 PP) and water recovery fluxes of about 100 %. The higher hydrophilicity of membrane RC 70 PP seems to justify these results...|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} {{yield of}} <b>whey</b> <b>cheese</b> is generally lower than ordinary cheese because whey does not possess as much nutrients as milk. Yield {{is dependent on}} the composition of the whey, the addition of milk or cream, the production technology and the composition (moisture content) of the final product. With efficient modern methods such as ultrafiltration, 10 to 20% of solids or more remain after the whey is mixed with cream and reduced.|$|E
5000|$|Ricotta ( [...] in Italian) is an Italian <b>whey</b> <b>cheese</b> {{made from}} sheep, cow, goat, or Italian water buffalo milk whey {{left over from}} the {{production}} of cheese. Like other whey cheeses, it is made by coagulating the proteins that remain after the casein has been used to make cheese, notably albumin and globulin. [...] Ricotta (literally meaning [...] "recooked") protein can be harvested if the whey is first allowed to become more acidic by additional fermentation (by letting it sit for 12-24 hours at room temperature). Then the acidified whey is heated to near boiling. The combination of low pH and high temperature denatures the protein and causes it to precipitate, forming a fine curd. Once cooled, it is separated by passing the liquid through a fine cloth, leaving the curd behind.|$|E
5000|$|Corsican {{traditional}} cheeses are exclusively {{made with}} sheep or goat milk. In the mid 80s, {{in the island}} were raised 150,000 sheep and 20,000 goats. [...] The most important among them is Brocciu, a <b>whey</b> <b>cheese</b> akin to ricotta (but without lactose), produced {{for the most part}} with sheep milk, sometimes with goat milk. It can be consumed either fresh or aged, and is an ingredient of innumerable Corsican dishes, from first courses up to cakes. Brocciu is the only Corsican cheese to have deserved the AOC denomination so far. Other notable cheeses are the niulincu (from Niolo, the hearth of Corsica), the balaninu (from Balagne, the north-west region), the bastilicacciu and sartinesu (respectively from Bastelica and Sartène, in southern Corsica), the cuscionu of the Zicavo valley, also in the south. The casgiu merzu ("rotten cheese") is a cheese containing insect larvae similar to the Sardinian casu marzu. Corsican cheese producers meet each year in early May at the cheese fair (A Fiera di U Casgiu) in Venaco.|$|E
50|$|Whey is used {{to produce}} <b>whey</b> <b>cheeses</b> such as ricotta, brunost, and whey butter and many other {{products}} for human consumption. The fat content of whey is low; for example 1,000 kg of whey are required to make typically 1 kg of whey butter. It is also an additive in many processed foods, including breads, crackers, and commercial pastry, and in animal feed. Whey proteins consist primarily of α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin. Depending on the method of manufacture, whey may also contain glycomacropeptides (GMP).|$|R
50|$|With both methods, the whey may be pre-concentrated {{prior to}} the further {{concentration}} or coagulation of the whey. The process may also include the addition of milk, cream, or other raw materials of milk origin before or after concentration or coagulation. Depending on the production method used, <b>whey</b> <b>cheeses</b> range from soft to hard consistencies. Fresh soft varieties contain a lot of moisture and expire quickly. Ripened hard varieties have a much lower moisture content, making them preservable for much longer.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the potential of hydrogen and subsequent methane production from raw <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> at 35 °C. The fermentative hydrogen production process from raw <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> was conducted in a continuous-type stirred tank bioreactor, operated at low hydraulic retention time (HRT; 24 h). In this stage, the carbohydrates contained in <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> are fermented to a mixture of acids and a gaseous mixture rich in hydrogen. The continuous fermentative hydrogen production was sustained by the indigenous microflora already contained in the raw <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> because the bioreactor was not seeded with any source of inoculum. At a HRT of 24 h, the hydrogen production rate was 7. 53 L of H 2 /day, while the yield of hydrogen produced was 0. 041 m 3 of H 2 /kg of chemical oxygen demand (COD) added or 2. 49 L of H 2 /L of <b>cheese</b> <b>whey.</b> The mixed liquor from this stage was further digested to biogas in a periodic anaerobic baffled reactor (PABR), a baffled-type bioreactor. The PABR was operated at HRTs of 20, 10, and 4. 4 days. The highest biogas and methane production rates were 105. 9 L of biogas/day and 75. 6 L of CH 4 /day, respectively, and were obtained at an HRT of 4. 4 days. During this stage, COD reduction reached 94 %, obtained at an HRT of 4. 4 days. Furthermore, the methane potential of the raw <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> was assessed by conducting a biochemical methane potential test. It was estimated to be 0. 31 m 3 of CH 4 /kg of COD added or 17. 9 L of CH 4 /L of <b>cheese</b> <b>whey.</b> This work demonstrated that biohydrogen production from <b>cheese</b> <b>whey</b> can be very efficiently coupled with methane production in a subsequent step, exploiting the gaseous biofuel potential of this wastewater type...|$|R
