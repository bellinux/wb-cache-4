5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} {{in the mind of}} the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E

Somerset, who had started the weekend with the potential of winning both the Gillette Cup and the John Player League, returned to their home ground in Taunton needing to avoid defeat against Essex to guarantee winning the latter competition. They lost by two runs, prompting Alan Gibson of The Times to write [...] "So we are saying, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> at the end of so many seasons, 'well tried Somerset', and no more than that." [...] Somerset returned to the final in 1979, when they beat Northamptonshire to win their first trophy. Sussex did not reach the final again until 1986, though they won the 1982 John Player League in the interim.|$|E
500|$|Plutarch’s Life of Pericles, 13.4–9, {{informs us}} “the man who {{directed}} all the projects and was overseer [...] for him [...] was Phidias... Almost everything was under his supervision, and, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> {{he was in}} charge, owing to his friendship with Perikles, {{of all the other}} artists”. The description was not architekton, the term usually given to the creative influence behind a building project, rather episkopos. But it is from this claim, the circumstantial evidence of Phidias’s known work on the Athena Parthenos and his central role in the Periclean building programme that he is attributed authorship of the frieze. The frieze consists of 378 figures and 245 animals. It was 160 meters (524ft) in length when complete, as well as 1 meter in height, and it projects 5.6cm forward at its maximum depth. It is composed of 114 blocks of an average 1.22 meters in length, depicting two parallel files in procession. It was a particular novelty of the Parthenon that the cella carries an Ionic frieze over the hexastyle pronaos rather than Doric metopes, as would have been expected of a Doric temple. Judging by the existence of regulae and guttae below the frieze on the east wall this was an innovation introduced late in the building process and replaced the ten metopes and triglyphs that might otherwise have been placed there.|$|E

30|$|In our instructions, we were {{relatively}} vague {{in relation to}} the question what the additional taxes should be used for, except that we spoke of “a large budget deficit”. We did this on purpose. First of all, the students we contacted probably knew the economic and social situation within their own country so that they had at least a rough idea about what the levy of extra taxes would serve for. Secondly, and perhaps more important within a questionnaire study, any more concrete specification about where the additional taxes would go to might have led to particular reactions which, perhaps, should be avoided. If <b>we</b> <b>had,</b> for example, mentioned that the World Bank or the EU stood behind this measure, <b>we</b> would <b>have</b> elicited reactions which would have been different from the ones <b>we</b> would <b>have</b> engendered if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> that the extra money went to the poor or again quite differently, if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> that the additional tax revenues were needed to remedy grave mistakes from past governments.|$|R

The defeat of the Piedmontese became almost inevitable from the moment Bonaparte managed to drive a wedge between the allies and obliged the Piedmontese to draw ever further from their only source of help by threatening to outflank them. It would be easy to heap the blame for this on Beaulieu, but as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> before, he was given a difficult hand to play, and if he came off second best in a contest with one of the greatest strategists in the history of war, it is not surprising.|$|E
