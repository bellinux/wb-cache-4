40|$|Different institutes and {{websites}} define plagiarism differently. But the {{one common}} notion is that plagiarism is an ethical offense {{in which one}} author closely imitates and uses ideas/thoughts of another author without giving appropriate reference. Plagiarism is an immoral act and a serious offense and has many consequences which has disturbed and damaged reputations of many authors since ancient times. The Oxford English Dictionary [5] defines plagiarism as “the action or practice of plagiarizing; the <b>wrongful</b> <b>appropriation</b> or purloining, and publication as one’s own, of the ideas, or {{the expression of the}} ideas (literary, artistic, musical, mechanical, etc.) of another”. According to Academic Integrity at MIT: A Handbook for Students [1], “plagiarism occurs when you use another’s words, ideas, assertions, data, or figures and do not acknowledge that you have done so”. Plagiarism is a crime because it is considered a theft- a theft of ideas or a theft of text. Using someone’s hard work and dedication, and passing the work as your own is what constitutes plagiarism. Unethical use of other’s work makes plagiarism a serious crime and hence is seriously condemned in every industry. In India, plagiarism evolves mainly because of unawareness. People often plagiarise, sometimes deliberately and many times unknowingly. Many people don’t know what plagiarism is and how ba...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Plagiarism is 'The <b>wrongful</b> <b>appropriation</b> or purloining and {{publication}} as one's own, of the ideas, or {{the expression of}} the ideas'. It is the most commonly committed research misconduct with the prevalence of 2 %. Its effect can be devastating and damaging to science, indicating the need to recognise and curb such an act. Methodology: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to in-training residents from all specialities in one academic hospital using the attitude towards plagiarism questionnaire. Results: A total of 221 physicians in-training participated in this study. 52. 2 % were males and 47. 5 % were females. About half of the respondents (48. 9 %) had attended a medical writing course, 45. 2 % published manuscripts and 67 % had attended courses in medical research ethics. Respondents had a mean positive attitude towards plagiarism score of 29. 56 ± 6. 81, indicating an inclination towards plagiarism. Moreover, the mean negative attitude towards plagiarism score was 26. 26 ± 3. 78, indicating the tendency towards diminished tolerance of plagiarism. Furthermore, subjective norms score showed a mean value of 24. 84 ± 5. 47, representing an inclination towards personal approval of plagiarism practice in society. No strong correlation was found between attending research ethics course and plagiarism. However, we found that having a previous publication or attending medical writing courses was significantly associated with positive leaning towards plagiarism. Conclusions: Despite having had courses in medical writing, research ethics and/or published a scientific manuscript before; we still found a positive lean towards plagiarism. This emphasises the importance of tackling such behaviour by increasing the level of awareness among trainees to avoid such misconduct...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} based on the stories of 112 Bangladeshi girls and women taken mostly to Uttar Pradesh, India, and sold as wives. In a {{practice}} that peaked between 1982 and 1993, parents allowed their daughters to leave home, as they could neither pay for their dowries nor keep them unmarried. Go-betweens sold the idea of a country having a surplus of girls to another perceiving a shortage of them, while demographic data show missing females on both sides. Many girls never paid a return visit to their natal homes and lost contact with their families. Others returned after many years to reveal that they had been sold. The readings of this practice by different actors including NGO activists, anthropologists, wife-givers and wife-takersare dis-cussed. Can marriage be built upon a trafficking event? Can marriage exonerate the evil of trafficking? The situation is clearly more complicated when girls were married to men of a religion different to their own. In such cases, exacerbating the sense of alienation and <b>wrongful</b> <b>appropriation,</b> the mismatch made return highly problematic. The article also draws an analogy with the situation of the slave-wives (bandi bou) in 19 th- and 20 th-century Bengal. This article derives from a study carried out between 2001 and 2003 of female migration across the BangladeshIndia border. It documents the case histories of 112 Bangladeshi girls/women, re-presenting roughly 10 per cent of the migrants followed up, who had been transported to north India and sold into marriage. 1 Even though the number of girls who left to get married is relatively small compared to those who migrated for work, their stories con-stitute a significant chapter in the history of gendered migration, which is important to document...|$|E
40|$|E-crimes {{continue}} to generate grave {{challenges to the}} ICT regulatory agenda. Because e-crimes involve a <b>wrongful</b> <b>appropriation</b> of information online, it is enquired whether information is property which is capable of being stolen. This then requires an investigation {{to be made of}} the law of property. The basis for this scrutiny is to establish if information is property for purposes of the law. Following a study of the Roman-Dutch law approach to property, it is argued that the emergence of an information society makes real rights in information possible. This is the position because information is one of the indispensable assets of an information society. Given the fact that information can be the object of property, its position in the law of theft is investigated. This study is followed by an examination of the conventional risks that ICTs generate. For example, a risk exists that ICTs may be used as the object of e-crimes. Furthermore, there is a risk that ICTs may become a tool in order to appropriate information unlawfully. Accordingly, the scale and impact of e-crimes is more than those of the offline crimes, for example theft or fraud. The severe challenges that ICTs pose to an information society are likely to continue if clarity is not sought regarding: whether ICTs can be regulated or not, if ICTs can be regulated, how should an ICT regulatory framework be structured? A study of the law and regulation for regulatory purposes reveals that ICTs are spheres where regulations apply or should apply. However, better regulations are appropriate in dealing with the dynamics of these technologies. Smart-regulations, meta-regulations or reflexive regulations, self-regulations and co-regulations are concepts that support better regulations. Better regulations enjoin the regulatory industries, for example the state, businesses and computer users to be involved in establishing ICT regulations. These ICT regulations should specifically be in keeping with the existing e-authentication measures. Furthermore, the codes-based theory, the Danger or Artificial Immune Systems (the AIS) theory, the Systems theory and the Good Regulator Theorem ought to inform ICT regulations. The basis for all this should be to establish a holistic approach to e-authentication. This approach must conform to the Precautionary Approach to E-Authentication or PAEA. PAEA accepts the importance of legal rules in the ICT regulatory agenda. However, it argues that flexible regulations could provide a suitable framework within which ICTs and the ICT risks are controlled. In addition, PAEA submit that a state should not be the single role-player in ICT regulations. Social norms, the market and nature or architecture of the technology to be regulated are also fundamental to the ICT regulatory agenda. JurisprudenceLL. D...|$|E
