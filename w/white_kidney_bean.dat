40|$|As {{weight gain}} and obesity have become central {{in the minds}} of the public and health {{professionals}} alike, a dizzying array of nutritional supplement options for weight loss have become available. The vast majority of the products are either untested, useless, or, in some cases, unsafe. 1 One popular method of nutritional dieting is the low-carbo-hydrate diet, which has become mainstream through the efforts of Atkins and others. The ability to reduce effective carbohydrate intake through the inhibition of amylase has been researched for over 20 years, starting with unpurifi ed <b>white</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> prod-ucts in the 1980 s 2 - 5 and more recently with purified water extracts. The central theory is that the digestion of carbohydrates begins with salivary amylase in the mouth and continues with pancreatic amylase in the gut. The ability to block these enzymes may result in a decrease in the digestion of complex carbohy-drates into mono- and disaccharides, which are then absorbed by the gut and stored in skeletal tissue and in the liver as glyco-gen or stored in adipose tissue after conversion to triglyceride...|$|E

Homogenized small intestinal mucosa, prepared from bean-fed animals, showed a 28 % increase in protein content compared with control material. Measurements of 3 H-labelled thymidine turnover indicated that mucosal cell exfoliation was increased by approximately 35 % in the small intestines of bean-fed rats compared with controls. It is concluded that though a diet rich in cooked P. vulgaris leads to some increase in mucosal cell turnover in the small intestine of rats, the consequent increase in mucosal protein loss could not account for the increased faecal-N excretion seen in these animals...|$|R

Biochem. 120, 177 — 183]. The present study was undertaken to reveal the molecular features of aAI-u, which is composed of three kinds of subunits, a, p, and y. The y-subunit, {{in contrast to the}} a- and p-subunits that are indistinguishable from the a- and p-subunits of aAI-s, was found to correspond to a subunit of an a-amylase inhibitor-like protein, which has been identified as an inactive, evolutionary intermediate between arcelin and the a-amylase inhibitor in a P. vulgaris defense protein family. The polypeptide molecular weight of aAI-u determined by the light-scattering technique, together with the polypeptide molecular weights of the subunits, suggests that aAI-u is a trimeric complex, afiy. The inhibition of aAI-u by increasing amounts of porcine pancreatic a-amylase (PPA) indi-cates that an inactive 1 : 1 complex is formed between aAI-u and PPA.

A multiple-choice test and a no-choice test were conducted to record the number of eggs laid, total developmental time, number of adults emerged, and adult longevity of C. chinensis on the five different leguminous seeds. Both choice and no-choice tests revealed cowpea seed as the most preferred oviposition substrate. Total developmental time from egg to adult stage ranged from 28 to 31 days; developmental time was shortest on the cowpea. Successful development of C. chinensis was not observed on soybean or on kidney bean. Rate of adult emergence was higher on azuki and mung bean seeds with longer adult longevity of those emerged from azuki bean and cowpea. Higher egg laying preference and shorter developmental time with longer adult longevity of the beetle on cowpea probably signifies importance of physical as well as chemical attributes of the seed as an oviposition substrate other than evolutionary history of the insect. 5 page(s...|$|E

The contents of protein, and both total and individual sugars of alkali extracted (amorphous) and citric acid extracted (bipyramidal and spheroidal) proteins from Phaseolus vulgaris (white kidney and navy) and Phaseolus lutanus (baby lima and large lima) beans were determined. The proteins were subjected to differential scanning calorimetry, and measurements of surface tension (air-water interface), surface hydrophobicity, and foam expansion. Structural analysis of the proteins were performed using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Enzymatic and chemical deglycosylation was performed on a <b>white</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> protein isolate. Glucose and mannose were the major sugars found in the isolates.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of IgE mediated food allergies has {{increased over the}} last two decades. Food allergy has been reported to be fatal in highly sensitive individuals. Legumes are important food allergens but their prevalence may vary among different populations. The present study identifies sensitization to common legumes among Indian population, characterizes allergens of <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> and establishes its cross reactivity with other legumes. METHODOLOGY: Patients (n =  355) with history of legume allergy were skin prick tested (SPT) with 10 legumes. Specific IgE (sIgE) and total IgE were estimated in sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Characterization of <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> allergens and their cross reactivity was investigated by immunobiochemical methods. Identification of major allergens of <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> was carried out by mass spectrometry. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: <b>Kidney</b> <b>bean</b> exhibited sensitization in 78 (22. 0 %) patients followed by chickpea 65 (18. 0 %) and peanut 53 (15 %). SPT positive patients depicted significantly elevated sIgE levels against different legumes (r =  0. 85, p< 0. 0001). Sera from 30 <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> sensitive individuals exhibited basophil histamine release (16 - 54 %) which significantly correlated with their SPT (r =  0. 83, p< 0. 0001) and sIgE (r =  0. 99, p< 0. 0001). <b>Kidney</b> <b>bean</b> showed eight major allergens of 58, 50, 45, 42, 40, 37, 34 and 18 kDa on immunoblot and required 67. 3 ± 2. 51 ng of homologous protein for 50 % IgE inhibition.

40|$|Abstract Background Phase 2 ® is a dietary {{supplement}} {{derived from the}} common <b>white</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris). Phase 2 {{has been shown to}} inhibit alpha-amylase, the complex carbohydrate digesting enzyme, in vitro. The inhibition of alpha-amylase may result in the lowering of the effective Glycemic Index (GI) of certain foods. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether the addition of Phase 2 would lower the GI of a commercially available high glycemic food (white bread). Methods An open-label 6 -arm crossover study was conducted with 13 randomized subjects. Standardized GI testing was performed on white bread with and without the addition of Phase 2 in capsule and powder form, each in dosages of 1500 mg, 2000 mg, and 3000 mg. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA of all seven treatment groups using unadjusted multiple comparisons (t tests) to the white bread control. Results For the capsule formulation, the 1500 mg dose had no effect on the GI and the 2000 mg and 3000 mg capsule doses caused insignificant reductions in GI. For the powder, the 1500 mg and 2000 mg doses caused insignificant reductions in the GI, and the 3000 mg dose had a significant effect (- 20. 23 or 34. 11 %, p = 0. 023) Conclusion Phase 2 white bean extract appears to be a novel and potentially effective method for reducing the GI of existing foods without modifying their ingredient profile.

Protein isolates with different microstructures (crystalline and amorphous) were prepared from four varieties of Phaseolus beans; <b>white</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> and navy bean (P. vulgaris), and large lima and baby lima beans (P. lunatus). The protein isolates were subjected to tryptic hydrolysis at various time intervals, {{and the effect of}} hydrolysis on the functional properties of the protein isolates was studied, using bovine casein as control. Reversed phase HPLC with UV detection was used to generate peptide maps of the tryptic hydrolysates, and electrospray mass spectrometry was used to characterize the peptide profile of the protein hydrolysates. There was no difference between the susceptibility of the crystalline and amorphous protein isolates to tryptic hydrolysis, however, the hydrolytic products of the crystalline isolates showed higher solubility and functional properties compared with those of the amorphous isolates. Limited hydrolysis markedly improved the functional properties of both crystalline and amorphous protein isolates. The effect of hydrolysis on the functionality of the bean protein isolates was higher compared with casein. In general the hydrolysates of the bean protein isolates showed higher functional properties than casein and its hydrolysates. Reversed phase HPLC peptide mapping of the tryptic digests and ESI/MS of the RP-HPLC fractions showed structural and compositional difference between crystalline and amorphous protein isolates prepared from the same bean variety.
