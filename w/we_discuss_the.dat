30|$|In this paper, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>the</b> discriminating {{kernel of}} the dynamic game with two targets and two players. On <b>the</b> one hand, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>the</b> discriminating kernel of a discrete-time dynamic game. Using set-valued {{analysis}} and viability theory, we computed an approximation of the viability kernel by the maximal reachable set. Then, we proposed an algorithm of the discriminating kernel. On <b>the</b> other hand, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>the</b> discriminating kernel of a differential game. We computed an underapproximation of the viability kernel by the backward reachable set from a closed target. Using the relationship of discriminating kernel and viability kernel, we proposed an algorithm of the discriminating kernel. In the future work, we will consider the calculation of the kernels of a convex polytope, an ellipsoid, and so on.|$|R
