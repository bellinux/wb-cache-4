25|$|Much wood collage art is {{considerably}} smaller in scale, framed and hung as a painting <b>would</b> <b>be.</b> <b>It</b> usually features pieces of wood, wood shavings, or scraps, assembled on a canvas (if there is painting involved), or {{on a wooden}} board.

500|$|Peter Hunt, who {{had worked}} on the five {{preceding}} films had impressed Broccoli and Saltzman enough to earn his directorial debut as they believed his quick cutting had set the style for the series; {{it was also the}} result of a long-standing promise from Broccoli and Saltzman for a directorial position. Hunt also asked for the position during the production of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and he brought along with him many crew members, including cinematographer Michael Reed. Hunt was focused on putting his mark – [...] "I wanted it to be different than any other Bond film <b>would</b> <b>be.</b> <b>It</b> was my film, not anyone else's." [...] On Her Majesty's Secret Service was the last film on which Hunt worked in the series.|$|E
500|$|In August 2015, Cornell openly said in {{interview}} with Total Guitar {{that he was}} quite eager to reunite with Audioslave: [...] "I {{think it would be}} great.

[...] Soon after, Morello said that he's interested in working with Cornell again, remembering their 2014 Seattle performance with great fondness: [...] "I love Chris and consider him a great friend. The Hall of Fame jam was nice, but a little chaotic. Playing with him in Seattle, that was just fantastic. I love that guy. He's one of the most talented vocalists in the history of vocalists. And {{to be able to play}} the songs that we wrote together, it was awesome and so much fun. I hope we do something like that again." ...|$|E
500|$|Amy Ratcliffe, {{writing for}} IGN, ranked the episode as the fifth best episode of Veronica Mars, writing, [...] "the Season 2 finale had head-twisting reveals, heartbreaking moments…tragedy, {{and so many}} jumps in crime-solving that Sherlock {{might not have been}} able to keep up." [...] BuzzFeed called the episode the best episode of the series, stating, [...] "It's {{extremely}} violent, extremely scary, and extremely moving. If you don't cry watching this episode, there's a tiny little rock where your heart should be." [...] On a similar list, TV Line ranked the episode third, only behind [...] "A Trip to the Dentist" [...] and [...] "Pilot". Give Me My Remote also ranked the episode as the best of the series, writing, [...] "If I had to pick a single episode to represent the show, this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>it.</b> The actual plot of this episode was compelling, fast-paced, and the twist at the end was shocking." [...] The reviewer went on to praise Kristen Bell's performance and the less action-heavy parts of the episode.|$|E

Club gave the episode an A− {{and noted that}} while the episode is [...] "ponderous and pretentious", {{this aspect of the}} entry turns it into [...] "a benefit". VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "here's the thing: 'Grotesque' is absolutely [...] self-serious, just as much as I feared it <b>would</b> <b>be.</b> <b>It</b> also, unquestionably, works. The reason it works is very simple: It's pretty scary". Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode a largely positive review, awarding it an 8 out of 10. He noted, [...] "Overall, this is a solid effort by Howard Gordon. It’s good {{to see some of the}} methods that earned Mulder his nickname, and the underlying dynamic between Mulder and Scully is very well played. The central premise is vague enough to fall within the confines of the unusual, if not necessarily paranormal, and the supporting cinematography and score rise to the occasion." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, and praised the themes of the episode, writing that, [...] "Because 'Grotesque' certainly surprises, and shocks, and even appals —this is the closest The X-Files ever gets to staring into the face of insanity." [...] Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised Duchovny's acting, calling it [...] "his best performance yet seen in the series". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. She referred to the episode as [...] "one of [...] darkest ever" [...] and called it [...] "a triumph for director Manners, cinematographer Bartley, and The X-Files art department." [...] Vitaris, however, was critical of the episode's closing monologue, noting that [...] " [...] spells out what the camera is saying a hundred times more effectively with its finale shot of a pairing of a gargoyle." [...] Jonathan Dunn, writing for What Culture, described [...] "Grotesque" [...] as a [...] "deep, dark, twisted psychological moment for The X-Files that I absolutely love" [...] and included it in the [...] "5 Episodes [...] That Could Be Made Into Movies" [...] list.|$|E

2500|$|Apple Valley {{was founded}} in 1969, and was {{previously}} named Lebanon Township. Orin Thompson, a real estate developer, {{was responsible for the}} city's early development. He contracted a company to determine where the next growth in the Twin Cities <b>would</b> <b>be.</b> <b>It</b> was one-half of a mile from County Road 42 and Cedar Avenue. Thompson bought the first houses and streets from the Brobacks, who built the city's first four houses. The firm that selected this area was in Apple Valley, California, so Thompson took that name for the development. An alternate explanation for the name change exists, however. According to local developer Henry Broback, Lebanon Township was renamed Apple Valley because [...] "...when you drive east on (County Road) 42 and turn to enter Lebanon, it reminded them of Apple Valley, California, which was a nice community." ...|$|E

In a conversation that reportedly lasted 45 seconds Johnson pitched the idea to Mittal, who immediately agreed to supply the steel. Mittal later said of his involvement, [...] "I never expected that this was going to be such a huge project. I thought it was just the supply of some steel, a thousand tonnes or so, and that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>it.</b> But then we started working with artists and I realised that the object was not just to supply steel but to complete the whole project. It took us almost 15 months of negotiation and discussion." [...] Johnson has said that, [...] "In reality, ArcelorMittal has given much more than the steel." ...|$|E

However, in 1988 Anita Dobson decided that she wanted to move on after three years playing Angie. She left in May 1988. Despite many alleged attempts at getting Dobson to reprise the role, she never accepted, commenting: [...] "Why tarnish the gorgeous creation that was Angie Watts?". The character of Angie Watts was subsequently killed off-screen in 2002 (dying of a drink related illness) and brought home to be buried by her on-screen daughter Sharon in order to facilitate the [...] return of the actress Letitia Dean. In 2010, Dobson said she was glad her character was killed off, as it was unrealistic that the character would ever return.|$|E

2500|$|A {{preview of}} the PlayStation version in Next Generation called it [...] "one of the best PC {{strategy}} games ever". According to a 1996 review by GameSpot, [...] "put simply, X-COM is a bona fide modern classic, standing proudly alongside Civilization and Populous as a benchmark {{in the evolution of}} strategy gaming." [...] A 1996 review of the PlayStation version by Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that [...] "any person who likes strategy games will fall in love with this title" [...] and added that [...] "if you could afford to buy one game for the PS over the next year, X-COM <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>it.</b> It has it all and then some!" [...] A reviewer for Next Generation criticized the PlayStation version for being little more than a straight port, arguing that the game could have been improved if the console's capabilities were used. However, he praised the game itself for its sophisticated, enjoyable gameplay, and concluded, [...] "X-Com was a smashing PC title, it's lost nothing of practical value in the translation, and makes a marvelous addition to the console market." [...] A rare dissenting review by GamePro stated that [...] "You have to be a major sim-freak to enjoy X-Com. It's an interesting and complex game about planet colonizing, but the extensive manuals and one-dimensional music really bore you to alien tears after a while." [...] Computer Gaming World gave it its Game of the Year award for 1994. PC Gamer US presented Enemy Unknown with its 1994 [...] "Best Strategy Game" [...] award. The editors wrote, [...] "X-COMs classic mix of action and strategy will have you hooked for hours, and made this one of the finest games of the year." ...|$|E
