These vectors create the zonohedron <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> the zonohedrification {{of the original}} polyhedron.

The two triangular regions of a cross-quadrilateral (like a figure 8) have opposite-signed densities, and adding their areas together can give a total area of zero for the whole figure.|$|E
