The earliest human dispersal in {{the region}} around Lake Tauca occurred {{towards the end of}} the Ticaña phase, with the Coipasa phase coinciding with the definitive establishment of humans {{in the region}}. In the Atacama area, the end of the paleolake phase coinciding with Lake Tauca was accompanied by the end of the first phase of human settlement. Some fossil <b>water</b> <b>reserves</b> in the dry Andes formed during the Tauca phase. Lake Tauca may have supplied water to the Rio de la Plata region, sustaining life there during dry periods.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenge}} to world conscience {{was provided by}} an influential 1968 article by Garrett Hardin that critically analyzed the dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest (and, he claimed, the apparently low 'survival-of-the-fittest' value of conscience-led actions) ultimately destroy a shared limited resource, even though each acknowledges such an outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density (and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed), created controversy additionally through his direct deprecation {{of the role of}} conscience in achieving individual decisions, policies and laws that facilitate global justice and peace, as well as sustainability and sustainable development of world commons areas, for example including those officially designated such under United Nations treaties (see common heritage of humanity). Areas designated common heritage of humanity under international law include the Moon, Outer Space, deep sea bed, Antarctica, the world cultural and natural heritage (see World Heritage Convention) and the human genome. It will be a significant challenge for world conscience that as world oil, coal, mineral, timber, agricultural and <b>water</b> <b>reserves</b> are depleted, there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit common heritage of mankind areas.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{conditions}} {{occurred in}} parts of the other eastern islands. Along the southern shore of Sal, Fred's storm surge sunk or stranded dozens of vessels and destroyed the island's main tourist pier in Santa Maria. Pier restoration was incomplete as of May2017, about 2.5years after the hurricane; the delay led to concerns over the island's precarious, tourism-reliant economy. Hotels, restaurants, and beach facilities were flooded, and roads in the town became impassable. Gusts leveled the roof of a high school gym, which had initially been set up as a storm shelter to 100citizens. Elsewhere on the island, the winds knocked out power to homes in Palmeira, and caused minor structural damage to Sal International Airport. At the height of the hurricane, flooding forced nearly 130people living in the impoverished outskirts of Terra Boa and Espargos to relocate to shelters. Fred destroyed 80percent of the Loggerhead sea turtle nests on the beaches of Sal, a crucial nesting site for this species. Overall, Sal suffered CVE$30million ($300,000) in damage from the hurricane. The storm's outer bands dropped heavy rain on the islands of Santiago and Fogo, peaking at 13in (330mm) over the mountains of Santiago and causing widespread damage to roads, sidewalks, and walls. In São Miguel, flood waters and fallen trees led to major traffic obstructions. Conversely, the rains replenished <b>water</b> <b>reserves</b> and filled a large dam in São Salvador do Mundo to maximum capacity, irrigating adjacent arable lands. Structural damage across Santiago, largely in flooded urban areas, reached CVE$87million ($860,000).|$|E

5|$|The target {{chosen for}} the {{operation}} was a fresh-water aqueduct near Calitri in southern Italy, which supplied water to {{a large portion of}} the Italian population as well as several ports used by the Italian military; it was also hoped that its destruction would hamper Italian military efforts in North Africa and Albania. The airborne troops were delivered by converted Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bombers to the target on 10 February, but equipment failures and navigational errors meant that a significant portion of the troops explosives, and a team of Royal Engineer sappers, landed in the wrong area. Despite this setback the remaining members of the troop successfully destroyed the aqueduct and withdrew from the area, but were all captured by the Italian authorities within a short time; an Italian translator was tortured and executed and one paratrooper managed to escape captivity, but the rest remained as prisoners of war. The aqueduct was rapidly repaired before local <b>water</b> <b>reserves</b> ran out, ensuring that the local population and the ports were not deprived of water, and, consequently, that the Italian war efforts were not hampered. However, it served as a morale boost for the fledgling airborne establishment, and the technical and operational lessons learnt from the operation helped the development of further airborne operations.|$|E

40|$|Pragmatic {{assessment}} of the <b>water</b> <b>reserve</b> of the forest sites and mapping at the regional scale (Wallonia, Belgium). The {{assessment of}} the forest sites water availability constitutes a growing concern following the awareness of {{the potential impact of}} climate change on the soil moisture regime. At the present time, the forest managers lack tools for a quantitative estimation of the soil <b>water</b> <b>reserve.</b> This paper presents a simple estimation method that can be adopted on field by foresters. A map of this soil <b>water</b> <b>reserve</b> at the forest site scale has been established for the Southern Belgium. After the inventory of the possible techniques, the "textural method", based on the pedotransfert classes of Jamagne et al. (1977), has been used. The soil profiles from the Aardewerk database have eased the translation of the Jamagne et al. (1977) 's results in the Belgian textural system. Moreover, the geodatabase of the Digital Soil Map of Wallonia (DSMW), through the typology of the major soil types, has been used as mapping support of the <b>water</b> <b>reserve</b> at the regional scale. Like a first attempt of validation, the result has been compared with the bioindicator character of forest understory vegetation. The regression results show a significant relationship between the soil <b>water</b> <b>reserve</b> and the vegetation estimate, but they also indicate that the <b>water</b> <b>reserve</b> does not explain alone the moisture level expressed by the flora. It emerges that the characterization of the Walloon parent materials will constitute an undeniable support {{for the development of the}} proposed method, the transposition of foreign results leading to some bias. The use prospects of this thematic map are multiple: integration as inputs for the autecological modelling, {{assessment of the}} moisture regime for the water availability of forest sites and building of sites catalogs; as many tools to guide forest managers in their planning measures...|$|R

25|$|Bushfires {{severely}} harmed {{the vegetation}} of the Cotter River Catchment and caused water quality {{problems in the}} three dams in the catchment: Corin, Bendora and Cotter Dams. For quite some time after the fires, turbidity in the water due to silt and ash from surrounding burnt-out forests meant Canberra {{had to rely on}} Googong Dam on the Queanbeyan River, which was not affected by the fires. Given the drought and existing water shortages, this effectively reduced Canberra's <b>water</b> <b>reserves</b> to around 15% for some time. An upgrade to the Stromlo Water Treatment Plant was subsequently required to allow extra filtration of water to cope with the diminished quality in the future.|$|E

25|$|The Ogallala aquifer, or the High Plains aquifer, is an {{integral}} fresh water source for {{the entirety of the}} Great Plains region, providing drinking water to 80% of the population and irrigating 13 million acres of land. Precipitation, seasonal lakes, and prehistoric <b>water</b> <b>reserves</b> serve as sources of water for the aquifer, which lies beneath 174,000 square miles of the Central and Southern regions, contains 3.25 billion acre-feet of water, and which is used by around 200,000 irrigation wells. Around 95% of the water pumped out of the aquifer is used for irrigation for the extensive areas of farmland in the Great Plains. The playa lakes, or seasonal lakes, are the primary sources of recharge for the aquifer, with an average of 0.5 inches per year as the recharge rate for the entire High Plains region. Population, agricultural, and economic growth have increased the demand for water in the areas that rely on the aquifer, causing the average level of water in the aquifer to drop by 13 feet since 1950.|$|E
500|$|All {{utilities}} except electricity {{are managed}} by Komunalno poduzeće Zaprešić (...) [...] Zaprešić's electricity is, {{as in the}} rest of Croatia, provided by Hrvatska elektroprivreda, and distributed by Elektra Zagreb, a company managing access to electricity in Zagreb, and Zagreb County. Zaprešić receives tap water from underground <b>water</b> <b>reserves</b> through a water pump in the settlement of Šibice. The water from the water pump is of drinking quality. However, local factories Pliva, and Kvasac produce waste water, which is released into the Sava River through the Harmica-Pliva-Zaprešić water treatment plant. Before the construction of the treatment plant, the polluted water was piped into the Gorjak Creek, endangering the tap water quality. Possible consequences of releasing waste water into the Sava will be dealt with by the construction of the Zajarki water purification system for screening the used water. The ecological problem is multiplied {{by the fact that the}} utility company received only 400 requests to clean septic tanks in 2007, although most households in the relatively rural surroundings of Zaprešić use septic systems. There are plans of constructing four hydroelectric power plants around Zagreb with one being in Zaprešić (HE Zaprešić, also known as HE Podsused) as a part of a system of exploiting natural resources of the Sava River.|$|E
