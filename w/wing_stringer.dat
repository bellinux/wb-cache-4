40|$|Report: In the {{aerospace}} industries significant research {{effort has been}} concentrated on weight saving and innovative design options for the future generation very large aircraft [1]. Welding {{has been identified as}} one of the potential and cost effective alternative to mechanical fastening for fabrication of structural components including <b>wing</b> skin <b>stringer</b> panels. However the use of welding instead of mechanical fastening could lead to the formation of a variable distribution residual stress field with changed grain size and microstructural features. Therefore, before implementation of such process change the effect of residual stress distribution and changed microstructure on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour needs to be ascertained for damage tolerant design of safety critical aircraft structural members. In the previous experiments (Experiment no. ME 281, ME 515 and ME 516) we determined the residual strain distribution in the two in-plane principal strain directions for AA 2024 and AA 7150 used in the lower and upper <b>wing</b> sking <b>stringer</b> assemblies respectively. Two candidate weld processes, the Metal Inert Gas (MIG) and the Variable Polarity Plasma Arc (VPPA) welding processes were studied. The strain distributions in the longitudinal and transverse strain directions of the AA 2024 -T 351 were carried out in the as-welded coupon sample of dimension 240 x 280 x 12. 5 mm 3 (VPPA welds) and 186 x 285 x 12. 5 mm 3 (MIG welds). Strains from the two principal in...|$|R

In this paper, structural optimization has been harnessed to improve the design of a structure by minimising the weight but not compromising on the performance of the component.

40|$|The {{demand for}} more {{efficient}} and lighter structural components has shifted focus to formal optimization techniques in order to change the structure&# 039;s topology automatically to achieve a given objective; for example, minimizing {{the weight of the}} structure without compromising on its performance. This paper explores the concepts for structural optimization employed in design improvement using the shape optimization technique. Shape optimization software has been successfully employed to optimize an aircraft <b>wing</b> structure, comprising <b>stringers</b> and skins to model structural parts. The mathematical methods of structural optimization are presented. A sensitivity analysis precedes the optimization process of the stringer-skin structure. The stringers are repositioned on the skin while maintaining a smooth shape after the optimization process. It was found that the performance of the structure improved. Shape optimization can enable weight savings as well as long term cost benefits, while ensuring that the component is structurally sound and can be commercially manufactured...|$|R
40|$|The product {{development}} cycles {{in all parts}} of the industry become increasingly shorter. In spite of the shorter cycle time, the performance of a new product generation must be increased. In the early design process, simulation tools are used to create a large number of designs and to evaluate their performance. To reduce the effort for modeling and structure evaluation, a design environment for thin-walled lightweight structures (DELiS) with the focus on structure mechanics has been developed. The core of DELiS is a parametric model generator which creates models of lightweight thin-walled structures. It has been developed initially for the aircraft pre design process. Furthermore, due to its flexibility and the use of synergies to aircraft wings, wind turbine blades can also be generated with DELiS. Based on the same abstract database, it is possible to create models with variable level of detail. Exemplarily wings can be modeled as simplified beam, or in a fine <b>wing</b> model, <b>stringers</b> can be created using beam elements or smeared as an extra shell layer. With the support of several com-mercial finite element (FE) solvers many other applications can be used, such as sizing tools that require a specific FE solver. Thus, DELiS facilitates interfaces to these sizing tools. So forth it includes the modeling, the simulation and the evaluation process. Based on Python programming language it is platform independent and can access most major libraries. The structural description of a database is interpreted and transferred in an abstract object oriented data model. Therefore, new interfaces can be added conveniently, FE models can be derived smoothly and sizing results can be used to update the model easily. DELiS utilizes the common aircraft language CPACS (Common Parametric Aircraft Configuration Scheme) as input database for the model generation. It is developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and allows the exchange of data between all disciplines in the aircraft design pro-cess. By interpreting this multidisciplinary aircraft language, all disciplines of the aircraft design process are able to communicate with the structural model in such problems. When searching for the game changing configuration of aircrafts or wind turbine blades, a wide design space must be supported. This design space consists of global (e. g. different configurations) as well as local (e. g. subcomponent properties) degrees of freedom. Thus, a modular and parametric design environment is advantageous. The paper shows the program architecture and the methodology of DELiS that enable the required variability. Examples of the model generation are given and the flexibility with respect to sizing tools is pointed out...|$|R
