40|$|This Note reviews Montejo v. Louisiana (2009) and {{discusses}} its implications on Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, particularly related to post-arraignment <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> defendant’s <b>right</b> to counsel at a police-initiated interrogation. Montejo’s appeal relied upon a bright-line rule (Jackson rule) established 26 years before, which makes post-arraignment <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> defendant’s <b>right</b> to counsel at a police-initiated interrogation presumptively invalid. In Montejo, the Supreme Court {{did away with}} the Jackson rule, while allowing that a state may continue {{to adhere to the}} Jackson rule under its state constitution. The Author finds that historically the right to counsel in Massachusetts demonstrates the Commonwealth’s longstanding record of being proactive in both affording indigent criminal defendants the right to counsel before the Supreme Court and expanding the right to counsel when the Supreme Court has limited it. While Montejo has affected “a sea change in the law,” the Author argues that following the Supreme Court’s holding in Montejo would degrade the right to counsel and Massachusetts courts should continue the prohibition that is in place forbidding police-initiated interrogations of represented defendants. Further, adherence by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to pre-Montejo law would continue to provide a bright-line, workable rule thereby ensuring that the protections afforded by Article 12 do not become mere abstractions...|$|R
25|$|Instead of {{responding}} to his complaint, Hayden Stone sought a stay pending the outcome <b>of</b> arbitration, per <b>a</b> clause in Wilko's customer agreement mandating that both parties use that method of dispute resolution.

50|$|A non-variation clause does {{sometimes}} have unacceptable consequences, and its application is limited. It is restrictively interpreted, because it limits {{the principle of}} freedom of contract. Cancellation of the contract and certain forms <b>of</b> <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> (e.g. <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accrued <b>right</b> arising from <b>a</b> breach <b>of</b> contract, datio in solutum, release of the debtor, and a pactum de non petendo) do not amount to variations. A non-variation clause is not enforced where its enforcement is against public policy or where estoppel can be raised. Neither defence has successfully been raised on the facts in any reported case.|$|R
2500|$|Should {{that issue}} {{actually}} arise {{in a future}} case, Blackmun observed, the proper time to raise it was not prior to the arbitration but afterwards, when the court {{would be asked to}} enforce the award.

Under the Court's analysis, the question turned on whether the employer provided minimally sufficient notice of the contractual nature of the e-mailed policy and <b>of</b> the concomitant <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employee's <b>right</b> to access <b>a</b> judicial forum. The Court weighed the attendant circumstances; concluded that the notice was wanting and that, therefore, enforcement <b>of</b> the <b>waiver</b> would be inappropriate; and upheld the district court's denial of the employer's motion to stay proceedings and compel the employee to submit his claim to arbitration.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{whatever}} debates continue to stew regarding {{the true meaning}} of Lawrence v. Texas, at the very least, Lawrence represents the recognition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> individual 2 ̆ 7 s heightened interest in decisional non-interference in private affairs. This is an important constitutional development since a problem under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions only arises when the government offers a benefit, like government employment, conditioned on the <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> preferred constitutional <b>right.</b> Thus, <b>a</b> government employer, post-Lawrence, should be prohibited, under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, from firing a government employee who exercises her rights to decisional non-interference in private affairs. However, the current protections for public employee speech rights under the Connick/Pickering analysis do not adequately safeguard these emerging rights to decisional non-interference. The proposed modified Pickering test discards the unnecessary 2 ̆ 2 public concern test 2 ̆ 2 for these post-Lawrence substantive due process cases and, in the first instance, balances the employee 2 ̆ 7 s right to decisional non-interference in private affairs against the government 2 ̆ 7 s interest in operating an efficient governmental service for the public. The upshot, and a much neglected aspect of Lawrence, is that over 21 million federal, state, and local United States 2 ̆ 7 employees will enjoy <b>a</b> significant expansion <b>of</b> their rights to be free from arbitrary and capricious government employer interference in their personal and private lives (especially in matters pertaining to sex) ...|$|R
40|$|A presente dissertação tem por objetivo a análise dos acordos homologados pela Justiça do Trabalho em dissídios individuais na fase de conhecimento. Essa análise foi empreendida dentro do contexto socioeconômico atual: acirrada competitividade interempresarial, altas taxas de desemprego e poucos mecanismos de proteção efetiva ao emprego. Verificou-se que esses acordos implicam, em parte, renúncias de direitos trabalhistas e, em parte, autênticas transações. Discutiram-se os limites que renúncia e transação possuem na esfera trabalhista. A partir dessa discussão, analisou-se a interferência negativa dos acordos trabalhistas, nos moldes em que vêm sendo realizados, na eficácia do Direito do Trabalho. Para enriquecer esse estudo, foi empreendida pesquisa de campo que teve por objeto a análise de cento e oitenta acordos (noventa acordos em audiência inicial e noventa acordos firmados após a instrução do processo, mas antes da sentença) homologados na Justiça do Trabalho da 2 a Região, nas noventa Varas do Trabalho do Fórum Rui Barbosa. Essa pesquisa teve por objetivo verificar como ocorre o procedimento conciliatório na Justiça do Trabalho, observar a conduta do juiz e das partes e, especialmente, o conteúdo do acordo. Foi conduzida outra pesquisa com reclamantes e reclamadas, para aferir aspectos subjetivos relacionados aos acordos: condição socioeconômica das partes, contentamento (pacificação social) e outras questões subjetivas relacionadas ao acordo firmado. Por fim, apontaram-se mecanismos externos e internos ao processo judicial, capazes de promover, incentivar e, em certa medida, até mesmo garantir a homologação de acordos justos na Justiça do Trabalho. The present dissertationś {{objective}} is {{the analysis of}} individual bargaining agreements entered into early in the negotiation process that are subsequently homologated by the Labor Court. This analysis was conducted within the present socioeconomic context: fierce competition between companies, high unemployment rates and few effective mechanisms protecting the employee. It was determined that these agreements represent, in part, <b>a</b> <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> individuals <b>rights</b> under the labor laws and, in part, authentic transactions. There was <b>a</b> discussion <b>of</b> the bondaries of the former and latter {{in the realm of}} labor law. From this discussion, there was <b>an</b> assessment <b>of</b> the negative impact of labor agreements, in how they are consummated, in implementing labor law norms. To ensure the study was comprehensive, field research was conducted analyzing one hundred and eighty agreements (ninety of which were consummated at the first hearing and ninety of which were consummated after the fact-finding stage, but before the sentence) homologated at the Labor Circuit of the 2 nd Region, at ninety Labor Courts of the Rui Barbosa Tribunal. The objective of this research was threefold: to understand how the parties come to an agreement at the Labor Court, to observe the judgeś and partiesś conduct and, especially, to analyse the content of the agreement. Another study was conducted with complainants and defendants, to compare subjective aspects related to the agreements: the socioeconomic status of the parties, the degree of satisfaction with the agreement, and other subjective factors related to the final agreement. Finally, mechanisms were recommended, both external and internal to the judicial process, capable of promoting, encouraging and, to a certain extent, ensuring the homologation of fair agreements at the Labor Court...|$|R

5000|$|The second element, {{that the}} {{landlord}} {{knew of the}} handicap or should have known <b>of</b> it, places <b>an</b> affirmative burden on the tenant to request the reasonable accommodation, such as <b>a</b> <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "no pets" [...] policy for an emotional support animal. A tenant wishing to obtain <b>a</b> <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "no pets" [...] policy for an emotional support animal may meet this burden by providing a letter {{from his or her}} physician or mental health professional: stating that the tenant has a mental disability, explaining that the animal is needed to lessen the effects of the disability, and requesting that the animal be allowed in the rental unit as a reasonable accommodation for the mental disability. Landlords are entitled to ask for supporting materials which document the need for anemotional support animal. Mere emotional distress that would result from having to give up <b>an</b> animal because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "no pets" [...] policy will not qualify under federal law. Instead, there must be a link, or a nexus, between the animal and the disability. The nexus between the animal and the disability is analyzed under the third element <b>of</b> <b>an</b> FHAA housing discrimination case, known as the necessity requirement, and requires that the accommodation will affirmatively enhance a disabled tenant's quality of life by ameliorating the effects of the disability. So long as the requested accommodation does not constitute an undue financial or administrative burden for the landlord, or fundamentally alter the nature of the housing, the landlord must provide the accommodation.|$|R

Persons with disabilities may request a reasonable accommodation, such as <b>a</b> <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "no pets policy", for any assistance animal, including an emotional support animal, under both the FHAA and Section 504.|$|R

This annual event showcases the research projects funded through the Acquisition Research Program at the Graduate School of Business and Public Policy at the Naval Postgraduate School. Featuring keynote speakers, plenary panels, multiple panel sessions, a student research poster show and social events, the Annual Acquisition Research Symposium offers a candid environment where high-ranking Department of Defense (DoD) officials, industry officials, accomplished faculty and military students are encouraged to collaborate on finding applicable solutions to the challenges facing acquisition policies and processes within the DoD today. By jointly and publicly questioning the norms of industry and academia, the resulting research benefits from myriad perspectives and collaborations which can identify better solutions and practices in acquisition, contract, financial, logistics and program management.

One reason is that the public perceives that the government too rigidly enforces laws and regulations or that favoritism or bias influences decisions to make exceptions or <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> rules. Although observed in various contexts, such perception is particularly evident in government contracting and procurement. This perception can erode the public confidence in government; thus, improving the public's perception is paramount. An approach to this perception problem involves instilling objectivity in a government decision to make <b>an</b> exception or <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> procurement rule or regulation. Analytical techniques can be used to evaluate the decision of whether or not to waive a particular procurement rule or regulation. Granted, a waiver may be unnecessary in exigent circumstances (where life or health is in imminent danger) because procurements under such exigent circumstances are often exempt from application of procurement rules. Yet, absent such exigent circumstances, <b>a</b> <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular regulation may require a formal exception by an administrative body, an executive, a court-issued injunction, or even legislation...|$|R
