500|$|Beginning in late 1880, {{letters from}} Pedro II to the Countess of Barral reveal a man grown world-weary {{with age and}} having an {{increasingly}} alienated and pessimistic outlook. In them he frequently expresses [...] "his loneliness and his desire to escape into her company." [...] The Emperor entertained a fantasy of leaving everything behind and realizing his cherished ambition of taking up a life in Europe, as he expressed it: [...] "and I, were I to enjoy my total independence, <b>where</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> be? Guess." [...] This strong desire to retire to a less circumscribed life abroad was a constant presence throughout the 1880s. Despite the dichotomy between reverie and reality, he remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the Imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm.|$|E

I told {{them back to the}} 'Tombs.' I knew no other place. 'But where are your friends?' said they. 'I have none.' So they put me into a hand-barrow with an awning to it, and wheeled me down to the dock and on board a boat, and away to Blackwell's Island to the Corporation Hospital. There I got worse--got pretty much as you see me now. Couldn't cure me. After three years, I grew sick of lying in a grated iron bed {{alongside}} of groaning thieves and mouldering burglars. They gave me five silver dollars, and these crutches, and I hobbled off. I had an only brother who went to Indiana, years ago. I begged about, to make up a sum to go to him; got to Indiana at last, and they directed me to his grave. It was on a great plain, in a log-church yard with a stump fence, the old gray roots sticking all ways like moose-antlers. The bier, set over the grave, it being the last dug, was of green hickory; bark on, and green twigs sprouting from it. Some one had planted a bunch of violets on the mound, but it was a poor soil (always choose the poorest soils for grave-yards), and they were all dried to tinder. I was going to sit and rest myself on the bier and think about my brother in heaven, but the bier broke down, the legs being only tacked. So, after driving some hogs out of the yard that were rooting there, I came away, and, not to make too long a story of it, here I am, drifting down stream like any other bit of wreck." ...|$|E
