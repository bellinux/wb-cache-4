5|$|Adopted {{children}} are children that were given up at birth, abandoned or {{were unable to}} be cared for by their biological parents. They may have been put into foster care before finding their permanent residence. It is particularly hard for adopted children to get adopted from foster care: 50,000 children were adopted in 2001. The average age of these children was 7, <b>which</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> fewer older children were adopted.|$|E
5|$|The record shows, {{that for}} nearly thirty years, {{elements}} of the U.S. Department of Justice {{have been engaged in}} world-wide political targeting of me and my associates. This includes early 1970s operations run in conjunction with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's U.S. State Department. During the last ten years or so of that period, some U.S. officials, and others, have challenged the relevant agencies with some of the evidence <b>which</b> <b>shows,</b> <b>that</b> those prosecutions and correlated harassment of me and my associates, had been clearly fraudulent, politically motivated targeting.|$|E
5|$|Single-celled {{microorganisms}} {{were the}} first forms of life to develop on Earth, approximately 3–4 billion years ago. Further evolution was slow, and for about 3 billion years in the Precambrian eon, (much {{of the history of}} life on Earth), all organisms were microorganisms. Bacteria, algae and fungi have been identified in amber that is 220 million years old, <b>which</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the morphology of microorganisms has changed little since the Triassic period. The newly discovered biological role played by nickel, however — especially that brought about by volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps — may have accelerated the evolution of methanogens {{towards the end of the}} Permian–Triassic extinction event.|$|E

SpongeBob then shows Mr. Krabs the highway's blueprint, <b>which</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the highway with concrete columns will run over the Krusty Krab and end directly at the Chum Bucket, revealing that Plankton {{is responsible for the}} highway's development. Mr. Krabs is outraged at this revelation and decides to support SpongeBob. They both go to the Chum Bucket and ask Plankton to not develop the highway, but he states {{that the rest of the}} town has already unanimously voted to build the highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for applying for {{an order for}} review of detention differs from that for obtaining a mandatory order, prohibiting order or quashing order because the latter orders are only available by leave of court, whereas an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court. The {{procedure for}} doing so is set out in Order 54 of the Rules of Court. An application {{must be made to}} the High Court by way of an ex parte originating summons, supported, if possible, by an affidavit from the person being restrained <b>which</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the application is being made at his or her instance and explaining the nature of the restraint. If the person under restraint is unable to personally make an affidavit, someone may do so on his or her behalf, explaining the reason for the inability.|$|E
5|$|The town's {{coat of arms}} {{depicts the}} old castle that used {{to stand on the}} site of the former prison. The royal purple {{background}} represents Dorchester's status as part of the monarch's private estate, a position held since before the Domesday Book was published. The shield is divided into quarters, two depicting lions and two fleur-de-lis. These are copied from the shields of the troops from Dorset who took part in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The fleur-de-lis have a scattered arrangement <b>which</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> permission for the armorial bearings was given before 1405, after which date the rights were varied by King Henry VI. The inscription 'Sigillum Bailivorum Dorcestre' translates as 'Seal of the Bailiffs of Dorchester'. The mayor has a similar seal of office, but this has the inscription ' Dorcestriensis Sig : Maioris'.|$|E

RTÉ would not produce another sitcom until the mid-1990s, while being criticized for not commissioning another series that featured a Parish Priest Housekeeper.|$|E
25|$|Polyhedral cones play {{a central}} role in the {{representation}} theory of polyhedra. For instance, the decomposition theorem for polyhedra states that every polyhedron can be written as the Minkowski sum of a convex polytope and a polyhedral cone. Polyhedral cones also play an important part in proving the related Finite Basis Theorem for polytopes <b>which</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> every polytope is a polyhedron and every bounded polyhedron is a polytope.|$|E
