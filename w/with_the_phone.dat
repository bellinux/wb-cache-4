25|$|The iPhonenbsp&5C {{received}} generally mixed reviews, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> itself being {{regarded as}} solid, but the polycarbonate shell being considered a downgrade that lacked a 'premium' look and feel, {{compared to the}} aluminum bodies of the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S.|$|E
25|$|Haughey's {{leadership}} {{came under}} scrutiny {{for a third}} time when a report linked Haughey <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> tapping of political journalists. In spite of huge pressure Haughey refused to resign and survived yet another vote of no-confidence in early 1983, albeit with a smaller majority. Haughey's success was partly due to the death of the Fianna FÃ¡il TD Clement Coughlan, a supporter of O'Malley. Haughey's supporters managed to have the meeting moved to the following week after the funeral, which gave him more time to manoeuver. Having failed three times to oust Haughey, most of his critics gave up and returned to normal politics.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the first}} 35 minutes, there were {{technical}} difficulties with the Fort Worth TV relay {{as well as}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> link MacNeil was using to report from the hospital. When the coverage began, McGee was waiting for MacNeil to call in with information. While Ryan and Huntley were recounting the information, McGee got MacNeil {{on the line and}} told him to recount chronologically what happened. However, NBC was using a studio that wasn't equipped to patch calls through to the air and thus only McGee could hear MacNeil. While the studio crew worked on a solution, McGee improvised and told MacNeil to relay the information in fragments, which he would then repeat for the audience. While they were talking, Huntley was handed a speaker from off camera and took the receiver from McGee so he could attach it to the earpiece, this enabling MacNeil to be heard. However, by that time there was no further information to report; MacNeil had a medical student from Parkland hold the phone line for him so that he could return to the emergency ward for the latest developments.|$|E
