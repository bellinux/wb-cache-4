[...] On the return flight from South America, the automatic valve for gas cell 3 stuck open. [...] Gas was transferred from other cells through an inflation line. It was never understood why the valve stuck open, and subsequently the crew only used the hand-operated maneuvering valves for cells 2 and 3. 38 hours after departure, one of the airship's four Daimler-Benz 16-cylinder diesel engines [...] (engine car no. 4, the forward port engine) suffered a <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> breakage, damaging the piston and cylinder. Repairs were started immediately and the engine functioned on fifteen cylinders {{for the remainder of}} the flight. Four hours after engine 4 failed, engine no. 2 (aft port) was shut down, as one of two bearing cap bolts for the engine failed and the cap fell into the crank case. The cap was removed and the engine was run again, but when the ship was off Cape Juby the second cap broke and the engine was shut down again. The engine was not run again to prevent further damage. [...] With three engines operating at a speed of [...] and headwinds reported over the English Channel, the crew raised the airship in search of counter-trade winds usually found above , well beyond the airship's pressure altitude.

50|$|Under ideal {{engineering}} conditions, {{force is}} applied directly {{in the line of}} travel of the assembly. The sinusoidal motion, cosinusoidal velocity, and sinusoidal acceleration (assuming constant angular velocity) result in smoother operation. The higher percentage of time spent at top dead centre (dwell) improves theoretical engine efficiency of constant volume combustion cycles. It allows the elimination of joints typically served by a <b>wrist</b> <b>pin,</b> and near elimination of piston skirts and cylinder scuffing, as side loading of piston due to sine of connecting rod angle is mitigated. The longer the distance between the piston and the yoke, the less wear that occurs, but greater the inertia, making such increases in the piston rod length realistically only suitable for lower RPM (but higher torque) applications.|$|E
50|$|Finally, in 1993 Ford made {{available}} a turbocharged {{edition of the}} 7.3L. An internally wastegated, AR.82 Garrett T3 series turbo {{was used as the}} OEM for the factory turbocharger system. The system was tuned to minimize performance loss at high elevation, rather than to improve peak performance. A primary limiting factor to the performance potential of the engine is an incredibly restrictive stock down-pipe. It is commonly believed, but not officially verified, that this is deliberate and due to Ford's impending release of the T444E (Powerstroke) engine. Factory turbo vehicles received numerous additional improvements. Pistons had an enlarged primary compression ring, added intermediate ring, an enlarged ring land and <b>wrist</b> <b>pin,</b> as well as an anodized piston face. Other improvements included tweaks to the injection pump, and an upgraded oil-coolant heat exchanger.|$|E
40|$|Compressors {{are being}} {{required}} to operate at increasingly severe conditions {{in order to increase}} efficiency, and with the transition from CFC to HFC and natural refrigerants, natural ferrous chloride layers on iron surfaces have been eliminated. To recover lost wear resistance with the transition to oil-less operation, greater protection is sought through the application of hard coatings with enhanced tribological properties. Controlled shoe-on-disk experiments simulating the interface in a swashplate compressor were performed using a High Pressure Tribometer under unlubricated conditions. Specimens used for these experiments included 52100 steel shoes and coated aluminum A 390 -T 6 disks. Coatings were provided by two leading manufacturers and consisted of two different single layer WC/C coatings (one from each manufacturer), multi-layer WC/C + DLC and multi-layer TiAlN + WC/C. To help increase load bearing ability on the relatively soft aluminum, a CrN underlayer was deposited on half of the disks. The performance of the coatings was evaluated using surface profilometry and scanning electron microscopy. In some cases, the CrN underlayer increased friction due to increased roughness, while it also significantly increased the load bearing capability in most applications. One of the CrN + WC/C multilayered coatings exhibited friction coefficients similar to lubricated experiments with scuffing loads roughly ten times larger than uncoated, unlubricated tests. Controlled, reciprocating pin-on-disk experiments imitating the wrist pin-connecting rod interface were also performed under unlubricated conditions. Specimens used for these experiments included coated, cylindrical 52100 steel <b>wrist</b> <b>pins</b> and uncoated cast iron disks. Coatings used were the same as those for the swashplate simulation tests but without the CrN underlayer. Analysis of experiments investigating temperature effects, frequency variation, and performance in various refrigerants including R 134 a, R 410 a, and R 600 a, was completed using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis, and surface profilometry. It was found that steady-state friction coefficients decreased with increasing temperature while friction coefficients increased during the running-in period. Also, wear decreased from testing in room temperature up to 80 ??C and beyond that, increased due to unstable running-in. Tests conducted in R 410 a produced the lowest wear, while those in R 600 a had the lowest friction coefficients. Tests in R 134 a performed the worst, but better than tests conducted in dry nitrogen. Based on the research presented in this work, hard coatings have the potential to replace oil in future compressors. Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Project 17...|$|R
40|$|Background: External fixator is anappropriate {{device for}} the {{treatment}} of comminuted distal radius fractures, but there is no consensus about simultaneous supplementary percutaneous pinning. The present study was conducted to determine the short-term outcomes of comminuted distal radius fracture treated by close reduction and external fixation with and without supplementary pinning. Methods: This prospective study was carried out on 62 patients with distal radius fracture type III. All consecutive patients were treated by close reduction and External Fixator (EXF) (N= 30) and close reduction, External Fixator (EXF) with supplemental percutaneous pinning (N= 32). Radiographic images of the wrist were takenbefore treatment and 1 week, 3 weeks and 3 months after treatment. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} the Dorsiflexion (DF) means of the <b>wrist</b> in the <b>pin</b> (43. 5 ± 9. 2) and no-pin (41. 3 ± 6. 9) groups (P= 0. 099).

50|$|Acceleration (0-60) for the 4-cylinder {{models is}} {{improved}} (around the mid-9-second mark), with comparable fuel efficiency to its predecessor: 23 mpg/city and 30 mpg/hwy for LX and EX models with automatic transmissions. Emissions of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG), {{also known as}} unburned hydrocarbons, produced during engine warm-up are considerably lower. The LX and EX engines produce less than 0.0075 grams per mile, qualifying them for California LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle) status. In California, the Accord EX with the available automatic transmission will produce less than 0.003 grams per mile of NMOG, qualifying it as the first gasoline-powered vehicle to reach ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) status. The five-main bearing block is high-pressure die-cast from aluminum alloy. The walls of the block extend below the centerline of the crankshaft, which helps stiffen the bottom end. FEM (Finite Element Method) computer {{analysis was used to}} arrive at optimum thicknesses for the block ribs and walls in order to minimize engine vibration. Additional bottom-end rigidity comes from a larger, stronger bearing-cap beam that ties directly into the cylinder-block skirt. An aluminum-alloy stiffener has been added between the transmission case and the block, just behind the bearing carrier. The stiffener serves to tie the block and transmission together into a single, reinforced unit. FEM was also used to design this stiffener so that it would not only stiffen the area, but also help minimize high-frequency engine vibration. Finite-element analysis of the Accord's piston design by Honda engineers yielded a new ultra-short, lightweight skirt design, which is very rigid and resistant to vibration and piston slap. Like the V-6 engine the pistons are gravity-cast aluminum alloy and utilize full-floating <b>wrist</b> <b>pins</b> in order to minimize noise. The engine's drop-forged single-plane steel crankshaft and connecting rods have been designed to be stronger and operate with less friction, much like the V-6 components. The I-section, drop-forged steel connecting rods have a completely new design and are considerably lighter than their predecessors (475 g vs. 578 g), which helps to minimize vibration. Big end-bearing journal diameter has been reduced from 48 mm to 45 mm. Rod thickness is down from 24 mm to 20 mm and the bolt size is smaller. Like the V-6 rod bolts, those of the 4-cylinder engine are torqued to the plastic region of the bolt material in order to ensure a solid union between the bearing cap and the connecting rod. The engine block incorporates the Honda-designed second-order balance system that cancels the inertial forces common to large-displacement 4-cylinder engines. The system consists of two parallel shafts {{on either side of the}} crank-shaft, 81 mm (3.19 in.) above its centerline. Driven by a toothed belt, the balance shafts rotate in opposite directions at twice engine speed. Eccentric weights built into the shafts generate inertial forces that counteract the second-order forces created by the motion of the pistons and connecting rods. This Honda system minimizes vibration in the entire rpm range.|$|R
50|$|What {{distinguished}} the Clerget {{rotary engine}} from its rivals (Gnome and Le Rhône) {{was that the}} Clerget had normal intake and exhaust valves unlike the Gnome, and the connecting rod arrangement was much simpler than the Le Rhone. A source of failure among the Clerget engines were the special-purpose piston rings, called obturator rings. These were located below the gudgeon or <b>wrist</b> <b>pin,</b> to block heat transfer from the combustion area to {{the lower part of}} the cylinder and overcome their subsequent distortion. These rings were often made from brass and only had a lifespan of a few hours. The Clerget engines were considered reliable but they cost more per unit to produce than their rivals. Unlike other contemporary rotaries in which the ignition system was either switched on or off to provide a rudimentary form of engine speed control, the Clerget featured a throttle.|$|E
5000|$|Honda employs {{advanced}} {{four-stroke engine}} technology in their 250cc and 450cc bikes. The engines in these bikes use technology developed in Formula One racing engines. Honda uses an over-square engine design, {{which means that}} the diameter of the cylinder is larger than the stroke of the piston. This allows for higher engine speeds and a reduction of reciprocating mass. Another technology that is used is short piston skirts. The [...] "skirt" [...] area of the piston is the portion {{on the side of the}} piston which comes into contact with the cylinder wall and aids piston stability. While the introduction of the shorter skirt on the piston helps to reduce reciprocating mass, it also leads to more [...] "rocking" [...] of the piston, or minute unwanted rotation of the piston around the axis of its <b>wrist</b> <b>pin.</b> This leads to more frequent maintenance intervals for the pistons, piston rings, and cylinder walls.|$|E
5000|$|The {{small end}} {{attaches}} to the piston pin, gudgeon pin or <b>wrist</b> <b>pin,</b> which is currently most often press fit into the connecting rod but can swivel in the piston, a [...] "floating wrist pin" [...] design. The big end connects to the bearing journal on the crank throw, in most engines running on replaceable bearing shells accessible via the connecting rod bolts which hold the bearing [...] "cap" [...] onto the big end. Typically there is a pinhole bored through the bearing and the big end of the connecting rod so that pressurized lubricating motor oil squirts out onto the thrust side of the cylinder wall to lubricate the travel of the pistons and piston rings. Most small two-stroke engines and some single cylinder four-stroke engines avoid {{the need for a}} pumped lubrication system by using a rolling-element bearing instead, however this requires the crankshaft to be pressed apart and then back together in order to replace a connecting rod.|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} of the radial club hand, the main problem is the extreme radial {{deviation}} of both the hand and wrist (Fig.  1). In the newborn, the first treatment is based on braces and physiotherapy to maintain the reduction of the wrist, if the reduction is possible, or to improve the reduction if it is impossible to reduce it. With surgery, the first step is pollicization of a finger in order to reconstruct a thumb. Then comes the timing of the centralization. With no deviation of the hand, which is a very rare condition, there is nothing to do except maintain a close follow-up during growth. However, if there is a radial deviation, and if this deviation is reducible, the centralization can be done with a <b>pin</b> bridging the <b>wrist.</b> This <b>pin</b> can extend from the olecranon to one of the metacarpal bones and must be replaced during growth because it will become too short and too thin, leading to breakage. One trick to know about the pinning: it can be interesting to put a screw in the olecranon in order to fix the proximal part of the pin (Fig.  2), as this will prevent the pin from sliding completely in the olecranon during growth. It would seem the better option that the pin slides into the metacarpal bone because it will be easier to remove it the pin needs replacing.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The aim of {{the study}} is to categorically suggest the apt method of {{surgical}} technique for a particular type of distal radius fracture (Frykman’s type III-VI). Distal radius fracture are among the most common fractures of the upper extremity inspite of increased focus on regular prevention of osteoporosis, early identification and its prompt management. Most distal radius fractures are the result of low energy mechanisms that can be successfully treated either nonoperatively or with a variety of operative techniques if indicated. Complex distal radius fractures occur most commonly in high-energy injuries with extensive comminution or bone loss and associated soft tissue or vascular injuries. These high-energy fractures can present challenges in reconstructing the distal radius. Effective restoration of the bony architecture requires a thorough knowledge of distal radius anatomy, understanding of the goals of treatment, versatility in surgical approaches and familiarity with multiple fixation options. Although, majority of the extra-articular fracture without signs of instability can be successfully managed with POP immobilisation for a period of 4 - 5 weeks followed by active physiotherapy, other types (Frykman’s III-VI) need surgical management that too with combination of surgical techniques namely augmented spanning external fixator with supplemented K-wire fixation or external fixation followed by fragment specific volar locking compression plate osteosynthesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS I have studied 50 cases of distal radius fractures classified using Frykman’s classification using combination of techniques namely augmented spanning external fixator application with K-wire supplementation and spanning external fixator application followed by volar LCP fixation in which external fixator had been used as a reduction tool in majority of the cases and external fixator had been removed after plate osteosynthesis. In some cases retained for a period of 4 - 6 weeks after plate osteosynthesis, which is followed by bone grafting. By early removal of external fixator, fixator-related issues like muscle tendon and nerve impalement, pin tract infection at the site of pin insertion can be minimised. RESULTS Outcome is determined by multiple factors and depends greatly on the soft tissue injury, patient factors and management and the adequacy of restoration of osseous and ligamentous relationships. In contrary to prolonged use of augmented spanning external fixator, which resulted in stiffness of <b>wrist</b> and finger, <b>pin</b> tract infection in both groups (whether external fixator application followed by K-wire fixation as well as external fixator application followed by volar plate osteosynthesis) external fixator can be removed at the end of 4 weeks while K-wires are still in place. Patient can be encouraged to move their fingers and wrist, allowed them to do minimal daily activities. With the use of external fixation in combination protocol radial length has been achieved by ligamentotaxis in majority of the cases (except in die punch intra-articular fracture) and in spite of ground-glass comminution - good reduction is always almost possible. In highly impacted intra-articular die punch fracture-variant arthroscopy-assisted reduction followed by K-wire fixation and further maintained on external fixation. Need for bone grafting was almost negligible unless there was evidence of segmental bone loss from day 1. As in one case (open fracture) where external fixator was applied in order to maintain length of distal radius and soft tissues healing followed by bone grafting and VLCP fixation. CONCLUSION Finally, combination techniques instead of single technique offers various advantages in the management of complex comminuted fracture distal radius both in closed and open fractures. ...|$|R

It preserves an ancient pagan tradition, possibly celebrating the old Roman new Year, beginning on 1 March, identical with Romanian Mărțișor. Pagan customs found their way to the Christian holidays. The ancient ritual of kukeri (кукери), similar to Slovenian Kurentovanje, Busójárás and Halloween, is performed by costumed men in different times of the year and after Easter. This seeks to scare away evil spirits and bring good harvest and health to the community. Goat is symbolized, that was left from the Thracian cult of Dionysian Mysteries. The ritual consists of dancing, jumping, shouting and collect gifts from the houses in an attempt to banish all evil from the village. The adornments on the costumes vary from one region to another. The Thracian Heros remains in the image of Saint George, at whose feast the agriculture is celebrated, a lamb is traditionally eaten, accomplished with ritual bathing. Saint Tryphon's fertility and wine is attributed a Thracian origin, considered to preserve the cult to Sabazius as the Kukeri. This is followed in February by Pokladi, a tradition of setting massively large fire and jump over as at the Kupala Night and a competition between couples to eat an egg on a thread is held. Another characteristic custom called nestinarstvo (нестинарство), or firedancing, distinguishes the Strandzha region, as well as Dog spinning. The authentic nestinarstvo with states of trance is only preserved in the village Balgari. This ancient custom involves dancing into fire or over live embers. Women dance into the fire with their bare feet without suffering any injury or pain. Slavic pagan customs are preserved in Bulgarian Christian holidays. The Miladinov brothers and foreign authors noticed that even pagan prayers are preserved quoting plenty of Slavic pagan rite songs and tales remained in Bulgarians, including Macedonians and Pomaks, mainly dedicated to the divine nymphs samovili and peperuna for the feasts surva, Saint George's Day, Koleda, etc. with evidence of toponymy throughout the regional groups linking directly to the deities Svarog, Perun, Hors and Veles, while the regional group Hartsoi derive their name from god Hors. Songs dedicated to the Thracian divinity Orpheus were found in Pomaks, who is said to marry the samovili. The old Bulgarian name of the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple was Gromnitsa and Perunov den dedicated to the supreme Slavic thunder god Perun. In the mix of Christian and pagan patrons of thunder, at Saint Elijah's feast day Ognyena Maria is worshiped, the Slavic goddesses assisting Perun that took a substitutional dual position of the Christian Mother of God. The custom for rain begging Peperuna is derived from the wife of Perun and the god of the rain Dodola, this was described by a 1792 Bulgarian book as a continued worship of Perun at times of absence of rain with a ritual performed by a boy or a girl dressed like Perun. Similar rain begging is called German. In case of continuous lack of rain, a custom of driving out the zmey from the area is performed. In the dualistic Slavic belief the zmey may be both good tutelary spirit and evil, in which case is considered not local and good, but evil and trying to inflict harm and drought. Saint Jeremiah's feast is of the snakes and the reptiles, there is a tradition of jumping over fire. At the Rusalska Week the girls don't go outside to prevent themselves from diseases and harm that the dead forces Rusalii can cause. This remained the holiday of the samovili. The men performing the custom are also called Rusalii, they don't let anybody pass through between them, don't talk with each other except for the evening, avoid water, if someone lacks behind a member swoops the sword over the lacker's head to prevent him from evil spirits. If the group encounter on their way a well, dry tree, old cemeteries, crossroads, they go round them three times. Before leaving rusalii say goodbye to their relatives as if they went to war, which is not surprising because some of them are killed. When two rusalii groups met there was a fight to the death in which the dead were buried in special [...] "rusaliyski cemetery." [...] Each year there are holidays in honour of wolves and mouses. A relief for the scared believers is celebrated at the Beheading of St. John the Baptist, when according to Bulgarian belief all the mythical figures go back to their caves in a mythical village in the middle of nowhere Zmeykovo of the zmey king, along with the rusalki, samodivi, an return at Annunciation. According to other beliefs the danger peaks at the so-called few days around the New Year Eve [...] "Dirty Days", this time starts at Koleda, which merged with Christmas, when groups of kids koledari visit houses, singing carols and receiving a gift at parting. It is believed that no man can go in Zmeyovo and only the magpie knows the location of this place. At many of the holidays a sexual taboo is said to be practiced to prevent conceiving a vampire or werewolf and not to work, not to go to Sedenki or go out. Live fire is set in case of epidemics. Babinden for example is rooted in the mother-goddess. On the day of St. Vlas, the tradition of a [...] "wooly" [...] god Veles established itself, a god who is considered to be a protector of shepherds, and bread is given to the livestock on that day. The ancient Slavic custom to marry died people occurred in Bulgarian society. Survakane is performed each new year with a decorated stick by children, who hit adults on the back for health at the New Year Eve, usually in exchange of money. In the Chech region there is a custom forbidding [...] "touching the land", i.e. construction and agriculture, at the equinox on 25 March and the same custom is found in Belarusian Volhynia and Polesia.|$|R
