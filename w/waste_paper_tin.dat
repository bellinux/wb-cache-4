40|$|Nowadays, the Municipal Solid Waste {{is the one}} of the {{environmental}} problem that needed to give attention in Malaysia. The total amount of waste generated continues to increase in response to rapid increasing in population, urbanization and industrialization process. This research aims to identify the different type of solid waste from residential area in Gambang, Kuantan Pahang and to reduce the total amount of waste generated for sustainable waste management. Sources of the data and information are gathered by the researcher from the literature review of previous researches, published articles, and academic writings and provided suggestions to improve MSW management system in Malaysia. The standard procedure was followed to conduct the research. This study found that there were 6 types of residential waste such as food <b>waste,</b> <b>paper,</b> glass, plastic, <b>tin</b> or aluminium and others. The percentage of the solid waste was about 53 to 63 of food waste, 6 to 8 of papers, 8 to 11 of plastics waste, 4 to 7 of glass, 6 to 8 aluminium and others waste was about 13. Hence these studies suggest that effort to improve awareness of the population involved and practicing to reduce the waste produce, reuse and the use of recycling bins and sorting of solid waste in order to preserve the environment...|$|R

The {{major problem in}} <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> recycling is still the removal of contraries, although technological developments have so far been able to remove some of them. The costs incurred by the local authorities in recovering <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> were investigated. Local authority costing {{was found to be}} inconsistent and many of them did not include all the relevant indirect costs and savings, so that many local authorities claimed to be making heavy losses in their operations. Full accounting incorporating all the relevant indirect costs and savings have shown that most local authorities incurred much smaller losses and in some cases profited from their <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> recovery operations. A general computer model was developed to allow local authorities to check the viability of their on-going operations and another computer model was developed for an investment appraisal of a proposed <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> recovery operation. Multiple regression models were developed to forecast the demand of <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> in the short term and the long term. The cost to the mill in recycling <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> was also examined. <b>Waste</b> <b>paper</b> recycling can only be increased by improving demand for <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> based products. Various alternatives for diversifying the markets for <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> were investigated, particularly those outside the paper and board industry.

40|$|<b>Waste</b> <b>paper</b> {{stands for}} the major {{biodegradable}} organic fraction of most of municipal solid waste. The potential of <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> for glucose production was investigated in this current work. The pretreatment was accomplished by first subjecting <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> to disintegration time (30 s), followed by ink removal of disintegrated <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> using an deinking agent. Concentrated acid hydrolysis of <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> with sulfuric acid was optimized to maximize glucose conversion. The concentrated acid hydrolysis conditions for <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> (disintegrated time: 30 s, deinking agent loading: 15 ㎖) were optimized by using central composite design and response surface methodology. The optimization process employed a central composite design, where the investigated variables were acid concentration (60 ∼ 80 %), loading sulfuric acid (1 ∼ 5 ㎖) and reaction time (1 ∼ 5 h). All the tested variables were identified to have significant effects (p < 0. 05) on glucose conversion. The optimum concentrated acid hydrolysis conditions were acid concentration of 70. 8 %, loading sulfuric acid of 3. 2 ㎖ and a reaction time of 3. 6 h.

In this work, bioethanol production processes from various <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> (newspaper, office paper, cardboard and magazine) using two enzyme alternatives (Celluclast 1. 5 L supplemented with Novozyme 188 and Cellic Ctec 1) were evaluated from technological, economic and environmental standpoints. Laboratory experiments were conducted to analyse {{the composition of the}} <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> and to assess the carbohydrate yields from enzymatic saccharifications at relatively high-solids loading (15 % w/w). Kinetic models were adapted for the glucan and xylan hydrolyses in this study and were validated by experimental data. The kinetic models provide further insights on enzymatic hydrolysis at high-solids loadings and predictions of the enzymatic digestibilities of the four types of paper. The experimental data, together with published data, were applied in process design models using the simulation software ASPEN PLUSTM to explore the techno-economic aspects of potential conversions of <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> to bioethanol. The mass and energy flows and the pollutant emissions estimated from the process simulations were used in life cycle environmental analyses (LCAs) to provide insight on the potential environmental pros and cons of converting <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> to bioethanol. This research has demonstrated that several pathways to bioethanol production from <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> are economically and environmentally competitive with conventional petrol as a transport fuel. They can also offer environmentally favorable or neutral profiles when compared with the alternative <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> management options of recycling or incineration with energy recovery. Simplistic, general assumptions that converting <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> to bioethanol is either ‘good’ or ‘bad’ are not supported by this research. Instead, this study has demonstrated that detailed techno-economic and environmental profiling work, such as that carried out here, is essential to identifying the most beneficial approaches to developing valuable and environmentally favorable production of bioethanol from <b>waste</b> <b>papers.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
30|$|To help {{address the}} physical, chemical, and {{biological}} degradation of agricultural soils resulting from indiscriminate {{use of chemical}} fertilizers, we developed a slow-release fertilizer from <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> and urea.

Emphasis is placed on the possibility of increasing the share of <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> used for printing paper production in the paper industry, and on the reduction of the quantity of <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> which is not utilized. Different probabilities were assumed for the developed scenarios. The increase in the share of <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> in printing paper production was assumed to be 19 % in 1991 and 23 to 31 % in 1997.

However the utilisation process is not so easy. Problem starts from the collection, consumers, transportation, classification and goes to the pulping strategy and production with chemical addition. The composition of <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> used in the paper production greatly varies from time to time and the location from which it is collected. This creates a great concern at the mills from the fact that the production quality inevitably changes and fluctuates. In such situation, the production has to be monitored very closely and parameters should be modified very fast if something occurs.

Handsheets were made from each <b>waste</b> <b>paper</b> groups with alum-rosin addition as an internal sizing agent. Papers were tested firstly for water resistance and some other standard properties.

From both technical and economic aspects, bioethanol production processes for various <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> were evaluated in this study. High-solids loading (15 % w/w) enzymatic hydrolyses using two enzyme alternatives (Celluclast 1. 5 L supplemented with Novozyme 188 and Cellic Ctec 1) achieved glucan conversion efficiencies from <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> of 50 % to 76 %. Base case process models developed using these experimental data were then applied to an economic analysis to determine the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) for bioethanol derived from the <b>waste</b> <b>papers</b> using a discounted cash flow method. The effects of several processing parameters: alternative product recovery processes, enzyme loading, enzymatic hydrolysis residence time and two enzyme alternatives on the MESP are explored. Bioethanol produced from cardboard (using Cellic Ctec 1) resulted in the lowest MESP. Two state-of-the-art technologies, dilute acid pre-treatment on office paper and oxidative lime pre-treatment on newspaper, were also investigated.
