25|$|To {{produce a}} shock wave, {{an object in}} a given medium (such as air or water) must travel faster than the local speed of sound. In {{the case of an}} {{aircraft}} travelling at high subsonic speed, regions of air around the aircraft may be travelling at exactly the speed of sound, so that the sound waves leaving the aircraft pile up on one another, similar to a traffic jam on a motorway. When a shock <b>wave</b> <b>forms,</b> the local air pressure increases and then spreads out sideways. Because of this amplification effect, a shock wave can be very intense, more like an explosion when heard at a distance (not coincidentally, since explosions create shock waves).|$|E
25|$|Shock waves {{can form}} due to steepening of {{ordinary}} waves. The best-known {{example of this}} phenomenon is ocean waves that form breakers on the shore. In shallow water, the speed of surface waves {{is dependent on the}} depth of the water. An incoming ocean wave has a slightly higher wave speed near the crest of each wave than near the troughs between waves, because the wave height is not infinitesimal compared to the depth of the water. The crests overtake the troughs until {{the leading edge of the}} <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> a vertical face and spills over to form a turbulent shock (a breaker) that dissipates the wave's energy as sound and heat.|$|E

The quadrature <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> {{may have}} the same frequency as an input voltage and may be ninety degrees out of phase with the input voltage. Next, a harmonic <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> may be created. The harmonic <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> may be based upon an even harmonic of the input voltage and may comprise a triplen <b>wave</b> <b>form.</b> Then, the quadrature <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> and the harmonic <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> may be added to create a resultant <b>wave</b> <b>form.</b> The resultant <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> may be contained within an envelope defined by the input voltage. Next, duty cycle control may {{be applied to the}} resultant <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> to create an output voltage. The duty cycle control may be applied without using an energy storage device.

Due to heavy use of this function in transient analysis simulation programs such as the EMTP (ElectroMagnetic Transients Program), determining the <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> parameters is important.

500|$|Mu waves, {{also known}} as mu rhythms, comb or wicket rhythms, arciform rhythms, or {{sensorimotor}} rhythms, are synchronized patterns of electrical activity involving large numbers of neurons, probably of the pyramidal type, {{in the part of}} the brain that controls voluntary movement. These patterns as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or electrocorticography (ECoG), repeat at a frequency of 7.5–12.5 (and primarily 9–11) Hz, and are most prominent when the body is physically at rest. Unlike the alpha wave, which occurs at a similar frequency over the resting visual cortex at the back of the scalp, the mu wave is found over the motor cortex, in a band approximately from ear to ear. A person suppresses mu wave patterns when he or she performs a motor action or, with practice, when he or she visualizes performing a motor action. This suppression is called [...] of the wave because EEG <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> are caused by large numbers of neurons firing in synchrony. The mu wave is even suppressed when one observes another person performing a motor action or an abstract motion with biological characteristics. Researchers such as V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues have suggested that this is a sign that the mirror neuron system is involved in mu wave suppression, although others disagree.|$|E

60|$|The {{wind blew}} very {{hard in the}} course of last night from N.E., and to-day the sea ran so high that no boat could {{approach}} the rock. During the dinner-hour, when the writer was going {{to the top of the}} building as usual, but just as he had entered the door and was about to ascend the ladder, a great noise was heard overhead, and in an instant he was soused in water from a sea which had most unexpectedly come over the walls, though now about fifty-eight feet in height. On making his retreat he found himself completely whitened by the lime, which had mixed with the water while dashing down through the different floors; and, as nearly as he could guess, a quantity equal to about a hogshead had come over the walls, and now streamed out at the door. After having shifted himself, he again sat down in his cabin, the sea continuing to run so high that the builders did not resume their operations on the walls this afternoon. The incident just noticed did not create more surprise in the mind of the writer than the sublime appearance of the waves as they rolled majestically over the rock. This scene he greatly enjoyed while sitting at his cabin window; each wave approached the beacon like a vast scroll unfolding; and in passing discharged a quantity of air, which he not only distinctly felt, but was even sufficient to lift the leaves of a book which lay before him. These waves might be ten or twelve feet in height, and about 250 feet in length, their smaller end being towards the north, where the water was deep, and they were opened or cut through by the interposition of the building and beacon. The gradual manner in which the sea, upon these occasions, is observed to become calm or to subside, is a very remarkable feature of this phenomenon. For example, when a gale is succeeded by a calm, every third or fourth <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> one of these great seas, which occur in spaces of from three to five minutes, as noted by the writer's watch; but {{in the course of}} the next tide they become less frequent, and take off so as to occur only in ten or fifteen minutes; and, singular enough, at the third tide after such gales, the writer has remarked that only one or two of these great waves appear in the course of the whole tide.|$|E
40|$|A {{selected}} {{channel of}} a multi-channel signal which {{is represented by}} frames composed from sampling values having a high time resolution can be encoded with higher quality when a <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> parameter representation representing a <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> of an intermediate resolution representation of the selected channel is derived, the <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> parameter representation including a sequence of intermediate <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> parameters having a time resolution lower than the high time resolution of the sampling values and higher than a time resolution defined by a frame repetition rate. The <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> parameter representation with the intermediate resolution {{can be used to}} shape a reconstructed channel to retrieve a channel having a signal envelope close to that one of the selected original channel.; The time scale on which the shaping is performed is shorter than the time scale of a framewise processing, thus enhancing the quality of the reconstructed channel. On the other hand, the shaping time scale is larger than the time scale of the sampling values, significantly reducing the amount of data needed by the <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> parameter representation...|$|R

5000|$|FMX {{synthesis}} {{was introduced}} with the Yamaha Montage synthesizers in 2016. FMX uses 8 operators. Each FMX operator has {{a set of}} multi-spectral <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> to choose from, which means each FMX operator can be equivalent to a stack of 3 or 4 DX7 FM operators. The list of selectable <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> includes sine waves, the All1 and All2 <b>wave</b> <b>forms,</b> the Odd1 and Odd2 <b>wave</b> <b>forms,</b> and the Res1 and Res2 <b>wave</b> <b>forms.</b> The sine wave selection works {{the same as the}} DX7 <b>wave</b> <b>forms.</b> The All1 and All2 <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> are a saw-tooth wave form. The Odd1 and Odd2 <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> are pulse or square waves. These two types of <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> can be used to model the basic harmonic peaks {{in the bottom of the}} harmonic spectrum of most instruments. The Res1 and Res2 <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> move the spectral peak to a specific harmonic and can be used to model either triangular or rounded groups of harmonics further up in the spectrum of an instrument. Combining an All1 or Odd1 wave form with multiple Res1 (or Res2) <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> (and adjusting their amplitudes) can model the harmonic spectrum of an instrument or sound.|$|E
50|$|The FS1R {{synthesizer}} has {{an impressive}} set of new <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> over the earlier DX line of FM synthesizers, which {{have since been}} incorporated into the new Montage line from Yamaha (with {{the exception of the}} Formant wave form). These <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> include Sine, All1, All2, Odd1, Odd2, Res1, Res2, and Formant. The new <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> are each constructed with a very LARGE number of inherent harmonics making FM synthesis far more efficient. Each one of these operator <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> can replace an entire column of operators in a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer algorithm.|$|E

The thresholds or boundaries defining the frequency ranges vary considerably among professionals. Fast cortical potentials {{can be described}} by their predominant frequencies, but also by whether they are synchronous or asynchronous <b>wave</b> <b>forms.</b> Synchronous <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> occur at regular periodic intervals, whereas asynchronous <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> are irregular.|$|E

30|$|The <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> of {{the thin}} curves in Figs.  8 b and e occurs more {{frequently}} when an appropriate correlation time τ {{is used in}} the convolution. This brings our discussion back to the problem proposed previously. Which features of the SEEs are crucial for STR? The answer is probably a combination of the action level immediately preceding the time when the spiking threshold is reached and a stereotypical <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> of the SEE. We believe the influence of the correlation time τ is probably indirect, making it more likely for the stereotypical <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> to occur at increasing values of τ.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} to {{estimate}} the crest value and the <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> of a impulse voltage from its electrical figure by measuring the radius and observing the shape of branches of it. But this method is difficult in practice especially at higher voltages because of distorsion of their figures. In this paper, as a reference in the above estimation {{the relation of the}} crest voltage to the maximum length of branches of the figuve is measured for each <b>wave</b> <b>form.</b> By comparing these characteristics for several kinds of voltages having different <b>wave</b> <b>form,</b> distinct features are found in general...|$|R
