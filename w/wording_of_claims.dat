40|$|This paper {{presents}} some exploratory {{observations on}} appraisal {{in a set}} of 40 undergraduate students’ argumentative essays. Written texts can be seen to embody, initiate, or simulate various kinds of interpersonal and textual interaction, working together with ideation, as their writers develop and evaluate arguments for reader consideration. In our ongoing research, we investigate the linguistic resources on which undergraduate writers draw for this complex set of intellectual and dialogic purposes. In this paper, we concentrate on the evaluative <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> in an English language essay as captured within the framework of appraisal theory (Martin 2000; White 2002). We focus on how student writers convey, and sometimes negotiate, evaluative meanings in claims that they make. Evaluative linguistic choices made by writers of high-rated and low-rated essays appear quite similar in the general incidence of appraisal system resources. At a finer level of analysis, different trends begin to emerge regarding the types of ENGAGEMENT resources used and their combination with GRADUATION and ATTITUDINAL resources in writers’ claims. We briefly consider implications for research and pedagogy. 21 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Issues {{pertaining}} to consumer understanding of food health claims {{are complex and}} difficult to disentangle {{because there is a}} surprising lack of multidisciplinary research aimed at evaluating how consumers are influenced by factors impacting on the evaluation process. In the EU, current legislation is designed to protect consumers from misleading and false claims but there is much debate about the concept of the ‘average consumer’ referred to in the legislation. This review provides an overview of the current legislative framework, discusses the concept of the ‘average consumer’ and brings together findings on consumer understanding from an international perspective. It examines factors related to the personal characteristics of individuals such as socio-demographic status, knowledge, and attitudes, and factors {{pertaining to}} food and food supplement products such as the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> and the communication of the strength and consistency of the scientific evidence. As well as providing insights for future research, the conclusions highlight the importance of enhancing the communication of scientific evidence to improve consumer understanding of food health claims...|$|E

5000|$|But a clear mistake, {{inadvertently}} committed, in the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the <b>claim,</b> is necessary, {{without reference}} to the length of time. In the present case, there was no mistake in the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> the original patent. The description warranted no other claim. It did not warrant any claim covering bands not short or sectional. The description had to be changed in the reissue to warrant the new claims in the reissue. The description in the reissue is not a more clear and satisfactory statement of what is described in the original patent, but is a description of a different thing so ingeniously worded as to cover collars with continuous long bands and which have no short or sectional bands. The drawings showed no continuous band, and the statement in the original patent that [...] "the use of the short or sectional bands produces a saving of material, as compared to the old style of continuous band," [...] shows that the patentee was drawing a sharp contrast between the only bands he contemplated - short or sectional bands - and a continuous band of one piece of material as long as the collar. The original patent industriously excluded from its scope a continuous band. In the reissue, to cover a continuous graduated band, the two bands B B are converted into a single band composed of the parts B B and, while that is described as extending along the top or body of the collar, the [...] "shorter graduated bands" [...] are described as saving material, as compared with an old style continuous band, of uniform width.|$|R
5000|$|Binnie was {{hesitant}} for {{courts to}} attempt to find the [...] "spirit of the invention" [...] which would create more uncertainty and unpredictability.

If an essential element is different or missing from the challenged invention then there is no infringement. However, there may still be infringement where only non-essential elements are different or missing. A non-essential element is one that, from the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the <b>claim,</b> are not clearly intended to be essential, or where a skilled reader would have been able to identify a substitute.|$|R

Although this reissue was applied for a little over three months after the original patent was granted, the case is one where it is sought merely to enlarge the <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> the original patent by repeating that claim and adding others; where no mistake or inadvertence is shown, so far as the short or sectional bands are concerned; where the patentee waited until the defendants produced their continuous band collar, and then applied for such enlarged claims as to embrace the defendants' collar, which was not covered by the <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> the original patent, and where it is apparent from a comparison of the two patents that the reissue was made to enlarge the scope of the original.

40|$|New EU {{legislation}} (EU Regulation 1924 / 2006) {{will allow}} {{a number of}} nutrition and health claims in food products. The objective {{of this research was}} to study how health claims affect consumers' perception of other product attributes. A survey with a total of 4612 respondents from the Nordic countries explored consumers' perceptions of attractiveness, healthiness, naturalness, tastiness and ability to reduce risk of disease by comparing ratings of products with and without health claims. Used claims varied in their benefit, active ingredient, claim structure and framing. The results showed that health claims had a moderate but mostly negative impact on theÂ perception of other product attributes; the most significant impact was decrease in perceived naturalness. Consumers could also interpret the benefits in claims as intended. The <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the <b>claim</b> had only small impact on the perception of the products, whereas earlier market presence of the ingredient had a large impact: differences among the Nordic countries reflected the previous exposure to health claims. The findings from this study suggest that consumers do not imply other health benefits from health claims and the health claim per se is not likely to cause any unrealistic positive inferences in perceived product quality.

40|$|Under the new Regulation (1924 IEC 2006), {{consumer}} {{understanding is}} now one the criteria for the approval <b>Of</b> NH <b>claims.</b> This thesis focuses on consumer interpretation <b>of</b> NH <b>claims</b> as a key factor influencing expectations of product healthfulness and potential health benefits. Based on spreading activation theory and the Elaboration Likelihood Model, the thesis investigates the impact of package characteristics and personal determinants on consumer perceptions of product attributes and potential health benefits. Using a combined approach of qualitative and quantitative research methods, the research found that people's expectations of a product's healthfulness are primarily influenced by personal characteristics, {{and to a lesser}} extent, by NH claims and other front package characteristics. With regards to front package characteristics, results suggest that colour-coding nutritional information may create a negativity bias while endorsement/logo schemes may create a positivity bias in some cases. However, data show that variations in the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> a <b>claim</b> only have a small impact on consumer evaluations. With regards to personal determinants, result show that people's motivation (expressed in terms of personal relevance) and their perceived understanding of the information on food products play an important part in the way consumers evaluate a product's healthfulness. Level of liking of the pictures on the package and perceived expertise of the organisation supporting NH claims were also found to have a significant influence on consumer evaluations. Furthermore, the belief that a product's health benefits increase with increasing consumption (dose insensitivity) appears to be relatively common amongst consumers. Implications for these findings are dis cussed in context, along with considerations for future research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Such problems are not amenable to easy or final solutions; instead they are defined by copious amounts of disagreement, conflicting objectives, as well as high levels of uncertainty (ie. public policy problems). They are dynamically complex and ill-structured. Calls to address such problems are supported by a skepticism of neutrality, of experts proffering the final <b>word,</b> and <b>of</b> any <b>claim</b> that facts and values can be separated.

40|$|The <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> {{a patent}} {{are central to}} {{virtually}} every aspect of patent law. The claims define {{the scope of the}} invention, and their meaning therefore determines both whether a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s product infringes a patent and whether the patent is valid. One of the most significant aspects of patent litigation is 2 ̆ 2 claim construction, 2 ̆ 2 the process <b>of</b> defining the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the <b>claim</b> in other, theoretically clearer words. Courts construe the <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> the patent by starting with the plain meaning of their terms as they would be understood by a person having ordinary skill in the art, or PHOSITA. Claim construction occurs in every patent case during a 2 ̆ 2 Markman hearing. 2 ̆ 2 Indeed, claim construction is so important to patent litigation that once the court construes the claims, most patent cases settle, and those that do not are often decided on summary judgment. As Judge Rich succinctly put it, 2 ̆ 2 {{the name of the game}} is the claim. 2 ̆ 2 In order to construe the <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> a patent, the court must fix the meaning <b>of</b> the <b>claim</b> terms as <b>of</b> a particular point in time. Both the knowledge of the PHOSITA in a particular field and the meaning of particular terms to that PHOSITA will frequently change over time. Indeed, the risk of change in the meaning of terms over time is particularly great in patent law, because patents necessarily involve new ideas, and the process of assigning terms to describe those new ideas is not static. As the Supreme Court recognized many years ago, 2 ̆ 2 it does not follow that when a newly invented or discovered thing is called by some familiar word, which comes nearest to expressing the new idea, that the thing so styled is really the thing formerly meant by the familiar word. 2 ̆ 2 In that case, the Court found that the meaning of the term 2 ̆ 2 bridge 2 ̆ 2 in a 1790 statute did not mean the same thing in 1860 after the development of railroad bridges.

40|$|The {{object of}} the present {{dissertation}} is the meaning <b>of</b> the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> science conveying rational concepts. How can we ascertain the meaning <b>of</b> any given <b>word</b> <b>of</b> science? What is “the meaning” <b>of</b> a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> science? How, by apprehending the meaning <b>of</b> the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> science, can we further develop our knowledge? How {{is it possible to}} convey the meaning <b>of</b> a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> science in the most efficient way? In the present work I shall endeavour to search for an answer to those and other related questions {{from the standpoint of the}} semiotical pragmatism developed by Charles Sanders Peirce. Peirce is considered the father both of semiotic, or the general science of signs, and of pragmatism, the only American native movement of thought. Although there are plenty of contributions already concerned with Peirce’s pragmatism, only few of them strive to provide a complete account of its genesis and development, and none provides it in relation to the issue <b>of</b> the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> science. The <b>claim</b> I shall vindicate is twofold: not only the issue <b>of</b> the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> science represents a relevant aspect in Peirce’s thought so far neglected by the critical literature, but it affords as well a new way to reinterpret and apply his pragmatism in relation to contemporary problems of philosophy and science. In other <b>words,</b> the issue <b>of</b> the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> science can be used to gain a better understanding of Peirce’s pragmatism and this, in turn, can be used to gain a better understanding of how language and rationality conjointly operate in that endeavour that we call scientific inquiry. The present work is articulated into three main parts. In the first part, a complete reconstruction of the genesis and of the development of Peirce’s pragmatism will be set forth. It has a two aims: the critical one is to determine in which ways Peirce’s pragmatism can be interpreted in relation to the issue <b>of</b> the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> science, while the theoretical one is to ascertain how, according to it, we ought to behave in order to teach and learn the meaning <b>of</b> a given <b>word</b> <b>of</b> science in the best way possible. In the second part, we shall then consider the relation between Peirce’s thought and the issue <b>of</b> the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> science from the standpoint of the evolution of English and American lexicography. Besides reconstructing some neglected aspects of Peirce’s biographical connection to lexicography, the general aim of this second part will be to determine to what extent the conclusion of the first part concerning pragmatism are in line with those achieved by lexicography along its complex evolution. Finally, in the third part, we shall consider the theory of the ethics of scientific terminology developed by Peirce, tracing its evolution and determining its potential pragmatic bearings in relation to our main purpos...|$|R
5000|$|The Russian {{government}} has shown some dissatisfaction with <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the <b>claim</b> that the Kuril Islands should be [...] "returned" [...] to Japan. It claims that asking to [...] "return" [...] the islands, Japan is showing its unwillingness {{to accept the}} post-war status quo. It offered {{to replace it with}} the term [...] "voluntary transfer" [...] of the Kuril Islands to Japan. A public opinion poll that was conducted on Russian website superjob.ru in March 2011, right after the earthquake in Japan, shows that even at the peak of international sympathy toward Japan, three quarters of Russians still thought it is unacceptable to transfer the islands to the Japanese. One of the reasons that Russians are opposed to the transfer of the Kuril Islands to the Japanese is that they still view Japan as a country that historically was associated with Nazi Germany. Similarly, in 2004, when Russia agreed to transfer disputed territories to China, many protesters went out to the streets to protest against the actions of their government. As for the Japanese, there are many people in Japan who are former inhabitants or who are the descendants of those who lived on the Kuril Islands before 1945. Approximately 17,000 Japanese were forced off the islands after the war. Nowadays, their descendants, some of whom wish to return to the Kuril Islands, mostly reside in Hokkaido. A political analyst based in Sapporo, Shigeo Tanaka, says that it would be equal to political suicide if the Japanese government were to give up on the Kuril Islands.|$|R
