500|$|Masked {{protesters in}} Seattle, Washington, United States congregated {{in front of}} the Church of Scientology of Washington. Protesters were quoted as saying, [...] "We believe in total freedom of belief. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> against the people of Scientology, however the Church of Scientology has {{committed}} crimes. They're vehemently anti-opposition. Anyone who opposes them, must go down." [...] A protester in Santa Barbara emphasized that their opposition was against the organization, not the belief system, and that they supported the Scientology split-off group known as the Free Zone. Protesters turned out in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania despite unusually cold weather. The masked crowd consisted mainly of college students, including some who had travelled from as far as Penn State University.|$|E
500|$|The {{question}} of who had designed 40 ballet costumes for Portman and the dancers in Black Swan was one publicized controversy related to the film. The media gave substantial coverage to the dance double controversy: how much credit for the dancing in the film was being given to Portman {{and how much to}} her [...] "dance double," [...] Sarah Lane, an American Ballet Theatre soloist. Lane claimed to have danced more than she was credited. The director and Fox Searchlight disputed Lane's claim. Their released statements said, [...] "We were fortunate to have Sarah there to cover the more complicated dance sequences and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> but praise for the hard work she did. However, Natalie herself did most of the dancing featured in the final film." ...|$|E

500|$|Hand's {{democratic}} {{respect for}} legislation {{meant that he}} hardly ever struck down a law. Whenever his decisions went against the government, he based them only on the boundaries of law in particular cases. He adhered to the doctrine of presumptive validity, which assumes that legislators {{know what they are}} doing when they pass a law. Even when a law was uncongenial to him, or when it seemed contradictory, Hand set himself to interpret the legislative intent. Sometimes, however, he was obliged to draw the line between federal and state laws, as in United States v. Schechter Poultry. In this important case, he ruled that a New Deal law on working conditions did not apply to a New York poultry firm that conducted its business only within the state. Hand wrote in his opinion: [...] "It is always a serious thing to declare any act of Congress unconstitutional, and especially in a case where {{it is part of a}} comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of the nation as a whole. With the wisdom of that plan <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> whatever to do..." ...|$|E

But my main efforts are being directed toward building up a positive, progressive group of speeches which tell {{what we want to}} do, not what the Democrats have failed to do... I'm really hopped up over this deal, and I believe we can win." [...] However, [...] "" [...] Republicans deemed Nixon's campaign hopeless. [...] Nixon was a virtual unknown outside of his hometown of Whittier and was facing a popular and respected incumbent. [...] Charles Voorhis wrote his son that the Republicans had endorsed a Quaker named Richard Nixon, but hoped that his son would retain {{a large part of the}} Quaker vote. The elder Voorhis was confident that his son would triumph again, writing, [...] "It is just another campaign that we have to go through... In any event, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to worry about now." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Morello, Wilk and Commerford's {{involvement}} in Prophets of Rage, Commerford confirmed {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that Rage Against the Machine has not split up, explaining, [...] "We just do things our own way. Throughout our career, we never did what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by. And here we are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where are they now? They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's a great artist in his own right. But where you're going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage." ...|$|E

500|$|On August 5, 2012, a song {{entitled}} [...] "Enough Said" [...] {{was released}} online. The song {{was produced by}} Noah [...] "40" [...] Shebib and features Canadian rapper Drake. Four days later, Jomo Hankerson confirmed a posthumous album is being produced {{and that it was}} scheduled to be released by the end of 2012 by Blackground Records. The album was reported to include 16 unreleased songs and have contributions from Aaliyah's longtime collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott, among others. On August 13, Timbaland and Missy Elliott dismissed rumors about being contacted or participating for the project. Elliott's manager Mona Scott-Young said in a statement to XXL, [...] "Although Missy and Timbaland always strive to keep the memory of their close friend alive, we have not been contacted about the project nor are there any plans at this time to participate. We've seen the reports surfacing that they have been confirmed to participate {{but that is not the}} case. Both Missy and Timbaland are very sensitive to the loss still being felt by the family so we wanted to clear up any misinformation being circulated." [...] Elliott herself said, [...] "Tim and I carry Aaliyah with us everyday, like so many of the people who love her. She will always live in our hearts. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> but love and respect for her memory and for her loved ones left behind still grieving her loss. They are always in our prayers." ...|$|E
500|$|Bolt's record-setting runs caused {{commentators}} {{not only}} to praise his achievements but also to speculate about his potential {{to become one of}} the most successful sprinters ever. Critics hailed his Olympic success as a new beginning for a sport that had long suffered through high-profile drug scandals. The previous six years had seen the BALCO scandal, Tim Montgomery and Justin Gatlin stripped of their 100 m world records, and Marion Jones returning three Olympic gold medals. All three sprinters were disqualified from athletics after drugs tests detected banned substances in their systems. Bolt's record-breaking performances caused suspicion among some commentators, including Victor Conte, and the lack of an independent Caribbean anti-doping federation raised more concerns. The accusations of drug use were vehemently rejected by Glen Mills (Bolt's coach) and Herb Elliott (the Jamaican athletics team doctor). Elliott, a member of the IAAF anti-doping commission, urged those concerned about the issue to [...] "come down and see our programme, come down and see our testing, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to hide". Mills had been equally ardent that Bolt was a clean athlete, declaring to the Jamaica Gleaner: [...] "We will test any time, any day, any part of the body... doesn't even like to take vitamins". Bolt stated that he had been tested four times prior to the Olympics, and all had tested negative for banned substances. He also welcomed anti-doping authorities to test him to prove that he was clean, stating, [...] "We work hard and we perform well and we know we're clean".|$|E

2500|$|In response, people {{involved}} with the film (particularly Aronofsky) and Fox Searchlight disputed Lane's claim.

2500|$|The Hungarians, however, were {{repeatedly}} {{defeated by}} the Romanians. By the middle of July 1919, Hungary had begun a major offensive against the Romanian invasion.

When the Hungarian offensive is launched, we shall retreat to the line of demarcation and launch the counteroffensive from that line.
