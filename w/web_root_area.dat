In the present study, N addition significantly reduced the specific <b>root</b> <b>area</b> to specific leaf area ratio, which suggests that the proportion of assimilates in the root system was less than that in the leaves. Consequently, we consider that this ratio might be more suitable than the area or biomass indices to explain the utilization of N by plants.|$|R

40|$|In organic animal production, {{synthetic}} {{amino acids}} are not allowed. Therefore, {{a higher level}} of crude protein is needed in the diet to pigs, which lead to more nitrogen (N) excreted in the faeces and urine. N can be emitted to the air in the form of e. g. ammonia (NH 3), which contributes to eutrophication and acidification and as nitrous oxide (N 2 O), which is a very potent greenhouse gas. The emission of N can be reduced by e. g. modifying the diet and by reducing the defecated areas in the pens. The aim {{of this study was to}} enrich the outdoor yard in organic pig production with a <b>rooting</b> <b>area</b> filled with peat, and thereby also reduce the emissions of N. The hypothesis was that pigs avoid to dung in areas with high activity, and a <b>rooting</b> <b>area</b> should therefore direct the pigs to dung in a smaller <b>area</b> outside the <b>rooting</b> <b>area.</b> Peat is appreciated as a rooting material by pigs and it has a high potential to bind N, which reduces the emission of NH 3. The complex environment (aerobic and anaerobic) that can occur in peat is not always optimal, which can lead to more N emitted as N 2 O. The study was performed in a stable for organic finishing pigs in Skåne (the most southern part of Sweden). The stable consists of 8 pens, each dimensioned for 16 pigs. Two batches of pigs were studied. Studies of the pigs’ behaviour, measures of the emission of NH 3 and hygiene of the floor in the outdoor yards were included. Furthermore, as a pilot trial in batch 2, the concentration of N 2 O was measured in closed chambers with two different methods. The results showed that the pigs chose to stay outdoor and to lie outdoor to a higher extent when the climate was warmer (batch 2). During batch 1, the hygiene was poorer than in batch 2, but the emission of NH 3 was observed to be lower. The explanation for this result is that the temperature in batch 1 was lower than in batch 2. The <b>rooting</b> <b>area</b> did not stimulate the pigs to root more or be more active, but the pigs directed their rooting to be more frequent outside, and a tendency (p= 0. 097) that the pigs chose to stay outside more was observed (Table 8, 9, 10 and 11). The pigs avoided to dung in the <b>rooting</b> <b>area,</b> and their dunging was mostly concentrated to the dunging area (area C), a result that corresponds to the hypothesis. This behaviour led to better hygiene in the outdoor yard and a lower emission of NH 3 from the <b>rooting</b> <b>area</b> (49. 9 mg/m 2 h) compared to the same area in boxes without <b>rooting</b> <b>area</b> (108. 6 mg/m 2 h). However, from the dunging area (area C), higher emission of NH 3 was detected in pens with the <b>rooting</b> <b>area</b> (134. 8 mg/m 2 h) compared to boxes without it (80. 1 mg/m 2 h) (Table 12 and 13). Because of the few measures of the concentration of N 2 O, conclusions can not really be made. Though, the measures showed altered concentrations of N 2 O (= emission) from outdoor yards with a <b>rooting</b> <b>area,</b> compared to outdoor <b>areas</b> without <b>rooting</b> <b>areas,</b> where no altered concentrations was detected (Figure 12 - 15). The <b>rooting</b> <b>area</b> can be considered positive for the welfare of the pigs since it was popular both for rooting and as a lying area, and it resulted in a better utilization of all areas in the pen. Though, the higher emission of NH 3 from area C and the detected emission of N 2 O from outdoor yards with a <b>rooting</b> <b>area,</b> concludes that more actions than a <b>rooting</b> <b>area</b> are needed to reduce the total emissions of N from outdoor yards. Suggestions for other actions are more frequent cleaning (which is facilitated by concentrated dunging), another type of dunging system and maybe another rooting material or another kind of peat. To reduce the total emissions of N from dung, it is important to take into consideration both NH 3 and N 2 O in future studies...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess whether}} rooting damage by {{pregnant}} sows {{can be reduced}} by offering a designated area for wallowing and foraging, four groups of four sows each were subjected to four treatments, during eight periods in a 4 × 4 Latin square designed experiment. During each period, each group was given access to a 160 m 2 field for 4 h per day, {{over a period of}} five consecutive days. The treatments were different 4 m 2 <b>rooting</b> <b>areas</b> in a field and included either ploughed dry soil (D), ploughed wet soil (W), dry soil with 400 g wheat and barley seeds (S) or no <b>rooting</b> <b>area</b> (N). At the start of each period, new areas were fenced off and groups were allocated to a new treatment. Pig behaviour was scan sampled at 5 min intervals over the 4 h access periods, temperature was recorded daily and pasture damage was assessed {{at the end of each}} period. The study was conducted during the summer months, with air temperature during observations ranging from 20 to 25 °C. During the first 15 min at pasture, the sows spent 70 % of their time grazing, gradually reducing it to 20 % during the final hour. Increased ambient temperature resulted in less grazing and more lying and rooting behaviour. Approximately 23 % of the total time was spent in the <b>rooting</b> <b>area</b> (if present), with no difference between treatments. Of all lying behaviour, 40 % was performed in a <b>rooting</b> <b>area.</b> Only for W was the use of <b>rooting</b> <b>area</b> positively correlated with temperature (P < 0. 05).

In contrast, RAIfine was inversely propotional to basal area.

The effect of <b>root</b> surface <b>area</b> on water uptake and transpiration rate of maize (Zea mays L. cv Honey Bantam) plants cultivated hydroponically and in soil was examined using this model. Transpiration rate of the plants was measured by load cell using gravity method. Root length was measured according to Newman [10]. Root volume was measured by putting the roots into a measuring cylinder containing water. Water movement coefficient of root system was estimated using pressure chamber method. Regardless of cultivation methods, transpiration rate was low for plants with small <b>root</b> surface <b>area.</b> It was obvious that <b>root</b> surface <b>area</b> had a close relationship with the resistance of water uptake and transpiration rate of the plants. From the measurements of water saturation deficit of leaf, it was clear that plants with smaller <b>root</b> surface <b>area</b> are more sensitive to water stress than those with larger <b>root</b> surface <b>area.</b> Strong correlation between the meteorological conditions and transpiration rate per unit leaf area was observed. High solar radiation led to high temperature, and hence to a high transpiration rate of the plants.

The results showed the following. 1) With drought stress increasing, the heights, base diameters, and <b>root</b> surface <b>areas</b> of mulberry trees decreased significantly relative to the corresponding earlier period. The root / shoot ratio increased gradually in the earlier stage, and decreased gradually in the later stage. The specific <b>root</b> <b>area</b> of mulberry trees on the whole increased significantly relative to the corresponding earlier period. 2) With the elongation of treatment time, the growth of mulberry seedlings decreased gradually, and the heights, base diameters, <b>root</b> surface <b>area</b> and <b>root</b> / shoot ratio of the mulberry trees in the three treatment groups increased to different degrees. The specific <b>root</b> <b>area</b> of mulberry trees on the whole decreased gradually.

Nineteen fungi were analysed and, based on ITS analysis, 17 isolates showed to be genetically distinct. The overall effect of water mint endophytes on Arabidopsis fresh (FW) and dry weight (DW) was neutral and positive, respectively, and the increased DW, mainly occurring 14 DAI, was possibly related to plant defence mechanism. Only three fungi increased both FW and DW of Arabidopsis at 14 and 21 DAI, thus behaving as plant growth promoting (PGP) fungi. E-treatment caused a reduction of root depth and primary root length in most cases and inhibition-to-promotion of <b>root</b> <b>area</b> and lateral <b>root</b> length, from 14 DAI.
