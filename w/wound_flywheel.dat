40|$|An all-electric {{driveline}} {{based on}} a double <b>wound</b> <b>flywheel,</b> connected in series between main energy storage and a wheel motor, is presented. The flywheel works as a power buffer, allowing the battery to deliver optimized power. It also separates electrically the system in two sides, with the battery connected to the low voltage side and the wheel motor connected to the high voltage side. This paper presents the implementation {{and control of the}} AC/DC/AC converter, used to connect the flywheel high voltage windings to the wheel motor. The converter general operation and the adopted control strategy are discussed. The implementation of the AC/DC/AC converter has been described from a practical perspective. Results from experimental tests performed in the full-system prototype are presented. The prototype system is running with satisfactory stability during acceleration mode. Good efficiency and unity power factor could be achieved, based on vector control and space vector modulation...|$|E
40|$|Flywheel {{systems are}} {{attractive}} in hybrid and electric vehicles {{due to their}} ability to handle power during acceleration and braking. The combination of a flywheel device with a battery source has several advantages such as high peak power capacity, high energy density and {{reduction in the number of}} charge/discharge cycles of the battery. A flywheel based all-electric driveline is investigated in this thesis. The novelty of the system consists in the use of a double <b>wound</b> <b>flywheel</b> machine, which divides the system in two different power levels. Due to this configuration, the system becomes efficient and can handle the power developed during fast dynamical processes. The complete driveline consists of three main components: the battery, the flywheel machine and the wheel motor. The High-Power (HP) side of the driveline connects the flywheel machine to the wheel motor, whereas the Low-Power (LP) side connects the flywheel machine to the battery. The connections of different components of the system are made electrically through power converter devices. The present thesis focuses on the electrical converters and control strategies used in the flywheel based all-electric driveline. The control of power converters is responsible for the logic and functionality of the driveline, being a challenging step within this project. Different power converter topologies have been investigated: a DC/DC plus a DC/AC converter on the LP side, and an AC/DC/AC converter on the HP side. The design and assembly of the power electronics and their control scheme have been successfully implemented. Different control strategies have been suggested and a complete scaled driveline has been assembled and tested based on previous simulation results. Results have confirmed the functionality of the driveline, where smoothed output power has been obtained from the battery, whereas the flywheel handles power transients on the traction side. An average efficiency of about 87 % (battery to wheels) has been obtained. The power converter systems have been shown to be efficient and robust, with control strategies able to handle the peak energy flow in the system. A regenerative braking strategy has been simulated and a wheel-to-wheel efficiency of about 80 % has been estimated...|$|E
5000|$|Powerline's {{variant of}} the T Class was an entirely new model - the first for the then-new {{management}} of the company, with no parts recycled from previous models. A new mechanism was developed in India {{to make use of}} the 5 pole skew <b>wound,</b> twin <b>flywheel</b> system, and as has since become standard, the unit was fitted with all-wheel drive and all-wheel electrical pickup. RP-25 110 wheels were made standard. The units were also fitted with DCC decoders and NEM [...] "dunny seat" [...] couplers as standard, although Kadee metal couplers are included in every box. Each unit was also fitted with separately-applied detail parts like handrails, brake hoses and grilles, giving a much higher level of detail than previous models. The first run was to include initial releases of the VR and V/Line liveries on both body types, and high nose West Coast Railway and low nose Freight Australia schemes. An offer was made to customers, that if they paid $50 upfront, they would receive their model(s) for $198.00. As of 2015, the recommended retail price $295.00. The engines were due to be released in 2004, but production line delays caused the announcement to be pushed back to October 2004, and the final release to early 2007. Because of the parallel development and release schedules between Austrains and Powerline, the company adopted the marketing slogan, [...] "DO NOT BUY ANY OTHER T CLASS UNTIL YOU SEE OUR T CLASS". The final product is slightly smaller in all dimensions than the Austrains units, and Powerline has claimed that all dimensions bar some valence and handrail measurements are within 0.5mm. To cover for variants, some engines were released with decals to alter pilot stripes. Valence units were also released separately, to allow purchasers to modify or replace those provided.|$|R
