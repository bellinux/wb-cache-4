5000|$|Piperine was {{discovered}} in 1819 by Hans Christian Ørsted, who isolated it from the fruits of Piper nigrum, the source plant of both {{the black and white}} pepper grains. [...] Flückiger and Hanbury found piperine in Piper longum and Piper officinarum (Miq.) C. DC. (=Piper retrofractum Vahl), two species called [...] "long pepper". <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>pepper</b> also contains piperine.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the colony}} is {{nowadays}} primarily associated with Atlantic slave trade, {{this was not}} the reason for the first Dutch traders to trade with the Gold Coast. Barent Eriksz made a profit trading gold, ivory, and <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>pepper,</b> and these products remained the primary trading goods in the early 17th century. According to Joannes de Laet, the Dutch West India had transported West-African goods worth 14 million Dutch guilders to the Dutch Republic by 1637, of which the most important was the trade in gold.|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{sustainability of}} cotton-based systems {{is at risk}} in the Nigerian savanna because of its environmental effects. Presently, policies aimed at addressing the problems of soil fertility decline and insecticide contamination are being advanced. The effects of two organic materials (i. e. cowdung and poultry litter) as soil amendments and, two others (extracts of garlic and <b>west</b> <b>African</b> black <b>pepper)</b> as insecticidal materials on soil physical properties and upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) productivity were compared with the conventional method (mineral fertiliser and synthetic insecticide) in a 2 year field trial on a savanna Alfisols. Seed cotton yield under mineral fertiliser amendment was about 30 % higher than were yields from the two organic amendments. However, the cotton lint yield from the three amendments were similar. Seed cotton, cotton seed and lint yields were similar for cotton that received garlic extract and karate (synthetic insecticide). Cotton sprayed with extract of <b>west</b> <b>African</b> black <b>pepper</b> produced significantly higher seed cotton and cotton lint yield than the synthetic insecticide. The treatments had no significant effect on soil physical properties. This result further confirms the usefulness of organic cotton cultivation, {{a viable alternative to}} the conventional method of cotton production in the savanna...|$|R

5000|$|Piper guineense is a West African {{species of}} Piper; the spice derived from its dried fruit {{is known as}} <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>pepper,</b> Ashanti pepper, Benin pepper, false cubeb, Guinea cubeb, uziza pepper or (ambiguously) [...] "Guinea pepper", and called locally kale, kukauabe, masoro, sasema and soro wisa. It is a close {{relative}} of cubeb pepper and a relative of black pepper and long pepper. Unlike cubeb pepper, which is large and spherical in shape, Ashanti peppers are prolate spheroids, smaller and smoother than Cubeb pepper in appearance and generally bear a reddish tinge. The stalks of Ashanti pepper berries are also distinctly curved whilst those of cubeb pepper are completely straight.|$|E
50|$|Not {{only the}} seeds of Piper are used in cooking. <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>Pepper</b> leaves, known locally as uziza, are used as {{flavoring}} vegetable in Nigerian stews. In Mexican-influenced cooking, hoja santa or Mexican pepperleaf (P. auritum) {{has a variety of}} uses, mainly to impart flavor too. In Southeast Asia, leaves of two species of Piper have major importance in cooking: lolot (P. lolot) is used to wrap meat for grilling in the Indochina region, while wild betel (P. sarmentosum), often seen under the Thai name cha phlu, is used raw or cooked as a vegetable in its own right in Malay and Thai cuisine; it is also used to prepare the famous miang kham snacks of northwestern Thailand.|$|E
50|$|It {{is used in}} West African cuisine {{where it}} imparts heat and a pungent aroma to classic West African stews. Even in West Africa, Ashanti pepper is an {{expensive}} spice and is used sparingly. Often, a few grains are in a pestle and mortar before being added (along with black pepper) to soups or to boiled rice. The spice can also be substituted in any recipe using cubeb pepper, where Ashanti imparts a less bitter flavour. The pepper is also sometimes one of the ingredients in the Berbere spice mix used in the cuisines of Ethiopia and of Eritrea. However, <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>Pepper</b> is a highly esteemed spice in its region of origin and {{may be hard to}} get abroad; thus, long pepper is more often used in Berbere.|$|E

5000|$|<b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>pepper</b> (P. guineense), {{also given}} {{a variety of}} [...] "regionalized" [...] names like [...] "Benin pepper", [...] "Ashanti pepper, or the rather {{ambiguous}} [...] "Guinea pepper", is considered supreme for use in stews and other regional specialties. It is used in addition to black pepper to impart a particularly refined aroma with hints of nutmeg and saffron. Sometimes it {{is used in the}} East African berbere spice mix. This species, despite being traded more extensively in earlier times, is very hard to get outside Africa today. More readily available in the West is long pepper (P. longum), commonly traded under its Indian name pipalli. This is possibly the secondmost popular Piper spice internationally; it has a rather chili-like [...] "heat" [...] and the whole inflorescence is used as the fruits are tiny.|$|E
40|$|The {{rehydration}} {{characteristics of}} dehydrated <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>pepper</b> leaves were investigated at hydration temperatures of 28, 60, 70, and 80 °C. Four treatments {{were given to}} the leaves: blanched and sun dried, unblanched and sun dried, blanched and shade dried, and unblanched and shade dried. The hydration pro-cess of the dehydrated leaves was adequately described by the Peleg’s equation. As the hydration temperature increased from 28 to 70 °C, there was a significant decrease in the Peleg’s constant K 1, while for most of the leaves the Peleg’s con-stant K 2 varied with temperature. Rehydration ratio values ranged from 3. 75 in blanched shade dried leaves to 4. 26 in unblanched sun dried leaves with the unblanched leaves generally exhibiting higher ratios than the blanched leaves...|$|E
