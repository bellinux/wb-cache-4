25|$|Némirovsky was {{the very}} {{definition}} of a self-hating Jew. Does that sound too strong? <b>Well,</b> <b>here</b> is a Jewish writer who owed her success in France entre deux guerres in no small measure to her ability to pander to the forces of reaction, to the fascist right. Némirovsky's stories of corrupt Jews—some of them even have hooked noses, no less!—appeared in right-wing periodicals and won her the friendship of her editors, many of whom held positions of power in extreme-right political circles. When the racial laws in 1940 and 1941 cut off her ability to publish, she turned to those connections to seek special favors for herself, and {{even went so far as}} to write a personal plea to Marshal Pétain.|$|E
25|$|Democrats fared <b>well</b> <b>here</b> in the 2008 election. In the 1998 Senate race, John Edwards won in Wake County, {{which helped}} him defeat {{incumbent}} Republican Lauch Faircloth. In 2000 Mike Easley won the governor's race here with 55% of the vote. In 2004, Easley won again, winning with 59 percent to 40 percent for opponent Patrick Ballantine. Democrat Beverly Perdue won Wake County in the 2008 Governor’s election by a 51 to 45 percent margin. Democratic candidate for US Senate Erskine Bowles won the county with 52 percent, despite losing statewide to Richard Burr {{by the same}} margin. In 2002, however, Republican Elizabeth Dole defeated Bowles with 55% of the vote here, and won by a large margin statewide. In 2008 Kay Hagan defeated Dole 56 to 40 percent.|$|E
25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as <b>well.</b> <b>Here,</b> a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|E

500|$|In the Poetic Edda, Urðarbrunnr is {{mentioned}} in stanzas 19 and 20 {{of the poem}} Völuspá, and stanza 111 of the poem Hávamál. In stanza 19 of [...] Völuspá, Urðarbrunnr is described as being located beneath Yggdrasil, and that Yggdrasil, an ever-green ash-tree, [...] is covered with white mud or loam. Stanza 20 describes that three norns (Urðr, Verðandi, and Skuld) [...] "come from" [...] the <b>well,</b> <b>here</b> described as a [...] "lake", and that this trio of norns then [...] "set down laws, they chose lives, for the sons of men the fates of men." ...|$|E
500|$|Milk's {{swearing-in}} made national headlines, as {{he became}} the first non-incumbent openly gay man in the United States to win an election for public office. He likened himself to pioneering African American baseball player Jackie Robinson and walked to City Hall arm in arm with Jack Lira, stating [...] "You can stand around and throw bricks at Silly Hall or you can take it over. <b>Well,</b> <b>here</b> we are." [...] The Castro District was not the only neighborhood to promote someone new to city politics. Sworn in with Milk were also a single mother (Carol Ruth Silver), a Chinese American (Gordon Lau), and an African American woman (Ella Hill Hutch)—all firsts for the city. Daniel White, a former police officer and firefighter, was also a first-time supervisor, and he spoke of how proud he was that his grandmother was able to see him sworn in.|$|E
500|$|The Washington Post Stuever {{has many}} {{complaints}} about the show {{including the fact that}} it is about Washington, DC, but filmed in Baltimore. He also complains about its entrance into the television landscape littered with [...] "more fictitious administrations than anyone can keep track of". He says that perspective will affect your perception of the show. Those not already inundated with [...] "Type A personalities inside the Beltway" [...] in their daily lives may be drawn to the show. However, it is not likely a show that will serve well those who spend a lot of time with the issues that the show deals with. After viewing the first two episodes, Stuever also finds fault with the use of breaking the fourth wall, describing it as [...] "the show's unwise narrative trope". The Wall Street Journal Smith defends the fourth wall as an [...] "artifice that generally works <b>well</b> <b>here</b> to loosen our bearings".|$|E

500|$|At the fort, Moultrie {{ordered his}} men to {{concentrate}} their fire on the two large man-of-war ships, Bristol and Experiment, which took hit after hit from the fort's guns. Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the main- and mizzenmasts. One round hit her quarterdeck, slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh. The shot also tore off part of his britches, leaving his backside exposed. By mid-afternoon, the defenders were running out of gunpowder, and their fire was briefly suspended. However, Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland, and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day, telling Colonel Moultrie, [...] "I see you are doing very <b>well</b> <b>here,</b> you have no occasion for me, I will {{go up to the}} town again." [...] Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort's walls with persistent broadside cannonades. This strategy failed due to the spongy nature of the palmetto wood used in its constructions; the structure would quiver, and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering. [...] The exchange continued until around 9:00 pm, when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities, and the fleet finally withdrew out of range.|$|E
500|$|Allgame {{said the}} {{enjoyment}} [...] "isn't bad", but limited: [...] "You can only blow {{up so much}} stuff with a helicopter." [...] Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot in his PlayStation review called the game tired and mediocre, but reviewing the PC version, Shane Mooney wrote: [...] "I'm happy {{to say that the}} much-maligned action-heavy, plot-light genre has received a solid kick in the pants from the wonderfully fun Nuclear Strike." [...] Mooney praised the successful port from the console version and believed players would [...] "find plenty to slobber over in this extremely entertaining title." [...] Daily Radar said: [...] "When it comes to creating an action game, {{it would be nice to}} play something that requires a little bit more than just holding down the fire button continuously. In Nuclear Strike 64, that's just about all you do." [...] The website said: [...] "if all you're looking for is a game where you can fly around in a helicopter, drive a tank and manipulate 10 other vehicles in a destructive fest, <b>well,</b> <b>here</b> you go." [...] Allgame summarised: [...] "When all is said and done, Nuclear Strike 64 is a fine example of an excellent shooting game." [...] The reviewer believed that gamers would appreciate the game's longevity and variety. Game Revolution praised the helpful interface and responsive controls and said the mechanics were generally good, but complained of an occasionally inaccurate targeting system. The website acclaimed the [...] "perfect" [...] difficulty level. GameFan took issue with enemies shooting the player's vehicle while not visible on-screen. GameSpot's minor complaints were infrequent game saves, a [...] "too easy" [...] structure allowing supply lines to be destroyed before the main forces, a short game despite large missions and a lack of multiplayer.|$|E

2500|$|Bishop's {{first novel}} {{for young people}} [...] "whatever their age" [...] was {{published}} in June 2016 by the Fairwood Press imprint Kudzu Planet Productions. Ten-year-old Joel-Brock Lollis returns home from a baseball game to discover that his parents and sister have been kidnapped, and proceeds to recruit two employees of the local big-box department store in his quest to rescue his family. Reviewer Paul Di Filippo writes [...] "Bishop’s prodigious powers of invention serve him <b>well</b> <b>here</b> too. There are many angles to the tale, including an ongoing dialogue between Joel-Brock and his future self. The bulk of the book {{takes place in the}} Sporangium , and there’s always a new miracle or horror around the bend. While the marvels are unpredictable and chaotic, they also exhibit the consistency and inner logic of the best dream worlds." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once {{it became}} clear that Eccleston would decline to appear, Moffat turned to an {{alternative}} concept he had been formulating, featuring a [...] "mayfly Doctor" [...] who appears for a single episode, asking, [...] "Would it be weird in the run of the series to have the 45th Doctor turn up and be played by Johnny Depp or someone? Would that be a cool thing to do?". He also indicated that the [...] "classic Doctor" [...] he would most like to feature in a new story was William Hartnell's First Doctor, stating, [...] "You'd want him to come and say 'What in the name of God have I turned into?' That's the confrontation that you most want to see, to celebrate 50 years. Going round and round in circles on it I just thought, 'What about a Doctor that he never talks about?' And what if it is a Doctor who's done something terrible, who's much deadlier and more serious, who represents that thing that is the undertow in both David and Matt. You know there's a terrible old man inside them. <b>Well,</b> <b>here</b> he is, facing the children he becomes, as it were." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{embarked}} on the Test leg of England's tour of Bangladesh in March 2010, Onions returned {{home with a}} back injury without playing a match. Alastair Cook, England captain on the tour, voiced his disappointment that Onions {{would not be able}} to play for England: [...] "He was a huge part of our plans and he still is, obviously, because of the way he bowled in South Africa, where he was unlucky not to take more wickets than he did. He bowled really well there, and I was expecting him come to these conditions and bowl <b>well</b> <b>here</b> as well." [...] The injury prevented Onions from playing most of the English cricket season. He also underwent surgery on his left knee to repair cartilage. Speaking of his disappointment at not being able to play for England, Onions said [...] "The last few months have been massively frustrating. When you've had a place in the team for a while and you lose it it's hugely disappointing and hurts a lot. Before the injury everything had been like a dream for me, all I ever wanted to do was play for England, but the last six months have been tough." [...] In April 2010 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack named him as one of its five cricketers of the year for 2009. Onions did not recover in time to play in the 2010–11 Ashes series. However he was named in England's 27-man performance squad the following March after recovering from surgery.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly before West Indies {{embarked}} {{on a tour of}} Australia in November to December 2009; senior players such as Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul returned to the squad, but Roach had sufficiently impressed selectors during the dispute that he retained his place. The West Indies lost the first Test in three days; Adrian Barath's century on debut and Roach's bowling performance were the main positives for the West Indies; in the opinion of former Australia captain Ian Chappell, Roach's bowling was [...] "exceptionally good" [...] but he lacked support from more senior bowlers. Although the West Indies drew the second Test, Roach (who was regularly bowling over [...] ) and Dwayne Bravo took the West Indies close to levelling the series {{on the final day of}} the match. Australia's captain, Ricky Ponting, commended Roach for his control and accuracy and said [...] "Someone who is pretty short at that pace can get the ball to skid onto you pretty quickly off the wicket with not much bounce. We've played him pretty <b>well</b> <b>here</b> [...] The ball reverse-swung for them in both innings. He's a handful, there's no doubt about that. He's someone who could play a fair bit of Test cricket for them in the future." [...] It was the opinion of Tony Cozier that in the absence of experienced fast bowlers Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards, Roach was the leader of the bowling attack in Australia. Roach, who was fastest of the West Indies' bowling line-up, troubled the Australian batsmen with his pace through the series, and a rivalry emerged between Roach and Ponting. In the first innings of the third and final Test, Roach struck Ponting on the elbow, who was forced to retire hurt. However, he was forced to bowl into the wind, which surprised Australian batsmen Shane Watson as it reduced Roach's pace.|$|E
