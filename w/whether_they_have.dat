On August 14, 2009, PBS performed in Dakar for their 20th anniversary effectively ending speculations about <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> disbanded. Guests at the concert included powerful Senegal music stars such as Youssou Ndour and Ismael Lo.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} may {{be categorized}} according to <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> environmental or developmental causes. While environmental abnormalities {{may appear to}} have an obvious cause, there may {{not appear to be}} any known cause for some developmental abnormalities. Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.|$|E
5|$|During {{a welcome}} dinner at Barton Park, Sir John {{introduces}} the Dashwoods to his wife, Lady Middleton (Rosanna Lavelle); her mother, Mrs. Jennings (Linda Bassett); {{and their family}} friend, Colonel Brandon (David Morrissey). Brandon instantly {{falls in love with}} Marianne, but she believes he is too old for her. While out walking with Margaret, Marianne falls and twists her ankle. She is rescued by a young man, who carries her back to the cottage. He introduces himself as John Willoughby (Dominic Cooper), and states that he will return to check on Marianne the following day. Brandon also comes to visit, but upon seeing Willoughby, he quickly departs. Willoughby and Marianne grow close through their mutual love of poetry, and he later takes a lock of her hair. Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor begin to speculate on <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> become secretly engaged.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The Characteristics of Employment Survey {{presents}} {{information on}} all employed persons {{according to their}} status of employment. The framework below classifies jobholders to a status of employment {{on the basis of}} their main job that is, the job in which they usually worked the most hours. The status of employment category groups are: 	Employees; 	Owner managers of incorporated enterprises (OMIEs); and 	Owner managers of unincorporated enterprises (OMUEs). Employees are then further classified according to <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> paid leave entitlements, that is <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> paid sick and/or paid holiday leave, while OMIEs and OMUEs are further classified according to <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> employees.  ...|$|R

5|$|Admission to {{the school}} is through the eleven-plus examination, taken in year 6. Pupils must obtain a minimum score before their {{application}} will be considered and places will be awarded based on whether the child is in public care, whether {{he lives in the}} catchment area and attends a partnered primary school, and <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> siblings attending the school or parents working there. In the event of a tie, places will be allocated based on proximity {{to the school}}. The school has a maximum annual intake of 116 at the start of year 7 (aged 11); pupils are arranged into forms of no more than 30, where registration takes place. Their form tutors provide access to pastoral support, overseen by their Key Stage Manager. In 2013 the lower school had approximately 577 pupils on roll. The school uniform consists of a black blazer with the school badge embroidered on the breast pocket and a red braid on each pocket. Charcoal or black trousers are worn along with a white shirt and school tie.|$|E

25|$|Electrolytic {{capacitors}} {{with an open}} vent are in {{the process}} of drying out, regardless of <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> good or bad electrolyte. They always show low capacitance values and very high ohmic ESR values. Dry e-caps are therefore electrically useless.|$|E
25|$|The jury is {{composed}} of at least six assayers from the Company of Goldsmiths. They have two months to test the provided coins, and decide <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been properly minted. Criteria are given for diameter, chemical composition and weight for each class of coinage.|$|E
25|$|The {{works of}} Kurt Gödel, Alan Turing, and others shook this assumption, with the {{development}} of statements that are true but cannot be proven within the system. Two examples of the latter can be found in Hilbert's problems. Work on Hilbert's 10th problem led {{in the late twentieth century}} to the construction of specific Diophantine equations for which it is undecidable <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a solution, or even if they do, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a finite or infinite number of solutions. More fundamentally, Hilbert's first problem was on the continuum hypothesis. Gödel and Paul Cohen showed that this hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved using the standard axioms of set theory. In the view of some, then, it is equally reasonable to take either the continuum hypothesis or its negation as a new axiom.|$|E

25|$|The Obama {{administration}} has increased {{scrutiny of the}} provision of credit to poor and African American neighbourhoods. Lenders have come under investigation for not operating in such areas, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> halted service there or have never operated in them before. Former Atlantic associate editor Daniel Indiviglio attributes increasing noncompliance with the CRA to the tightening of lending requirements.|$|E
25|$|An {{official}} {{list of substances}} covered by Proposition 65 is maintained and made publicly available. Chemicals are added to or removed from the {{official list}} based on California's analysis of current scientific information.

25|$|Guidelines for {{treatment}} for specific clinical situations requires a good estimation of a person's long-term life expectancy. People {{can also use}} an 18-item questionnaire to learn <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> good knowledge and understanding about their treatment options before they choose.

25|$|Beyond {{preventing}} bullying, it is {{also important}} to consider how interventions based on emotional intelligence (EI) are important in the case that bullying does occur. Increasing EI may be an important step in trying to foster resilience among victims. When a person faces stress and adversity, especially of a repetitive nature, their ability to adapt is an important factor in <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a more positive or negative outcome.|$|E

25|$|However, Moscow under Luzhkov invited several {{restrictions}} to this rule, partially {{keeping the}} old system.

The fine for noncompliance is 2500 rubles of penalty, {{and he or she}} would have trouble getting legal employment. Moscow police frequently ask for people's identification to check <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a propiska.|$|E
25|$|There were 3 {{elimination}} rounds. In {{the first}} elimination round, 170 contestants from around Indonesia were separated in 17 groups of 10 contestants.
