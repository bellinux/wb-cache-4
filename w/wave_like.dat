25|$|However, a <b>wave</b> <b>like</b> {{this with}} {{definite}} wavelength is not localized in space, and so cannot represent a particle localized in space. To localize a particle, de Broglie proposed a superposition of different wavelengths ranging around a central {{value in a}} wave packet, a waveform often used in quantum mechanics to describe the wave function of a particle. In a wave packet, the wavelength of the particle is not precise, and the local wavelength deviates {{on either side of}} the main wavelength value.|$|E
25|$|Because f(η) is real valued, {{the three}} roots η1, η2 and η3 are either all three real, or {{otherwise}} one {{is real and}} the remaining two are a pair of complex conjugates. In the latter case, with only one real-valued root, {{there is only one}} elevation η at which f(η) is zero. And consequently also only one elevation at which the surface slope η’ is zero. However, we are looking for <b>wave</b> <b>like</b> solutions, with two elevations—the wave crest and trough (physics)—where the surface slope is zero. The conclusion is that all three roots of f(η) have to be real valued.|$|E
25|$|These {{aspects of}} third-wave {{feminism}} {{arose in the}} mid-1980s. Feminist leaders rooted in the second <b>wave</b> <b>like</b> Gloria Anzaldúa, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, Cherríe Moraga, Audre Lorde, Luisa Accati, Maxine Hong Kingston, and many other feminists of color, called for a new subjectivity in feminist voice. They wanted prominent feminist thought to consider race-related subjectivities. This focus on the intersection between race and gender remained prominent through the 1991 Hill–Thomas hearings, but began to shift with the Freedom Ride 1992, a drive to register voters in poor minority communities whose rhetoric intended to rally young feminists. For many, the rallying of the young is the common link within third-wave feminism.|$|E

25|$|At {{the date}} of my visit, the volcano had poured out, for five months continuously, a stream of lava on the Legaspi side from the very summit.

Gradually, fading as the upper surface cooled, it changed to a thousand sparkling rills among the crevices, and, as it passed beyond the line of complete vision behind the woods near the base, the fires twinkled like stars, or the scintillions of a dying conflagration. More than half of the mountain height was thus illuminated.|$|E

The Germans set out to cut the cable to the United Kingdom, as well as securing the telegraph cables to Denmark and Cuxhaven in Germany. Arendal was also important as a telegraph junction for the southern parts of Norway, with German personnel tasked to listen in on Norwegian communications. Isolating Norway from the outside world was {{an important part of the}} German effort at pacifying the Norwegian population and discouraging resistance to the occupation.|$|E
25|$|Dreams do {{not involve}} {{actually}} sensing a stimulus because, as discussed, the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner than when awake. Aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water. When they look away from that stimulus, the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a <b>wave</b> <b>like</b> motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus {{is no longer the}} focus of their attention, it leaves an impression. When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant. However, during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made. So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{a century}} later, Young and Fresnel revived the wave theory of light when {{they pointed out}} that light could be a {{transverse}} wave rather than a longitudinal wave – the polarization of a transverse <b>wave</b> (<b>like</b> Newton's [...] "sides" [...] of light) could explain birefringence, and {{in the wake of}} a series of experiments on diffraction the particle model of Newton was finally abandoned. Physicists assumed, moreover, that like mechanical waves, light waves required a medium for propagation, and thus required Huygens's idea of an aether [...] "gas" [...] permeating all space.|$|E
2500|$|All waves have a {{positive}} and negative peak, i.e. a ridge and a trough. [...] In {{the case of a}} propagating <b>wave</b> <b>like</b> a tsunami, either may be the first to arrive. [...] If the first part to arrive at shore is the ridge, a massive breaking wave or sudden flooding will be the first effect noticed on land. [...] However, if the first part to arrive is a trough, a drawback will occur as the shoreline recedes dramatically, exposing normally submerged areas. [...] Drawback can exceed hundreds of metres, and people unaware of the danger sometimes remain near the shore to satisfy their curiosity or to collect fish from the exposed seabed.|$|E
2500|$|Before Newton, Christiaan Huygens had {{hypothesized}} that light was a wave propagating through an aether. Newton rejected this idea, {{mainly on the}} ground that both men apparently could only envision light as a longitudinal <b>wave,</b> <b>like</b> sound and other mechanical waves in fluids. However, longitudinal waves necessarily have only one form for a given propagation direction, rather than two polarizations like transverse wave. Thus, longitudinal waves could not explain birefringence, in which two polarizations of light are refracted differently by a crystal. [...] Instead, Newton preferred to imagine non-spherical particles, or [...] "corpuscles", of light with different [...] "sides" [...] that give rise to birefringence. [...] In addition, Newton rejected light as waves in a medium because such a medium would have to extend everywhere in space, and would thereby [...] "disturb and retard the Motions of those great Bodies" [...] (the planets and comets) and thus [...] "as it [...] is of no use, and hinders the Operation of Nature, and makes her languish, so there is no evidence for its Existence, and therefore it ought to be rejected".|$|E
