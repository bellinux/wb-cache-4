He {{grew up in the}} borough's Manhattan Beach neighborhood, where he was [...] "raised culturally Jewish, but there was very little spiritual attendance in temple. It was a cultural thing—celebrating the holidays, knowing <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> from, knowing your history, having respect for what your people have been through." [...] He graduated from Edward R. Murrow High School. He has one sister, Patti, who attended a professional ballet school through high school. His parents would often take him to Broadway theater performances, which sparked his keen interest in show business.|$|E

500|$|The fourth track, [...] "Electric", is an {{electronic}} funk song with elements of reggae music. The title track holds a [...] "convinced relativism", according to Robert Christgau, while [...] "Main Thing", {{a cover of}} Shot's 1986 single, explores deep house, disco and funk genres. The ninth track, [...] "Giving You Back", is a piano ballad that addresses Robyn's abortion as she sings [...] "I'm giving you back to <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> from but I'm not forgetting who you are". David Schmader of The Stranger opined that it features a directness that is [...] "unprecedented in pop", and compared its piano elements {{to those found in}} Braxton's work.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV in 2006, vocalist Taylor said that Come What(ever) May was {{a return to the}} roots of the band, stating it is [...] "a lot more from the spirit of what the band started with in 1992". He noted that some songs were [...] "very atmospheric" [...] while others maintained [...] "the hard rock and the heavy stuff". Jon Wiederhorn of MTV said that [...] "for every thrash riff there's a tunefully grungy passage, for every flailing guitar line there's a rock-radio hook." [...] When talking about the track [...] "30/30-150", he said parts are [...] "bludgeoning, barbed and heavy" [...] while others are [...] "soaring and triumphant" [...] with the production of Raskulinecz helping to balance the album's heaviness with its radio-accessibility. Come What(ever) Mays lyrics include themes of [...] "pain, pleasure, happiness, and grief". The diversity in subjects is evident throughout the album; songs including [...] "Come What(ever) May" [...] were politically influenced while the track [...] "Socio" [...] is about [...] "social anxiety attacks" [...] that Taylor suffered. [...] "Zzyzx Rd" [...] is a love song written to Taylor's wife for helping him in his struggles against alcoholism and contemplation of suicide. [...] "I've never written anything like that before, but it was very important for me to tell the world not only how much she saved me, but how much she means to me," [...] said Taylor. Taylor said there is a common thread with the lyrics throughout the album, saying that they are [...] "about never forgetting <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> from, who you are and why you do this." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{representative}} for Jive Records stated that although Spears {{was working in}} the studio, [...] "no album is scheduled at the moment" [...] and [...] "there are no plans to service 'Mona Lisa' to radio." [...] "Mona Lisa" [...] was released in a bonus CD included with the video of [...] (2005). Spears gave birth to her first son, Sean Preston, on September 14, 2005. In an interview with People in February 2006, Spears explained that she was anxious to resume her career, commenting she missed [...] "traveling [...] the road, seeing different places and being with the dancers and having fun. That feeling of being on the stage, knowing it's your best – I love that. I needed a break. I needed to be hungry again." [...] When asked about her next album, she said she had been experimenting in her home studio with live musicians, stripping down her sound and playing the piano. Spears wanted the album to represent her Louisiana roots, explaining that she grew up listening to blues. [...] "When I was little, I would listen to myself [...] But the record label signs you, and you're just thankful to get a hit song. You can't really show off your voice and <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> from. I would like to try to have more influences of that sound. Not that I'm going to be like frickin' Tina Turner. But you never know", she stated. She also said that she hoped the album would reinvigorate the current pop scene, adding that [...] "It's been boring. Nothing's been wow to me." [...] On May 9, 2006, Spears announced she was pregnant with her second child. A few days later, producers such as J. R. Rotem and Sean Garrett told MTV News they were working with Spears.

2500|$|In 2012, Anderson {{participated in}} the SBS doco-reality show Go Back To <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Came</b> From, in which six Australians, each with differing {{opinions}} on Australia's asylum seeker debate, were taken on a journey to which refugees have taken to reach Australia. At {{the outset of the}} series Anderson says that [...] "boat people" [...] who arrive in Australia illegally should be sent back to their countries of origin: [...] "If you come here illegally, I don't care about your story, first thing you do is you turn around and go back." [...] Later in the series, after having met with refugees from Afghanistan who settled in Melbourne as well as visiting war-torn Kabul, Anderson softened his stand on the subject: [...] "Now I've been here and spoken to people, I don't want to turn away refugees, I don't want to turn away people who need to be reunited with their families. I don't want that. Who would want that? [...] I don't want people to go on suffering needlessly, when we can give them somewhere safe to be. But I don't want them to come to Australia in boats." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{match for}} St Kilda against Collingwood in Round 4 of the 1993 season, Winmar was racially abused {{by members of the}} Collingwood cheersquad, who yelled for him to [...] "go and sniff some petrol" [...] and [...] "go walkabout <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> from". At the {{conclusion}} of the game, which St Kilda won by 22 points, Winmar lifted up his jumper and, facing to the crowd, pointed to his skin. The following day, a photograph (pictured right) of Winmar's gesture, taken by Wayne Ludbey, was published in the Sunday Age under the headline [...] "Winmar: I'm black and proud of it", with the Sunday Herald Sun publishing a similar photograph under the caption [...] "I've got guts". Winmar's gesture, described as a [...] "powerful statement", an [...] "anti-racist symbol", and one of the [...] "most poignant" [...] images in Australian sport, has been credited as a catalyst for the movement against racism in Australian football, and compared to the black power salute performed by American athletes at the 1968 Summer Olympics in terms of impact. The event inspired Indigenous singer-songwriter Archie Roach to write the song [...] "Colour of Your Jumper". The photograph is reproduced in The Game That Made Australia, a mural painted by Jamie Cooper and commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the origins of Australian rules football. Tony Albert included a watercolour of the photograph in a collage titled Once upon a time, winner of the 2014 Basil Sellers Art Prize.|$|E
