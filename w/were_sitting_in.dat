5|$|In 1928, Hastings became {{involved}} in the Savidge Inquiry. Sir Leo Chiozza Money was a noted journalist, economist and former Liberal MP. On 23 April 1928, he and Miss Irene Savidge <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> Hyde Park in London when they were arrested by two plain-clothes police officers and taken to the nearest police station, where they were charged under the Parks Regulation Act 1872 with committing an indecent offence. The next morning, they were remanded for a week at Great Marlborough Street Police Court. At the next hearing a week later, the case was dismissed by the magistrate, who criticised the police for failing to contact a man seen running through the park to establish some kind of corroborative evidence, and failing to report at once to Scotland Yard to avoid having to charge the defendants immediately.|$|E
5|$|In December 1958 Ngo Dinh NhuDiem's {{younger brother}} and chief adviserbroached {{the idea of}} {{orchestrating}} a coup to overthrow Sihanouk. Nhu contacted Dap Chhuon, Sihanouk's Interior Minister, who {{was known for his}} pro-American sympathies, to prepare for the coup against his boss. Chhuon received covert financial and military assistance from Thailand, South Vietnam, and the CIA. In January 1959 Sihanouk learned of the coup plans through intermediaries who were in contact with Chhuon. The following month, Sihanouk sent the army to capture Chhuon, who was summarily executed {{as soon as he was}} captured, effectively ending the coup attempt. Sihanouk then accused South Vietnam and the United States of orchestrating the coup attempt. Six months later, on 31August 1959, a small packaged lacquer gift, which was fitted with a parcel bomb, was delivered to the royal palace. Norodom Vakrivan, the chief of protocol, was killed instantly when he opened the package. Sihanouk's parents, Suramarit and Kossamak, who <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> another room not far from Vakrivan, narrowly escaped unscathed. An investigation traced the origin of the parcel bomb to an American military base in Saigon. While Sihanouk publicly accused Ngo Dinh Nhu of masterminding the bomb attack, he secretly suspected that the US was also involved. The incident deepened his distrust of the US.|$|E

He suffered minor superficial injuries, but Freund was shot twice and died several hours later at the hospital. Neither victim had seen their attacker(s).|$|E
25|$|As of March 1941, 300 tonnes of this {{material}} would, on average, traverse the Trans-Siberian Railway every day {{on its way to}} Germany. According to one analysis of the natural rubber supply chain, as of 22 March 1941, 5800 tonnes of this essential material were transiting on the Soviet railway network between the borders of Manchukuo and the Third Reich, 2000 tonnes were transiting Manchukuo, 4000 tonnes <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> Dairen, 3800 tonnes were in Japan, and 5700 tonnes, on the way from South-East Asia to Japan.|$|E

25|$|In November 2000, Still became Barnet's {{director}} of football following the high-profile appointment of former England international Tony Cottee as player-manager. At the time, Barnet <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> tenth {{place in the}} league, but soon suffered a sharp loss of form and plunged down the table to the relegation zone. On 16 March 2001, Cottee left after losing 13 of his 19 league matches as manager and Still returned to lead the team {{for the remainder of}} the season. He was unable to prevent Barnet's slide back into the Football Conference, as a 3–2 defeat at home to Torquay United on the final day of the season saw them relegated and end a decade-long stay in the Football League. Still agreed to remain as both the club's manager and {{director of}} football until a replacement could be found, with Barnet intending to promote youth team coach and former Norwich City defender Ian Culverhouse to manager. However, Culverhouse left the club in January 2001 to become youth team coach at Leyton Orient and Still subsequently resigned as manager one month later. At the time, Barnet were 14th in the table, winless in seven league matches and had been knocked out of the FA Trophy.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} morning, up to 100 protesters {{took to the}} street in Saar village, west of Manama. The protest was {{peaceful}} and protesters were chanting anti-government slogans and waving Bahraini flags, witnesses said. Shortly {{before the arrival of}} security forces, the protest dispersed peacefully. In another village south of Manama, the MoI reported that an Asian worker trying to open a blocked road was injured after getting attacked with molotov cocktails and that a main road in Muharraq was blocked with burning tires. It described both incidents as [...] "terrorism". Protests were also held in Malkiya, Juffair and Sitra where protesters held peaceful sit-ins and formed human chains. Some protesters <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> front of their houses, still they were attacked by security forces, witnesses reported. A video posted on YouTube showed police arresting and beating two men who <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> front of a house.|$|E
500|$|Her {{books were}} very popular during the Great Depression and World War II. Her novels, which {{journalist}} Lesley McDowell described as containing [...] "derring-do, dashing blades, and maids in peril", allowed readers {{to escape from}} the mundane and difficult elements of their lives. In a letter describing her novel Friday's Child, Heyer commented, [...] "'I think myself I ought to be shot for writing such nonsense. ... But it's unquestionably good escapist literature and I think I should rather like it if I <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> an air-raid shelter or recovering from flu." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Mars was a {{struggling}} singer-songwriter, and Levine was a producer looking {{to work with}} new songwriters. Lawrence was the first guest at Levine's studio (Levcon Studios); they had previously worked together after being introduced by a mutual friend. One day Mars and Lawrence <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the car with no money in their pockets {{when they decided to}} try producing for themselves and enlisted the help of Levine who contributed his equipment and expertise in drum programming, sampling and other electronic sounds that dominate. In 2009, The Smeezingtons settled in Hollywood. After creating the team, [...] they worked over 10 hours every day for two years.|$|E
500|$|In {{a larger}} event in 1966 in San Francisco, drag queens, hustlers, and transvestites <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> Compton's Cafeteria {{when the police}} arrived to arrest men dressed as women. A riot ensued, with the patrons of the {{cafeteria}} slinging cups, plates, and saucers, and breaking the plexiglass windows {{in the front of}} the restaurant, and returning several days later to smash the windows again after they were replaced. Professor Susan Stryker classifies the Compton's Cafeteria riot as an [...] "act of anti-transgender discrimination, rather than an act of discrimination against sexual orientation" [...] and connects the uprising to the issues of gender, race, and class that were being downplayed by homophile organizations. It marked the beginning of transgender activism in San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|Ragan, who was {{the leader}} before the fifteenth caution, {{described}} his frustration after being black flagged by saying, [...] "It was tough to swallow.

So it's tough, but there is a bright side– we finished, we got some points and we ran up front, but we just didn't get what we come down here to do." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Down Beat magazine found Waters's singing [...] "forced and artificial", writing that Folk Singer {{suffers from a}} major flaw: [...] "He only begins to {{come close to the}} power and unforced intensity of the original numbers and style from time to time, as on 'You Gonna Need My Help' and 'My Home Is in the Delta'". In a retrospective review, Cub Koda, writing for AllMusic was more enthusiastic, deeming the record's sound fresh and vital. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Folk Singer number 280 on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of AllTime", writing that the [...] "unplugged" [...] playing was pioneering and has since been [...] "beloved by blues and folk fans alike". In a 1994 issue of Rolling Stone, a reviewer wrote, [...] "...There aren't too many blues albums that qualify as audiophile recordings, but Muddy Waters Folk Singer surely does. A wonderfully intimate session, it delivers Waters' voice in all its power and subtlety, while rendering his guitar work...with such vivid realism, you would think you <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the studio...." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bart to the Future" [...] {{was written}} by Dan Greaney and {{directed}} by Michael Marcantel {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). It was the second episode of the series to show the Simpson family's life in the future, following the season six episode [...] "Lisa's Wedding" [...] that aired five years earlier in 1995. Three more future-set episodes have been released since [...] "Bart to the Future", the first being Future-Drama (season 16, 2005), second being [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] (season 23, 2011) and third being [...] "Days of Future Future" [...] (season 25, 2014). Greaney's inspiration for [...] "Bart to the Future" [...] came from [...] "Lisa's Wedding". He and The Simpsons writer Matt Selman <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> Greaney's office one day, {{trying to come up with}} new episode stories, when they received the idea of making a companion piece to that episode. Greaney wanted to write an episode set in the future that focused on Bart instead of Lisa. He thought it would be interesting to explore how the future works out for [...] "a guy like Bart, who doesn't pay attention to school work and is all about being cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after, Barker, Corbett and Josephine Tewson {{performed}} a sketch about Henry VIII at the 1971 BAFTAs, with Barker playing Henry. The two {{also had to}} keep the audience entertained for eight or so minutes as the show was stopped because of technical difficulties. Their performance at the award show impressed the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton and Controller of BBC One Paul Fox, who <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the audience. Not knowing they were both essentially unemployed, although still contracted to Paradine, Cotton signed the duo up for their own show together, and a series each on their own; he later joked he [...] "must have offered them too much money." [...] Barker and Corbett wished to avoid being remembered primarily as a duo, and felt they could not {{work in the same}} way as a conventional double act like Morecambe and Wise, and so each maintained their solo careers as well. They each were given a one-off variety special; Barker's, called The Ronnie Barker Yearbook, featured a sketch for each month of the year, although because of time constraints the first two had to be cut. Barker also reprised his character Lord Rustless in the sitcom His Lordship Entertains in 1972. Barker wrote all seven episodes, again with the pseudonym Jonathan Cobbald.|$|E
