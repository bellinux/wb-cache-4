5|$|The {{most basic}} {{property}} of the Reuleaux triangle {{is that it has}} constant width, meaning that for every pair of parallel supporting lines (two lines of the same slope that both touch the shape without crossing through it) the two lines have the same Euclidean distance from each other, regardless of the orientation of these lines. In any pair of parallel supporting lines, one of the two lines <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> touch the triangle at one of its vertices. The other supporting line may touch the triangle at any point on the opposite arc, and their distance (the width of the Reuleaux triangle) equals the radius of this arc.|$|E

25|$|Every finite {{connected}} {{undirected graph}} {{has at least}} one Trémaux tree. One can construct such a tree by performing a depth-first search and connecting each vertex (other than the starting vertex of the search) to the earlier vertex from which it was discovered. The tree constructed in this way is known as a depth-first search tree. If uv is an arbitrary edge in the graph, and u is the earlier of the two vertices to be reached by the search, then v must belong to the subtree descending from u in the depth-first search tree, because the search <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> discover v while it is exploring this subtree, either from one of the other vertices in the subtree or, failing that, from u directly. Every finite Trémaux tree can be generated as a depth-first search tree: If T is a Trémaux tree of a finite graph, and a depth-first search explores the children in T of each vertex prior to exploring any other vertices, it <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> generate T as its depth-first search tree.|$|E
25|$|The will {{does not}} precede the intellect but follows upon it. The <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> desires {{that which is}} {{presented}} {{to it as a}} good in every respect satisfying the appetite. But it freely chooses among the many goods that are presented to it as desirable according to a changeable judgment or evaluation. Consequently, the choice follows the final practical judgment. But the will is the cause of it being the final one.|$|E

This is the first time a same-sex marriage is admitted in Italy, but the judgment does not imply that this <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> be the case in general terms.|$|E

25|$|Since Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam are traced by single genes via {{a single}} ancestral parent line, {{the time to}} these genetic MRCAs <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> be greater than that for the genealogical MRCA. This is because single genes will {{coalesce}} more slowly than tracing of conventional human genealogy via both parents. The latter considers only individual humans, without taking into account whether any gene from the computed MRCA actually survives in every single person in the current population.|$|E
25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{negative}} effects of diseconomies of scale, a firm must stick to the lowest average output cost and try to recognise any external diseconomies of scale. Moreover, on reaching the lowest average cost, a firm must either expand to other countries to increase demand for its products, or seek new markets or produce new products that do not compete with its original products. However, neither of these actions <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> eliminate communications and management problems often associated with large organisations.|$|E

25|$|Because {{each cell}} of a sannin shogi board is a hexagon {{rather than a}} {{rectangle}} as in other shogi variants, the pieces <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> move differently. Instead of four faces with adjacent squares and four corners, for eight directions total, there are six each {{for a total of}} twelve. However, except for castling and the promoted king, which is reminiscent of the queen of Western chess (indeed, it moves like the queen in Gliński's hexagonal chess), the pieces are fair analogues of their standard-shōgi counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Writers have {{described}} Mommsen's history as transformative of prior works on ancient Rome. He employed new sources, e.g., ancient inscriptions, {{in order to}} gain new insights. He also wrote in a new fashion. Yet his point of view itself was new, a product of his own life and times, a 19th-century outlook from middle Europe. From the vantage point of our latter era, the 19th-century view presents a result that appears now as somewhat of a distortion. On the other hand, each individual's outlook <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> encompass unique insights.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{probability}} density now appears as the fourth {{component of a}} relativistic vector and not a simple scalar as in the Schrödinger equation, it {{will be subject to}} the usual effects of the Lorentz transformations such as time dilation. Thus, for example, atomic processes that are observed as rates, <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> be adjusted in a way consistent with relativity, while those involving the measurement of energy and momentum, which themselves form a relativistic vector, will undergo parallel adjustment which preserves the relativistic covariance of the observed values.|$|E

25|$|Of course, {{not all of}} the {{possible}} states of a multi-state molecule or complex <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> be populated. Indeed, in systems where the number of possible states is far greater than that of molecules in the compartment (e.g. the cell), they cannot be. In some cases, empirical information can be used to rule out certain states if, for instance, some combinations of features are incompatible. In the absence of such information, however, all possible states need to be considered a priori. In such cases, computational modeling can be used to uncover to what extent the different states are populated.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that leading mathematicians tend to have {{particularly}} low Erdős numbers. For example, the roughly 268,000 mathematicians with a known Erdős number have a median value of 5. In contrast, the median Erdős number of Fields Medalists is 3. As of 2015, approximately 11,000 mathematicians have an Erdős number of 2 or less. Collaboration distances <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> increase over long time scales, as mathematicians with low Erdős numbers die and become unavailable for collaboration. The American Mathematical Society provides a free online tool to determine the Erdős number of every mathematical author listed in the Mathematical Reviews catalogue.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle argued {{at length}} against {{many aspects of}} Plato's forms, {{creating}} his own doctrine of hylomorphism wherein form and matter coexist. Ultimately however, Aristotle's aim was to perfect a theory of forms, rather than to reject it. Although Aristotle strongly rejected the independent existence Plato attributed to forms, his metaphysics do agree with Plato's a priori considerations quite often. For example, Aristotle argues that changeless, eternal substantial form is necessarily immaterial. Because matter provides a stable substratum {{for a change in}} form, matter always has the potential to change. Thus, if given an eternity in which to do so, it <b>will,</b> <b>necessarily,</b> exercise that potential.|$|E

25|$|The {{wide range}} in the {{percentages}} of aromatic compounds that may be present in each concentration means that the terminology of extrait, EdP, EdT, and EdC is quite imprecise. Although an EdP will often be more concentrated than an EdT and in turn an EdC, {{this is not always}} the case. Different perfumeries or perfume houses assign different amounts of oils to each of their perfumes. Therefore, although the oil concentration of a perfume in EdP dilution <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> be higher than the same perfume in EdT from within a company's same range, the actual amounts vary among perfume houses. An EdT from one house may have a higher concentration of aromatic compounds than an EdP from another.|$|E
25|$|The bowler is {{credited}} in the statistics with having taken a wicket if the batsman is out bowled, LBW, caught, stumped, or hit wicket. If {{the ball is}} a no ball then the batsman cannot be out {{in any of these}} ways. The bowler is not credited with having taken a wicket if the batsman is run out, hits the ball twice, or obstructs the field; these dismissals may occur even when the delivery is a no ball. The fieldsman {{is credited}} in the statistics with a dismissal if he takes a catch or a stumping (for a stumping this <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> be the wicket-keeper), and may be credited on scorecards for a run-out (although a run-out will not be credited to a player's statistics).|$|E
25|$|The third {{argument}} {{is given the}} most examination by the Court. In order to determine if decisions subsequent to Aguilar have actually undermined it or the basis for its findings, the Court examines the cases and the changes in views since that decision was made. The Court notes that it has {{moved away from the}} idea that a public employee teaching in a parochial school <b>will</b> <b>necessarily</b> inculcate some of the religious messages inherent in their pervasively sectarian environment. It notes, for example, that in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist. the Court ruled that it was permissible for a deaf student to have a state-sponsored interpreter attend his Catholic high school in the performance of her duties. In this vein, the Court concludes that to consider a public employee's presence in a religious school inappropriate in and of itself would put far too much emphasis on form over substance.|$|E
