500|$|On June 29, 1940—a Saturday {{morning when}} few {{inquisitive}} studio executives would be around—Welles began filming Citizen Kane. After the disappointment of having Heart of Darkness cancelled, Welles followed Ferguson's suggestion and deceived RKO {{into believing that}} he was simply shooting camera tests. [...] "But we were shooting the picture," [...] Welles said, [...] "because <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> started and be already into it before anybody knew about it." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{over twenty}} years of {{parliamentary}} majorities, Liberal ministers did as they wished {{with little regard for}} the opposition parties. The Mackenzie King and St. Laurent governments laid the groundwork for the welfare state, a development initially opposed by many Tories. C.D. Howe, considered one of the leading forces of the St. Laurent government, told his Tory opponents when they alleged that the Liberals would abolish tariffs if the people would let them, [...] "Who would stop us?... Don't take yourselves too seriously. If <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away with it, who would stop us?" ...|$|E
500|$|The title track, Loughnan's [...] "Big Red Rock", is an eight-and-a-half minute {{instrumental}} {{described by}} Juke Magazine as [...] "expertly capturing the stark loneliness and cosmic tranquility one gets standing before their namesake rock". According to Loughnan, the atmosphere {{they wanted to}} create was [...] "that spacey sort of feeling—like desert and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{the sound of the}} didgeridoo—which we did electronically". Doyle imitated a didgeridoo by playing guitar with a wah-wah pedal. Tony Catterall of The Canberra Times praised [...] "Big Red Rock", saying that it [...] "suggests the huge expanse of the outback, then takes you to the Aboriginal secrets [...] the power surrounding the area [...] in a burst of truly inspired musicianship".|$|E

500|$|Matheos asked Opeth vocalist and guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt {{to write}} lyrics and perform vocals on one track, which would become [...] "Stockholm". Matheos and Moore sent him the track {{they wanted him}} to work on, and he sent back a rough mix of his vocals. [...] "We were really happy with it," [...] Moore said. [...] "We didn't do any {{revisions}} or ask for any changes, like we were expecting to... It was a different approach than I would have taken, and that's what was refreshing about it. That's why <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> somebody else to do some vocals on the album." [...] Tim Bowness of No-Man wrote lyrics and performed vocals on [...] "No Celebrations", a bonus track.|$|E
500|$|By 1975, punk {{was being}} used to {{describe}} acts {{as diverse as the}} Patti Smith Group, the Bay City Rollers, and Bruce Springsteen. As the scene at New York's CBGB club attracted notice, a name was sought for the developing sound. Club owner Hilly Kristal called the movement [...] "street rock"; John Holmstrom credits Aquarian magazine with using punk [...] "to describe what was going on at CBGBs". Holmstrom, McNeil, and Ged Dunn's magazine Punk, which debuted at the end of 1975, was crucial in codifying the term. [...] "It was pretty obvious that the word was getting very popular", Holmstrom later remarked. [...] "We figured we'd take the name before anyone else claimed it. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of the bullshit, strip it down to rock 'n' roll. We wanted the fun and liveliness back." ...|$|E
500|$|The early 1950s saw {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} in Canada; in most years there was a government surplus. In 1951, the Government introduced an old age pension for Canadians to receive {{from the age of}} 70. With little unemployment and thus a surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, coverage was extended to seasonal workers, such as fishermen. St. Laurent's supervision of his ministers was minimal at the start of his tenure, and decreased as the years passed. With the Opposition few in numbers, ministers did as they wanted, and when Howe was accused by British Columbia Tory MP Howard Green in 1951 of being willing to end tariffs if the people would let him, Howe replied, [...] "Who would stop us? [...] Don't take yourself too seriously. If <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away with it, who would stop us?" ...|$|E

500|$|After {{playing at}} a few gigs with Deftones in California, United States, Korn {{went back to the}} studio to start {{recording}} Life Is Peachy in April 1996. Korn asked Ross Robinson to produce, and wanted to begin recording at Indigo Ranch, mostly because their first album had been recorded there and was a success. Authors Jason Arnopp and Doug Small, insisted the album was rushed when it was put together. Silveria explained, [...] "We went in really fresh, and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it done quickly to capture that moment. So it was probably about sixty percent knowing what I was going to play and forty percent just playing whatever came to mind at that moment, It ended up really good, and it has a kind of energy I probably wouldn't have gotten if I'd worked everything out beforehand." [...] Korn's bassist Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu said, [...] "We wanted that same energy and inspiration we found up in the Malibu Hills." ...|$|E
500|$|The I EP {{contains}} a single, 21-minute song of complex arrangements {{and was a}} hint of the forthcoming album, 2005's Catch Thirtythree. The EP, which was never played live by the band, was written and recorded during jamming sessions of Haake and Thordendal. On Catch Thirtythree, Meshuggah again used eight-string guitars, but utilized programmed drums for the first time also for the release, with the exception of two songs from 2001's compilation Rare Trax. The album was self-produced by the band and was recorded at the studio that Meshuggah shares with Clawfinger. Hagström notes, [...] "The eight-strings really have given us a whole new musical vocabulary to work with. Part of it is the restrictions they impose: you really can't play power chords with them; the sound just turns to mush. Instead, we concentrated on coming up with really unusual single-note parts, new tunings and chord voicings. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> as far away from any kind of conventions and traditions as we could on the album, so the guitars worked out beautifully." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} how they worked {{hard to make the}} {{animation}} believable, saying: [...] "It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator {{to be able to put}} some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way." ...|$|E

500|$|Inclement weather {{continued}} {{to disrupt the}} Saturday's proceedings as qualifying was delayed multiple times before being ultimately rescheduled for Sunday morning. Many drivers backed the decision, with Jenson Button saying: [...] "It {{was the right thing}} to do [...] In one respect, maybe if we decided three hours earlier it would have been better for the fans. But <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out there and drive and put on a show. Delaying it every half an hour was the way it had to be." [...] During the waiting period on Saturday, many teams had engaged in tomfoolery in the paddock to entertain the crowds, such as bowling or ballroom dancing between Red Bull teammates Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat. Ferrari later condemned the behaviour of their fellow teams, with team principal Maurizio Arrivabene saying: [...] "We are a Formula One team, not the Cirque du Soleil." [...] Kimi Räikkönen backed him, stating: [...] "I think this is F1 and not the circus. The people are obviously not happy when we're not running but we cannot make them happy with whatever we do apart from running." ...|$|E
500|$|Shearer {{said in an}} {{interview}} that [...] "The animating impulse was to do rock 'n' roll right. The four of us had been around rock 'n' roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it right." [...] When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, [...] "No, this is a story that's pretty familiar to people. We're not introducing them to anything they don't really know," [...] so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public. The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a cult following, after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema and it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".|$|E
500|$|The storyline {{idea was}} {{developed}} by head writer and co-executive producer Sally Sussman Morina. For this storyline, the soap opera partnered with the American Heart Association in order to highlight the issue of women's heart health. Executive producer Mal Young felt that the character of Jill was the [...] "perfect choice to show how a woman’s life can dramatically change {{as a result of}} heart disease." [...] He further mentioned that [...] "Along with providing us with some very emotional and dramatic episodes, the subject also gives us the opportunity to educate and highlight a very pertinent issue using characters our viewers know well. As well as seeing how it affects Jill as she comes to terms with her condition, the story will also illustrate how it impacts her family and those closest to her." [...] The producers considered Jill to be the right character to tackle this issue due to her being the show's longest-running character, as well as other factors: her unhealthy lifestyle, age and [...] "bullish personality that would deny anything was wrong". Following the episode where Jill is diagnosed, Walton appeared in a public service announcement urging viewers to visit the American Heart Association website. Young knew that the soap opera had to be [...] "very responsible", stating: [...] "We did not want to sensationalize this. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the facts in {{while at the same time}} telling a good, dramatic story." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{at least}} July 1999, Monolith {{has decided to}} {{introduce}} many major changes to the game; the main reason being that the gaming press unexpectedly started comparing the game to James Bond games, like GoldenEye 007 (1997). Hubbard mentioned that their intention was to [...] "make a 60s spy game", and that they [...] "didn't {{want to make a}} 'Bond' style game, so when people were obviously drawing that comparison, we decided to rework things a bit. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from the Bond comparisons that people were making, so we've changed the main character and the back-story a fair amount." [...] As a result, the player controls a female protagonist in the final game, Cate Archer, who works for an organization called UNITY. Changing the main character to a woman not only helped the separation of the game from the Bond franchise, but also allowed for [...] "more interesting dramatic possibilities", and the [...] "list of gadgets got a lot more visually interesting". As Hubbard said, before switching to a female protagonist, he had been [...] "struggling with trying to distinguish him from all the other male superspies from the era—extraordinarily handsome, intelligent, knowledgeable, resourceful, and so on. But a woman with those same characteristics immediately stood out because of the social climate of the time. No matter how qualified she might be, she'd have to overcome some serious barriers just {{to get a chance to}} prove herself. And if things didn't go flawlessly on a mission, she'd catch more heat than she deserved." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E
2500|$|Shannon Larkin {{described}} {{the sound of}} the upcoming album as a return to the band original sound, stating that [...] "Whiskey Hangover is a good clue, and that's what we're going for. It's more simplistic than the last record — less bluesy, more heavy, but you know <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to the original sound of the band and what made this band happen in the first place….simple heavy rock, so that's where we're kind of shooting for on this one." ...|$|E

2500|$|... “I am so {{very happy}} with this record—both with the {{performances}} and the production. Blood, sweat and tears went into its making. It was the longest we’d spent on anything ever we’ve done. We knew how we wanted it to sound and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it perfect, so yeah, we {{spent a long time}} on it. And I tell you; we had {{to make a lot of}} tough choices, with the sequencing. We wanted it to be perfect, we wanted all the different energies to flow into each other just so.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In between tours, Holder and Lea {{got down}} to what Holder called some [...] "serious writing". In mid-1975, the band booked {{themselves}} into New York's Record Plant and recorded the album Nobody's Fools. Speaking in a 1976 fan club interview, Holder said of recording an album in America: [...] "The album is why {{we went to the}} States, not for tax reasons, folks! <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> fresh ideas, we felt we were getting a bit stale living in England." [...] For the album, songwriters Holder and Lea drew much inspiration from living in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|Doctor Who and the Sea Devils, also by Hulke {{features}} {{a conversation between}} the Doctor and Jo Grant where the Doctor states [...] "We used to be great friends. Hundreds of years ago, when we were both young Time Lords, we were inseparable. After all, {{we had a lot}} in common." [...] Asked for an example, the Doctor replies [...] "You know the Golden Rule of the Time Lords – just to sit and watch but never actually do anything? He and I are different. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out into the Universe, to meet other species, to explore." [...] Jo asks [...] "one for good and the other for evil?", to which the Doctor responds [...] "Yes, you could say that." ...|$|E
