Labelling construction toys as boys’ toys and craft or dolls as girls’ toys restricts play. Play is important and different types toys help hone different skills. Telling girls that construction and science toys are for boys we limit what they think they can achieve before they've even had the chance to try it out. … There's nothing wrong with giving a girl a doll for Christmas, or a boy a car - but children need a variety of play.

I think there's a way that Robert did some of the story that we're reaching that had a real past to it, where people are referring to some things in the past in the comic. And we're able to portray some of that backstory in some ways that you didn't get to see in the comic." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2016/2017 Kristof Magnusson {{took part}} in the project „Frankfurt, Deine Geschichte. Literatur in einfacher Sprache“ (“Frankfurt, your history. Literature in simple German“) {{initiated}} by the Frankfurt Literature House, the Historic Museum Frankfurt and the Administrative Department for Inclusion of the City of Frankfurt. Six authors, alongside Magnusson Henning Ahrens, Mirko Bonné, Nora Bossong, Olga Grjasnowa und Alissa Walser, wrote texts about Frankfurt’s history in simple German and developed a set of rules for this purpose.In an article about the project, Magnusson wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung concerning the impact of the set of rules: “The rules for simple language, which seem to expel any literaricity from a text, suddenly - now that a group of authors has framed them before writing - appear as an artistic manifest that turns minimalism into a virtue.“ He spoke for “putting a greater effort in searching for fields in which we can usefully reduce barriers. Then we will realize that simple language can enrich us: As a chance for a fairer society, as an invitation for thinking about language, for artistic experiment, for playing.“Asked about topics and language of his texts in simple German, Magnusson stated: “I take a different approach to topics when I know I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> in easy German. For instance, I decided to write about the murder of Rosemarie Nitribitt, a Frankfurt prostitute in the 1950s. That is a really interesting story, and it is easy to tell. It’s about sex and violence; everyone gets that. (...) I try to tell a story in a simple way, usually from just one perspective, and not using too much reflection, and then I figure out what to write instead. Motives played a large role (...). (...) Working with simple language is interesting. Aspects emerge that you might otherwise never have thought of.“ ...|$|E

5000|$|No {{nation can}} afford a {{constant}} revolt from below {{if it wants to}} pass the test of history.The Movement must come to a standstill some day; at some time a stable social structure must emerge, maintained by an impartial judiciary and by an undisputed state authority. Nothing can be achieved through everlasting dynamics. Germany must not go adrift on uncharted seas toward unknown shores, with no one knowing when it will stop. History moves on its own; it is unnecessary to drive it on incessantly. If therefore the German revolution should experience a second wave of new life, then not as a social revolution, but as the creative culmination of work already begun. The statesman is there to create standards; the state and the people are his only concerns. The state is the sole power and the last guarantor of something to which every citizen can lay claim: iron-clad justice. Therefore, the state also cannot endure any dualism in the long term, and the success of the German Revolution and the future of our nation depend on whether a satisfactory solution can be found to the dualism between party and state.The Government is well informed on all the self-interest, lack of character, want of truth, unchivalrous conduct, and arrogance trying to rear its head under cover of the German Revolution. It is also not deceived {{about the fact that the}} rich store of confidence bestowed upon it by the German people is threatened. If one wishes a close proximity to and a close connection with the people, one must not underestimate the good sense of the people; one must return their confidence and not constantly <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> what to do. The German people know that their situation is serious; they feel the economic distress; they are perfectly aware of the defects of many laws conditioned by the emergency; they have a discerning feeling for violence and injustice; they smile at clumsy attempts to deceive them with false optimism. No organization and no propaganda, no matter how good, will in the long run be able to retain trust. I have therefore viewed the wave of propaganda against the so-called petty critics differently from many others. Confidence and readiness to cooperate cannot be won by incitement, especially of youth, nor by threats against helpless segments of the people, but only by discussion with the people with trust on both sides. The people know that great sacrifices are expected from them. They will bear them and follow the Führer with unwavering loyalty, if they are allowed to have their part in the planning and in the work, if every word of criticism is not taken for ill will, and if despairing patriots are not branded as enemies of the state. …" ...|$|E
