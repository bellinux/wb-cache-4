50|$|Each {{question}} as is {{shown on the}} screen consists of two slides, one for question and one for answer. The question slide usually includes introduction that is meant both to help find out {{the answer to the}} question and to describe the subject more, and the question itself. The answer slide includes a detailed explanation of the answer. The goal of Protmušis is not only to entertain but to expand the knowledge of the players and the spectators as well, therefore, the questions that are related to interesting subjects that are not widely known to the general public, but are <b>worth</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known,</b> are especially valued.

40|$|Abstract:- Forces {{that occur}} into various {{manufacturing}} processes usually are <b>worth</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> {{because of their}} key role in determining geometrical precision of the manufactured parts, in influencing technological system’s rigidity and in reducing energy consumption. The innovative device for measuring these forces {{is characterized by the}} shape and dimensions of the elastic element that proves good signal decoupling and the possibility to use it in various manufacturing processes types. The device’s prototype was obtained and tested so that, its rigidity characteristics and calibration equations to be determined. Experimented while manufacturing, both in machining and metal forming process, and aided by a LabVIEW data acquisition system, the device made possible the exact determination of each force’s component as well as of whole process force’s modulus. Key-Words:- elastic element, manufacturing force, calibration equations, rigidity characteristic...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this course is an {{introductory}} study of computational complexity and cryptography. The first part introduces the concept of computational complexity {{by looking at the}} basic arithmetic operations, i. e., addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Then matrix multiplication is touched. In order to prepare everything we need later for public-key cryptography, we continue with number theoretic problems and study several algorithms including modular exponentiation, primality testing and taking discrete roots. In the following, we introduce well-known complexity classes, look at complete problems and finish with probabilistic complexity classes. There is also an appendix comprising additional material that had to be omitted due to the introductory character of this course, but may be <b>worth</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known.</b> The second part is devoted to cryptography. After a short historical sketch we deal with public-key cryptography in some more detail, look at authentication and cryptographic protocols, and finish with a more detailed study of digital signatures. Again, there is an appendix containing material for further reading. There will be a midterm problem set and a final report problem set each worth 100 points. So your grade will be based on these 200 points. Note that the course is demanding. But this is just in line with William S. Clark's encouragement Of course, nowadays, we would reformulate this encouragement as Boys, be ambitious! Girls and Boys, be ambitious...|$|E
