Shortly before its release, Eminem reported in a press statement: [...] "Joseph and I worked pretty closely together to make sure <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> right".

500|$|Gorillaz are a British virtual band {{created in}} 1998 by Damon Albarn of rock band Blur, and Jamie Hewlett, co-creator {{of the comic}} book Tank Girl. While {{watching}} MTV, Hewlett {{came up with the}} idea to create the band, and later commented, [...] "if you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell – there's nothing of substance there. So <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that." [...] Gorillaz is a virtual band consisting of four cartoon characters: 2D, Murdoc, Noodle and Russel. They are used in promotional material such as album covers, posters, and in concerts, during which holographic versions of the characters are used. The band's music is a collaboration between various musicians; Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor. Gorillaz have released five studio albums, all on the Parlophone and Virgin record labels: Gorillaz (2001), Demon Days (2005), Plastic Beach (2010), The Fall (digital in 2010, physical in 2011), Humanz (2017).|$|E

[...] Belles praised the expressing animation, writing that [...] "the already incredible art has also improved, with a wider variety of styles being used." [...] A review from Republibot of {{the first part of the}} episode called the plot [...] "an interesting revisit of the premise of the pilot [...] ". Furthermore, the review called John de Lancie's performance [...] "superb" [...] and praised the animation. Reviews for part two were positive as well.

The website's consensus reads, [...] "A move from New York to Hollywood gives Agent Carter new territory to explore, as the series continues {{to search for a}} storyline as dynamic as its heroine." [...] Mitchell Broussard at <b>We</b> <b>Got</b> <b>This</b> Covered graded the season premiere 4.5 out of 5 stars, calling it [...] "Fantastic" [...] and positively comparing it to Marvel's Ant-Man by saying [...] "Agent Carter finds a way to make the smaller stakes of Peggy's noir sandbox as tense, credible, and addictively watchable as any other addition to the MCU." [...] Broussard highlighted the performances of Atwell and D'Arcy as well as the new casting additions, and called the season's pacing, due to the small episode order, [...] "exciting". He noted that [...] "some may be disappointed in the more restrained adultness of the show releasing so soon after Jessica Jones, but I think that’s the greatest thing about this world: each show feels different and its own thing, despite their close proximity." [...] Varietys Brian Lowry was less positive, praising the casting and performances but saying, [...] "Agent Carter feels too slavishly locked into the S.H.I.E.L.D. formula...it's sort of a shame Agent Carter isn’t more compelling, since the impeccable period trappings and costumes make the series a nice change of pace, at least visually." ...|$|E

2500|$|All of {{the movie}} themes and mini-games were {{conceived}} by the creative-design team, which they decided the movie themes would have an old B-movie feel.

His spear attack was ranked by IGN as the 76th-top video-game weapon in 2012, and ninth in GameSpot's 2002 list of the top ten fighting-game special moves of all time as the single most powerful yet balanced attack in the original game, as well as for its initial shock value, while deeming it [...] "the definitive Mortal Kombat move." [...] The [...] "Nether Gate" [...] from MK2011 was included by FHM on their list of the game's nine most brutal Fatalities. His MKII Friendship, shared with Sub-Zero and Reptile, placed 47th on Prima Games' 2014 list of the series' top fifty Fatalities, in addition to the [...] "Nether Gate" [...] coming in at 45th, his stage Fatality from MK2011 39th, and the [...] "Flaming Skull" [...] from MK1 in fourteenth. [...] <b>We</b> <b>Got</b> <b>This</b> Covered ranked the [...] "Nether Gate" [...] among the reboot's top finishers: [...] "Sub-Zero does another spine rip in this game, but it’s not as repulsive as it was a decade ago. Scorpion, however, has found a new way to use his favorite weapon for maximum damage." [...] Paste rated it the fourth-best Fatality from MK2011, in addition to rating the [...] "Flaming Skull" [...] as the third-best finisher from the first game. [...] Complex ranked the [...] "Flaming Skull" [...] last in their list of the twenty best MK finishing moves in 2013, calling it [...] "creepy to the max." [...] However, his Animality from UMK3/Trilogy (a penguin that lays an exploding egg) tied with that of Rain as the eighth-worst finisher in the series according to GamePro.|$|E
