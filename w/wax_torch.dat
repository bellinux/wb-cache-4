6000|$|... "A funeral {{has gone}} by, with the penitents in their black hoods, and the <b>wax</b> <b>torches</b> {{sputtering}} in the wet, {{and the little}} bell ringing, and the priests droning their monotonous chant. A pleasant sight to {{meet me at the}} window! I shall go back to my Diary.|$|R
60|$|He {{advanced}} to Meser Ramiro, bowed and presented a package. Ramiro broke the seal, and {{standing with his}} back to the fire, immediately in the light shed by one of the <b>wax</b> <b>torches,</b> he read the letter. Then his eyes wandered to the man who had brought it, and to me it seemed that they dwelt particularly upon the hat the courier was holding in his hand.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Artist Brose Partington applies <b>wax</b> using a <b>torch</b> to {{a bronze}} sculpture.|$|R
60|$|From where I {{watched it}} was {{impossible}} to see the door hidden in the black gloom. Away in the centre of the church, an island of light in that vast sea of blackness, stood the catafalque with its four <b>wax</b> <b>torches.</b> Something creaked, and almost immediately I saw the flames of those tapers bend towards me, beaten over by the gust that smote them from the door. Thus I surmised that Ramiro and his men had entered. The soft fall of their feet; for they were treading lightly now, succeeded, and at last they came into view, shadowy at first, then sharply outlined as they approached the light.|$|R
5000|$|Oreocereus is a genus of cacti (family Cactaceae), {{known only}} from high altitudes of the Andes.Its name means [...] "mountain cereus", formed from the Greek prefix [...] ( [...] , mountain) and the New Latin , meaning <b>wax</b> or <b>torch.</b>|$|R
60|$|Towards evening, at last, I rose, and {{skirting}} the Castle, I entered the town, dishevelled and bedraggled, yet caring nothing what spectacle I might afford. And presently a grim procession overtook me, and at {{sight of the}} black, cowled and visored figures that advanced in the lurid light of their <b>wax</b> <b>torches,</b> I fell on my knees there in the street, and so remained, my knees deep in the mud, my head bowed, until her sainted body had been borne past. None heeded me. They bore her to San Domenico, and thither I followed presently, and {{in the shadow of}} one of the pillars of the aisle I crouched whilst the monks chanted their funereal psalms.|$|R
2500|$|The chronicles {{explain the}} rapid success by the Turkish retreat, {{but it is}} also known that on 12 September, at Beyoğlu (Pera) in Constantinople, the count was {{preparing}} the funerals of several of his men who died in the attack on Gelibolu. Simon de Saint-Amour and Roland de Veissy, both knights of the Collar, had been killed, and the count's bursar, Antoine Barbier had purchased eighteen escutcheons bearing the [...] "device of the Collar" [...] (devisa collarium) for their funeral, while eighty-one <b>wax</b> <b>torches</b> and alms were paid for the burial of Girard Mareschal from Savoy and Jean d'Yverdon from the Vaudois. A large storm in the Sea of Marmora initially prevented the remainder of the crusade from leaving Gelibolu, but by 4 September they had arrived by sea at Constantinople. The fleet landed at Beyoğlu (Pera), the Genoese quarter where most of his men stayed, although some took lodgings in Galata, the borgo de Veneciis (Venetian quarter), and Amadeus himself purchased a house in the city proper, which he had to furnish. Besides the cost of furniture and funerals, the count had to pay his interpreter Paulo three months' wages.|$|R
60|$|On Saturday, 4th June, the King's body is {{laid out}} in state; all Potsdam at liberty to come and see. He lies there, in his regimentals, in his oaken coffin, on a raised place {{in the middle of}} the room; decent {{mortuary}} draperies, lamps, garlands, banderols furnishing the room and him: at his feet, on a black-velvet TABOURET (stool), are the chivalry emblems, helmet, gauntlets, spurs; and on similar stools, at the right hand and the left, lie his military insignia, hat and sash, sword, guidon, and what else is fit. Around, in silence, sit nine veteran military dignitaries; Buddenbrock, Waldau, Derschau, Einsiedel, and five others whom we omit to name. Silent they sit. A grim earnest sight in the shine of the lamplight, as you pass out of the June sun. Many went, all day; looked once again on the face that was to vanish. Precisely at ten at night, the coffin-lid is screwed down: twelve Potsdam Captains take the coffin on their shoulders; four-and-twenty Corporals with <b>wax</b> <b>torches,</b> four-and-twenty Sergeants with inverted halberts lowered; certain Generals on order, and very many following as volunteers; these perform the actual burial,--carry the body to the Garrison Church, where are clergy waiting, which is but a small step off; see it lodged, oak coffin and all, in a marble coffin in the side vault there, which is known to Tourists. [Pauli, viii. 281.] It is the end of the week, and the actual burial is done,--hastened forward for reasons we can guess.|$|R
5|$|The flowers provide dyes {{of bright}} yellow or green, {{and have been}} used for hair dye. The dried leaves and hair were made into candle wicks, or put into shoes to help with {{insulating}} them. The dried stems were also dipped into suet or <b>wax</b> to make <b>torches.</b> Due to its weedy capacities, the plant, unlike other species of the genus (such as V.phoeniceum), is not often cultivated.|$|R
60|$|As {{great and}} good in peace, {{as he was}} great and good in war, KING ALFRED never rested from his labours to improve his people. He loved to talk with clever men, and with {{travellers}} from foreign countries, and to write down what they told him, for his people to read. He had studied Latin after learning to read English, and now another of his labours was, to translate Latin books into the English-Saxon tongue, that his people might be interested, and improved by their contents. He made just laws, that they might live more happily and freely; he turned away all partial judges, that no wrong might be done them; he was so careful of their property, and punished robbers so severely, {{that it was a}} common thing to say that under the great KING ALFRED, garlands of golden chains and jewels might have hung across the streets, and no man would have touched one. He founded schools; he patiently heard causes himself in his Court of Justice; the great desires of his heart were, to do right to all his subjects, and to leave England better, wiser, happier in all ways, than he found it. His industry in these efforts was quite astonishing. Every day he divided into certain portions, and in each portion devoted himself to a certain pursuit. That he might divide his time exactly, he had <b>wax</b> <b>torches</b> or candles made, which were all of the same size, were notched across at regular distances, and were always kept burning. Thus, as the candles burnt down, he divided the day into notches, almost as accurately as we now divide it into hours upon the clock. But when the candles were first invented, {{it was found that the}} wind and draughts of air, blowing into the palace through the doors and windows, and through the chinks in the walls, caused them to gutter and burn unequally. To prevent this, the King had them put into cases formed of wood and white horn. And these were the first lanthorns ever made in England.|$|R
60|$|Crouching in the darkness, {{they saw}} that wild {{procession}} pass, the rushing screaming figures, the tossing arms, the bearded, distorted faces, now scarlet and now grey, as the brandished <b>torches</b> <b>waxed</b> or waned. They heard the rush of many feet, the clamour of hoarse voices, the clang of metal upon metal. And then suddenly, above them all, they saw {{a vision of a}} monstrous man, a huge bowed back, a savage face, grim hawk eyes, that looked out over the swaying shields. It was seen for an instant in a smoke-fringed circle of fire, and then it had swept on into the night.|$|R
50|$|As of 2010, the torches are {{structurally}} stable {{at their}} restored location; new mounts were bolted into the limestone bases, not directly {{attached to the}} torches but merely holding them in place underneath. At {{the time of this}} most recent installation the bronze was completely discolored by verdigris and black corrosion film. This splotchy appearance made the overall shape of the lampposts and the designs within the intricate bronze-work difficult to fully appreciate. Thus, the IMA Conservation Department performed a treatment on the torches following installation, thoroughly cleaning away most of the corrosion and applying multiple protective coatings of <b>wax</b> to the <b>torches</b> to protect them from further corrosion.|$|R
60|$|A {{good deal}} of taste, in one sense, had been {{expended}} in making these images, and money had clearly been no object. I might have been somewhat dazzled by the general effect, had I not reflected that, in my own country, gas is within reach of the poorest purse, while the electric light itself may be enjoyed by the very beggar in the street. Here, on the contrary, the dripping of the <b>wax</b> from the <b>torches,</b> the black smoke on the roof, the noisy crackling of the sandal-wood in the braziers, all combined to prove that these natives, though ingenious enough in their way, were far indeed {{below the level of}} modern civilization. The abominable ceremony of the afternoon would have proved as much, and now the absence of true comfort, even in the dwelling of a chief, made me think once more of the hardships of a missionary's career.|$|R
