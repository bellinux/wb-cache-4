Both supporters and critics insisted that Fordism epitomized American capitalist development, and that the auto industry was the key to understanding economic and social relations in the United States.

The poem [...] "Three Aces", signed [...] "Carl Byng", {{was published in}} the Buffalo Express in December 1870, not long after [...] "Plain Language from Truthful James" [...] first appeared. The poem was widely attributed to Mark Twain and labeled a [...] "feeble imitation" [...] of Harte. Twain angrily denied the charge and demanded a retraction, writing to the editor Thomas Bailey Aldrich, [...] "I am not in the imitation business". Harte, in turn, targeted Twain years later in his 1893 story [...] "Ingénue of the Sierras" [...] by creating an unsavory character named [...] "Charley Bing", modeled after Twain. The incident was one of several in a long rivalry between the two authors. In 1898, The Overland Monthly ran a poem making fun of Harte himself, who had moved to Europe in 1871 and never returned, for forgetting <b>what</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> in the west.|$|E

Two weeks later he returned to the regions covered initially, gave copies to the photographers, and interviewed them about the meaning of their photos. [...] Zaltman realized just how powerful the use of images “owned” by those being interviewed were in gaining a deep understanding of their implicit or tacit assumptions and beliefs. Zaltman noticed, for example, that they often cut off the feet of people appearing in their images. [...] It was discovered that this was deliberate. The Nepalese did not want to embarrass their friends and neighbors by showing their bare feet, which was a sign of poverty, and for this reason deliberately chose to leave it out of the photographic record.|$|E
