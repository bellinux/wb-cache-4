We’ve had enough of it. We’ve seen so many revolutions and wars. We need decades of calm and harmonious development.|$|E

From their examples we must learn that we must all contribute toward the development of our nation and that this cannot be done without being equipped with knowledge. So <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> attempt to acquire as much knowledge as possible, in order that we may render our services to society in the manner of the women of early Islam.|$|E

Coleman also said it was [...] "One of George's most potent tracks ever, highly emotional and introspective" [...] and predicted that its universal theme would encourage several cover recordings.|$|E
500|$|A French battery {{advanced}} to within 300 {{yards of the}} 1/1st Nassau square causing heavy casualties. When the Nassauers attempted to attack the battery they were ridden down by a squadron of cuirassiers [...] Yet another battery deployed on the flank of Mercer's battery and shot up its horses and limbers and pushed Mercer back. Mercer later recalled, [...] "The rapidity and precision of this fire was quite appaling. Every shot almost took effect, and I certainly expected <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> be annihilated. ... The saddle-bags, in many instances were torn from horses' backs ... One shell I saw explode under the two finest wheel-horses in the troop down they dropped".|$|E

[...] In the introduction to that book Norman Davies, a British historian, wrote: [...] "If there was an Allied hero who deserved to be remembered and celebrated, this was a person with few peers." [...] At the commemoration event of International Holocaust Remembrance Day held in the US Holocaust Memorial Museum on 27 January 2013 Ryszard Schnepf, the Polish Ambassador to the US, described Pilecki as a [...] "diamond among Poland's heroes" [...] and [...] "the highest example of Polish patriotism".|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered Here We Go Again [...] "not {{quite as much}} fun", as Lovato's debut album Don't Forget, [...] "but still fun, particularly when Lovato tears into hooky power pop like ... 'Remember December'." [...] Erlewine also named the song {{one of the best}} tracks on the album. BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine rated it four out of five stars, and wrote, [...] "I'm sure there's a punkrock reason why <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> get together and hate it, but {{for the life of me}} I just can't. Even with the weird pronunciation and silly lyrics, this is a corker." [...] McAlpine praised the [...] "grand" [...] chorus and wrote: [...] "Someone in Team Lovato has been cocking an ear to the musical stylings of Paramore and maybe suggested that the next logical step after Camp Rocks wholesome Disneyfication of popular song might be something a little more confessional." ...|$|E
500|$|In the NME, Neil Spencer {{wrote that}} [...] "Though Extra Texture isn't the Harrison revival that many might have hopes for, it's still several leagues {{superior}} to Hari's more recent efforts; {{and just as}} All Things Must Pass {{would have made a}} great single album, so Extra Texture would make a more than commendable single side." [...] Spencer described the album's content as [...] "the customary mournful and doom-laden Harrison we've come to know and fear, only this time the rigours of love take precedence over matters spiritual", and he advised his readers: [...] "I've played it, I don't mind it... Hari fans can anticipate purchase with glee. Others approach with cautious optimism." [...] Reviewing for Melody Maker, Ray Coleman described it as [...] "splendid" [...] and approved of Harrison's return to his 1960s musical influences. Coleman especially admired the first three songs and said that the album was a [...] "re-statement of the fundamentals <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> cherish".|$|E
500|$|... "Fly on the Wall" [...] is {{prominently}} an electropop {{song that}} is also composed {{of a number of}} hooks, which yell the song's title, while the instrumentation relies on electric guitars. Unlike other songs on Breakout, [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] has Cyrus' voice processed to sound different. The song's lyrics taunt [...] "the listener for being on the outside of her inner sanctum". The target of the message has been interpreted differently by contemporary critics – an ex-boyfriend and the media have most commonly been referred to. [...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] is a contemporary ballad that contains a sound reflecting influences from minimalist music. The backdrop for the [...] "feel-bad" [...] love song features ocean wave sounds. The track [...] "Wake Up America" [...] has a [...] "cheeky riff-rock backdrop" [...] as its, while its lyrical content concerns environmentalism, where Cyrus mainly pleads for audiences to give the Earth [...] "just a little attention". In the first verse, she [...] "admits that she doesn't know exactly what's up with this global warming but believes there's something <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> do about it". [...] "These Four Walls" [...] is a power ballad accented with country pop elements and twangy vocals and lyrics which speak of an interior narrative. [...] "Simple Song" [...] has [...] "bile" [...] sound and is lyrically about moments in coming of age where a person [...] "can't tell which way is up, which way is down" [...] and they feel the need to alienate themselves. In [...] "Goodbye", Cyrus' vocal performance is more [...] "roosty" [...] with a more [...] "natural-sounding accompaniment" [...] while, in the lyrics, she finds her remembering the [...] "simple things ... until [...]" [...] "See You Again" [...] (Rock Mafia Remix) is dance-pop number, fusing sultry vocals with techno beats. The track has Cyrus detailing previous scenes and plans to redeem herself.|$|E

The inside is stuffy and sleazy, but embodies that red-light district feel that fits right in with [...] rowdy environment." [...] That year, Willamette Week called the club [...] "the undisputed grande dame of West Coast strips" [...] and [...] "a stubbornly degenerate landmark". According to the newspaper's Matthew Korfhage, its entertainment {{came in the form of}} [...] "girls/ladies, friendly also brassy, oddly classy, with sterling taste on the juke, who let you see all of their piercings and tattoos.
