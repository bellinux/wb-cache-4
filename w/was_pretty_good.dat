By the way, scat is {{something}} {{that a lot of}} people don't understand, and they begin to believe that the first scat numbers was ever done, was done by one of my hometown boys, Louie Armstrong. But I must take the credit away, since I know better. The first man that ever did a scat number in history of this country was a man from Vicksburg, Mississippi, by the name of Joe Sims, an old comedian. And from that, Tony Jackson and myself, and several more grabbed it in New Orleans. And found it <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> for an introduction of a song.|$|E

Kerslake prepared five treatments during July and August 1993, but no shoot arrangements were made {{and by the end}} of the month, the group decided to work with Dutch photographer and video director Anton Corbijn. Corbijn, who typically created his own ideas for videos, was initially unsure of directing the video since Cobain's treatment was so detailed.

500|$|James Chamberlin of IGN {{stated that}} the scenes in which Amber and House were working out terms for sharing Wilson were [...] "hysterical", and graded the episode with an 8.5 (out of 10). Gina Dinunno of TV Guide thought the episode <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good,</b> {{and the only thing}} she was not very fond of was that she felt that the {{characters}} of Robert Chase and Allison Cameron seemed [...] "forced into the script". Jessica Paff, from Zap2it, reported that she was pleased that the love triangle between House, Amber and Wilson went on, despite House's blessing in the previous episode. Sara Morrison of Television Without Pity said she liked the jokes referring to [...] "Thirteen" [...] being bisexual. She graded the episode with an A+.

Music Radio stated that [...] "Madonna's {{appearance on the}} brilliantly titled but deeply dreary 'Me Against The Music' was a postmodern prank designed to make all sane listeners think 'actually, American Life <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good,</b> after all.'" [...] While reviewing The Singles Collection, Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy said that [...] "the only arguable weak link is the Madonna-featuring 'Me Against The Music', but in this context what once looked like a respectful {{passing of the baton}} now seems like an unconditional surrender of pop Queendom to its rightful heir." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] "the album's coy, overly busy single". Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian noted it as [...] "the only duff track" [...] of the album. Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Madonna shows up in the album's first song, 'Me Against the Music', as if endorsing Spears's foray into come-hither posing and club-land beats." ...|$|E

[...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] began as a [...] "cha-cha-style duet, à la Santana's [...] "Smooth"." [...] Ronson asked the Dap-Kings to collaborate on the track in order to get a [...] "crisply syncopated, locked-in groove." [...] Regarding the song, Mars says [...] "Man, there's a good pocket on this song right now. Let's keep it going." [...] He also mentioned that it took a long time to create it, commenting [...] "People didn't see us going at each other's throats in the studio and pulling out our hair." [...] He added, [...] "Trying to get these drums right and figure out a bass line." [...] Lawrence believes the lack of [...] "heavy hitting drums" [...] and the presence of a small guitar solo allows the song to be carried by Mars.|$|E

500|$|Speculation about Dempsey's {{exit from}} Grey's Anatomy began in November, when Dempsey casually {{mentioned}} {{during an interview}} that he might be leaving the series very soon. Despite signing on for two more years {{at the end of the}} tenth season of the show, he disclosed that the eleventh season would be his last. The announcement was made public on April 23, 2015, just a few hours before the airing of [...] "How to Save a Life". In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Dempsey explained how the decision could have been made when he had just renewed his contract as he asserted on the natural developments leading up to his exit from the long-running series. He said, [...] "It really was something that was kind of surprising that unfolded, and it just naturally came to be. Which <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good.</b> I like the way it has all played out." [...] He went on to share further details on his character being written out of the show, as he said, [...] "Things happened very quickly, where we were like, Oh this is where it’s going to go. It just sort of unfolded in a very organic way." [...] The developments leading up to the eventual exit which he deemed [...] "natural", began in February–March 2016.|$|E
500|$|By 1935 Jack Mara had {{received}} a degree from Fordham Law School, passed the bar, and was, at age 27, the team's president. By that same year, 19‑year‑old Wellington had become the team's secretary, {{and he started to}} exert influence over personal decisions. Newman retired before the 1935 season rather than come back from a back injury suffered the previous year when the team refused to give him a raise. This left Strong as the team's top draw, and the Giants signed him to a contract which guaranteed him $4,000 but gave him a percentage of the draw that could make his salary reach a maximum of $6,000 depending on attendance. At midseason the team's attendance had increased by 15% from the previous year's record ticket sales. Although Strong was paid well that season, and took advantage of high ticket sales from games in which he was injured, many of the other team's players were not. [...] "I felt pretty damn good," [...] Strong later said about his salary, [...] "but guys like Hein, Morgan, and Burnett weren't making much more than a hundred dollars a game. The salaries the front office fed to the newspapers weren't exactly true. We had three All-Stars on the Giants making less money than most of the bench warmers on the Dodgers. Hein was the greatest player the Giants ever had, but he didn't start making $5,000 until after his 12th season." [...] Hein remarked that he felt he was well paid for the time however, [...] "I think at the time $150 [...] was probably the highest pay of any lineman in the league. It <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> money, even though it wouldn't sound that way now, but you could buy a loaf of bread for a nickel and get a full meal for thirty-five cents in the Automat back then. And you had no income tax." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} asked United Artists for financing, but {{the studio}} would only put up $1 million. Later, the UK arm of United Artists provided an extra $100,000 {{to create the}} climax where Dr. No's base explodes. As {{a result of the}} low budget, only one sound editor was hired (normally there are two, for sound effects and dialogue), and many pieces of scenery were made in cheaper ways, with M's office featuring cardboard paintings and a door covered in a leather-like plastic, the room where Dent meets Dr. No costing only £745 to build, and the aquarium in Dr. No's base being magnified stock footage of goldfish. Furthermore, when art director Syd Cain found out his name was not in the credits, Broccoli gave him a golden pen to compensate, saying {{that he did not want}} to spend money making the credits again. Production designer Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian in 2005: [...] "The budget for Dr No was under $1m for the whole picture. My budget was £14,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr No's apartment. It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington, which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I painted a Goya over the weekend. It <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display." ...|$|E
