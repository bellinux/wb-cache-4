5|$|Cosimo III left a Tuscany one of {{the poorest}} nations in Europe; the {{treasury}} empty and the people weary of religious bigotry, the state itself <b>was</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gaming chip in European affairs. Among his enduring edicts is the establishment of the Chianti wine region. Gian Gastone repealed Cosimo's Jewish persecution laws, and eased tariffs and customs. Cosimo's inability to uphold Tuscany's independence led to the succession of the House of Lorraine upon Gian Gastone's death in 1737.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} training, No. 78 Squadron was {{deployed to}} the combat zone north of Australia in October 1943. From November that year until September 1944 the squadron supported {{the advance of}} the Allied ground forces through western New Britain and the north coast of New Guinea by attacking Japanese positions, providing fighter protection for recently established beachheads, and escorting Australian and United States bombers. From late 1944 until mid-1945 it operated against Japanese positions and shipping in the eastern Netherlands East Indies. The squadron {{took part in the}} Borneo campaign during the final weeks of the war. No. 78 Squadron <b>was</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cadre after it returned to Australia in December 1945, but received new aircraft in 1946 and undertook training exercises until being disbanded in April 1948.|$|E

5|$|As IRO expanded, it coordinated its {{activities}} {{more with the}} Bucharest-based BRCC. On Levski's initiative, a general assembly was called between 29 April and 4 May 1872. At the assembly, the delegates approved a programme and a statute, elected Lyuben Karavelov as the organisation's leader and authorised Levski as the BRCC executive body's only legitimate representative in the Bulgarian lands. After attending the assembly, Levski returned to Bulgaria and reorganised IRO's internal structure in accordance with BRCC's recommendations. Thus, the Lovech Central Committee <b>was</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> regular local committee, and the first region-wide revolutionary centres were founded. The lack of funds, however, precipitated the organisation into a crisis, and Levski's one-man judgements on important strategic and tactical matters were increasingly questioned.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914, Greece's pro-German monarch, Constantine I, decided to remain neutral. The Entente powers landed troops in Salonika in 1915, which {{was a source of}} tension between France and Greece. Ultimately, the French seized the Hellenic Navy on 19 October 1916 (see Noemvriana and National Schism). Kilkis <b>was</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> skeleton crew and had the breech blocks for her guns removed to render them inoperable. All ammunition and torpedoes were also removed.

5|$|Australian Army {{involvement}} in UNTAG was formalised in February 1979 by Cabinet, which approved {{the plan to}} commit the 17th Construction Squadron, Royal Australian Engineers and Workshop as the main force for deployment. The squadron was to be supplemented by a Field Troop and by members posted from other units throughout the Army, bringing the squadron to a deployment strength of 275. A headquarters was to be formed, supporting the Chief Engineer at the UNTAG Military Headquarters. The total strength of the force was to be over 300 of all ranks, in what was known as Plan Witan.

5|$|Between 1951 and 1960 a {{national}} service scheme had operated and {{during this time}} the CMF's numbers remained reasonably steady. However, in 1960 the scheme was suspended and the Australian Army was reorganised {{with the introduction of}} the Pentropic divisional structure. As a result of this the CMF was greatly reduced and 14 infantry battalions were disbanded altogether, while many others were amalgamated into the battalions of the six sequentially numbered multi-battalion State-based regiments. As a result of this, on 1 July 1960, the 2nd Battalion became part of the Royal New South Wales Regiment, and <b>was</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> company-sized element of the Pentropic 2nd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (2 RNSWR), forming 'C' Company (City of Newcastle Company).
