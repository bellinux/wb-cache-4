5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth {{the weight of a}}n object is {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a <b>weighing</b> <b>scale.</b> The ratio of the force of gravity on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.|$|E
500|$|The Kibble balance (known as a [...] "watt balance" [...] before 2016) is {{essentially}} a single-pan <b>weighing</b> <b>scale</b> that measures the electric power necessary to oppose {{the weight of a}} kilogram test mass as it is pulled by Earth's gravity. It is a variation of an ampere balance in that it employs an extra calibration step that nulls the effect of geometry. The electric potential in the Kibble balance is delineated by a Josephson voltage standard, which allows voltage to be linked to an invariant constant of nature with extremely high precision and stability. Its circuit resistance is calibrated against a quantum Hall resistance standard.|$|E

The Traffic Manager for Queensland Airlines advised that sets of <b>weighing</b> <b>scales</b> had been purchased but were not in use because {{they had not been}} approved by the Department of Weights and Measures. He said that at every port other than Bilinga passengers could use some other company's <b>weighing</b> <b>scales,</b> and passengers intending to board at Bilinga could use the <b>weighing</b> <b>scales</b> at the nearby railway station. Staff of Queensland Airlines at Bilinga asked passengers to estimate their weight.

In clinical practice, this is usually applied in evaluation of a medical history of an individual, where the [...] "test" [...] usually is a question (or even assumption) regarding various risk factors, for example, sex, tobacco smoking or weight, but it can potentially be a substantial test such as putting the individual on a <b>weighing</b> <b>scale.</b> When using relative risks, the resultant probability is usually rather related to the individual developing the condition {{over a period of}} time (similarly to the incidence in a population), instead of being the probability of an individual of having the condition in the present, but can indirectly be an estimation of the latter.|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinction}} between mass and weight is unimportant for many practical purposes because {{the strength of}} gravity does not vary {{too much on the}} surface of the Earth. In a uniform gravitational field, the gravitational force exerted on an object (its weight) is directly proportional to its mass. For example, object A weighs 10 times as much as object B, so therefore the mass of object A is 10 times greater than that of object B. This means that an object's mass can be measured indirectly by its weight, and so, for everyday purposes, weighing (using a <b>weighing</b> <b>scale)</b> is an entirely acceptable way of measuring mass. Similarly, a balance measures mass indirectly by comparing the weight of the measured item to that of an object(s) of known mass. [...] Since the measured item and the comparison mass are in virtually the same location, so experiencing the same gravitational field, the effect of varying gravity does not affect the comparison or the resulting measurement.|$|E
