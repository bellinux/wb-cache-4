30|$|Compared to thirst which {{manifests itself}} within 1 – 2  h {{following}} {{an increase of}} plasma osmolality, increased salt appetite is a delayed behavioral change which may take days to emerge. Furthermore, hyponatremia per se is not the prime trigger for increased salt intake [38]. In fact, rather than osmotic stimuli, hypovolemia (either true or effective), which is detected by peripheral baroreceptors [39, 40] and augmented levels of aldosterone and angiotensin II [41], {{are more likely to}} play leading roles in promoting enhanced salt appetite. Putative or documented brain structures implicated in salt appetite are numerous and their full description <b>would</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>beyond</b> the framework of this review. Extensive reviews on the topic can be found in [42, 43].|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} major study in English of fascist Italy's {{overseas}} propaganda. Using rare Italian and French captured documents, {{this is also the}} first investigation into the relationship between Mussolini's regime and Arab nationalist movements This new account covers propaganda and subversive activities engineered by the Italian government in the Mediterranean and the Middle East from 1935 until 1940, when Italy entered the war. It assesses the nature of the challenge brought by the Fascist regime to British security and colonial interests in the region. Fascist propaganda, in particular in the Arab Middle East, must be regarded as an expression of Mussolini's foreign policy and his attempts to build an Italian empire that <b>would</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>beyond</b> the Mediterranean, gaining control over the exits, Gibraltar and Suez, which were {{in the hands of the}} British and the French. The activities of individual agents and organizations are carefully reconstructed and analyzed to highlight the seemingly contradictory objectives of the Italian government: on the one hand, Rome was courting the Arab nationalist movements in Egypt and Palestine, which were seeking the support of external forces capable of providing political, financial and military backing needed to overthrow foreign rulers; on the other, the regime was promoting further territorial expansion in Africa. These aspects build into an excellent picture of this fascinating period of modern history. This book will be of great interest to all students and scholars of politics, media, Italian history and propaganda...|$|E

Part I argues that both those who order pre-acquisition soil testing and those who conduct the tests are PRPs if the testing spreads existing contamination. Part II argues that the statute {{does not allow for}} the judicial creation of a soil testing liability exception. Part III acknowledges the policy problems created by testing liability and advocates a legislative solution to exempt pre-purchase soil testing from CERCLA liability...|$|R

40|$|Recent archaeological studies {{reflect a}} growing {{interest}} in neighbourhoods and neighbourhood studies, covering urban environments from antiquity to historical cities. This thesis investigates neighbourhoods in Roman Ostia, through examining the spatial relationship of one city block within itself and {{to the rest of}} the city. The central research question in this thesis is how the buildings in insula IV iv along the Via del Tempio Rotondo relate to each other, to the street, and to the contemporaneous structures on the opposite side of the street. A second part of this question is whether this area functioned as part of one neighbourhood. This thesis focuses on two buildings in the insula that directly border the Via del Tempio Rotondo, to be able to provide a complete overview of one side of the insula. Although this thesis forms part of the larger investigations of insula IV iv, owing to its comprehensive treatment of a section of the insula, it presents a complete subproject in its own right. In addition to remapping and investigating the material remains in situ, different methods of Space Syntax are used to examine the buildings and the surrounding area. Access analysis and visual analysis are used to investigate the buildings themselves, and to determine how life in these buildings would have functioned. Several axial analyses are then used to determine how the city block relates {{to the rest of the}} city of Ostia. It can then be concluded that the buildings under investigation in this thesis were part of the same neighbourhood, although this neighbourhood <b>would</b> have <b>stretched</b> <b>beyond</b> the limits of a single street front. Eventually, directions for future research are presented...|$|R

40|$|Title from caption list {{supplied}} by the photographer, see file NLA 04 / 564.; Part of the collection: A blood red noon, photography of the Brindabella & southern ACT fires of January 2003.; Also available in an electronic version via the Internet at: [URL] Purchased 2005. "Feltus Place Kambah at 1930 hrs, 18 : 01 : 2003. Direct exposure to a full-blown fire is but one, transient, hazard faced by residents and fire fighters out-of-doors when serious fire incursions occur into residential and industrial areas. When structures ignite, exploding gas bottles and fuel containers, toxic and corrosive fumes from stored chemicals and plastic products, freed asbestos dust, add to falling trees, branches, collapsing powerlines and structures are {{but some of the}} more common hazards encountered. To all these dangers may be added; roof and ladder falls and panic driven motor vehicles in poor visibility conditions, physical and emotional stresses, heat exhaustion and smoke inhalation all make for a very dangerous environment. It is also noteworthy, that on a large-scale emergency, such as in Southern Canberra, emergency services <b>would</b> be <b>stretched</b> far <b>beyond</b> capacity and likely not available for some time, particularly if communications fail as did a major mobile phone network" [...] Note from the photographer...|$|R

Given the 'quicksand' nature of the Mersey's tidal silt the piles were needed to provide maximum stability. The resultant effect of the dock being constructed where it was is that the north and west stacks (now Merseyside Maritime Museum and Colonnades) rise and fall with every tide.|$|R
