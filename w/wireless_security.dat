40|$|Wireless {{networks}} {{are prone to}} security attacks due mainly to the open nature of its transmission medium (open air). Hence <b>wireless</b> network <b>security</b> is more concentrated and complex {{than that of a}} wired network. With the advent of wireless network technologies in the market today, mobility has becomes an important requirement for most university networks. A lot of attention has been given to the provision of wireless infrastructures in the University networks, but little attention has been given to <b>wireless</b> network <b>security</b> in a University environment. The current <b>wireless</b> network <b>security</b> implemented in Universities are weak, making it possible for hacker to break into University networks and hack confidential information of students, staffs and faculty members. This paper addresses how to enhance <b>wireless</b> network <b>security</b> by proposing a pee-to-peer security model with MAC address control, using Extensible Authentication Protocol with Tunneled Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS) with certificate based mutual authentication of client and network through an encrypted tunnel and dynamic per user, per session WEP keys, using only server side certificates. This will control access to the network by allowing infrastructures to authenticate users and not wireless hosts using a centralized authentication server system, RADIUS server and LDAP or Active directory server. This will enable users to use their regular username and password. Keywords: Wireless network, Peer-to-Peer, Network security, Authentication I...|$|R
