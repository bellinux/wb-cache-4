The lady was very beautiful and wore something like a black Spanish mantilla. The pair carried with them a curiously <b>wrought</b> <b>steel</b> box.

60|$|The {{pavilion}} {{in which}} these personages were, had, as became the time, {{as well as the}} personal character of Richard, more of a warlike than a sumptuous or royal character. Weapons offensive and defensive, several of them of strange and newly-invented construction, were scattered about the tented apartment, or disposed upon the pillars which supported it. Skins of animals slain in the chase were stretched on the ground, or extended along the sides of the pavilion; and upon a heap of these silvan spoils lay three ALANS, as they were then called (wolf-greyhounds, that is), of the largest size, and as white as snow. Their faces, marked with many a scar from clutch and fang, showed their share in collecting the trophies upon which they reposed; and their eyes, fixed from time to time with an expressive stretch and yawn upon the bed of Richard, evinced how much they marvelled at and regretted the unwonted inactivity which they were compelled to share. These were but the accompaniments of the soldier and huntsman; but on a small table close by the bed was placed a shield of <b>wrought</b> <b>steel,</b> of triangular form, bearing the three lions passant first assumed by the chivalrous monarch, and before it the golden circlet, resembling much a ducal coronet, only that it was higher in front than behind, which, with the purple velvet and embroidered tiara that lined it, formed then the emblem of England's sovereignty. Beside it, as if prompt for defending the regal symbol, lay a mighty curtal-axe, which would have wearied the arm of any other than Coeur de Lion.|$|E

So hot that even the thrush chose to hop, like a mechanical bird, {{in the shadow of the}} flowers, with long pauses between one movement and the next; instead of rambling vaguely the white butterflies danced one above another, making with their white shifting flakes the outline of a shattered marble column above the tallest flowers; the glass roofs of the palm house shone as if a whole market full of shiny green umbrellas had opened in the sun; and in the drone of the aeroplane the voice of the summer sky murmured its fierce soul. Yellow and black, pink and snow white, shapes of all these colours, men, women, and children were spotted for a second upon the horizon, and then, seeing the breadth of yellow that lay upon the grass, they wavered and sought shade beneath the trees, dissolving like drops of water in the yellow and green atmosphere, staining it faintly with red and blue. It seemed as if all gross and heavy bodies had sunk down in the heat motionless and lay huddled upon the ground, but their voices went wavering from them as if they were flames lolling from the thick waxen bodies of candles. Voices. Yes, voices. Wordless voices, breaking the silence suddenly with such depth of contentment, such passion of desire, or, in the voices of children, such freshness of surprise; breaking the silence?

40|$|Mechanisms {{of fatigue}} crack growth {{have been studied}} {{for a range of}} PM steels at {{relative}} densities of 0. 90 and 1. 0, for which strength, fracture toughness, and microstructural information was also available. It is shown that the Paris exponents for steady state crack growth are between 8 and 18 when ρr is approximately 0. 9 but when ρr is approximately 1. 0 the exponents are between 2. 6 and 4. 0, i. e in the range typical of <b>wrought</b> <b>steels</b> (2 - 4). At both densities, threshold stress intensities are between 5. 5 and 10. 8 MPa m 1 / 2 when R = 0. 1. Combinations of these thresholds and yield strengths are comparable with those for <b>wrought</b> <b>steels.</b> When R = 0. 8, reductions in threshold to between 2. 7 and 5 MPa m 1 / 2 are attributed to crack closure effects. At ρr = 0. 90, Fe- 0. 5 C fails by progressive rupture of sinter necks. Astaloy A, with 0. 2 %C and 0. 6 %C, and Distaloy AB- 0. 6 C have smaller plastic zone sizes and the cracks follow more difficult paths through particles as well as necks.

The P/M gear specimens were machined from sintered packs made from the single-press single-sinter route and some were surface-rolled using a high-precision CNC form-rolling machine of two roller-dies transverse-type. A fully densified surface layer less than 2 % porosity was obtained on the tooth flank approximately 0. 5 mm thick when P/M pinions with a density of 7. 4 Mg/m 3 or more were surface-rolled using the amount of stock rolled at 0. 15 mm. The load bearing capacity of P/M pinions were estimated by gear running tests using a power re-circulating type testing rig.

The data used to evaluate the fuzzy model were taken from the Machinability Hand Book [99] which contams the most appropriate values and ranges used for different types of materials in the industrial environment. Two fuzzy models were developed for carrying out these calculations. In fuzzy model- 1, the fuzzy metric arcs are overlapped at 50 % and in fuzzy model- 2, the fuzzymetnc arcs are overlapped at 33 %. Computer software was developed to implement the model and to predict the cutting conditions for the two materials mentioned above. The results based on the initial models were improved by tuning the models further. The results were then in excellent agreement with the machinability hand book. The programme as it stands is applicable for Medium carbon leaded steel and Freemachimng carbon <b>wrought</b> <b>steel</b> only.

40|$|Multiphase {{stainless}} steels are produced for their attractive properties of mechanical strength and corrosion resistance {{relative to their}} austenite-ferrite structure. The manufacture of these steel by powder metallurgy technology presents some advantages in terms of low cost and formability of complex shapes. Mechanical and corrosion resistances are not {{at the level of}} the <b>wrought</b> <b>steels</b> due to their porous nature. In this work the fatigue and corrosion fatigue behaviour of some sintered steels obtained by sintering from 316 L and 434 L base powders has been studied for characterisation and comparison. The sintered steels were fatigue tested in two different environments: air and NaCl aqueous solution. The tests performed indicate that the chemical and microstructral composition has no great influence on fatigue behaviour in comparison with the manufacturing technology (sintering). This is most evident in the more aggressive environment, like seawater, in which these steels could be advantageously used. The analysis of fracture surfaces using SEM microscopy shows a peculiar crack propagation characterised by cleavage, stress intensification due to porosity, and features of localised ductility on sintering necks and base powder particles...|$|R
