30|$|I {{define the}} nature of {{bureaucracy}} as a social technology that works as an “information processing machine” for the community to which it belongs. In other words, bureaucracy is a social technology dedicated to the distribution and processing of information that is needed in a specific community. This {{is illustrated by the}} fact that the first bureaucrats recorded in history in the world were “scribes” in Sumer; scribes were people who recorded and managed various kinds of information on tablets. They made a lot of tablets with their early letters, which provide information of lending, debt, interest, and so on. 15 <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to write down the lending, debt, interest? It was an effort to maintain the trust of society in the extended community. In a large community where a reputation system does not works as a trust machine, the society can not maintain trust unless someone is managing these information. Therefore, bureaucracy is not an organization for charity, cooperation, or innovation, but an “information processing machine” that processes all kinds of information according to predefined laws. The primary role of bureaucracy is to produce and circulate information forcibly within a large community.|$|R

40|$|Life history evolution: successes, limitations, and {{prospects}} Abstract Life history theory {{tries to explain}} how evolution designs organisms to achieve reproductive success. The design is a solution to an ecological problem posed by the environment and subject to constraints intrinsic to the organism. Work on life histories has expanded the role of phenotypes in evolutionary theory, extending the range of predictions from genetic patterns to whole-organism traits directly connected to fitness. Among the questions answered are the following: Why are organisms small or large? Why do they mature early or late? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> few or many offspring? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a short or a long life? Why must they grow old and die? The classical approach to life histories was optimization; it has had some convincing empirical success. Recently non-equilibrium approaches involving frequency-dependence, density-dependence, evolutionary game theory, adaptive dynamics, and explicit population dynamics have supplanted optimization as the preferred approach. They have not yet had as much empirical success, but there are logical reasons to prefer them, and they may soon extend the impact of life history theory into population dynamics and interspecific interactions in coevolving communities...|$|E

At UC Santa Cruz, Solomon created a visionary program within the theater arts board that synthesized dance and theater. She taught at UC Santa Cruz until 1995. Solomon also founded and coordinated UCSC’s prestigious Summer Dance Theater Institute from 1972 until 1980. In 1953 Solomon entered Bard College’s dance program, where Jean Erdman became her teacher and major mentor. While still at Bard, she joined the Jean Erdman Dance Theater and danced with Erdman’s company until 1970. Erdman was ultimately to recommend Solomon as the right person to found a new dance program at UC Santa Cruz. At Bard College, Ruth met her future husband, John Solomon. She worked with many well-known composers such as John Cage and Lou Harrison. Her oral history captures the milieu of the dance world in New York City in the mid-twentieth century. In 1960, Ruth and John married; John joined the army and the pair moved to Puerto Rico, where Ruth started a dance program on the military bases on the island. After a couple of years they moved to Hawaii, where Ruth began a dance program at East-West Center in Hawaii and formed a dance company. In 1967, Solomon and Jean Erdman established a dance program at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts (then called the School of the Arts), where Solomon served as assistant director until she was recruited by UC Santa Cruz in 1970.  In about 1980, Solomon widened her interests to include dance medicine. “I really needed to know what we were doing in class that could cause the damage we were seeing. Why were dancers <b>having</b> hip replacements? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> knee problems? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> back problems?” Solomon reflected. Since that time, Solomon has completed annual three-month “residencies” under the direction of Dr. Lyle Micheli at the Division of Sports Medicine, Harvard Medical Center, Boston. She tenaciously attended night school at Cabrillo College after a full day of teaching dance at UCSC, and became a certified medical assistant. After her retirement from UCSC, dance medicine grew into a major focus of her career, although she continued to choreograph productions in a diversity of locations.     Ruth and John edit the Journal of Dance Medicine and Science and she has served {{on the board of the}} International Association of Dance Medicine and Science since its inception.

Results: We found slow eye movements as well as pathological eye movements in the blind subjects. We found that blind subjects have a horizontal preferency. The duration of fixation of pictures is shorter in the blind subjects. The blind could even modulate saccade amplitudes. Discussion: Eye movements seem to be structural properties of the brain which prepare the organism for certain situations-even if <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not take place.

[...] Former head of the Middle East section of the DIA W. Patrick Lang told the Washington Post that the Weekly Standard article which published Feith's memo [...] "is a listing of a mass of unconfirmed reports, many of which themselves indicate that the two groups continued to try to establish some sort of relationship. If <b>they</b> <b>had</b> such a productive relationship, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to keep trying?"

This is strange considering the inherent social and interactive nature of music, especially amongst trends like Web 2. 0 where collaboration and user-generated data is key. In this paper I study the problems these applications face, and <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not <b>have</b> a greater appeal to musicians. With the results I develop and evaluate my own framework, known as Crescendo Online: a multi-user sequencing and modular synthesis environment, intended {{to pave the way for}} a new type of online music creation platform...|$|R
