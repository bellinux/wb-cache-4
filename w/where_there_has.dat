5|$|The term {{coronation}} {{is sometimes}} {{used in a}} semi-ironic sense to refer to uncontested party leadership elections, with all potential party leaders choosing to back a single candidate or to stay silent, rather than stand in an election {{they are likely to}} lose. This typically happens <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> been a protracted behind-the-scenes attempt to remove the outgoing leader, leading to a significant amount of time to determine who has the most party support before the election proper.|$|E
5|$|To be {{eligible}} for entry under the skilled migrant plan applicants are assessed by an approved doctor for good health, provide a police certificate to prove good character and speak sufficient English. Migrants working in some occupations (mainly health) must be registered with the appropriate profession body before they can work within that area. Skilled migrants are assessed by Immigration New Zealand and applicants that they believe will contribute are issued with a residential visa, while those with potential are issued with a work to resident visa. Under the work to residency process applicants are given a temporary work permit {{for two years and}} are then eligible to apply for residency. Applicants with a job offer from an accredited New Zealand employer, cultural or sporting talent, looking for work <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> been a long-term skill shortage or to establish a business can apply for work to residency.|$|E

25|$|Responsibility {{based on}} fault: Civil {{responsibility}} was {{grounded in the}} idea of fault.

25|$|Glycated {{hemoglobin}} measurement is {{not appropriate}} <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> been a change in diet or treatment within 6 weeks. Likewise, the test assumes a normal red blood cell aging process and mix of hemoglobin subtypes (predominantly HbA in normal adults). Hence, people with recent blood loss, hemolytic anemia, or genetic differences in the hemoglobin molecule (hemoglobinopathy) such as sickle-cell disease and other conditions, {{as well as those}} that have donated blood recently, are not suitable for this test.|$|E

25|$|The {{goal of the}} punishments imposed {{would be}} the {{satisfaction}} of victims' rights and the consolidation of peace, and would always {{be related to the}} level of acknowledgment of truth and responsibility in collective or individual declarations to the JEP, the gravity of the punished act, the level of participation and responsibility and the accused's commitment to truth and reparation of the victims. The punishment in cases <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> been acknowledgment of responsibility before the Chamber of Acknowledgment would be lesser than in cases of late or no acknowledgment.|$|E
25|$|In {{the common}} law of England and Wales there is no {{criminal}} liability for failing {{to act in the}} event of another person being in danger; however, there are exceptions to this rule. In instances <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> been an assumption of responsibility by the bystander, a dangerous situation was created by them, or there is a contractual or statutory duty to act, criminal liability would be imposed on the bystander for their failure to take action. The courts are reluctant to penalize people attempting rescue and English law makes provision for the actions of 'good Samaritans,' unless their actions were grossly negligent or made a situation worse.|$|E
25|$|Under the rules, {{investors who}} do not sue Madoff or other parties will be allowed a theft-loss {{deduction}} for the 2008 tax year, equal to 95 percent of their total investment, including all fictitious earnings credited to their accounts on which they were taxed, but less any withdrawals, or actual or potential recoveries from SIPC or their own insurance. Victims who decide to sue Madoff or third parties, believing they might have the possibility of some recovery, may still deduct 75 percent of their investment. The deduction will {{not be subject to}} the limitations on deduction of itemized deductions. Any loss exceeding current income may result in a net operating loss, which can be carried back, at the taxpayer's election, 3, 4, or 5 years, with any loss still remaining carrying forward 20 years. These rules apply to all Ponzi schemes <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> been a federal or state indictment of the lead promoter.|$|E
