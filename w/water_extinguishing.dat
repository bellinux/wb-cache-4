50|$|Using {{water is}} one common method to <b>extinguish</b> a fire. <b>Water</b> <b>extinguishes</b> a fire by cooling, which removes heat because of water’s ability to absorb {{massive amounts of}} heat as it {{converts}} to water vapor. Without heat, the fuel cannot keep the oxidizer from reducing the fuel in order to sustain the fire. <b>Water</b> also <b>extinguishes</b> a fire by smothering it. When water is heated to its boiling point, it converts to water vapor. When this conversion takes place, it dilutes the oxygen {{in the air above}} the fire, thus removing one of the elements that the fire requires to burn. This can also be done with foam.|$|R
40|$|Little {{research}} has been conducted with respect to water requirements for wildfire suppression. An explor-atory and robust regression analysis was conducted on statistical material extracted from a Swedish database, focusing on data related to the fire suppression. The variables included are the amount of water applied, appli-cation rate of <b>water,</b> <b>extinguishing</b> time, flame height, and the total fire area. The results of the analysis with potential relationships are described, discussed, and compared with results from earlier research. After initial outlier detection, a robust regression analysis was performed and relationships developed. It was found that the developed relationships could predict the dependent variable very well; this was especially the case with the extinguishing time {{as a function of the}} total fire area. The relationship with the lowest ability to predict the dependent variable was the application rate of water as a function of the total fire area. The large number of parameters and their included uncertainties could be an explanation to the increased inability to predict the dependent variable. When comparing the control times of earlier conducted building fire studies with the extinguishing times of developed relationships, it was found that the control times were much longer than the corresponding extinguishing times. The reason behind was most likely due to the difference in the fire area applied in the equations. The resulting relationships for the grass fuel type were found to have lower ability to predict the dependent variable. The reason behind this is unclear and needs to be investigated further...|$|E

Electrical safety in industrial environments by the appropriate design of electrical installations, technical means and means of protection, organizational and technical measures. For protection against static electricity use of protective grounding. The safe operation of lifting and handling equipment is provided by the audit of the reliability and strength of their structural elements, as well as ropes, lifting devices. To reduce the harmful impact of the use of the Department of toxic substances into the running, you must use individual protection equipment: special clothing, anti-dust respirators.

40|$|The {{mission of}} the Coal Fire Gang (CFG) is to spread {{awareness}} about the global issue of uncontrolled coal fires, and to highlight them as a low-hanging fruit of immediate emissions reduction. This report summarizes CFG’s research for the WERC competition, for which this topic was chosen as an open task. Beyond raising awareness, CFG modeled, developed and built an experimentation apparatus meant to prove the validity of a relatively cheap extinguishing method which was also novel to the regions in which it could be employed. The apparatus, which simulated an underground coal fire, {{was used to test}} a sand and <b>water</b> <b>extinguishing</b> method. CFG’s results on the experimental research side suggest that the sand and water approach to extinguishing coal fires, though requiring attention and labor {{for long periods of time}} (up to a few years depending on how long the coal fire has been burning prior to extinguishing activities), is very cost effective. Exact economics of a particular coal fire would have to be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the size and age of the fire, but those costs include only sand, water, labor, and heavy equipment to transport the sand around. The proposed extinguishing technique involves capping all exhaust vents of a fire with sand, and then saturating the sand with water. The steam created by the water on contact with the heated ground and coal then expands and flows through the cavity, flowing out of what were originally combustion air influent vents. This flow reversal could significantly reduce the oxygen intake while also removing heat. Over time, as more vents are discovered or created, they can be capped in the same manner. On the economics side, CFG proved that even at conservative estimates of the cost to extinguish fires and the cost of alternative CO 2 sequestering methods, extinguishing coal fires is the for immediate global emission reduction. CFG proposes that coal fires around the world are prioritized ahead of new and expensive technology for emission reduction, and that at the very least the emissions from coal fires are drawn into some regulating system so that they can be tracked and better managed...|$|E
