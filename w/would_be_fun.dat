5|$|In 1980 Chrisye {{appeared}} in the Indonesian film Seindah Rembulan (As Beautiful as the Moon); at first reluctant to accept the role, he was convinced by Sys NS that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun.</b> He later regretted the decision, considering the film crew unprofessional and often fighting with director Syamsul Fuad. The following year, he released Pantulan Cita (Reflection of Dreams), a collaboration with Jockie. After the album flopped, Chrisye took a long sabbatical.|$|E
5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to play; after the voices were added, {{he could see the}} characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Siliconera writer Rolando again {{echoed the}} {{necessity}} for understanding Japanese due to the game's text-heavy nature while noting the plot was quite simple and in common with other Monolith Soft titles, but otherwise generally praised the gameplay mechanics and noted that multiplayer <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> {{despite the lack of}} WiFi functionality. In conclusion, he positively compared Soma Bringer to console turn-based role-playing game Lost Odyssey: while it brought nothing new to the genre, it was a nostalgic experience that reminded players of the genre's worth. English previews positively compared the gameplay to the Mana series, with 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish also noting it feeling familiar to gameplay from the Diablo series. These comparisons were also shared by other reviewers.|$|E

5|$|Rise of Mana was {{intended}} to reach a wide audience, gaining an attention only previously seen by Dawn of Mana in 2006. The concept of the main character switching between angelic and demonic form was suggested by Yagi. The original concept was to keep both characters in separate bodies, with the unoccupied character being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The team used the Photon Server middleware to develop the game's multiplayer component. The development team initially thought of creating custom middleware, but the rebuild needed {{would have taken a}} whole year, threatening the project's existence. In search of suitable middleware, the team contacted Fixer, who offered them the use of multiple options including Photon Server. Trying out Photon Server, all the problems faced by the developers were resolved within a two-month period, and the middleware's inbuilt security structure and specification match with the game persuaded the project's engineers to greenlight its use. Rise of Mana was the first Japanese game to use Photon Server. The team needed to create two different specifications for iOS and Android, as Android had higher graphical power. During the early development stage, the team thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to re-create the multiplayer elements in Secret of Mana. The initial idea was to have multiplayer available in standard quests, but this took up too much operational space to be practical, so they reduced this to raid battles. Due to the use of Photon Server, additional player characters could be fully rendered rather than appearing as ghost-like transparent helpers.|$|E

Charlie noticed an advertisement in CCM Magazine for a talent contest, which he thought <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to enterâ€”and had no expectations of being chosen to play live months later in Nashville for record companies. Ten finalists were chosen {{from all of the}} demos sent in, and Jars of Clay were elated to be one of them.|$|E

500|$|Not wanting Red to be [...] "boring" [...] or [...] "too innocent", she was {{patterned}} on James Dean {{and given}} the desire of leaving home to find her way in the world. Todd Edwards had the idea of basing the Wolf on Chevy Chase's character in Fletch, feeling that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to apply the character's dry, deadpan style of humor to an animated wolf, while Cory Edwards created the hyperactive character of Twitchy {{to serve as the}} Wolf's foil. Going against types, Red's Granny was written as a thrill-seeking action hero, while the strong Woodsman was written as being childishly incompetent.|$|E
500|$|... "D'oh-in' in the Wind" [...] {{was written}} by Donick Cary and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland and Matthew Nastuk. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on November 15, 1998. The idea for the episode was pitched by Cary, who thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to see the citizens of Springfield hallucinating. He then fleshed it out, forming its current iteration. The episode features the revelation of Homer's middle name, [...] "Jay", which is a [...] "tribute" [...] to animated characters such as Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show who got their middle initial from Jay Ward. The name was pitched on for three days by the writers.|$|E
500|$|New Line Cinema (one-time video {{distributor}} of the original) acquired {{the rights to}} the film from co-rights holder StudioCanal, who will control the European rights, and Carpenter, who will serve as an executive producer and said, [...] "Snake is one of my fondest creations. Kurt Russell did an incredible job, and it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to see someone else try." [...] Russell has commented on the remake and on the casting of Butler as Plissken, saying, [...] "I will say that when I was told who was going to play Snake Plissken, my initial reaction was 'Oh, man!'

500|$|Review did {{note that}} the [...] "Top 40" [...] songs do not always make for {{challenging}} songs, as many featured simple chord repetition throughout the song or simply following pre-programmed electronic keyboard or drum beats. However, most songs were found to feature at least one difficult instrument portion that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to play. Reviews {{also noted that the}} censoring of songs in order to affirm a family-friendly rating is awkward, such as censoring the word [...] "whiskey" [...] from Don McLean's [...] "American Pie" [...] (8 times), and can ruin the enjoyment of some songs. Greg Miller of IGN further noted that these censoring are at odds with the straight-up inclusion of other songs such as [...] "Gasoline" [...] by The Airborne Toxic Event which, Miller claims, is about sex.|$|E
500|$|After President John F. Kennedy {{was assassinated}} in , {{his family and friends}} {{discussed}} how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects. Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. [...] "He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem," [...] she said. [...] "He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful." [...] Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it [...] "really an emotional decision", she explained: [...] "He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to take a great leap with him." ...|$|E
500|$|The film is Spielberg's {{third on}} the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Producer and {{longtime}} collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with War of the Worlds, Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the antithesis of the characters brought to life in E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. [...] "When we first started developing E.T., it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign. I think that the edgier, darker story has always been somewhere inside him. [...] Now, he's telling that story." [...] Spielberg stated that he just thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to make a [...] "really scary film with really scary aliens", something which he had never done before. Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story, with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy, but depicted in a hyper-realistic way.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea that}} the {{children}} should go to a camp run by Krusty was first suggested by David M. Stern. The animators were enthusiastic about making this episode because they had all gone to summer camps as children and {{thought it would be}} a fun episode to write for. The writers also thought that [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> if while the kids are gone Homer and Marge find that as the kids are miserable their marriage is better than ever." [...] The layout for Bart and Lisa's cabin was influenced by the director, Mark Kirkland, who as a child went to a Boy Scout camp that had exposed wires and other similar faults. Kirkland was also sure that the character Mr. Black was going to reappear later in the series, but he never did. Al Jean commented, [...] "I guess that the hydrofoil really got Mr. Black out of the show forever." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the episode is a play on words, {{referring}} both {{to the introduction of}} the eleventh Doctor and {{to the fact that he}} was nearly too late, the connotation of [...] In the DVD commentary, Moffat said it was originally titled The Doctor Returns, and that it was the most difficult script he had ever written, as he had to introduce a new Doctor, a new companion, convince the audience that it was both a new and an old show, and deliver a fast-paced story. While traditionally the Doctor rests after he regenerates, Moffat thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to make him save the world instead. He described it as a comedy of a man whose day keeps getting worse and worse. Believing that London and companions from London had become a clichÃ© and the audience had become bored with it, Moffat set the episode in the fictional village of Leadworth. Moffat, a Scot, debated whether to locate the episode in a village in Scotland. He ultimately decided on England, in keeping with the notion of Amelia as an unconventional girl.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake did a joint tour in North America with Christina Aguilera {{entitled}} the Justified and Stripped Tour, to support both Justified and Aguilera's 2002 album, Stripped. Timberlake's and Aguilera's managers suggested to both singers {{to go on}} a conjoint tour. Timberlake agreed with the suggestion, saying that [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to be on tour with somebody who's that talented". Timberlake's further reasoning for touring with Aguilera was due to both singers wanting to [...] "break the mold of what people look at as teen pop and move into a different direction". For the tour, Timberlake wanted to transform arenas into clubs, stating that he wants people [...] "to feel like they're a part of the show and it's a party", remarking that anybody caught sitting down would get booted. For the tour, Timberlake performed with eight dancers, a 14-piece band which included four backup singers, three horn players and a DJ. The tour commenced on June 4, 2003 in Phoenix, Arizona and concluded on September 2, 2003 in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The tour grossed approximately $45 million.|$|E

500|$|In April 2005, {{after several}} months of planning, the LucasArts team {{received}} Lucas' encouragement to create a game centered on Darth Vader's secret apprentice in the largely unexplored period between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, [...] drawing the two trilogies together. LucasArts spent six months developing the story. Lucas spent hours discussing with the developers the relationship between Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine and provided feedback on what Vader would want out of and how he would motivate an apprentice. Lucas Licensing reviewed many game details to ensure they fit into canon. Focus group feedback indicated that, while hunting down Jedi at Vader's order <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun,</b> the character should be redeemed, in keeping with a major Star Wars motif. Although the game introduces new characters, developers felt the presence of characters already part of Star Wars would help anchor the game within the official continuity. Before the game's release, Lucasfilm claimed it would [...] "unveil new revelations about the Star Wars galaxy" [...] with a [...] "redemption" [...] motif. The story progresses {{through a combination of}} scripted events, in-game cinematics, cutscenes, and dialogue.|$|E

[...] Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times considered the song"one unfortunate collaboration," [...] while saying Spears [...] "herself could beat [...] in a rap battle." [...] Similarly, Eric R. Danton of the Hartford Courant deemed the [...] "banal" [...] song as [...] "characteristically vapid, with a refrain that quickly progresses from inane to annoying." [...] Robert Everett-Green of The Globe and Mail wrote that [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] is a [...] "verseless tune", and commented that [...] " [...] thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to make [...] sound like Rihanna" [...] on the song. Braulio Lorentz of Billboard Brasil said that [...] "even will.i.am can't save [...] " [...] with [...] "Big Fat Bass". The Idolator staff {{noted that the}} song has [...] "all {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of your average Black Eyed Peas tune â€” itâ€™s catchy but repetitive, danceable with pretty inconsequential lyrics, and has the potential to become annoying if played too frequently." ...|$|E
500|$|Tom Baker found filming in Paris to {{be a very}} {{different}} experience to what he was used to in the UK where crowds would gather to watch the filming and meet the stars. Doctor Who was not shown in France at the time and so the cast and crew were largely ignored. Lalla Ward found City of Death the most challenging Doctor Who serial she worked on but was pleased with the final outcome, saying, [...] "We had to film loads of scenes in the rain and cold... there was no glamour in it at all... it was different from the ordinary stories too and I like the finished result". Seeing her costumes as an important part in creating the role of Romana, Ward clashed with costume designer Doreen James, rejecting the silver catsuit James had designed for her for the story. Ward {{came up with the idea}} for the schoolgirl costume she wore in conjunction with Baker, recalling, [...] "I thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to wear something that little girls probably hated wearing because it might cheer them up...
