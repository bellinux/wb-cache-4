60|$|Her {{married life}} glided happily on. She was alone all day, for, after an early breakfast her husband {{repaired}} {{every morning to}} the City, and did not return until their late dinner hour. He was 'in a China house,' he explained to Bella: which she found quite satisfactory, without pursuing the China house into minuter details than a wholesale vision of tea, rice, odd-smelling silks, carved boxes, and tight-eyed people in more than double-soled shoes, with their pigtails pulling their heads of hair off, painted on transparent porcelain. She always walked with her husband to the railroad, and was always there again to meet him; her old coquettish ways a little sobered down (but not much), and her dress as daintily managed as if she managed nothing else. But, John gone to business and Bella returned home, the dress would be laid aside, trim little wrappers and aprons would be substituted, and Bella, putting back her hair with both hands, {{as if she were}} making the most business-like arrangements for going dramatically distracted, would enter on the household affairs of the day. Such weighing and mixing and chopping and grating, such dusting and <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> <b>polishing,</b> such snipping and weeding and trowelling and other small gardening, such making and mending and folding and airing, such diverse arrangements, and above all such severe study! For Mrs J. R., who had never been wont to do too much at home as Miss B. W., was under the constant necessity of referring for advice and support to a sage volume entitled The Complete British Family Housewife, which she would sit consulting, with her elbows on the table and her temples on her hands, like some perplexed enchantress poring over the Black Art. This, principally because the Complete British Housewife, however sound a Briton at heart, was by no means an expert Briton at expressing herself with clearness in the British tongue, and sometimes might have issued her directions to equal purpose in the Kamskatchan language. In any crisis of this nature, Bella would suddenly exclaim aloud, 'Oh you ridiculous old thing, {{what do you mean by}} that? You must have been drinking!' And having made this marginal note, would try the Housewife again, with all her dimples screwed into an expression of profound research.|$|E
50|$|On 18 August, {{very early}} in the morning, a {{contingent}} of the Pakistani army led by Major Durrani proceeded towards Makalkandi in boats. He was accompanied by police officer Zainal Abedin and local Syed Fazlul Haque. At around 9 a.m. they reached the village of Makalkandi. It was the day of Vishahari Puja. The villagers were making arrangements for the puja. In the century old Chandi mandap {{in the western part of}} the village, the devotees were <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> the brass images. Young children were collecting flowers for worship. Suddenly, the Pakistani soldiers opened fire from the boats. The villagers ran wherever they could. Many of them dived into the Suta river. The Pakistani army alighted from the boats and went towards the Chandi mandapa. They caught hold of twelve villagers and made them stand in a line in front from the Chandi mandap. Eleven were shot to death, while the twelfth Kangsa Mohan Das survived the massacre with four bullet wounds. Subsequently, the Pakistani army combed the entire village and shot dead scores of people. The bodies were disposed off in the Suta river. Around 40 persons managed to escape with injuries. Though they succeeded in reaching India, the majority of them succumbed to their injuries. Women were raped and the entire village was looted by the Razakars. The entire village was doused with petrol and set on fire.|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of this paper, the sense in which {{cleanliness}} connects with godliness derives from the prominent role played by a handful of nonconformist entrepreneurs whose impact on the consumer goods industries extended far beyond the significance of their businesses when measured by investment or other financial criteria. The historically strong association between marketing and the manufacture and sale of packaged branded products supplying cleanliness to all classes in the form of soap, starch, <b>washing</b> blue, <b>and</b> <b>polish,</b> adds a special interest to a discussion of the conference themes of the virtue of business and the business of virtue. In pursuing the question of cleanliness next to godliness, the primary consideration in this paper is the connection between religious belief and the ethics of nonconformity and business conduct. For that purpose, we compare relevant aspects of the early histories of two British firms,J. & J. Colman of Stoke Holy Cross and subsequently Norwich, and Isaac Reckitt & Sons of Hull. Both were small to medium-sized firms during the period under consideration, but b...|$|R
50|$|When {{war broke}} out in 1914, Maclet served as a medical {{attendant}} in a temporary hospital run by the Little Sisters of the Poor. That allowed him to spend his periods of leave back in Montmartre, where he stayed at the ‘Lapin Agile” thanks to the hospitality of his friend Frede. Maclet slept in the cabaret hall and paid for his food by <b>washing</b> dishes <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> the copper pots. On one of these leaves, he painted two small pictures of Sacre-Coeur and the Moulin de la Galette which he sold to a Mr. Deibler, who combined his profession of official executioner with a love of the fine arts. Deibler was not his only patron and admirer. Francis Carco, the mayor of Montmartre: the innkeeper known as ”Le pere gay”; the famous writer Colette; and the American art dealer Hugo Perlsall regarded him as the equal of other great painters of the period. Famous dealers of the time, such as Pierre Menant and Matho Kleimann-Boch, hung Maclet’s work beside the paintings of Van Gogh and Picasso in their galleries.|$|R

The same causes lead to confusion of tongues, a clattering of crockery, a rattling of tin mugs, a whisking of brooms, and an expenditure of water, all in excess, while the saturation of the young ladies themselves is almost too moving a spectacle for Mrs. Bagnet to look upon with the calmness proper to her position. At last the various cleansing processes are triumphantly completed; Quebec and Malta appear in fresh attire, smiling and dry; pipes, tobacco, and something to drink are placed upon the table; and the old girl enjoys the first peace of mind she ever knows on the day of this delightful entertainment.|$|R

Pedal power is used transmit this power to run the machine by the operator. Power can be transmitted through crank chain to free wheel to the working unit. This human powered flywheel motor concept (HPFM) provide new era in the human powered agriculture processing, harvesting, post harvested operations equipments. Considering social, cultural and environmental factor as well as in many rural operations utilizing unskilled worker and in Vidharbha region there is more problem of electricity so this kind of HPFM concept is helpful in driving various rural machines. The machine is economically viable, can be adopted for human powered process units which could have intermitted operation without affecting the end product.

40|$|The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has funded a {{pilot project}} to assist small and medium-size {{manufacturers}} who want to minimize their generation of waste but who lack the expertise to do so. In an effort to assist these manufacturers Waste Minimization Assessment Centers (WMACs) were established at selected universities and procedures were adapted from the EPA Waste Minimization Opportunity Assessment Manual (EPA/ 625 / 7 - 88 / 003, July 1988). That document has been superseded by the Facility Pollution Prevention Guide (EPA/ 600 /R- 92 / 088, May 1992). The WMAC team at the University of Tennessee performed an assessment at a plant that manufactures various types of metal fasteners for automobiles, furniture, and appliances. Products are manufactured from steel, brass, copper, and aluminum wire and rod stock in two production lines-large part production and small part production. In large part production, header machines press wire stock into specific product shapes which are <b>washed,</b> machined, <b>and</b> in some cases heat-treated <b>and</b> <b>polished.</b> Small parts are manufactured from wire and rod stock {{in a series of}} machining operations, then <b>washed,</b> heat treated <b>and</b> <b>polished,</b> before shipment to an outside firm for surface finishing.
