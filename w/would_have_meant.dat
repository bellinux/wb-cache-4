5|$|Hambleton had Top Secret {{access to}} Strategic Air Command {{operations}} {{and was an}} expert in surface-to-air missile countermeasures. The North Vietnamese Army may have possessed information about his presence in Vietnam and his capture <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> a huge intelligence bonanza for the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Then in August 2009, {{speculation}} mounted {{that the}} UK would drop the F-35B for the F-35C model, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> the carriers being built to operate conventional {{take off and}} landing aircraft using the US-designed Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) catapults.|$|E
5|$|Despite American {{hunger for}} land, the {{leadership}} in the Minnesota Territory did not actually want to remove the Sioux from the territory. Federal subsidies to the tribes were heavily siphoned by the U.S. settlements and removal of the tribes from the territory <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> loss of this income.|$|E
50|$|Robert, the king's uncle, {{successfully}} interposed and no repudiation followed as repudiating her <b>would</b> also <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> {{the loss}} of Artois to the French crown.|$|R
25|$|Note: The Lockheed YF-12 was {{supposed}} to be stationed at Otis. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> either <b>meant</b> the creation of three new squadrons, or the reuse of the above squadrons.|$|R
50|$|However, {{when it came}} to settlement, Boat Park {{supplied}} a valuation {{report that}} gave a valuation of $3.5 million, more than triple the purchase price, which if accepted, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> effectively <b>meant</b> vendor finance of 100%.|$|R
5|$|Life peerages {{were also}} offered {{to members of}} the royal family with new {{hereditary}} peerages, but declined (as it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> they would hold seats in the House of Lords): Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Prince Charles, Duke of Cornwall and Rothesay; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. The Dukes of Gloucester and Kent had both inherited their titles from their fathers, the first dukes.|$|E
5|$|Peter Padfield's Hess, Hitler and Churchill (2013) {{explores the}} mystery of Hess's flight to Britain. Padfield {{suggests}} that Hess was carrying documents with detailed proposals from Hitler which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> peace between Germany and Britain, which would stand neutral in a planned German war against the Soviet Union, in return for which Germany was willing to withdraw from Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Z-8 Geier was not produced. It was {{intended}} as a ground attack aircraft and reached the first planning phase but was given up due to lack of performance and protective armour allocation against anti-aircraft artillery. An increase in armour <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> a decrease in speed which would have exposed the aircraft further to enemy fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not {{the latter}} part, sir," [...] {{the young man}} answered. [...] "I thought perhaps you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> noticed--I <b>meant</b> {{to speak to you}} as soon as you were a little stronger--I have asked Hester to be my wife!" ...|$|R
5000|$|This <b>would</b> {{therefore}} <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> {{an increase}} to five services per hour at Romiley, with possibility for more, should services from Rose Hill have been increased as discussed. The line <b>would</b> <b>have</b> effectively been {{run as a}} [...] "tram-train" [...] operation, offering users of stations along the route the ease of showing up without generally needing to know exact departure times.|$|R
50|$|Prussia's {{controlling}} {{position in the}} German Empire meant that the system {{was at the heart}} of debates about reform. Extending suffrage <b>would,</b> however, <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> the downfall of the ruling conservative politicians, elected by the wealthy voters favoured by the three-class system. Thus, despite popular dissatisfaction, the Prussian franchise persisted.|$|R
5|$|The {{area and}} the {{surrounding}} chase were subject to forest law, as a Royal forest. In the early period, this <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> harsh punishments for residents that poached livestock or encroached on other Royal entitlements. By Tudor times, royal lands had become used as commons and forest law had fallen into disuse.|$|E
5|$|Ímar mac Arailt (died 1054) was an eleventh-century {{ruler of}} the Kingdom of Dublin and perhaps the Kingdom of the Isles. He {{was the son of}} a man named Aralt, and appears to have been a {{grandson}} of Amlaíb Cuarán, King of Northumbria and Dublin. Such a relationship <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> that Ímar was a member of the Uí Ímair, and that he was a nephew of Amlaíb Cuarán's son, Sitriuc mac Amlaíb, King of Dublin, a man driven from Dublin by Echmarcach mac Ragnaill in 1036.|$|E
5|$|A {{story was}} told that Ælfric {{introduced}} monks into the cathedral church of Christ Church, Canterbury, replacing the secular clerks that {{had taken over the}} foundation during the ninth century. Ælfric is said to have done this on the command of the pope. This story originally dates to soon after the Norman Conquest and originated with the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear. He likely performed the marriage ceremony of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, which, if true, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.|$|E
60|$|But {{the very}} shiftlessness of the {{household}} rendered the misfortune a less terrifying one to them than it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been to a thriving family, though {{in the present case}} it meant ruin, and in the other it <b>would</b> only <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> inconvenience. In the Durbeyfield countenances there was nothing of the red wrath that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> burnt upon the girl from parents more ambitious for her welfare. Nobody blamed Tess as she blamed herself.|$|R
2500|$|In the Hebrew Bible, {{three classes}} {{of people are}} {{identified}} as [...] "anointed," [...] that is, [...] "Messiahs": prophets, priests, and kings. In Jesus' time, the term Messiah was used in different ways, {{and no one can}} be sure how Jesus <b>would</b> even <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> it if he had accepted the term.|$|R
50|$|After 1706, {{the name}} was usually spelt with a G. The rootword is the Old High German rod and the Middle High German rot, meaning a place made tillable by clearing, or simply a clearing. The {{qualifier}} Sargen— might well go back to somebody named Saricho. Thus, the name <b>would</b> originally <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> “Saricho’s Clearing”.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Wodehouse and his wife {{remained}} at their Le Touquet house, where, during the Phoney War, he worked on Joy in the Morning. With the advance of the Germans, the nearby Royal Air Force base withdrew; Wodehouse was offered the sole spare seat in one of the fighter aircraft, but he turned down the opportunity as it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> leaving behind Ethel and their dog. On 21 May 1940, with German troops advancing through northern France, the Wodehouses decided to drive to Portugal and fly from there to the US. Two miles from home their car broke down, so they returned and borrowed a car from a neighbour; with the routes blocked with refugees, they returned home again.|$|E
5|$|At the time, HBO {{made their}} {{commitments}} {{for only one}} year at a time, a third season <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> opening up a new two-season book in Daniel Knauf's six-year plan, including {{the introduction of new}} storylines for current and new characters, and further clarification and elaboration on the show's mythology. HBO announced that the show had been cancelled on May 11, 2005. HBO's president Chris Albrecht said the network would have considered otherwise if the producers had been willing to lower the price of an episode to US$2million; but the running costs for the sizable cast, the all-on-location shooting and the number of episodes per season were too enormous for them.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{conspired to}} oust Podgorny from the {{collective}} leadership {{as early as}} 1970. The reason was simple: Brezhnev was third, while Podgorny was first in the ranking of Soviet diplomatic protocol; Podgorny's removal would have made Brezhnev head of state, and his political power would have increased significantly. For much of the period, however, Brezhnev was unable to have Podgorny removed, {{because he could not}} count on enough votes in the Politburo, since the removal of Podgorny <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> weakening of the power and the prestige of the collective leadership itself. Indeed, Podgorny continued to acquire greater power as the head of state throughout the early 1970s, due to Brezhnev's liberal stance on Yugoslavia and his disarmament talks with some Western powers, policies which many Soviet officials saw as contrary to common communist principles.|$|E
60|$|And, indeed, Granville Kelmscott couldn't help {{admitting to}} himself, {{when he came}} to think of it, that King Khatsua was acting wisely in his generation. For the {{introduction}} of diggers into his dominions <b>would</b> surely <b>have</b> <b>meant,</b> as everywhere else, the speedy proclamation of a British protectorate, and the final annihilation of King Khatsua himself and his dusky fellow-countrymen.|$|R
5000|$|This idea is {{not backed}} by {{linguistic}} evidence. Combining the two Old English words [...] "wascan" [...] and [...] "dūn" [...] <b>would</b> actually <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> [...] "washed hill" [...] and not [...] "washing hill". Also, the Old English [...] "dūn" [...] meant a range of gently rolling hills, {{as evidenced by the}} naming of the North and South Downs in southern England.|$|R
25|$|Oesch {{was given}} the title Commander of the Isthmus Forces, and a staff was {{gathered}} to serve under him. For the second time Oesch was sent {{to take over a}} critical part of the front; this time it was the most critical ever. A decisive Soviet breakthrough in the Karelian Isthmus <b>would</b> probably <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> Soviet occupation of Finland and Finland becoming a Soviet satellite.|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with clinker (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting gunports into a clinker-built hull <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with carvel edge-to-edge planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the clinker planking is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping planking, though not with a true clinker technique.|$|E
5|$|In 1953 the Returned and Services League (RSL), a {{veterans}} organisation, recommended Saunders {{for inclusion}} in the official Australian contingent to the coronation of Elizabeth II; the Federal government rejected the suggestion on the grounds that including Saunders <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> excluding an officer who had been previously selected. Following his service in the Korean War, Saunders remained in the Army overseeing training for national servicemen at Puckapunyal. Away from active service, however, he soon became dissatisfied and in 1954 was discharged at his own request. The same year, he married an Irish nurse, Pat Montgomery; his first marriage had broken down soon after he returned from Korea.|$|E
5|$|In 1997–98, Mills' Grantham won the Southern League Midland Division title, earning {{promotion}} to the Southern League Premier Division, having led {{the table from}} the start of the season. Grantham also reached the quarter-final of the FA Trophy for only the second time in the club's history. He appeared even more frequently in the first team this season, making 50 appearances. However, Mills resigned a week after the season ended in May 1998 as the club's takeover by local businessman Reg Brealey <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> dismantling the team due to budget cuts. He joined Gresley Rovers of the Southern League Premier Division as a player in July 1998, making his debut in their 0–0 away draw with Bromsgrove Rovers on 22 August. He appeared regularly for Gresley, playing in their first seven matches of 1998–99.|$|E
50|$|Lee {{described}} {{an experiment in}} which 50 healthy women prisoners were selected and given poisoned cabbage leaves. All {{of the women were}} required to eat the cabbage, despite cries of distress from those who had already eaten. All 50 died after 20 minutes of vomiting blood and anal bleeding. Refusing to eat the cabbage <b>would</b> allegedly <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> reprisals against them and their families.|$|R
50|$|Tuqiri's {{contract}} <b>would</b> ordinarily <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> that he <b>would</b> {{stay with}} the Waratahs and the Wallabies till the year 2012, but on 1 July 2009 the ARU announced an unexplained, immediate termination of the contract. Subsequently, {{it has been suggested}} that the reason for the termination of his contract was that he had entertained a 20-year-old student in his room, in breach of strict team rules.|$|R
50|$|This {{alignment}} {{called for}} an elevated four lane structure {{on the north side}} of Gandy Blvd, connecting the Selmon Expressway and Dale Mabry Hwy to the Gandy Bridge. Interchanges at Manhattan and WestShore <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been built as well. However, this <b>would</b> <b>have</b> also <b>meant</b> that 37 businesses <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been wiped out, sparking fierce opposition among the Gandy community. Since the early 2000s, there have been no plans to bring this alignment back to the forefront.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, three {{countries}} applied {{to make their}} debut: Albania, Belarus and Ukraine. In addition, Serbia and Montenegro, who had not competed since 1992, applied to return. The EBU, having originally accepted the four countries' applications, later rejected all but Ukraine; allowing four extra countries to compete <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> relegating too many countries. The semi-final was introduced in 2004 {{in an attempt to}} prevent situations like this. The Union set a limit of forty countries, but by 2005 thirty-nine were competing. In 2007, the EBU lifted the limit, allowing forty-two countries to compete. Two semi-finals were held {{for the first time in}} 2008.|$|E
5|$|Initially, diesel {{propulsion}} {{was planned}} for these ships, {{as had been}} used for the three Panzerschiffe. However, {{it was decided to}} use superheated steam propulsion. The main reason was that the required total output for the desired speed was three times that of the Panzerschiffe. In the case of triple-screw ships, this <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> more than twice the shaft horsepower per shaft of the Panzerschiffe, {{and in the case of}} a quadruple-screw ship, this would have amounted to more than 40,000 horsepower per shaft. This requirement was beyond the diesel technology then available, and devising engines that could meet this demand would take an unforeseeable amount of time. Since high-pressure superheated steam had already proved successful, it was considered the most suitable choice for high power machinery.|$|E
5|$|Planning for the {{operation}} began in 1943. In {{the months leading up}} to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. The weather on D-Day was far from ideal, but postponing <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> a delay of at least two weeks, as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days in each month were deemed suitable. Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion.|$|E
50|$|Wilson's {{first season}} brought a sixth-place finish in Division One, which <b>would</b> {{normally}} <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> a playoff place, but a {{restructuring of the}} league meant that they missed out. They finished 10th a year later before finally emerging as serious promotion contenders in the 1996-97 season, finally clinching runners-up spot and automatic promotion and gaining the top flight place that they had spent 99 years trying to win.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Gleaming in {{the warm}} sunlight, Lockheed/Vega B-17G-45-VE Fortress 44-8020 was the lead {{aircraft}} for the 49th Bombardment Squadron from 23 July 1944 until VE-Day. Seen dropping 500-lb RDX bombs just weeks after its arrival in the MTO. the aircraft had its radar 'dustbin' extended, although the lack of cloud {{on this particular day}} <b>would</b> surely <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> that the bombardiers attacked using their Norden sights.

50|$|Sinagra was not {{actually}} {{a member of}} the Mafia but just a petty criminal, one of fourteen children to a fisherman from Palermo. In 1981 he made the mistake of robbing {{a member of the}} Mafia and although this <b>would</b> normally <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> instant death, because he had a cousin in the Mafia (see below) he was given a choice of leaving Sicily, being killed or becoming a gofer for the Mafia. He chose the third option.|$|R
