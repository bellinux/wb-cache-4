5|$|York again drew Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth {{round in}} 1985–86, {{and took the}} lead through Gary Ford only to concede a {{stoppage}} time equaliser. Tony Canham scored at Anfield and York had a second goal disallowed before York succymbed to a 3–1 defeat in extra time. York lost only three home league matches all season, but missed out on promotion after finishing seventh. In the summer of 1986 he sold MacPhail to Bristol City for £15,000, whilst many of the veteran players he signed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> to the club were coming {{to the end of}} their careers. The 1986–87 season was disappointing for York as they were knocked out of the FA Cup by non-League team Caernarfon Town and ended the season in 20th-place. They did though manage to beat Chelsea 1–0 in the League Cup, but lost the return fixture at Stamford Bridge 3–0. Smith ended up falling out with the club's directors, who invested money in the club's facilities rather than on players, and released goalkeeper Andy Leaning against his wishes.|$|E
5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived in <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The {{house was built}} in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck {{with the idea of}} attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E

25|$|The loss {{of almost}} all of their land {{was not the only}} issue that the Havasupai were contending with: the {{increase}} in the number of settlers in the local region had depleted game used for hunting, and soil erosion (a result of poor irrigation techniques) touched off a series of food shortages.

During his tenure as manager of Drury Lane, Garrick also sought to reform audience behaviour.

Garrick also sought reform in production matters, bringing an overarching consistency to productions that included set design, costumes and even special effects.|$|E

The true Philomel hardly enters Venetia, hardly crosses the Swiss Alps, ventures not into the Rhineland and Denmark, but penetrates (strangely enough) further into South Sweden than our own Luscinia: ranging meanwhile over all Central Europe, Persia, and the East, even to Egypt. Whether his song be really sad, let those who have heard him say.
