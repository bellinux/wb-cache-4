5|$|Miller's {{uncertain}} future continued to dog him, and Rawtenstall expressed their displeasure at their recruit's apparent refusal to fulfil his contract. Miller had privately {{decided that he}} would not go through with the deal, but was refusing to inform the Lancastrian club. In the meantime, he had various job proposals, which he spurned until privately receiving a contract offer from the manager of North Sydney Cricket Club. The proposed deal <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> subsidy for the costs of his relocation to Sydney to work as a liquor salesman, and gave him generous leave conditions so that he could play sport.|$|E
5|$|Kalākaua's Masonic ties as Master of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> global brotherhood in his travels. He and {{his chosen}} companions boarded the {{steamship}} City of Sydney at 6:30a.m., January 20, bound for San Francisco. As the King {{made his way}} onto the ship, many in {{the crowd at the}} dock reached out to touch him. Major George W. Macfarlane, his aide-de-camp, would accompany them as far as California. The King traveled as Aliʻi Kalākaua and as Prince Kalākaua, rather than in his capacity as head of state. The intent was to give the impression of a personal vacation, thereby avoiding the large costly retinue required for official business. The Royal Hawaiian Band, the Hawaiian army, and a large contingent of well-wishers bid them farewell as the City of Sydney sailed out.|$|E
5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's negotiators {{hoped to}} reach a truce in Vietnam prior to the election. Nixon {{received}} astute analysis on the talks from Henry Kissinger, then a consultant to U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman, and his campaign was in regular contact with Anna Chennault (at a July 1968 meeting in Nixon's New York apartment with South Vietnamese ambassador Bùi Diễm, he had been informed that Chennault would represent Nixon during the campaign). She advised South Vietnamese president Thieu {{not to go to}} Paris to join the talks, hinting that Nixon <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> better deal if elected. Johnson was aware of what was going on, as he had both Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington bugged, and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by Nixon to undermine U.S. foreign policy. On October 31, with no agreement, Johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing, and that peace negotiations would start in Paris on November 6, the day after Election Day. On November 2, after speaking with Chennault again, Thieu stated he would not go to Paris. Johnson telephoned Nixon, who denied any involvement; the President did not believe him. Johnson felt he could not publicly mention Chennault's involvement, which had been obtained by wiretapping, but told Humphrey, who chose not to use the information.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, {{and a third}} on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. All three sessions were held on a dry track. Hamilton was fastest in the first session {{with a time of}} 1:35.630, 0.39 of a second ahead of Massa, who was next quickest. Räikkönen, Heikki Kovalainen of McLaren, Kubica, Alonso and Heidfeld rounded out the top seven. Sébastien Bourdais of Toro Rosso was eighth, having been quickest early in the session. Renault driver Nelson Piquet drove into the gravel beside the pit-lane entry, though managed to rejoin. Hamilton was again quickest in the second session; his early time of 1:35.750 was the fastest of the afternoon. The Renaults were next quickest, ahead of Jarno Trulli of Toyota, Red Bull driver Mark Webber, Massa, Bourdais and Räikkönen. Bourdais spun off at turn two late in the session and beached his car in the gravel. Heidfeld was fastest in the final session with a time of 1:36.061, ahead of Hamilton, Kubica and Kovalainen. Massa, Räikkönen and Alonso lacked pace, and failed to make the top ten. Webber stopped late in the session when his engine failed on the back straight, requiring an engine change before qualifying. This <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> ten-place penalty on the grid.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 2008 season, Varitek {{opted for}} free agency, rejecting {{arbitration}} that <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> salary close to the $10 million he made in 2008.|$|E

25|$|It {{was also}} during McHale's reign that the Timberwolves were punished by the NBA {{for making a}} secret deal with free agent forward Joe Smith to {{circumvent}} the league's salary cap rules. Before the 1998–99 season, Smith secretly agreed to sign three, one-year contracts with the Timberwolves for salary amounts that were much less than what any other NBA teams would have reasonably offered him. In return, Smith received a promise that the Timberwolves <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> multi-year, multimillion-dollar contract before the 2001–02 season.|$|E
25|$|Victor Alonso of Spanoramic records got {{interested}} in Poventud's musical work. Before her death, Alonso promised Poventud's mother that he <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> career opportunity. He made Poventud an offer that included the recording of Poventud's first record album titled Pobre Huerfanito (Poor Little Orphan) in New York City. At this point, Poventud's father again resisted the boy's musical career, {{and his older brother}} Carlos argued with the father about Miguelito's future. After this argument, Carlos took young Poventud to live with him in New York City, and became his legal guardian.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{withdrawing}} from the presidential race in July 2011, Norris maintained considerable and, in some cases, increased public support. A poll taken one week after Norris withdrew from the presidential race, showed a large increase in public support for his Presidency if they were given the choice {{to vote for him}} (topping the poll by a considerable margin) with 40 per cent of respondents now saying they would vote Norris number one in the preferential voting electoral system and 50 per cent saying they <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> vote.|$|E
25|$|Bale {{attended}} Whitchurch High School in Cardiff. He was a keen {{athlete and}} played football alongside future Wales rugby captain Sam Warburton, rugby, hockey and excelled at athletics. As a 14-year-old {{he says that}} he ran the 100-metre sprint in 11.4 seconds. Because of his superior footballing skill, the school's PE teacher, Gwyn Morris, had to write special rules which restricted Bale to playing one-touch football and not using his left foot. Whilst at Whitchurch, Bale trained at Southampton's satellite academy in Bath, although there was initially some doubt if Southampton <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> scholarship due to his height.|$|E
25|$|Sensing {{that his}} time at CBS was ending, and tired of the {{restrictions}} imposed by the network, Griffin secretly {{signed a contract with}} rival company Metromedia. The contract with Metromedia <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> syndicated daytime talk show deal as soon as CBS canceled Griffin's show. Within a few months, Griffin was fired by CBS. His new show began the following Monday and ran until the mid-1980s. By 1986, Griffin was ready to retire and ended his talk show run. Thanks to profits from his highly successful game shows, Griffin had become one of the world's wealthiest entertainers.|$|E

25|$|He {{will return}} to the WTCC in 2013, driving a Lada Granta WTCC {{full-time}} with Lada Sport Lukoil alongside new team mate Aleksei Dudukalo. During qualifying for the Race of Italy he was hit by Dudukalo who had missed the braking point for the first chicane. Thompson was already through to Q2 and he returned to the pits for repairs before taking part in the second session. He set the ninth fastest time which <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> front row start when the grid was reversed for race two. Lada later withdrew both of their cars prior to the races as neither could be repaired in time to participate.|$|E
25|$|Massey {{was born}} in Toronto, Ontario, {{as the son of}} Anna (née Vincent) and Chester Daniel Massey, the owner of the Massey-Harris Co. (predecessor company to the Massey-Ferguson Tractor Company) and the patriarch of one of the city's wealthiest families. The clan was {{strongly}} Methodist and {{played an important role in}} supporting local religious, cultural, and educational organisations, including Victoria University, Massey Hall, and the Metropolitan Methodist Church (now the Metropolitan United Church). Massey was thus raised amongst Toronto's elite, which <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> number of social and familial connections throughout his life, as occurred with his younger brother, the actor Raymond Massey, his niece Anna Massey and his nephew Daniel Massey.|$|E
25|$|Sheridan {{believed}} that understanding the topography of the Shenandoah Valley <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> strategic and tactical advantage. By {{the summer of}} 1864, Meigs was {{recognized as one of}} the best mapmakers in the Union Army. At his base in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, he spent hours being tutored by Meigs on the layout of the valley. From Meigs, Sheridan learned that the long ridges in the Shenandoah were not the great protective barriers Union commanders had assumed. The ridges had a number of gaps. Confederate forces could ride north and south, screened by the ridges, and then turn through the gaps to initiate flank attacks on Union forces. Sheridan resolved to protect his flanks from these attacks, and take advantage of the gaps himself.|$|E

60|$|When von Horn {{returned}} {{to the court of}} mystery, he narrated to Professor Maxon the gist of his conversation with Virginia, wishing to forestall anything which the girl might say to her father that <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> impression that von Horn had been talking more than he should. Professor Maxon listened to the narration in silence. When von Horn had finished, he cautioned him against divulging to Virginia anything that took place within the inner campong.|$|R
25|$|Manetho's Epitome {{has been}} a debated topic among Egyptologists with little {{consensus}} given {{the small number of}} surviving documents for his reign, but a 13-year reign is preferred by older scholars while newer scholars prefer a shorter 3-4 year reign for this king due to the minimal amount of scarabs and monuments attested under Thutmose II. It is still possible to estimate when Thutmose II's reign would have begun by means of a heliacal rise of Sothis in Amenhotep I's reign, which <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> reign from 1493 to 1479 BC, although uncertainty about how to interpret the rise also permits a date from 1513 to 1499 BC, and uncertainty about how long Thutmose I ruled could also potentially place his reign several years earlier still. Nonetheless, scholars generally assign him a reign from 1493 or 1492 to 1479.|$|E
25|$|In the 2011 IPL auction, Sharma {{was bought}} by the Deccan Chargers; he hoped that his {{performance}} in the competition <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> chance to impress selectors and push for selection in India's ODI team. From 12matches, Sharma took 11wickets {{at an average of}} 28.54. A month after the IPL, which was held in April and May, India toured the West Indies for five ODIs and three Tests. Several senior players were rested from the ODI side and others absent through injury; this mostly affected the batsmen but Zaheer Khan missed the ODI series. India won the first three ODIs, and Sharma was called into the team for the fourth, his first ODI since August 2010. He managed one wicket from two matches in the series while conceding 109runs. The first Test resulted in a win for India and Sharma took three wickets in each innings. He claimed his 100th Test wicket in the second Test, becoming the fifth youngest to reach the landmark; the fixture was also the first time he took ten wickets in a match for India. The second and third Tests ended in draws and India won the series 1–0; Sharma was the leading wicket-taker on either side with 22dismissals at an average of 16.86.|$|E
25|$|Ford was {{renowned for}} his intense {{personality}} and his many idiosyncrasies and eccentricities. From the early Thirties onwards, he always wore dark {{glasses and a}} patch over his left eye, which was only partly to protect his poor eyesight. He was an inveterate pipe-smoker {{and while he was}} shooting he would chew on a linen handkerchief—each morning his wife <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> dozen fresh handkerchiefs, {{but by the end of}} a day's filming the corners of all of them would be chewed to shreds. He always had music played on the set and would routinely break for tea (Earl Grey) at mid-afternoon every day during filming. He discouraged chatter and disliked bad language on set; its use, especially in front of a woman, would typically result in the offender being thrown off the production. He rarely drank during the making of a film, but when a production wrapped he would often lock himself in his study, wrapped only in a sheet, and go on a solitary drinking binge for several days, followed by routine contrition and a vow never to drink again. He was extremely sensitive to criticism and was always particularly angered by any comparison between his work and that of his older brother Francis. He rarely attended premieres or award ceremonies, although his Oscars and other awards were proudly displayed on the mantel in his home.|$|E
50|$|Brown {{lost the}} {{election}} {{for the new}} Cleethorpes seat at the general election on 1 May 1997. Initially he struggled to find employment, working for David Evans contract cleaning firm but in April 1998 he submitted a piece for The Independent on how he {{was looking forward to}} being canvassed by the Labour Party candidates for his area in the Westminster City Council elections, which <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to play the kind of tricks voters often play on election candidates.|$|R
50|$|During his career, Falls {{also had}} weekly columns in both The Sporting News and The Hockey News. It is said many young writers were so taken by his writing {{they wanted to}} become sportswriters. He also kept a {{statistic}} on Rocky Colavito during {{his years as a}} member of the Detroit Tigers. When Colavito stranded <b>a</b> runner, Falls <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> RNBI (Run Not Batted In). This infuriated Colavito and created a tense relationship between the two for several years.|$|R
