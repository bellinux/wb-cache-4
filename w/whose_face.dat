5|$|Legendary {{stories of}} pig-faced women {{originated}} roughly simultaneously in Holland, England and France {{in the late}} 1630s. The stories told of a wealthy woman whose body was of normal human appearance, but <b>whose</b> <b>face</b> {{was that of a}} pig.|$|E

5|$|As a judge, Parker was {{notable for}} {{independently}} researching each {{case that he}} heard. He was {{generally considered to be}} pro-labor and was an active supporter of social reform legislation, for example upholding a maximum-hours law as constitutional. In the 1902 decision Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co, Parker found against a woman <b>whose</b> <b>face</b> had been used in advertisements without her permission, ruling that this use did not violate her common law privacy rights. The decision was unpopular in the press and led to the passage of a privacy law by the New York State Legislature the following year. In the same year, Parker upheld the death sentence given to convicted murderer Martha Place, who became the first woman to be executed by electric chair.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} illustrations, {{which may have}} been drawn by Raspe himself, the Baron appears slim and youthful. For the 1792 Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, an anonymous artist drew the Baron as a dignified but tired old soldier <b>whose</b> <b>face</b> is marred by injuries from his adventures; this illustration remained the standard portrait of the Baron for about seventy years, and its imagery was echoed in Cruikshank's depictions of the character. Doré, illustrating a Théophile Gautier fils translation in 1862, retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait, but gave the Baron a healthier and more affable appearance; the Doré Baron became the definitive visual representation for the character.|$|E

5|$|Later drafts see vice made {{central to}} the plot, with the Le Chiffre {{character}} becoming head {{of a network of}} brothels (as he is in the novel) whose patrons are then blackmailed by Le Chiffre to fund Spectre (an invention of the screenwriter). The racy plot elements opened up by this change of background include a chase scene through Hamburg's red light district that results in Bond escaping whilst disguised as a female mud wrestler. New characters appear such as Lili Wing, a brothel madam and former lover of Bond whose ultimate fate is to be crushed {{in the back of a}} garbage truck, and Gita, wife of Le Chiffre. The beautiful Gita, <b>whose</b> <b>face</b> and throat are hideously disfigured as a result of Bond using her as a shield during a gunfight in the same sequence which sees Wing meet her fate, goes on to become the prime protagonist in the torture scene that features in the book, a role originally Le Chiffre's.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} view of Rihanna lying in open waters, as other scenes of {{diamonds}} being rolled in a manner suggestive of making a joint are intercut– a scene reminiscent of the single's artwork. As the video progresses Rihanna is shown running on a highway. In a black-and-white scene, Rihanna licks the joint and begins smoking it. The image fades to black as the song begins. Rihanna performs in the same black-and-white setting while in a black corset. Images of Rihanna on a bed in a room while singing are shown, with objects breaking, curtains falling and roses burning in reverse effect. Rihanna is shown again on the highway, running away from {{what appears to be the}} headlights of a chasing car. She then stops as she looks up to the night sky at an aurora view. Throughout the video, Rihanna's hand is shown intertwined with that of a heavily tattooed man, <b>whose</b> <b>face</b> is not shown in the video. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is shown in a desert where horses run freely. Scenes of a street battle are later shown, depicting burning cars and broken glass around the environment. As the video continues, the singer and her lover's hands are shown slowly slipping apart, with only their fingertips touching towards the conclusion of the video. The video ends with Rihanna once again floating alone in the open waters.|$|E

5000|$|In geometry, a {{near-miss}} Johnson solid is {{a strictly}} convex polyhedron <b>whose</b> <b>faces</b> {{are close to}} being regular polygons but {{some or all of}} which are not precisely regular. Thus, it fails to meet the definition of a Johnson solid, a polyhedron <b>whose</b> <b>faces</b> are all regular, though it [...] "can often be physically constructed without noticing the discrepancy" [...] between its regular and irregular faces. The precise number of near misses depends on how closely the faces of such a polyhedron are required to approximate regular polygons. Some high symmetry near-misses are also symmetrohedra with some perfect regular polygon faces.|$|R
25|$|Between 2005 and 2008 new, lighter fifty-paise, one-, two- and five-rupee coins were introduced, {{made from}} {{ferritic}} stainless steel. The move {{was prompted by}} the melting-down of older coins, <b>whose</b> <b>face</b> value was less than their scrap value. The demonetisation of the 25-(chawanni) paise coin and all paise coins below it took place, and {{a new series of}} coins (50 paise– nicknamed athanni– one, two, five and ten rupees, with the new rupee symbol) were put into circulation in 2011. Coins commonly in circulation are one, two, five and ten rupees. Although it is still legal tender, the 50-paise (athanni) coin is rarely seen in circulation.|$|E

Roosevelt, Massachusetts Governor Winthrop Murray Crane, secretary {{to the president}} George Bruce Cortelyou, and bodyguard William Craig were thrown into the street. Craig was killed; {{he was the first}} Secret Service agent killed while on a presidential protection detail. Roosevelt, <b>whose</b> <b>face</b> and left shin were badly bruised, nearly came to blows with the trolley motorman, Euclid Madden.
