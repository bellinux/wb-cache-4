5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that given its proportion of the <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> and the lack of distinct collections, food waste is not currently being targeted appropriately. However proposals by the European Union, which would require local authorities to provide separate collection of food and garden waste, have been met with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they serve, and that they should decide waste policy. Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable waste from other materials.|$|E

40|$|Food {{industries}} produce {{huge amounts}} of processing waste that are often disposed of incurring expenses and impacting upon the environment. For these and other reasons, food processing <b>waste</b> <b>streams,</b> in particular marine processing <b>waste</b> <b>streams,</b> are gaining popularity amongst pharmaceutical, cosmetic and nutraceutical industries as sources of bioactive molecules. In the last 30 years, {{there has been a}} gradual increase in processed marine products with a concomitant increase in <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> that include viscera, heads, skins, fins, bones, trimmings and shellfish waste. In 2010, these <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> equated to approximately 24 million tonnes of mostly unused resources. Marine processing <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> not only represent an abundant resource, they are also enriched with structurally diverse molecules that possess a broad panel of bioactivities including anti-oxidant, anti-coagulant, anti-thrombotic, anti-cancer and immune-stimulatory activities. Retrieval and characterisation of bioactive molecules from marine processing waste also contributes valuable information to the vast field of marine natural product discovery.

25|$|In {{order to}} meet recyclers' needs while {{providing}} manufacturers a consistent, uniform system, a coding system was developed. The recycling code for plastics was introduced in 1988 by the plastics industry through the Society of the Plastics Industry.

40|$|When 55 -gal {{steel drum}} waste {{containers}} fail in service, i. e., leak, corrode or breach, the standard fix {{has been to}} overpack the drum. When a drum fails and is overpacked into an 83 -gal overpack drum, there are several negative consequences. Identifying <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> that preferentially corrode steel drums {{is essential to the}} pollution prevention philosophy that ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. `` It is essential that facilities perform pollution prevention measures at the front end of processes to reduce pollution on the back end. If these <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> can be identified before they are packaged, the initial drum packaging system could be fortified or increased to eliminate future drum failures, breaches, clean-ups, and the plethora of other consequences. Therefore, a survey was conducted throughout the US Department of Energy complex for information concerning <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> that have demonstrated preferential corrosion of 55 -gal steel drums. From 21 site contacts, 21 <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> were so identified. The major components of these <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> include acids, salts, and solvent liquids, sludges, and still bottoms.

25|$|Controlled {{high-temperature}} incineration, above 850°C for two seconds, {{performed with}} selective additional heating, breaks down toxic {{dioxins and furans}} from burning plastic, and is widely used in municipal solid waste incineration. Municipal solid waste incinerators also normally include flue gas treatments to reduce pollutants further. This is needed because uncontrolled incineration of plastic produces polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, a carcinogen (cancer causing chemical). The problem occurs because the heat content of the <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> varies. Open-air burning of plastic occurs at lower temperatures, and normally releases such toxic fumes.|$|E

25|$|E-waste is {{a growing}} problem, {{accounting}} for 20–50 million metric tons of global waste per year according to the EPA. It is also the fastest growing <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> in the EU. Many recyclers do not recycle e-waste responsibly. After the cargo barge Khian Sea dumped 14,000 metric tons of toxic ash in Haiti, the Basel Convention was formed to stem the flow of hazardous substances into poorer countries. They created the e-Stewards certification to ensure that recyclers are held to the highest standards for environmental responsibility and to help consumers identify responsible recyclers. This works alongside other prominent legislation, such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive of the EU the United States National Computer Recycling Act, to prevent poisonous chemicals from entering waterways and the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Early (1973) {{evaluations}} of the processes for removing dissolved arsenic from drinking water demonstrated the efficacy of co-precipitation with either iron or aluminum oxides. In particular, iron as a coagulant was found to remove arsenic with an efficacy exceeding 90%. Several adsorptive media systems have been approved for use at point-of-service in a study funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). A team of European and Indian scientists and engineers have set up six arsenic treatment plants in West Bengal based on in-situ remediation method (SAR Technology). This technology does not use any chemicals and arsenic is left in an insoluble form (+5 state) in the subterranean zone by recharging aerated water into the aquifer and developing an oxidation zone that supports arsenic oxidizing micro-organisms. This process does not produce any <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> or sludge and is relatively cheap.|$|E

40|$|Twenty-six waste {{samples from}} eight {{factories}} in the Goulburn Valley and south-west Victoria were characterised to determine their suitability {{for a range of}} potential uses. The <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> were found to be diverse in nature and composition. They included sludges and product rejects, such as cheeses, powders and ice-cream solids. The nutrient quality of many dairy processing wastes make them ideal for direct land application, but little information is available about their public health, agronomic and environmental impacts when they are applied to land. The moisture content of the sludges ranged from 21 - 97 % (w/w wet basis). On a dry basis, the total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total potassium of these wastes ranged from 0. 7 - 8. 9 % (w/w), 913 - 21, 349 mg/kg and 205 - 19, 673 mg/kg, respectively. <b>Waste</b> <b>streams</b> from cheese and/or ice-cream production were commonly recycled as stock feed. The digestibility for the stock feeds ranged from (w/w d. m.) 76. 6 - 94. 1 %, and there was wide variation in carbohydrate (1. 4 - 92 %), protein (4. 5 - 82. 1 %) and fat (0. 4 - 78. 9 %) contents between samples. <b>Waste</b> <b>streams</b> that were recycled as tallow had fat contents ranging from (w/w d. m.) 75. 3 % to more than 95 %, but only two of these were close to meeting the specifications for technical tallow production. Three high-fat (> 44 % w/w d. m.) <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> were also composted, including two grease trap <b>wastes.</b> High-fat <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> could possibly be used as boiler fuel, or for bio-diesel production, but at current waste volumes, these applications are probably not yet economically viable. Variability in the composition of dairy processing <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> is probably not a major concern for the continuing low-level utilisation of these <b>waste</b> <b>streams,</b> such as for land application, composting and stock feed. However, a better understanding of this variability is needed if higher value uses are to be considered for dairy-processing <b>waste</b> <b>streams...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{processing}} of cassava (Manihot esculenta) in Africa produces {{a range of}} <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> which are proving problematic due to their current mismanagement. Although a range of technical solutions exists to convert these <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> into valuable products, there has been very little progress made in applying these solutions. This review provides a broad picture of the cassava waste issue {{in the context of}} African agriculture and bioprocessing. As an outcome of the review process the authors propose a simple and scalable two-step process that biologically converts the <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> into valuable products. The first step in the process is fermentation and distillation of the cassava waste to produce ethanol. The second step is the anaerobic digestion of the fermentation byproducts with other <b>waste</b> <b>streams,</b> including animal manure and human excrement, to produce biogas and biological fertilizers. Despite the scalability of this system, the focus of this review is the development of a conceptual system for rural smallholders to achieve multiple beneficial outcomes including[*]treatment of multiple troublesome <b>waste</b> <b>streams,</b> production of a liquid biofuel, the provision of refrigeration through biogas powered absorption chillers, and the co-production of organic fertilizers...|$|R
