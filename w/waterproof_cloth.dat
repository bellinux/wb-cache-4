6000|$|... "The bags {{sometimes}} {{came off}} {{when we were}} travelling; but it was generally easy to catch the horse and reload him. When a horse rolled over, or fell in a river, it was rather an advantage than otherwise to get clear of them. Our waterproof bags were of leather, lined with <b>waterproof</b> <b>cloth,</b> just large enough to fill one of the canvas pack-bags. They had a brass neck with a worm inside, in which we screwed a plug of soft wood. (There was rarely, if ever, occasion to use them.) Each pair of bags was carefully balanced, one against the other, that the horses might not be unequally loaded. The average weight of stores carried in each bag was 75 lbs., making a load (at starting) or 150 lbs., exclusive of bags, packages, or saddlery. Bells were attached to the necks of the horses most apt to stray; but the clappers were tied up {{with a piece of}} thong, to keep them quiet on the march; and were loosened at night, so that the sound might guide us in searching for them next morning.|$|E

50|$|Dominion started {{operations}} as Brown, Hibbard and Bourne, established in 1854. In 1866, the company registered as the Canadian Rubber Company of Montreal Limited and became prosperous manufacturing <b>waterproof</b> <b>cloth,</b> rubber footwear and machinery belts.

5000|$|<b>Waterproofed</b> <b>cloth</b> {{garments}} were in {{use from}} the late 1700s. Various methods of waterproofing were used over the years. Some early sou'westers and rain capes were handmade of sailcloth waterproofed with {{a thin layer of}} tar, while other methods involved [...] canvas duck coated with multiple applications of linseed oil and paint. [...] While durable, these methods of waterproofing did not possess the breathable qualities of Le Roy's process.|$|R
50|$|In 1836, Sievier {{patented}} {{a process}} for rubberising fabrics and formed a ‘patent’ company (the London Caoutchouc Company - caoutchouc being the original name for India rubber). The company became large-scale manufacturers of elastic driving bands for machinery, rope for mines, <b>waterproof</b> <b>cloths</b> and garments, and waterproof canvas, as well the first rubber-insulated wire. His interests in manufacturing took over from the early 1840s onwards. Sievier's factory was situated close to his home, the Old Manor House, in Upper Holloway, at the south corner of Red Cap Lane (later Elthorne Road). Sievier also carried out experiments in electrical telegraphy there. The house was demolished in 1897.|$|R
50|$|In 1823 Charles Macintosh (1766-1843) {{patented}} {{his invention}} for <b>waterproof</b> rubberised <b>cloth,</b> pressing together two sheets of cotton material with dissolved India-rubber sandwiched in between. It {{was a brilliant}} idea for making any fabric weatherproof, and the very first macintosh coats were made at the family's dyestuffs factory, Charles Macintosh and Co of Glasgow.|$|R
50|$|The poncho {{was first}} used {{on a regular basis}} in the 1850s for {{irregular}} U.S. military forces operating on the U.S. Western Plains. These early military ponchos were made of gutta percha muslin, a latex-coated, <b>waterproof</b> <b>cloth.</b> Ponchos made of gutta-percha or India rubber coated cloth were officially adopted during the American Civil War, both as rain clothing and as a ground sheet for sleeping. While originally intended for cavalry forces, they were widely used by infantry as well; General Sherman's Union troops, lightly equipped and living off procurement demand from the local populace, wore ponchos during wet weather encountered during the march through Confederate Georgia to the sea.|$|E

50|$|Similar gaiters {{to those}} {{described}} above find multiple uses on most vehicles. They are used {{at both ends}} of driveshafts, protecting constant-velocity joints from the ingress of dirt, and retaining the grease. They also prevent the ingress of dirt where one component slides within another, for example, on suspension struts or the ends of steering racks. Finally, they are also usually used to perform the same function on ball joints, which appear on suspension wishbones and steering tie rod ends. The gear stick gaiter is to resist dirt entering the ball joint {{at the bottom of the}} stick and to not have oil or grease from the joint exposed to passengers. They are commonly leather, faux leather, rubber or a <b>waterproof</b> <b>cloth.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1946, a Westport {{housewife}} named Marion Donovan, {{invented the}} [...] "Boater", a <b>waterproof</b> covering for <b>cloth</b> diapers.

50|$|Discontinued {{after the}} Civil War, the U.S. Army again issued ponchos of {{waterproof}} rubberized canvas to its forces during the Spanish-American War of 1898. Two years later, both the Army and the Marines {{were forced to}} issue <b>waterproof</b> rubberized <b>cloth</b> ponchos with high neck collars during the Philippine-American War in 1900. With the entry of the United States into World War I, both doughboys and Marines in France wore the poncho; it was preferred over the raincoat {{for its ability to}} keep both the wearer and his pack dry, as well as serving as a roof for a makeshift shelter.|$|R
500|$|Latex is {{a sticky}} {{defensive}} secretion that protects plants against herbivores. Many trees produce it when injured {{but the main}} source of the latex used to make natural rubber is the Pará rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Originally used to create bouncy balls and for the <b>waterproofing</b> of <b>cloth,</b> natural rubber is now mainly used in tyres for which synthetic materials have proved less durable. The latex exuded by the balatá tree (Manilkara bidentata) is used to make golf balls and is similar to gutta-percha, made from the latex of the [...] "getah perca" [...] tree Palaquium. This is also used as an insulator, particularly of undersea cables, and in dentistry, walking sticks and gun butts. It has now largely been replaced by synthetic materials.|$|R

40|$|This study {{selected}} three model designs {{used for}} air injection type welding clothes designed for insulation purposes and analyzed {{the performance of}} each design. The bending characteristics were analyzed {{in order to identify}} the flexibility of the welded areas; subsequently, the seam breaking strength and water pressure resistance were analyzed to identify the bonding strength. In addition, two types of waterproof fabric, poly-urethane (PU) coated 2 layer and PU laminated 2 layer fabrics, were used for a performance analysis, accord-ing to fabric processing specifications. The circle type showed the highest flexibility in the terms of bending characteristics that influence wearability and were followed by the wave and the straight type. In terms of breaking strength, the straight type showed the highest breaking strength, followed by the wave and the circle type. The water pressure resistance analysis found that the wave type was superior to the straight type in terms of water pressure resistance. The wave type is deemed to be a design type suitable for maximizing per-formance, provided that the issue of stabilization in the welding production process is addressed. Looking at the bending characteristics of waterproof fabric for each specification, the laminating <b>waterproof</b> <b>cloth</b> out-performed the coated <b>waterproof</b> <b>cloth</b> in terms of flexibility. However, in terms of seam breaking strength, the coated <b>waterproof</b> <b>cloth</b> outperformed the laminated cloth. In contrast, the water pressure resistance of the laminated waterproof fabric was found to be higher than the coated waterproof fabric, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} bonding strength of the laminated waterproof fabric is higher than that of the coated waterproof fabric based on the assumption of injecting air...|$|E

25|$|Natural rubber is an {{elastomer}} (an elastic hydrocarbon polymer) {{that originally}} {{was derived from}} latex, a milky colloidal suspension found in specialised vessels in some plants. It is useful directly in this form (indeed, the first appearance of rubber in Europe was <b>cloth</b> <b>waterproofed</b> with unvulcanized latex from Brazil). However, in 1839, Charles Goodyear invented vulcanized rubber; a form of natural rubber heated with sulfur (and a few other chemicals), forming cross-links between polymer chains (vulcanization), improving elasticity and durability.|$|R

50|$|Perilla oil {{made from}} untoasted seeds {{can be used}} for non-culinary purposes, {{including}} in paint, varnish, printing ink and linoleum. As a drying oil similar to tung oil or linseed oil, perilla oil has been used for paints, varnishes, linoleum, printing ink, lacquers, and for protective <b>waterproof</b> coatings on <b>cloth.</b> Perilla oil can also be used for fuel. It is used along with synthetic resins in the production of varnishes. It dries faster than linseed oil and on drying forms a film that is harder and yellows more than that formed by linseed oil. The paint and varnish industry accounts for the largest usage. Perilla oil is also important in the manufacture of printing inks and linoleum, and in more ancient times was a critical component in creating durable earthen floors.|$|R
30|$|Membrane {{electrode}} assembly (MEA) {{consists of three}} main parts: membrane, anode, and cathode. Nafion 117 is selected as a membrane, and the membrane is treated to remove the impurities using hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and DI water as applied in Hasran et al.’s [17] study. The treated membrane is stored in the beaker filled with DI water until it {{is ready to be}} used. Carbon cloth is used as the anode and cathode backing layer. This carbon cloth is treated with 5  wt% of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to make it <b>waterproof.</b> The carbon <b>cloth</b> is immersed into the PTFE solution and dried in the furnace for 30  min at 380  °C. The backing layer is coated with a gas diffusion layer of carbon, where the loading is 2  mg cm− 2. The carbon is mixed with the IPA and Nafion dispersion D 520 (Dupont). The carbon slurry is casted onto the carbon cloth and dried in the oven at 100  °C for 1  h. Then, the electrocatalyst layer is ready to be coated and synthesized by PtRu/TiO 2 -CNF and commercial electrocatalyst PtRu/C, used for the anode part, and Pt/C for cathode part. 2  mg cm− 2 loading of electrocatalyst is added with IPA (1100  μL), DI water (300  μL), and Nafion dispersion (24  mg). The solution is dispersed in the homogenizer for 1  min and casted onto the carbon cloth. The anode and cathode are dried in the oven for 1  h at 100  °C. The anode and cathode are clamped together with membrane in the middle using hot press at the condition of 135  °C and 50  kPa for 3  min. The MEA is ready to be used in single-cell performance testing.|$|R
