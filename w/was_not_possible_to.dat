5|$|Burial 6 was a cist located {{under the}} first chamber of the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). It had been heavily looted, to an extent that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} if the scattered human remains of at least four people belonged to one burial or several. The bones belonged to two children and two young adult females and fragments of ceramic offerings were also identified.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} second lift arrived, the first supply drop was made onto LZ 'L'. Although most {{supplies}} arrived, {{only a small amount}} could be collected as the area was not under full British control. The poor radio communication meant that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> alert the RAF and unsecured drop zones would be a major problem in the days to come.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} possibly detected {{signals from}} Venera 1, a Russian satellite {{en route to}} Venus, in 19–20 May 1961. However, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> confirm {{the origin of the}} signals. A few years later, in December 1962, the telescope tracked and received data from Mariner 2. On 18 October 1967, the telescope received signals from, and tracked, Venera 4, a Russian probe to Venus.|$|E

5|$|A Free Ride {{was first}} shown to its target {{audience}} in 1915. At that time, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> screen stag films in public theaters {{due to the}} Victorian moral views of contemporary society. Like other pornographic films of that era, A Free Ride was released and circulated underground to avoid censorship. It was likely shown in brothels, gentlemen's clubs, illegal gatherings of men in public places, stag parties, and other all-male venues: the film was kept hidden from society at large and the government.|$|E
5|$|A {{declaration}} is a pronouncement {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. Before 1 May 2011, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> apply for prerogative orders and declarations in {{the same set of}} legal proceedings. Following that date, changes to Order 53 of the Rules of Court permitted an application for a declaration to be made together with an application for one or more prerogative orders. However, the application for a declaration cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the prerogative orders to be applied for.|$|E
5|$|Because it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> upgrade Gardner Hall, a new modern block, Orchard Hall, {{was built}} to replace it. Gardner became an {{assessment}} centre for prospective students. In September 2009 Gardner was made available as a venue for hire for functions such as weddings. In addition to the halls of residence, the college also owns several houses {{both on and off}} campus which enable students to gain a greater level of independent living. There is a restaurant which provides meals, or students can choose to be self-catering. All accommodation has kitchen facilities.|$|E

5|$|Eight Chinook HC Mk3s {{were ordered}} in 1995 as {{dedicated}} special forces helicopters, which {{were intended to}} be low-cost variants of the US Army's MH-47E. The Mk3s include improved range, night vision sensors and navigation capability. The eight aircraft were to cost £259million and the forecast in-service date was November 1998. Although delivered in 2001, the Mk3 could not receive airworthiness certificates as it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> certify the avionics software.|$|E
5|$|Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California {{produced}} 28 μg {{of plutonium}} in the 60-inch cyclotron there in May 1941, {{and found that}} it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time plutonium-239 had been produced in minute quantities using cyclotrons, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> produce large quantities that way. Compton discussed with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber how the plutonium produced in a reactor might be separated from uranium.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Dr. Joe McInnis and Woodman {{organised}} {{an attempt}} to identify the priority targets from the year before. A chartered aircraft landed on the ice at three of the locations, a hole was drilled through the ice, and a small sector-scan sonar was used to image the sea bottom. Unfortunately, due to ice conditions and uncertain navigation, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> exactly confirm {{the locations of the}} holes, and nothing was found although hitherto-unknown depths were found at the locations that were consistent with Inuit testimony of the wreck.|$|E

Nevertheless, the high response rate from almost all directorates indicated that no one group of clinicians was excluded.|$|R
50|$|This {{constancy}} of {{the speed}} of light means that, counter to intuition, speeds of material objects and light <b>are</b> <b>not</b> additive. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> make the speed of light appear greater by approaching at speed towards the source of said light, and likewise, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> make the speed of light appear any less by receding from the source.|$|R
5|$|Most {{schools were}} {{residential}} whereby {{both teachers and}} students resided as a rule. The teachers appointed were jurists, theologians, and traditionalists who received their salary from endowments to the institutions they taught in. Each student was offered a lodging where he would resort, a teacher to instruct him in whatever art he requested, and regular grants to cover all his needs. Madrasas were considered prestigious institutions in society. Under the Ayyubids, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> obtain {{a job in the}} government without receiving an education from a madrasa.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 2010, {{tourists}} found a jawbone on an Aruban beach {{near the}} Phoenix Hotel and Bubali Swamp. Preliminary examination by a forensic {{expert on the}} island determined that the bone was from a young woman. A part of the bone was sent to The Hague for testing by the Netherlands Forensic Institute. On November 23, 2010, Aruba Solicitor-General Taco Stein announced that—based on dental records—the jawbone was not from Holloway, and it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> determine whether it {{had come from a}} man or woman.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulty}} with Richards' transformation {{from the point}} of view of building practical filters was that the resulting distributed element design invariably included series connected elements. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> implement in planar technologies and was often inconvenient in other technologies. This problem was solved by K. Kuroda who used impedance transformers to eliminate the series elements. He published a set of transformations known as Kuroda's identities in 1955, but his work was written in Japanese and it was several years before his ideas were incorporated into the English-language literature.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage meant it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} the exact source of ignition, but possibilities include an emergency generator and the depot's fire pump system. The investigators {{did not believe that}} it was caused either by the driver of a fuel tanker, as had been speculated, or by anyone using a mobile phone. It was felt unlikely that the explosion had a widespread effect on air quality at ground level.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} {{liberate}} Talcahuano {{was followed by}} naval reinforcements from the North. The viceroy of Peru sent Mariano Osorio {{in an attempt to}} reconquer Chile. The royalists would then advance by land to the northern Chile. San Martín thought that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> defend Concepción, so he ordered O'Higgins to leave the city. 50,000 Chileans took cattle and grain and moved north, burning everything else, so that they did not leave supplies for the royalists. As he had done with the Tucumán Congress, San Martín urged a declaration of independence, to legitimize the government and the military actions. The Chilean Declaration of Independence was issued on 18 February 1818, one year after the battle of Chacabuco.|$|E
5|$|The multi-coloured {{platform}} tiles on the Northern line were reconstructed in the 1920s {{in conjunction}} with an extension to Morden station. The tiles were carefully replicated in 2006 to replace the originals, which were in poor condition. The original C tiles dating from 1890 remain on the tunnel roofs of the Northern line platforms, albeit now covered over by the new cable-management system. The station was refurbished in 2007. The original maroon and cream tiling on the Bakerloo line platforms has been covered over. Because of {{the arrangement of the}} lighting, cabling and public address loudspeakers, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> arrange the new roundels at alternate ‘low’ and ‘high’ positions, all being at the lower level.|$|E

5|$|The {{underwater}} {{search was}} beset by technical problems and eventually abandoned. Diagrams and notes {{included in the}} declassified documents make clear it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> search the entire area where crash debris had spread. Four bomb reservoirs, one nearly intact secondary, and parts equaling two secondaries were recovered on the sea ice; parts equaling one secondary were not accounted for. The search also revealed a weapon cable fairing, polar cap, and a one-foot by three-foot section of a warhead's ballistic case.|$|E
5|$|These four {{created and}} tested all the {{elements}} of the Thin Man design between April 1943 and August 1944. Parsons, who had developed the proximity fuze for the Navy, ran the division, and handled liaison with other agencies. As the head of the E-6 Projectile, Target, and Source Group, Critchfield calculated critical masses, and instituted a system of live testing with scale models using 20 mm cannon and 3-inch guns. While full-scale Thin Man tubes took months to produce, these were readily and easily obtained. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> conduct tests with plutonium, as it was not yet available. Indeed, the actual physical characteristics of the metal were little more than educated guesses at this time.|$|E
5|$|AFIS {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to call up}} the aircraft. It {{received a call from}} a resident close to Torghatten which said they had heard aircraft noise followed by a crash. Brønnøysund Fire Department and an ambulance helicopter with a doctor was dispatched to Torghatten. The rescue work was made difficult by low clouds, small fires and explosions. The terrain was difficult and the lack of daylight made assisting the situation difficult. A helicopter with medical personnel and the airport direct arrived at 21:25, while a meeting place for the next of kin was established at the airport. At 23:30 the police stated that there was no hope of finding survivors and the scene changed from a search to an investigation scene. Due to the fog it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> verify that all people had been killed until the next day. Seventy-five soldiers from the Home Guard participated in the salvage.|$|E
