2500|$|As Watson {{was quoted}} in the Sault Star on January 31, 1979, “They deserve a chance to live life as {{normally}} as you or I and we can help them do it. We can tear down some of those needless barriers that the handicapped face everyday. We can give thanks that our kids and families aren’t afflicted and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> and sincerely work hard to make the 1979 Snowarama the most successful yet.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On Monday 8 January, Pye Records {{issued a}} 45 rpm single {{of the song}} [...] "I'm Backing Britain" [...] {{supporting}} the campaign. Written by Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent, and sung by Bruce Forsyth, the chorus included [...] "The feeling is growing, so let's keep it going, the good times are blowing our way". All involved in making the single took cuts in their fees or royalties so that the single sold for 5 shillings instead of the going rate of 7s d. Forsyth happily endorsed the campaign: [...] "The country has always done its best when it is up against the wall. If everyone realises what we are up against <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of trouble easily." [...] However, the song {{did not make the}} charts; it sold only 7319 copies.|$|E

2500|$|All of {{the movie}} themes and mini-games were {{conceived}} by the creative-design team, which they decided the movie themes would have an old B-movie feel. Trowers notes {{the making of the}} mini-games to be [...] "quite an organic process": [...] "Sometimes we'd have a movie and we'd say OK, we want the player to do this in the scene, which is the action we want, so try to think of a game idea for this. But other times we'd be thinking, [...] "Oh, you know what, we got this great idea for a game and these are the essential actions <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of it, {{how are we going to}} use it in movies?" [...] So it was really a three-way process, trying to figure out what we could get people to do, what would be fun, how it would fit in the movie—it wasn't just one process of doing it, it had to go both ways." [...] There had also been a few more movie ideas, but they were left out of the game.|$|E
2500|$|According to Labouchère, Dr Sturman {{explained}} that his M.A. was an honorary {{degree from the}} University of Washington, {{and that he was}} a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Even if this were true, it gives no evidence of a doctorate. According to Sturman, the Society had been established in 1882 with three other members: Goold, a Miss Button who had since died, and Rev. Irvine Coates. Sturman said that in 1892 the Society consisted of [...] "1,500 men and women interested in learning and education" [...] but that they were reluctant to continue to pay their guineas for membership, and that he [...] "got as many as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of them." [...] From the Society's income, Sturman in his capacity as Secretary would officially receive £300 per annum plus the Society's rent for his Holland Road establishment, and his wife would receive £50 as Lady Secretary. Goold officially gave his services free. However Sturman was not able to say that he did not take all the income for his family and share some of it with Goold. He [...] "lived on the Society and was the Society." [...] The majority of the Society's income came from school examinations; this consisted of mailing out exam papers and not examining candidates. Sturman sold diplomas and [...] "shared the proceeds with Goold [...] [...] [...] the examinations were a farce." [...] Labouchère said, ...|$|E

2500|$|... "A lot {{of people}} hear about Biscayne National Park because of Stiltsville. It can be a {{wonderful}} educational tool if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> people <b>out</b> there so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> talk about the local history and marine environment." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The Frenchman has gone, father; and so noiselessly that I {{could hardly}} hear her. If <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> as quietly {{there is little}} fear of our being noticed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, well, it's {{seven years}} ago. You {{would have had}} to send it to the wash anyhow by this time. But don't let us brood on the past. Let us put our heads {{together}} and think how <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> you <b>out</b> of this terrible situation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Forester. [...] "We {{ought to}} do the best <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> but not to be {{concerned}}. To be concerned is to be anxious and unhappy. This does no good. Being concerned would never help us find our way out of the woods." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're welcome {{always to}} my news. This fellow {{is a perfect}} savage, as strong as a cart-horse and as fierce as the devil.

6000|$|... "Just the same," [...] {{answered}} the girl, [...] "we ought to explore it, {{and see where}} it goes, 'cause it's the only poss'ble way <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of this place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You’re {{taking it}} for granted that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of debt. If such a thing were possible, we’d haul her up and strip her for the winter with the first big tides.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{because it}} isn't {{so far in}} the swamp but that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> in a short time if {{anything}} happens, and a glimpse of that city would repay a fellow for considerable trouble." ...|$|E

[...] "I'd take the car--{{want you to see}} how swell she runs since I put in a new piston. But we'll take a team, so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> right <b>out</b> into the fields.

He supports grass fed beef and vehemently opposes industrial livestock production. [...] “The number one public enemy is the cow. But the number one tool that can save mankind is the cow.

"If {{they find}} us here {{together}} it'll merely {{mean that the}} two of us will get it, for I'll stick with you, Billy, and we can't fight off a whole troop of cavalry out here in the open.

6000|$|Let us now trace {{distinctly}} {{the connection}} between these two points. This is hydrogen--a body classed among those things which in Chemistry we call elements, because <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> nothing else <b>out</b> of them. A candle is not an elementary body, because <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> carbon <b>out</b> of it; <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> this hydrogen <b>out</b> of it, or at least {{out of the water}} which it supplies. And this gas has been so named hydrogen, because it is that element which, in association with another, generates water. [Footnote: [greek: hudos], [...] "water," [...] and [greek: gennao], [...] "I generate."] Mr. Anderson having now been able to get two or three jars of gas, we shall have a few experiments to make, and I want to shew you the best way of making these experiments. I am not afraid to shew you, for I wish you to make experiments, if you will only make them with care and attention, and the assent of those around you. As we advance in Chemistry, we are obliged to deal with substances which are rather injurious, if in their wrong places--the acids, and heat, and combustible things we use, might do harm if carelessly employed. If you want to make hydrogen, you can make it easily from bits of zinc, and sulphuric or muriatic acid. Here is what in former times was called the [...] "philosopher's candle." [...] It is a little phial with a cork, and a tube or pipe passing through it.|$|R
