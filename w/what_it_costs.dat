25|$|Jerome's account, {{including}} his estimated speed of only , was corroborated by two further {{letters to the}} Times, from E. Riggs and Clara Claritas commander, Captain Alex Smith. In his response, also published in the Times, Dickerson did not deny the abysmal performance of his engine adaptation, confining his comments instead to a denial of the charge that he had lied in his previous letter. The spectacular failure of the engine {{was not lost on}} Dickerson's enemies in the Navy Department, some of whom quickly published a satirical piece on him entitled Uncle Samuel's Whistle And <b>What</b> <b>It</b> <b>Costs.</b> The piece was later reproduced in Frank M. Bennett's book The Steam Navy of the United States.|$|E
500|$|A 2009 Carnegie Mellon University {{study found}} that a PHEV-40 will be less cost {{effective}} than a HEV or a PHEV-7 {{in all of the}} scenarios considered, due to the cost and weight of the battery. Jon Lauckner, a Vice President at General Motors, responded that the study did not consider the inconvenience of a [...] electric range and that the study's cost estimate of [...] per [...] for the Volt's battery pack was [...] "many hundreds of dollars per kilowatt hour higher" [...] than <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> to make today." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Marx, capitalists take {{advantage}} of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce. Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices. Marx called the difference [...] "surplus value" [...] and argued that this surplus value had its source in surplus labour, the difference between <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> to keep workers alive and what they can produce. Marx's dual view of capitalism can be seen in his description of the capitalists: he refers to them as vampires sucking worker's blood, {{but at the same time}} he notes that drawing profit is [...] "by no means an injustice" [...] and that capitalists simply cannot go against the system. The true problem lies with the [...] "cancerous cell" [...] of capital, understood not as property or equipment, but the relations between workers and owners—the economic system in general.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout its history, the Mekorot {{has been}} financially stable {{according}} to information published on its website. In 2006, Mekorot's turnover was over $700 million, shareholders' equity was $500 million and total assets were {{in excess of}} $2.8 billion. In 2006, Mekorot invested over $240 million in developing water facilities, including a new central filtration plant, compared with $180 million in investments in 2005. For {{a number of years}} Mekorot's fundraising instruments (primarily, bond offerings) have been awarded the highest AAA rating by the [...] credit rating agency based on the following factors: Because tariffs established by the government are low and do not cover Mekorot's operating costs, the company receives compensation for the difference between <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> to produce a unit of water and what it is allowed to charge. The level of subsidies is fixed in multi-annual agreements, the first one having covered the period 1993–98, the second one 1998–2006 and the third one for a much shorter period, 2007–08.|$|E

O! saith the soul, if a few sins are so terrible, and lay the soul under such wrath and torment, what did Christ undergo, who bare the sins of thousands and thousands, and all at once? ...|$|R
2500|$|The cost of {{the balloon}} and the {{arrangements}} under which it was funded also attracted criticism. The executive director of culture for the ACT Chief Minister’s directorate informed the media on 9 May that the balloon and its supporting website cost about $170,000. Documents released the next day showed that the total cost {{to the government of}} commissioning and operating The Skywhale over its lifespan will be $300,000, and the philanthropic Aranday Foundation will provide a further $50,000. Moreover, the balloon will remain the property of the Melbourne-based company Global Ballooning and only one flight was scheduled for Canberra at the time. In response, Jeremy Hanson stated that [...] "this $300,000 extravagance again shows out of touch the ACT Government is with Canberrans' priorities". Katy Gallagher has stated that the Government considered retaining ownership of the balloon during its development, but decided against this option as it would have also involved funding all of The Skywhales operating costs. Robyn Archer defended the project, arguing that the balloon's cost was relatively low, and represented [...] "a bargain for public art". Piccinini has also said that [...] "it's an aeronautical machine. People's lives depend on it. It has to function properly and that's <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>costs,</b> to make a balloon". While Global Ballooning owns The Skywhale, Piccinini retains the intellectual property to the balloon and the company does not expect to make much money from displaying and operating it. The director of Global Ballooning believes that The Skywhale will become self funding when international galleries begin to exhibit it.|$|E

I suppose he made up his mind to go, but I knew <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>cost</b> him by <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>cost</b> me when I heard of it. I had been through one war before.
