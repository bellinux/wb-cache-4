5|$|More than 800,000 Varkaris {{travel to}} Pandharpur for the yatra on Shayani Ekadashi, the 11th {{day of the}} <b>waxing</b> moon in the lunar month of Ashadha. Both Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodhini Ekadashi (in the <b>waxing</b> half of Kartik), are {{associated}} with the mythology of Vishnu. Hindus believe that Vishnu falls asleep in Ksheersagar (a cosmic ocean of milk), while lying on the back of Shesha-nāga (the cosmic serpent). His sleep begins on Shayani Ekadashi (literally the 'sleeping 11th') and he finally awakens from his slumber, four months later, on Prabodhini Ekadashi. The celebrations in Ashadha and Kartik continue until the full-moon in those months, concluding with torchlight processions. Inscriptions dating to the 11thcentury mention the Ekadashi pilgrimages to Pandharpur. On Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodini Ekadashi, the chief minister or a minister of Maharashtra state performs ritual components of worship on behalf of the Government of Maharashtra. This form of worship is known as sarkari-mahapuja.|$|E

5|$|In Vedic literature, Mitra and Varuna {{are portrayed}} as icons of affection and {{intimate}} friendship between males (the Sanskrit word mitra means “friend” or “companion”). They are depicted riding a shark or crocodile together while bearing tridents, ropes, conch shells and water pots. Sometimes they are portrayed seated side-by-side on a golden chariot drawn by seven swans. Ancient Brahmana texts furthermore associate Mitra and Varuna with the two lunar phases and same-sex relations: “Mitra and Varuna, on the other hand, are the two half-moons: the <b>waxing</b> one is Varuna and the waning one is Mitra. During the new-moon night these two meet {{and when they are}} thus together they are pleased with a cake offering. Verily, all are pleased and all is obtained by any person knowing this. On that same night, Mitra implants his seed in Varuna and when the moon later wanes, that waning is produced from his seed.” (Shatapatha Brahmana 2.4.4.19) Varuna is similarly said to implant his seed in Mitra on the full-moon night for the purpose of securing its future <b>waxing.</b> In Hinduism, the new- and full-moon nights are discouraged times for procreation and consequently often associated with citrarata or unusual types of intercourse.|$|E

5|$|A {{mesoscale}} convective complex, {{or large}} circular area of thunderstorms, {{developed in the}} Ethiopian Highlands of Africa on July28. The complex moved west-southwestward through the continent, <b>waxing</b> and waning until persisting along a tropical wave on August2. The next day, the wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from Guinea. Once over the open Atlantic Ocean, the wave quickly developed and became Tropical Depression Three later that day. The depression moved to the west-northwest and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alberto early on August 4. Alberto continued to strengthen, but moved to cooler waters late on August 5 and weakened briefly. However, the storm strengthened again early on August 6, and it was upgraded to hurricane status as an eye became visible. The upgrade was accompanied with a brief westward turn.

From there they travelled by boat toward the town of Kanchanaburi. Tabinshwehti travelled in great state with a massive retinue of elephants and servants. Many of these elephants carried muskets and bronze cannon; these were kept close to the king. Royal elephants were rafted across rivers, while the ordinary war elephants marched upstream to a ford. The Burmese king was accompanied by his crown prince Bayinnaung, Bayinnaung's thirteen-year-old son Nanda, and many richly attired lords. Hundreds of workmen marched ahead of the king's retinue, to pitch a richly decorated wooden camp, painted and gilded for the King's use, only to pack it up and pitch it at a new location every day.|$|E

5|$|The {{book had}} {{chapters}} on memory, imitation and suggestion, perceptual illusions, and esthetics. In these he refuted {{the idea that}} experience was just the external environment acting on and molding a mind working as a passive recipient. Stratton saw the sensation of time as being multidimensional, in analogy with perception of space. That we could simultaneously hear separately, without synthesizing, multiple mixed tones meant our experiences did not necessarily come in single file temporally. To Stratton this meant time had multiple dimensions, since simultaneous events could not be distinguished on the one past-present-future dimension of time alone. He did not address how the other dimensions could be in temporal-space if the events were indistinguishable temporally to begin with. He also analyzed poetic measure as mathematically connected to the <b>waxing</b> and waning span of attention, tying the arts to psychology. This last was rebutted by Charles Samuel Myers, writing in Nature, who saw poetry and its rhythm as too complex a subject to be reduced to the arithmetic of attention spans.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} Vithoba temples in Maharashtra, {{and some in}} Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. However, the main centre of worship is Vithoba's temple in Pandharpur. The temple's date of {{establishment}} is disputed, though {{it is clear that}} it was standing at the time of Dnyaneshwar in the 13thcentury. Along with Vithoba and his consorts—Rukmini, Satyabhama and Radha—other Vaishnava deities are worshipped. These include: Venkateshwara, a form of Vishnu; Mahalakshmi, a form of Vishnu's consort Lakshmi; Garuda and Hanuman (see previous section). Shaiva deities are also worshipped, such as: Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of wisdom and beginnings; Khandoba, a form of Shiva; and Annapurna, a form of Shiva's consort Parvati. The samadhis (memorials) of saints like Namdev, Chokhamela and Janabai, and of devotees such as Pundalik and Kanhopatra, are in and around the temple. Other significant temples in Maharashtra are located: at Dehu, the birthplace of Tukaram, which attracts visitors at all ekadashis of the year; at Kole (Satara district), in memory of Ghadge Bova, which has a fair on the fifth day of the bright fortnight (<b>waxing</b> moon) in Magha month; at Kolhapur and Rajapur, which host fairs on Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodini Ekadashi; Madhe— a refuge of the Pandharpur image when it was moved to protect from Muslim invaders and finally at the Birla Mandir in Shahad.|$|E
5|$|The astronomical {{phenomena}} {{of the solar}} eclipse and lunar eclipse had been observed in the 4th century BC by astronomers Gan De and Shi Shen; the latter gave instructions on predicting the eclipses based on the relative position of the Moon to the Sun. The philosopher Wang Chong argued against the 'radiating influence' theory of Jing Fang's writing in the 1st century BC and that of Zhang Heng (78–139); the latter two correctly hypothesized that {{the brightness of the}} Moon was merely light reflected from the Sun. Jing Fang had written in the 1st century BC of how it was long accepted in China that the Sun and Moon were spherical in shape ('like a crossbow bullet'), not flat. Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the 'flat earth' theory for celestial bodies. However, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century. When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the Sun and Moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained that celestial bodies were spherical because of knowledge of <b>waxing</b> and waning of the Moon. Much like what Zhang Heng had said, Shen Kuo likened the Moon to a ball of silver, which does not produce light, but simply reflects light if provided from another source (the Sun). He explained that when the Sun's light is slanting, the Moon appears full. He then explained if one were to cover any sort of sphere with white powder, and then viewed from the side it would appear to be a crescent, hence he reasoned that celestial bodies were spherical. He also wrote that, although the Sun and Moon were in conjunction and opposition with each other once a month, this did not mean the Sun would be eclipsed every time their paths met, because of the small obliquity of their orbital paths.|$|E

40|$|A {{large part}} of worlds {{remaining}} oil and gas resources is found in harsh environments such as deep water and arctic conditions. The development of such oil and gas fields requires advanced process and transport solutions. <b>Wax</b> is precipitated out of solution as reservoir fluid cools down during transport. <b>Wax</b> precipitation may cause operational problems when unprocessed well streams are transported in undersea pipelines. The goal of this work is to investigate modelling concept for controlled <b>wax</b> deposition and controlled <b>wax</b> loosening that is applicable to subsea flowlines in {{oil and gas production}} systems. An approach to <b>wax</b> control using the annulus pipe in pipe flow concept is modelled and also described. <b>Wax</b> thermodynamic and deposition models is reviewed and evaluated. The review is aimed to provide accurate prediction analysis of <b>wax</b> precipitation and to serve as a reliable knowledge input into <b>wax</b> deposition modelling in oil and gas flow systems. The cold flow concept for <b>wax</b> deposition solution is developed using an annulus pipe in pipe configuration for the cooling of oil below the <b>wax</b> appearance temperature. A <b>wax</b> deposition zone is created, an effect of a large temperature gradient, which is the driving force between cooling water and the flowing oil in the annulus cooling section of the pipeline. Co-current and counter current oil cooling cases is tested. The counter current annulus-cooling case is validated to adequately knock out potential <b>wax</b> from the oil in the <b>wax</b> deposition zone. The annulus cooling approach is considered to provide an efficient and economic <b>wax</b> control strategy for the mechanical removal of <b>wax</b> in a <b>wax</b> control zone when pigging of <b>wax</b> is to be employed in a flowline eliminating excessively long pigging routes and high cost of pigging operation in typical subsea pipelines. A wax-loosening model is further developed to determine potential loosening and potential transport tendencies of stable <b>wax</b> solids liberated from the wall flowline downstream the annulus. Experimental results from the Porsgrunn flow loop of Statoil AS reveals that stable <b>wax</b> solid is released from <b>wax</b> deposits on pipeline walls when the inner wall is heated {{for a short period of}} time such that released stable <b>wax</b> is transported in the cool stream with no or low tendency of re-deposition downstream the flowline. Deposited <b>wax</b> in the <b>wax</b> deposition zone is liberated using hot water sent through the annulus. Model results show re-deposition downstream the flowline. Ability of this <b>wax</b> deposition module to predict <b>wax</b> loosening is criticised. OLGA shows good representation of <b>wax</b> deposition growth in the annulus but incapable to represent expected <b>wax</b> liberation in the flowline at temperatures higher than the <b>wax</b> appearance temperature but below the dissolution temperature. A cold flow <b>wax</b> liberation model using active fluid forces with minimum wall heating for effective stripping of <b>wax</b> from the <b>wax</b> deposition zone is proposed. </p...|$|R
