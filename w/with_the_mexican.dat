5|$|Following a coup in the Mexican government, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna became {{president}} and revoked many freedoms previously {{enjoyed by the}} Texans further deteriorating the government's relations with the region's settlers. Texas declared its independence and revolted in 1835. Following a number of battles <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> army, the Texas army, {{under the leadership of}} General Sam Houston, finally defeated Santa Anna in the Battle of San Jacinto, near modern Pasadena.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Lane {{returned}} to San Francisco {{to open the}} Panama-Pacific International Exposition. The President was supposed to open the fair, {{but was unable to}} attend, and sent the Interior Secretary in his place. In 1916, Wilson appointed Lane to lead the American delegation and meet <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> commissioners at Atlantic City, New Jersey about the unstable military situation in Mexico. These negotiations led to the withdrawal of United States troops from Mexico.|$|E
5|$|A fierce {{defense was}} {{launched}} {{from within the}} walls, even as Bowie and Travis made unsuccessful attempts to negotiate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> army. Travis repeatedly dispatched couriers with pleas for reinforcements. Although Santa Anna refused to consider a proposed conditional surrender, he extended an offer of amnesty for all Tejanos inside the fortress to walk away unharmed. Most Tejanos evacuated from the fortress about February 25, either {{as part of the}} amnesty, or as a part of Juan Seguín's company of courier scouts on their last run.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> raised <b>the</b> {{white flag}} a ceasefire began, and Lieutenant Maus {{approached}} <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> line <b>with</b> Tom Horn. <b>The</b> two talked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> {{for a while}} and concluded that <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> were after scalps for the high bounty established by <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> government. One scalp of an Apache warrior was worth 200 silver pesos while a woman or a child's scalp was worth 100. Eventually Tom Horn went back to his side of the lines, leaving Lieutenant Maus alone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans.</b> As <b>the</b> lieutenant attempted to leave, <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> demanded that they be given some mules to transport their wounded. Maus agreed, so six mules were given to <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> made a gesture as though they would not let Maus go, so the scouts let out a loud war cry, which frightened <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> into freeing <b>the</b> lieutenant.|$|R

50|$|Cortés then {{received}} reinforcements {{when the}} Panuco River settlement was abandoned, and supply ships arrived from Cuba and Spain. Cortés also built 13 sloops to cross Lake Texcoco. Xicotencatl the Younger, however, sought an alliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans,</b> but was opposed.|$|R
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1843 Sam Houston's Texas {{administration}} had returned to negotiations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> government to consider a rapprochement that would permit Texas self-governance, possibly as a state of Mexico, with Great Britain acting as mediator. Texas officials felt compelled {{by the fact that}} the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation. With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally anti-Texas. Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico's borders, or an independent republic with the provision that Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.|$|E
5|$|Central America gained its {{independence}} along with New Spain. On September 15, 1821, an Act of Independence {{was signed in}} Guatemala City which declared Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) independent from Spain. The regional elites supported {{the terms of the}} Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of Central America <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Empire in 1821. Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic of Central America. The new state existed for seventeen years, centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840.|$|E
5|$|Texas is in {{the south}} {{central part of the}} United States of America. Three of its borders are defined by rivers. The Rio Grande forms a natural border <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south. The Red River forms a natural border with Oklahoma and Arkansas to the north. The Sabine River forms a natural border with Louisiana to the east. The Texas Panhandle has an eastern border with Oklahoma at 100° W, a {{northern}} border with Oklahoma at 36°30' N and a western border with New Mexico at 103° W. El Paso lies on the state's western tip at 32° N and the Rio Grande.|$|E
60|$|Xicotencatl replied; but Maxixca, {{losing his}} temper, seized him and, with sudden violence, thrust {{him from the}} chamber. So unusual a step so {{astonished}} the assembly that it silenced all opposition, and <b>the</b> alliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> was unanimously rejected.|$|R
6000|$|... "Down <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans!</b> Hurrah for <b>the</b> {{liberty of}} Texas!" [...] were the cries, and the Texans grew more {{enthusiastic}} than ever.

60|$|The Texans {{formed into}} {{something}} of a square, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wagons in the centre, and the artillery at the corners, and so withering was their fire that <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> were repulsed again and again, and retreated, leaving <b>the</b> prairie crimson <b>with</b> <b>the</b> blood {{of the dead and}} wounded. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> were a number of Indians, but they quickly retreated when their leaders were shot down by the Texan sharpshooters.|$|R
5|$|The Mexican {{government}} {{reported that}} Moreno González was killed during a two-day gunfight <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> federal police {{in his home}} state in December 2010. After the shootout, however, no body was recovered. Rumors thus persisted that Moreno González was still alive and leading the Knights Templar Cartel, the split-off group of La Familia Michoacana. Four years later, on 9 March 2014, his survival was confirmed. Mexican authorities located him again, this time in the town of Tumbiscatío, Michoacán, and attempted to apprehend him. A gunfight ensued resulting in Moreno González's death. Subsequent forensic examination confirmed his identity.|$|E
5|$|A gas-station scene {{within the}} episode {{was meant to}} {{establish}} what the brothers and the series are about—bantering, credit card scams, and classic rock; Kripke feared {{that it would be}} cut because it was character-based and did not further the episode's plot. He also did not want the series to feature ballad music typical of The WB network, and forced the use of classic rock for the soundtrack by writing the music into the script. For the episode's villain, Kripke used the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker, but combined it <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization. The ghost was younger in an earlier version of script, and murdered her parents instead of her children; this was revised to allow for the casting of an older actress.|$|E
5|$|Following the Act of 1819, in 1820 the Court {{began to}} {{distinguish}} Palmer. In United States v. Klintock (1820), the Court distinguished Palmerin {{a case involving}} piracy by a U.S. citizen, claiming to act {{under the authority of}} the Mexican Republic, committed against a Danish ship and citizens, under the fraudulent claim that the Danes were Spanish (Spain being at war <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Republic)on the grounds that the victims in Palmer were not subjects of a nation recognized by the United States. In United States v. Furlong (1820), sometimes referred to as United States v. Pirates, authored by Justice Johnson (a dissenter in Palmer), the Court distinguished Palmer again, primarily on the ground that the pirate vessel had no nationality (it was an American ship prior to being hijacked). United States v. Holmes (1820) distinguished Palmer on the same ground, further holding that the burden was on the defendant to prove that his vessel flew a lawful flag.|$|E
50|$|Corwin was reelected to the House of Representatives in 1860, but {{resigned}} on March 12, 1861 {{after being}} {{appointed by the}} newly inaugurated President Lincoln to become Minister to Mexico, where he served until 1864. Corwin, well regarded among <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> public for {{his opposition to the}} Mexican-American War while in the Senate, helped keep relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> friendly throughout <b>the</b> course of the Civil War, despite Confederate efforts to sway their allegiances.|$|R

5|$|In 2003, Osiel {{was arrested}} in Matamoros {{following}} a shootout <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> military, and was extradited to the United States in 2007. In exchange for a life sentence, Osiel cooperated with the U.S. authorities by supplying information on {{the workings of the}} Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas. When Osiel was arrested, Antonio Ezequiel inherited the Gulf Cartel along with Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, a former policeman in Matamoros. He and other Gulf Cartel leaders were responsible for trafficking multi-ton drug shipments of cocaine and marijuana from Mexico to the United States. Antonio Ezequiel received a federal indictment in 2008 in the District of Columbia for drug trafficking violations. He also directed the flow of narcotics through land, sea, and air from Venezuela and Colombia to Guatemala and the U.S-Mexico border. When Osiel was imprisoned, several high-ranking lieutenants in the Gulf Cartel got together to appoint leaders and their turfs. According to the declarations of Zeta leader Mateo Díaz López (alias Comandante Mateo), Antonio Ezequiel was given the turf of Matamoros, one of the leading smuggling routes for the cartel. But Antonio Ezequiel never had the edge; one of his most trusted men, Ramiro García Hernández (alias El Mati), {{was arrested in}} 2004. Deemed inexperienced, Costilla Sánchez, Lazcano, and high-ranking leader Víctor Manuel Vázquez Mireles (alias El Meme Loco) moved Antonio Ezequiel to command the Gulf Cartel in Cancún. But after failing to meet the Gulf Cartel's demands, he was replaced.|$|E
