25|$|The first Pro Spectacular was {{launched}} in Reno, Nevada on January 4, 1985. While a critical success, the racing was exciting with the ABA put on its usual show of efficiency and the pros generally liked the concept (although the track itself was too tight and ungroomed for their taste) and more than enough pros participated to make it interesting (the ABA dropped its vaunted Direct Transfer System and ran the qualifying motos three times just like the National Bicycle League). In an effort to enhance the awards, $10,000 purses for each race was offered. The winner of the Pro Spectacular series would win a Pontiac Trans Am, just like {{the winner of the}} ABA No. 1 pro plate for the year. The spectator attendance, which was the key, were lackluster. Despite the relatively low admission fee at $5.00, which was about the same as the racer's sign up fee at a local race and the heavy promotion the venues were, if not empty was well below seating capacity. At the first event held at the Lawlor Events Center of the University of Nevada in Reno, Nevada, only about 2,000 spectators were on hand in a facility that could seat 10,000. Many in the crowd were probably there for the standard National that was to be held the next day (those who signed up to race in the National the next day got a discount on the spectator's fee in the Pro Spectacular). Perhaps it was a losing situation from the start. Not enough people knew about the existence of BMX to care and bicycle racing of any type hasn't been big in the United States since the 1920s indoor track racing fad. In Europe by comparison capacity crowds fill venues and racers are front page news in Europe, even previously unknown BMX racers. The same was true for South America. As a comparison the 1983 International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) sanctioned World Championship held in Slagharen, the Netherlands drew an incredible (by US standards) 15 to 20,000 paying spectators and was televised live in Europe. In the US you would be lucky to get a mention in sports section of an American newspaper for any form of cycling outside of yearly reporting of the Tour de France, never mind a BMX race. It seems ironic that BMX was invented in the United States in light of the lackluster attitude of the public at large toward cycling. However, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the fact that BMX wasn't so much derived from cycling but from kids imitating motocross racing then it is much more understandable why BMX was invented here. Still, it was cycling even if it was aping Motocross. In that light, despite the expensive 68 30 second TV advertisements shown on then popular programs like Magnum, P.I., Dynasty and Good Morning America, it was a steep uphill battle to win over the public. The light attendance most likely did not justify the reputed $4000 in television advertising the ABA invested. The most successful of the Spectaculars in terms of non racer attendance was the fifth round held in Phoenix, Arizona on February 8. Albeit {{a far cry from the}} 15 to 20,000 that came to see the IBMXF World Championship in the Netherlands, it did draw 2,600 paying spectators despite Phoenix's first snow fall in seven years. However, considering the cost of renting the arena with the deliberate lack of amateur involvement and hence their entrance fees it was a financial burden the ABA could ill afford. By the time of Land of Lincoln Pro Spectacular on April 28, the last in the series, they had dropped the TV advertisement campaign, as a result only a few dozen of spectators were on hand for the event at the Coliseum State Fair Grounds in Springfield, Illinois. To help defray the cost, the ABA started to run a few selected Amateur open classes to collect entry fees to offset at least partially the losses.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal only {{managed a}} draw against West Bromwich Albion on 20 November 2004; Robert Earnshaw's goal with 11 minutes {{remaining}} of normal time cancelled out Pirès’s opener. Arsenal lost their final match of November, away to Liverpool at Anfield. Vieira finished off a one-touch move to equalise for Arsenal – who were {{behind in the}} first half – but Neil Mellor scored the winning goal of the game, shooting from long range. Football pundit Alan Hansen in his analysis on Match of the Day criticised the temperament of Arsenal’s players and questioned their desire: [...] "When you have success, sometimes it isn't there and you have to dig in with great determination and hard work, and at the moment they are not doing that. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> their two big players, Henry and Vieira, [...] must do better in future."

People remember who was playing and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> programmes from finals you just recall the facts of the game. These boys have produced a game which will be remembered for a long time — and that is thanks to Alavés too." [...] Houllier hit back at critics that had labelled Liverpool as boring before the match: [...] "Maybe we are a boring side — as I seem to keep reading — but I will put up with that. We must have scored 122 of our 123 goals on the counter attack, but all I know is that our total this season is the third highest in Liverpool's history." ...|$|E

[...] Schmid continued, [...] "I thought Evans did a really good job. Sometimes we were stretched in the midfield, but I thought he {{did a very good job}} of stepping up to Pável. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the 90 minutes, it was a rare occasion that he was able to hit a ball behind our defense." [...] Chicago midfielder Logan Pause commented on the game saying, [...] "It’s disappointing. We came here to win. We were under the gun all night.

[...] He knew it had to be [...] "sensitively handled" [...] though, and ultimately it is not about romance, but [...] " [...] {{the fact that you can}} have a wondrous experience, enjoy it and move on". Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan, a talented archer, in battle, and that the romance contributed to her character's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place.|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{designed}} Two-Face's {{appearance in}} the film {{as one of the}} least disturbing, explaining, [...] "When we looked at less extreme versions of it, they were too real and more horrifying. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a film like Pirates of the Caribbean– something like that, there's something about a very fanciful, very detailed visual effect, that I think is more powerful and less repulsive." [...] Framestore created 120 computer-generated shots of Two-Face's scarred visage. Nolan felt using make-up would look unrealistic, as it adds to the face, unlike real burn victims. Framestore acknowledged they rearranged the positions of bones, muscles and joints to make the character look more dramatic. For each shot, three 720-pixel HD cameras were set up at different angles on set to fully capture Aaron Eckhart's performance. Eckhart wore markers on his face and a prosthetic skullcap, which acted as a lighting reference. A few shots of the skullcap were kept in the film. Framestore also integrated shots of Bale and Eckhart into that of the exploding building where Dent is burned. It was difficult simulating fire on Eckhart because it is inherently unrealistic for only half of something to burn.|$|E

500|$|It was {{announced}} that Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan would also be featured on the song, who West had invited to Hawaii. Raekwon initially {{had no interest in}} working with West musically, and originally only went to Hawaii to share some insight with him. According to the rapper, a lot of artists in the music industry refuse to be honest and give genuine advice because they don't want to help their competition, comparing the mentality to a group of crabs in a barrel. One of the reasons for Raekwon's desire to give West advice was because the frontman of the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA, spoke positively of West. RZA stated that West embodied the mentality of the Wu-Tang Clan, and praised his skills as a producer. RZA {{was a part of the}} recording sessions for the album in Hawaii, and contributed to the production of songs [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and [...] "So Appalled". Eventually after being impressed by West himself, Raekwon decided to collaborate with West on several tracks, including [...] "Gorgeous". Raekwon described West as a hard worker, and stated that the [...] "first thing I can tell you about Kanye West is that he's a hard worker. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, you can tell that he still has that whole hip-hop thing in his bones." ...|$|E
500|$|Saw 3D {{was shot}} entirely in RealD 3D using the SI-3D digital camera system; rather than filming on set {{traditionally}} and later transferring the footage to 3D. Before choosing 3D, Burg and others viewed {{a minute of}} the original Saw film rendered in 3D and were pleased, which led to them choosing 3D for the seventh film. [...] The sets and traps were designed {{to take advantage of}} 3D. To continue the fast pace of the previous films, the SI-3D cameras' light weight allowed three-quarters of film to be shot handheld. Saw 3D was Greutert's first time directing a 3D film. He {{said in an interview with}} Popular Mechanics that composing a shot in 3D was tricky compared to 2D; he explained, [...] "If you've got both cameras looking at a subject and there's a very bright sheen on the side of the person's arm that only one camera can see, there's a good chance that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a composite of the two images that sheen will not register in 3D space. It looks like a mistake. These things aren't an issue at all in 2D but in 3D are obsessively problematic". Given the cost of filming in 3D, Greutert said the budget was $17 million, the most expensive of the series. Principal photography began on February 8, 2010, in Toronto, Ontario, and wrapped on April 12, 2010. Filming took place mostly at Toronto's Cinespace Film Studios.|$|E
