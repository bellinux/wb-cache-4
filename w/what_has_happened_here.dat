6000|$|... "Thank God for that," [...] Mrs. Dormay said earnestly, and Ciceley gave {{an exclamation}} of pleasure. [...] "That accounts, then, for <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{expedient}} seems a favourite {{one with}} you," [...] said Jessie. [...] "I suppose no news of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> can have reached him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I refer. You {{know what}} I'm talking about. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> been <b>happening</b> <b>here</b> since I left? The place is {{positively}} stiff with happy endings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And some idle people, perfect {{strangers to}} us, {{are trying to}} trace a {{connexion}} between what happened at our house in Yorkshire and <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> since, <b>here</b> in London?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} glad, sir, {{if you will}} tell us <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been <b>happening</b> <b>here.</b> All {{we know is that}} the fort of Coomassie is surrounded, and that we have come up to relieve it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I hope, Towlinson,' says Miss Tox, who, in her {{instruction}} of the Toodle family, has acquired an admonitorial tone, and {{a habit of}} improving passing occasions, 'that <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here,</b> will be a warning to you, Towlinson.' ...|$|E
6000|$|THE GENERAL. But, my dear Lesbia, you see <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> to-day. [Coming {{a little}} nearer and bending his face towards hers] Now I {{put it to}} you, does it not show you the folly of not marrying? ...|$|E
40|$|Network {{forensics}} is {{a branch}} of digital forensics, which applies to network security. It is used to relate monitoring {{and analysis of the}} computer network traffic, that helps us in collecting information and digital evidence, for the protection of network that can use as firewall and IDS. Firewalls and IDS can’t always prevent and find out the unauthorized access within a network. This paper presents an extensive survey of several forensic frameworks. There is a demand of a system which not only detects the complex attack, but also it should be able to understand <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> <b>Here</b> it talks about the concept of the distributed network forensics. The concept of the Distributed network forensics is based on the distributed techniques, which are useful for providing an integrated platform for the automatic forensic evidence gathering and important data storage, valuable support and an attack attribution graph generation mechanism to depict hacking events...|$|R
6000|$|... "The very person I {{was going}} to send for!" [...] said the Pope of Dimchurch. [...] "Don't excite Mrs. Finch! Don't speak to Mrs. Finch! You shall hear why directly.

60|$|The ex-Rackbird did not {{hesitate}} a moment as to {{what ought to be}} done. That everlastingly condemned meddler, Horn, must never be allowed to put his oar into this business. If he were not content with the gold which he had for himself, he should curse the day that he had tried to keep other people from getting the gold that they wanted for themselves. No matter <b>what</b> <b>had</b> to be done, he must never reach the Dunkery Beacon--he must never know <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to her. <b>Here</b> was a piece of work for the Vittorio to attend to without the loss of a minute.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and {{are just}} as angry. Of course, the news of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> was sent off to them at once, and has brought them back again. I trust that it reached them before they came upon Oswald's party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By my hand, friend Woodcock," [...] {{said the}} page, [...] "though I know {{you for a}} hardy gospeller, that fear neither saint nor devil, yet, if I were you, I would not sing your profane songs in this valley of Glendearg, {{considering}} <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> before our time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I do," [...] she asserted, bitterly. [...] "I {{mean just}} that. So saddle up and pull out. All I ask {{of you is}} to say nothing about <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b> You'd better leave the state. If Wayland should get worse it might go hard with you." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{a letter}} from Francisco de Vargas to the Princess Dowager of Portugal, Regent of Spain, dated 22 September 1556, it is written: [...] "I have {{reported}} to your Highness <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been <b>happening</b> <b>here,</b> and how far the Pope is going in his fury and vain imaginings. His Majesty could not do otherwise than have a care for his reputation and dominions. I am sure your Highness will have had more recent news from the Duke of Alva, who has taken the field with an excellent army and has penetrated so far into the Pope's territory that his cavalry is raiding up to ten miles from Rome, where there is such panic that the population would have run away had not the gates been closed. The Pope has fallen ill with rage, and was struggling with a fever on the 16th of this month. The two Carafa brothers, the Cardinal and Count Montorio, do not agree, and they and Piero Strozzi are not on as good terms {{as they were in}} the past. They would like to discuss peace. The best thing would be for the Pope to die, for he is the poison at the root of all this trouble and more which may occur. His Majesty's intention is only to wrest the knife from this madman's hand and make him return to a sense of his dignity, acting like the protector of the Apostolic See, in whose name, and that of the College of Cardinals, his Majesty has publicly proclaimed that he has seized all he is occupying. The Pope is now sending again to the potentates of Italy for help. I hope he will gain as little thereby as he has done in the past, and that the French will calm down. May God give us peace in the end, as their Majesties desire and deserve!" ...|$|R
30|$|Derrett {{has argued}} that the {{production}} of new, modern and yet supposedly timeless scriptures such as those created by the Śuddha Dharma Maṇḍala should be seen as a response to a unique intellectual climate, one in which Hindu scriptures, to be considered authoritative, both had to be ancient 60 and yet could not call upon established systems of commentary and exegesis to offer a recontextualization (of the ancient wisdom), that is to say, the tradition of reception had been interrupted. Under these conditions, the only way Sir Subramania’s “yearnings for spirituality and for the spiritual regeneration of his country” could be met were through falsification of the documentation (Derrett 1977, 178). 61 Derrett holds out the prospect of a renewal and a restoration of these systems (“The answers are bound to come with time. The pandits of that day will welcome a method of regulating society which will neither have a need for the participation of complacent foreigners, nor fear to build upon the flattened rubble of the latter’s ignorance, disdain, and neglect”; xv), but we, who still work under the conditions of this immense rupture and delegitimation of the tradition, must look for alternative ways to make sense of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> in history. <b>Here</b> we wish to offer a commentary by way of offering a parallel.|$|R
5000|$|Writing after King Philip II of Spain {{had decided}} to declare war against the pope, {{he wrote in a}} letter to the Princess Dowager of Portugal, Regent of Spain, dated 22 September 1556: [...] "I have {{reported}} to your Highness <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been <b>happening</b> <b>here,</b> and how far the Pope is going in his fury and vain imaginings.

6000|$|... "When I have {{an end in}} view, I march {{straight}} to it; I do not vacillate--that is all. But never mind me; here we are near home. Go to town by the first train to-morrow morning and post another letter announcing <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b> Then come back and wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you all about it fully, later on," [...] Jack said, [...] "but it would take me till night to give you the full yarn now. But first you must tell me <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b> You know I have heard nothing, and only know that Sebastopol is not yet taken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's {{lucky you}} left it behind. Best {{go up the}} slope an' tell Donovan <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here,</b> so's he can send men to the old shaft.

40|$|Thank-you for the {{opportunity}} to be with you today in this fascinating panel on the state of health promotion in Brazil, Canada and around the world. It is a great pleasure to be here, and to share my thoughts and reflections with you, not as an expert here to tell you how it ‘should’ be, but as a colleague interested in dialogue around points of mutual concern. I feel we have much to learn from <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been <b>happening</b> <b>here</b> in Brazil, and the work of Paolo Freire and many contemporary colleagues who continue this tradition of critical pedagogy for health (like my colleague and friend here at UNIFOR, Dr. Francisco Cavalcante Jr.). So in this spirit of friendship, dialogue and mutual learning, I will be very frank with you about the lessons learned in Canada, including some of our failures and mistakes which I hope you can successfully avoid. Also, I offer my apologies {{for not being able to}} speak with you in your own language. I wish to thank my friends Nicolas Ayres and Francisco Cavalcante Jr. for their assistance with translation. In addition to a brief overview of the development of health promotion in Canada, I would like to share some reflections on the social, political and economic context in which the field has evolved, both in Canada and internationally. I will address three (3) key tensions I see in the field at the moment (from a Canadian perspective), and reflect on our successes and our failures. I will close with a few thoughts on future prospects and some of the challenges that I see that lie ahead. I would like to emphasize that any brief history of health promotion in Canada, and any assessment of its strengths, contributions and failures is inherently ‘subjective’ and idiosyncratic. Rather than repeat the work of other analysts and commentators (see for example – cite PHAC/HC docs), I offer my observations based on over a decade of involvement in the field (including involvement in the Critical Social Science and Health group at the University of Toronto), and in my capacity as Director of the Masters of Health Science program in health promotion at the University of Toronto. Doubtless, those with different interests, orientations, and practice backgrounds would come to (slightly or substantially) different conclusions...|$|R
5000|$|Three major {{excavation}} works <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> {{through the}} last century: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, the {{surrounding}} regions {{are filled with}} the noise of late wonders that <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here!</b> You didn't hear of them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't ask you, Mr. Barnes," [...] he said, [...] "whether {{you know}} {{anything}} about <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b> You are not bound to say. I hope you don't know, and that {{you will be able to}} prove it. But I must go through the form of arresting you in the King's name for the murder of Colonel Norman Bohun." ...|$|E
6000|$|My lord's eyes {{expressed}} his doubt of divine intervention. He preferred {{to speak for}} himself. [...] "I'll disown the dog. He shall not enter my house again. You shall not be reminded of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b> Gad! You were shrewd to have smoked his motives so!" [...] he cried {{in a burst of}} admiration for her insight. [...] "Gad, child! Shouldst have been a lawyer! A lawyer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But we {{must not}} hurry. In the first place, we must settle all our plans {{carefully}} and prepare our disguises; in the next place, there will be such tremendous excitement when the news of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> is known {{that it would be}} unsafe to travel. I think myself it will be best to wait a little until there is a lull. That is what I want you to think over and decide.|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be {{interesting}} to know <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> to the world. [...] . This green vapor--queer stuff. But I know <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> to me. It's Conversion. I've always known. [...] . But this is being a fool. Talk! I'm going to stop it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then Andor {{came into}} the tap-room. With soft words and insinuating {{promises}} he got me to tell him <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> I didn't want to at first--I mistrusted him because of <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> at the banquet--I knew that he hated me because of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly; well, things <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b> To be brief, I {{mean that}} a lot of silly women have got up a scandal about them--no, scandal is too strong a word--gossip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Worse and worse, Mike! Evidently, the {{governor}} is determined {{to get rid of}} all whose evidence might throw any light on this matter. After <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here,</b> and these summary executions, I feel very uncomfortable as to Colonel Mendez. Will you go to the artillery barracks with a message from me that, as I have my first report to write out, I shall not continue the investigations today? Take Pierre with you again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, if {{you will}} believe me after deceiving you once," [...] Ethel interposed, still very humbly, [...] "I will never {{say that it was}} I who withdrew from you, and that it was not you who refused me. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> fully authorises you. Let the rupture of the {{engagement}} come from you, my lord. Indeed, indeed, I would spare you all the pain I can. I have done you wrong enough already, Lord Farintosh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our men {{fought the}} battle of Talavera when weak with hunger; while the Spaniards, who engaged to supply them with provisions, were feasting. Our men were {{neglected}} and starved in the hospitals, and would have died to a man had not, happily for them, the French arrived, and treated them with the greatest humanity and kindness. Soldiers do not forget this sort of thing. They know that, {{for the last three}} years, the promises of the Spanish authorities have never once been kept, and that they have had to suffer greatly from the want of transport and stores promised. We can, of course, discriminate between the people at large and their authorities; but the soldiers can make no such distinction and, deeply as I deplore <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here,</b> I must own that the soldiers have at least some excuse for their conduct." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, I {{have heard}} steps," [...] said Mrs. Royer, [...] "and wailing--wailing. No wonder {{after all that}} <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b> Oh yes, steps as of the guard being turned out!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What do you mean? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened?</b> Something <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> to you. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> at home? <b>What</b> are {{you going}} to do?' she said sharply. She palpitated with terror. For the first time she felt powerless. Siegmund was beyond her grasp. She was afraid of him. He had shaken away her hold over him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm so glad!" [...] {{said the}} lady. [...] "I didn't know but {{she might be}} at church. What in the world <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here?</b> Is there {{anything}} unusual going on inside?" ...|$|R
