5|$|Robust layout means {{buildings}} more square than elongated, and symmetrical not L-shaped, {{as well as}} no 'soft' first stories (stores {{with large}} windows, buildings on unbraced columns). New Zealand's earthen building guidelines check for enough bracing wall length {{in each of the}} two principal directions, based on <b>wall</b> <b>thickness,</b> story height, bracing wall spacing, and the roof, loft and second story weight above earthen walls.|$|E
50|$|The nozzle mandrel must be {{adjusted}} eccentrically {{to the drawing}} nozzle {{in order to avoid}} uneven <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> Therefore, the resulting tube initially has different <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses,</b> which balance out after the bending.|$|R
30|$|A {{large area}} of CdS {{nanotube}} arrays is fabricated by a facile way of layer-by-layer deposition. The <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses</b> of nanotubes {{are controlled by}} tuning the deposition cycles. The FE properties of CdS nanotube arrays dependence on <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses</b> are investigated and show infusive and regular results. With decreasing the <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses</b> of CdS nanotubes, the value ofEtoandEthdecrease andβ increases. The thinnest walls of CdS nanotubes exhibit the least value ofEtoandEthfor promising candidate materials on field emitters and nanodevices.|$|R

5|$|The blast {{caused by}} a sudden release of the gas {{pressure}} inside a diving cylinder makes them very dangerous if mismanaged. The greatest risk of explosion exists while filling, but cylinders have also been known to burst when overheated. The cause of failure can range from reduced <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> or deep pitting due to internal corrosion, neck thread failure due to incompatible valve threads, or cracking due to fatigue, sustained high stresses, or overheating effects in aluminum.|$|E
5|$|The {{cylinder}} is inspected externally for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations {{and excessive}} wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, corrosion damage, illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and unauthorised additions or modifications. Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination {{to identify any}} damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting <b>wall</b> <b>thickness,</b> or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.|$|E
25|$|Differentiation between {{proximal}} enteritis {{and small}} intestinal obstruction {{is important to}} ensure correct treatment, and can be assisted {{with the help of}} ultrasound. Horses with small intestinal obstruction will usually have an intestinal diameter of -10nbsp&cm with a <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> of 3-5mm. Horses with proximal enteritis usually have an intestinal diameter that is narrower, but <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> is often greater than 6mm, containing a hyperechoic or anechoic fluid, with normal, increased, or decreased peristalsis. However, obstructions that have been present for some time may present with thickened walls and distention of the intestine.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason for}} the {{discrepancy}} for NPS ⅛ to 12 inches is that these NPS values were originally set to give the same inside diameter (ID) based on <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses</b> standard at the time. However, as the set of available <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses</b> evolved, the ID changed and NPS became only indirectly related to ID and OD.|$|R

40|$|This European Standard {{specifies}} {{the requirements}} for the ultrasonic examination of steel castings (with ferritic structure) for highly stressed components and the methods for determining internal discontinuities by the pulse echo technique. This European Standard applies to the ultrasonic examination of steel castings which have usually received a grain refining heat treatment and which have <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses</b> {{up to and including}} 600 mm.

25|$|Intima-media {{thickness}} (IMT), {{also called}} intimal medial thickness, is a {{measurement of the}} thickness of tunica intima and tunica media, the innermost two layers of the wall of an artery. The measurement is usually made by external ultrasound and occasionally by internal, invasive ultrasound catheters; see Intravascular ultrasound. Measurements of the <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> of blood vessels can also be done using other imaging modalities.|$|E
25|$|A scale {{also allows}} bullets and cases to be sorted by weight, which can {{increase}} consistency further. Sorting bullets by weight has obvious benefits, as {{each set of}} matched bullets will perform more consistently. Sorting cases by weight is done to group cases by case <b>wall</b> <b>thickness,</b> and match cases with similar interior volumes. Military cases, for example, tend to be thicker, while cases that have been reloaded numerous times will have thinner walls due to brass flowing forward under firing, and excess case length being later trimmed from the case mouth.|$|E
25|$|The healthy {{epicardial}} {{coronary artery}} {{consists of three}} layers, the intima, media, and adventitia. Atheroma {{and changes in the}} artery wall usually result in small aneurysms (enlargements) just large enough to compensate for the extra <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> with no change in the lumen diameter. However, eventually, typically as a result of rupture of vulnerable plaques and clots within the lumen over the plaque, stenosis (narrowing) of the vessel develops in some areas. Less frequently, the artery enlarges so much that a gross aneurysmal enlargement of the artery results. All three results are often observed, at different locations, within the same individual.|$|E

25|$|The {{enormous}} <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> at basement {{level in}} many bergfrieds usually decreases significantly {{on the inside}} of the tower at the level of the upper floors. On the resulting wall ledges, wooden ceilings were laid that served to partition the various floor levels. The lowest floor and the uppermost floor are often covered by a stone vault. Occasionally, narrow stairways were incorporated into the masonry to allow a single person to climb the tower. More often, however, the floors were connected by wooden stairs or ladders. Some bergfrieds had limited living space, and even small fireplaces may be found in the upper floors. These heated rooms were usually used by the watchmen.|$|E
25|$|A popular {{choice of}} working fluid is ammonia, which has {{superior}} transport properties, easy availability, and low cost. Ammonia, however, is toxic and flammable. Fluorinated carbons such as CFCs and HCFCs are not toxic or flammable, but {{they contribute to}} ozone layer depletion. Hydrocarbons too are good candidates, but they are highly flammable; in addition, this would create competition for use of them directly as fuels. The power plant size is dependent upon the vapor pressure of the working fluid. With increasing vapor pressure, {{the size of the}} turbine and heat exchangers decreases while the <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> of the pipe and heat exchangers increase to endure high pressure especially on the evaporator side.|$|E
25|$|Collagen is {{the major}} {{component}} of the extracellular matrix and has been widely used in nerve regeneration and repair. Due to its smooth microgeometry and permeability, collagen gels are able to allow diffusion of molecules through them. Collagen resorption rates are able {{to be controlled by}} crosslinking collagen with polypoxy compounds. Additionally, collagen type I/III scaffolds have demonstrated good biocompatibility and are able to promote Schwann cell proliferation. However, collagen conduits filled with Schwann cells used to bridge nerve gaps in rats have shown surprisingly unsuccessful nerve regeneration compared to nerve autografts. This is because biocompatibility is not the only factor necessary for successful nerve regeneration; other parameters such as inner diameter, inner microtopography, porosity, <b>wall</b> <b>thickness,</b> and Schwann cell seeding density will need to be examined in future studies in order to improve the results obtained by these collagen I/III gels.|$|E
40|$|Compaction of additively {{manufactured}} Ti 6 Al 4 V components by Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) {{is often}} applied to eliminate porosity, producing fully dense material. In the present work shelled samples produced by Electron Beam Melting with the Arcam process (EBM) were compacted by HIP to produce fully dense samples. Cylindrical samples were studied. The {{walls of the}} cylinders were built with EBM, and the powder from the process was left uncompacted inside the cylinders. Samples with different <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses</b> were produced. The samples were thereafter subjected to a HIP compaction. The critical <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses</b> needed for compaction were evaluated, and the microstructures characterized.

25|$|The {{thickness}} specified for a wall {{is determined}} by such factors as damp proofing considerations, {{whether or not the}} wall has a cavity, load-bearing requirements, expense, and the era during which the architect was or is working. <b>Wall</b> <b>thickness</b> specification has proven considerably various, and while some non-load-bearing brick walls may be as little as half a brick thick, or even less when shiners are laid stretcher bond in partition walls, others brick walls are much thicker. The Monadnock Building in Chicago, for example, is a very tall masonry building, and has load-bearing brick walls nearly two metres thick at the base. The majority of brick walls are however usually between one and three bricks thick. At these more modest wall thicknesses, distinct patterns have emerged allowing for a structurally sound layout of bricks internal to each particular specified thickness of wall.|$|E

Numerical {{results are presented}} for a fluid of Prandtl number 0. 7 in an annulus of radius ratio 0. 5 and dimensionless eccentricity 0. 5. The conjugation effect on the induced flow rate and the total heat absorbed in the annulus is presented for the case of one wall being isothermally heated while the other wall is kept at inlet fluid temperature. The conjugate effects are controlled by solid-fluid conductivity ratio, cylinder <b>walls</b> <b>thickness</b> and dimensionless channel height (i. e. Grashof number). Solid-fluid conductivity ratio is varied over a range that covers practical cases with commonly encountered inner and outer <b>walls</b> <b>thickness.</b> Values of conductivity ratio over which conjugate effect can be neglected have been obtained...|$|R
40|$|To {{assist the}} Saltstone Vault 2 Design Team, an {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effectiveness of alternative concrete <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses</b> in limiting nitrate diffusion away from the planned facility. While the current design calls for 18 -inch concrete <b>walls,</b> alternative <b>thicknesses</b> of 12 -in, 8 -in, and 6 -in were evaluated using a simplified 1 -D numerical model. To serve as a guide for Saltstone Vault 2 conceptual design, the results of this investigation were applied to Saltstone Vault 4 to determine what the hypothetical limits would be for concrete <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses</b> thinner than the planned 18 -inches. This was accomplished by adjusting the Vault 4 Limits, based on the increased nitrate diffusion rates through the thinner concrete walls, such that the 100 -m well limit of 44 mg/L of nitrate as nitrate was not exceeded. The implication of these preliminary results is that as thinner vault walls are implemented there is a larger release of nitrate, thus necessitating optimal vault placement to minimize the number of vaults placed along a single groundwater flow path leading to the discharge zone...|$|R
