5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court.

Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.|$|E

5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, law {{was taught}} in the City of London, {{primarily}} by the clergy. During the 13th century, two events happened that destroyed this form of legal education; firstly, a decree by Henry III of England on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London, and secondly a papal bull was issued in 1254 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the common law, rather than canon law. As a result, the existing system of legal education fell apart. The common lawyers migrated to the hamlet of Holborn, the nearest place to the law courts at Westminster Hall that <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> City.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, {{the three}} Baltic states, had formed the Baltic Entente in 1934.

In Latvian and Estonian opinion, the Polish–Lithuanian dispute over Vilnius <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> scope of the Entente, but they wished for a resolution, considering the conflict detrimental to the stability of the region. Latvia attempted to persuade Estonia to exert mutual pressure on Lithuania for a speedy acceptance of the ultimatum. This reaction from an ally was unexpected.|$|E

5|$|The British {{evacuated}} Philadelphia to New York City before d'Estaing's arrival, {{and their}} North American fleet {{was no longer}} in the river when his fleet arrived at Delaware Bay in early July. D'Estaing decided to sail for New York, but its well-defended harbour presented a daunting challenge to the French fleet. Since the French and their American pilots believed his largest ships were unable to cross the sandbar into New York harbour, their leaders decided to deploy their forces agaynst British-occupied Newport, Rhode Island. While d'Estaing <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> harbour, British Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Clinton and Vice-Admiral Lord Richard Howe dispatched a fleet of transports carrying 2,000 troops to reinforce Newport via Long Island Sound; these reached their destination on 15 July, raising the size of Major General Sir Robert Pigot's garrison to over 6,700 men.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Department of Defense {{responded by}} {{accelerating}} its Rapid Deployment Forces concept but suffered from major problems with airlift and sealift capability.

5|$|Before leaving England in 1189, Richard put the Tower of London in Longchamp's {{hands and}} {{appointed}} him jointly with Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, {{to the office}} of Chief Justiciar, at that time not strictly a judicial office. Instead, the justiciar was the person entrusted with much of the king's authority when the king <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> kingdom, able to act in the king's name. Along with Puiset, the king named Hugh Bardulf, William Briwerre, Geoffrey fitz Peter, and William Marshall as associates in the justiciarship, under Puiset and Longchamp. As Justiciar, Longchamp sent judges throughout the country to visit the shires on judicial visits, even though he had no previous knowledge of the judiciary. Longchamp and Puiset were unable to work together, and so in March 1190 Richard gave authority north of the River Humber to Hugh, and authority south of the river to Longchamp. Historian's opinions are divided whether Richard explicitly made Longchamp superior to Puiset at this time, or if in theory the two were supposed to co-equal in their respective spheres. By June, Longchamp had eased Puiset out of power and the justiciar's office. He also received a commission as a papal legate from Pope Clement III at this time. Supposedly Richard paid 1,500marks (£1,000) to the papacy to secure the legateship for Longchamp.|$|E
5|$|Five {{minutes before}} half-time, Juventus were awarded a free-kick. Boniek, who had beaten three Liverpool players with a run, was brought down outside the Liverpool penalty area by Wark, who {{received}} a yellow card for the foul. The resulting free-kick came to nothing, and at half-time the score was 0–0. Almost immediately after the restart, Liverpool suffered another injury. Paul Walsh stretched to reach a pass from Neal, aggravated a stomach strain {{and was replaced by}} Craig Johnston. Juventus were gaining an ascendancy in the match, and in the 56th minute they were awarded a penalty kick. Boniek again went on a run through the centre of the Liverpool defence and was brought down by Gillespie. Liverpool believed that the foul <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> area, but the Swiss referee, from some 25 yards (22.86 m.) behind the ball, awarded the penalty. Michel Platini scored the subsequent penalty to give Juventus a 1–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 {{the island}} was leased to Colonel Tynte of Halswell House, who {{established}} an inn for sailors. The inn was run by the Harris family, using rum and tobacco bought from ships. They claimed that the island <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> jurisdiction of the excise men until a court case in 1884. After the Harris family, the inn was run by Mr W.L. Davies, who offered fishing, shooting and boating holidays. To make landing on the island easier, a new pier was built close to the inn. In 1835 clergyman John Ashley from Clevedon voluntarily ministered to {{the population of the}} island and the neighbouring Flat Holm. Ashley created the Bristol Channel Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the Bristol Channel. The mission would later become the Mission to Seafarers, which still provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports.|$|E

5|$|In January 1944, Eichelberger was {{informed}} {{that he would be}} in charge of the next operation, a landing at Hansa Bay with the 24th and 41st Infantry Divisions. However, in March this was cancelled in favor of Operation Reckless, a landing by the same force at Hollandia. The operation meant leapfrogging the Japanese defenses at Hansa Bay, but was risky because it <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> range of land-based air cover. Cover was instead provided by aircraft carriers of the United States Pacific Fleet, but this meant that the operation had to adhere to a strict timetable. Hoping to avoid a repeat of Buna, Eichelberger meticulously planned the operation, and implemented a thorough training program that emphasized physical fitness, individual initiative, small unit tactics and amphibious warfare. The operation went well, mainly because surprise was achieved and few Japanese were present in the area. However, poor topographical intelligence led to an inability to clear some beaches due to their being backed by swamps. Supplies piled up on the beaches, with fuel and ammunition being stored together in some instances. On 23 April a single Japanese plane ignited a fuel dump, which caused a fire that resulted in 124 casualties and the loss of 60 per cent of the ammunition stockpile. An appalled Krueger felt that Eichelberger had been let down by his staff, and offered to transfer Byers to an assistant division commander's post, but Eichelberger turned down the offer.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 2009, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia {{issued an}} arrest warrant for Guandique. He was {{returned}} to {{the custody of the}} District of Columbia Department of Corrections on April 20 via the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City. Two days later, Guandique was charged in D.C. with Levy's murder. He was indicted by a grand jury on six counts: kidnapping, first-degree murder committed during a kidnapping, attempted first-degree sexual abuse, first-degree murder committed during a sexual offense, attempted robbery, and first-degree murder committed during a robbery. Guandique pleaded not guilty at his arraignment, where a trial date was initially set for January 27, 2010. His lawyers argued that Guandique's federal prison cell <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> jurisdiction of a court-ordered search. After errors in processing contaminated some of the gathered evidence with DNA from employees of the prosecution, the start date of the trial at the H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse was moved to October 4, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Saratoga {{was ordered}} to depart for home for a refit by 19 May and Somerville wanted to mount one more attack as she was leaving the Indian Ocean. He chose the naval base and oil {{refinery}} at Surabaya, Java (Operation Transom), and {{the distance from the}} newly renamed East Indies Fleet's base at Ceylon required refuelling at Exmouth Gulf on the western coast of Australia before the attack. The necessity to attack from the south, across the full width of Java, meant that the target <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Barracuda's range and 810 and 847 Squadrons were replaced by the 18 Grumman TBF Avengers of 832 and 845 Squadrons for the mission. Early on the morning of 17 May, the ship launched all 18 Avengers, escorted by 16 Corsairs. One Avenger crashed on take-off and an American Avenger was shot down over the target; only one small ship was sunk, and little damage was done to the refinery. The Saratoga and her escorts separated after refuelling again in Exmouth Gulf and the East Indies Fleet was back in Trincomalee on 27 May where No. 21 Wing reembarked.|$|E
