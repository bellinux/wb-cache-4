John DuBois, at whose house the meeting <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place, became worried and drove to Nelson's camp. When he {{surveyed}} the campsite, everything {{appeared to be in}} order, until he got to Nelson's chickee.|$|E
5|$|After {{the episode}} was submitted, several re-writes were requested. Originally, the story <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place in Oklahoma, noted {{for being the}} center of Tornado Alley. For {{budgetary}} reasons, the episode was relocated to Mississippi. Another scene, originally scripted to take place at a motel, featured Pinker taking a short cut through a wall. This scene was cut {{not only because of}} budgetary reasons, but also because the writers and producers wanted to shift the episode from a supernatural focus to an emotional one.|$|E
5|$|A ten-man tag team match <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place next, {{but it was}} {{canceled}} due to time constraints. The kayfabe reason given was that the heel team (Irwin R. Schyster, The Headshrinkers, Rick Martel and Jeff Jarrett) could not agree on {{who would be the}} team's captain for the match. Their opponents were scheduled to be the face team of the 1–2–3 Kid, Sparky Plugg, Tatanka and The Smoking Gunns. Bob Holly ("Sparky Plugg"), stated in his 2013 autobiography The Hardcore Truth that the timekeeper backstage repeatedly told the referee over his earpiece to end the ladder match, but Michaels and Ramon ignored him, and kept wrestling until officials were forced to cancel the tag team match.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed over three {{days at the}} end of October and {{beginning}} of November 2002. It <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> only two days, but the filming of the wedding scenes was postponed after Messing got sick on the first day. On November 3, 2002, the rooftop terrace scene was filmed at the New York Palace Hotel. In November 2002, the scene in Central Park was shot in New York. The wedding ceremony was filmed, in part, at Temple Israel of Hollywood. As the actors performed their lines in front of a studio audience, the writing staff stood behind the cameras taking notes in the script and watching the audience's reaction to jokes. The writers often stopped the cameras and added new inflections to the dialog. According to the Knoxville News Sentinels Terry Morrow, the cast handled the changes quickly, and scenes were routinely redone up to three times even if the actors executed their lines properly.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2015–16 season, the Rockets {{acquired}} Ty Lawson {{from the}} Denver Nuggets {{in exchange for}} Joey Dorsey, Nick Johnson, Kostas Papanikolaou, Pablo Prigioni, and a 2016 first round draft pick. Expectations were high for the Rockets coming into the season. Lawson <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> some of the ball-handling pressures off of Harden, and they were bringing back nearly the same team that {{made it to the}} Western Conference Finals the previous year. However, things did not go according to plan. Kevin McHale was fired {{at the beginning of the}} season after the Rockets only won 4 of their first 11 games. J. B. Bickerstaff, his assistant, took over the head coaching duties. The Rockets struggled to remain in the playoff contention throughout the season due to inconsistent play and injuries. Lawson was waived mid-season in a buyout agreement. Houston only clinched the eight seed in the 2016 playoffs by beating the Kings in the last game of the regular season. In the first round of the playoffs, the Rockets played the Warriors, who were coming off a record-breaking regular season. The Rockets once again lost to the Warriors in 5 games.|$|E

25|$|Norman-Walker <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up the {{new post}} as the Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Man after he had {{returned}} to England. But a problem arose when it became known that his wife would not accompany him. The reaction in the Isle of Man was negative, and the Tynwald insisted that Lady Norman-Walker should accompany her husband to assist the Lieutenant Governor in carrying out his social duties. In fact, {{it was not the}} first time that Norman-Walker had taken up a new post alone. When he arrived at Hong Kong to become Colonial Secretary in 1969, his wife was not with him. The absence of his wife did not attract any criticism at that time in Hong Kong, and she arrived later.|$|E
25|$|I {{grew up on}} the Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.|$|E
25|$|The {{uprising}} {{was primarily}} organized {{and supported by}} members of the Polish nobility and middle class, who desired the restoration of Polish independence after the 1795 partitions of Poland ended its existence as a sovereign state; there was also support for various political and social reforms (such as the demands for the emancipation of peasants and an end to serfdom). Many of the insurgents' ideas were developed in exile by activists from organizations such as the Polish Democratic Society. The uprising <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place in other locations, but poor coordination and arrests by authorities broke many other cells, most notably in Greater Poland. The uprising was also supported by some local peasants from the Free City and the miners of the Wieliczka salt mine. The Free City of Cracow, nominally independent, was a central place for pro-Polish independence activists to discuss their plans.|$|E

25|$|In the {{original}} plan, the Woodlands MRT line had only four stations: Admiralty, Woodlands, Marsiling and Yew Tee. They would service commuters in Choa Chu Kang North, Woodlands West, Woodlands Central and Woodlands East. Two more stations {{were added to}} the plan later to include Sembawang and Kadut Industrial Estate. Construction work <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place in two phases, with four stations opening first and the remaining two (Sembawang and Kadut) later. However, the government and the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC; now known as SMRT Corporation) subsequently made the decision to open the Sembawang Station with those in the first phase. It was also decided that Kadut Station would be built at a later stage (depending on the development of housing plans in the area), as there was no immediate need for an MRT station there. Instead, a new station, Kranji, was added to the plan. The entire line was to be built above ground and would measure a total of 16 km. The eventual stations built were Yew Tee, Kranji, Marsiling, Woodlands, Admiralty and Sembawang to serve the estates of Choa Chu Kang North, Kadut Industrial Estate, Woodlands West, Woodlands Central, Woodlands East and Sembawang.|$|E
25|$|The {{seventh and}} {{deciding}} {{game of the}} series was scheduled for Sunday night, October 26. However, heavy rain caused the postponement of the game one night and the game was played on Monday night, October 27. The Mets sent Ron Darling, their scheduled starter, out for Game 7 with an extra day of rest due to the rainout. Oil Can Boyd, who had struggled in his Game 3 start earlier in the series, <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the mound for the Red Sox in Game 7. The postponement gave Red Sox manager John McNamara another idea, {{and he decided to}} start Bruce Hurst, already 2-0 in the series and the presumptive series MVP if the Red Sox won, instead of Boyd as the rainout enabled him to get a third day of rest and thus be ready to go for the decider. Boyd, upset at not being given the ball as he was supposed to, went into the clubhouse and decided to drown his sorrows in alcohol. Thus, when pitching coach Bill Fischer went to check on him, he found Boyd was highly intoxicated and thus in no condition to pitch in relief that night if he was needed.|$|E
25|$|The league's inaugural {{season of}} the all-professional league, called National, was held in 1932–1933. The 20 inaugural members of National were Antibes, CA Paris, Cannes, Club Français, Excelsior AC Roubaix, Fives, Hyères, Marseille, Metz, Mulhouse, Nice, Nîmes, Olympique Alès, Olympique Lillois, Racing Club de France, Red Star Olympique, Rennes, Sochaux, Sète, and Montpellier. The 20 clubs were {{inserted}} into two groups of 10 with the bottom three of each group suffering relegation to Division 2. The two winners of each group would then face {{each other in a}} final held at a neutral venue, which later turned out to the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir. The first final was held on 14 May 1933 and it matched the winner of Group A, Olympique Lillois, against the runner-up of Group B, Cannes. Antibes, the winner of Group B, <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in the final but was suspected of bribery by the French Football Federation and was forced into disqualification. In the first final, Lillois were crowned the inaugural champions following the club's 4–3 victory. After the season, the league decided to retain the 14 clubs and not promote any sides from the second division. The league also agreed to change its name from National to simply Division 1. For the 1934–35 season, the league organized a legitimate promotion and relegation system bringing the total tally of clubs in the first division to 16. The number remained until the 1938–39 season.|$|E
