Entertainment Weekly called it the album's highlight, [...] "where Bono's soaring voice and the Edge's pointillistic guitar meld to create one of those {{uplifting}} moments <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> to U2 for". [...] Cedarville University literature professor Scott Calhoun says of one lyrical portion of [...] "Ultraviolet", [...] "That's so evocative and works as beautiful writing away from the music.

500|$|The {{shifting}} {{point of}} view coincides with the movie's subject matter: filmmaking. The film begins {{with the end of}} a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera's focus in the first scene on Barton (who is mouthing the words spoken by actors offscreen), not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: [...] "hough <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> to one scene, we watch another.... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the protagonist (his play) and the world outside it (what goes into creating a performance)".|$|E

[...] In her final essay in the book, Angelou uses the story of the prodigal son to emphasize the value of solitude: [...] "In the silence <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> to ourselves.

500|$|Of Human Feelings was a {{continuation}} of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing. Coleman found Tacuma's playing ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to change. Although Coleman's theory initially challenged his knowledge and perception of music, Tacuma came to like the unconventional role each band member was given as a soloist and melodist: [...] "When we read Ornette's music we have his notes, but <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> for his phrases and phrase the way he wants to. I can take the same melody, then, and phrase it like I want to, and those notes will determine the phrasing, the rhythm, the harmony– all of that." ...|$|E

500|$|Truth Serum {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Anita Moran of The New Zealand Herald opined that the tracks were [...] "easy to listen to" [...] and had [...] "wide appeal". She also considered that the record was [...] "too short" [...] and that Lo's voice {{did not have}} the same intensity of Ellie Goulding's. Writing for BBC News, Mark Savage said that the EP [...] "contains more hooks than a coat rack". Furthermore, he ranked the record at number two on his list of the top ten singles of 2014, writing that, [...] "Every track hits you like a hurricane – the pop hooks deployed like rock riffs as Tove excavates her darkest secrets". Ben Oliver of <b>We</b> <b>Listen</b> Hear called it an [...] "excellent debut EP" [...] and [...] "a collection that not only showcases a sharp new talent but sets a new standard for emotional pop music". Panisch of Out noted that the singer [...] "manages to mesh together a warts-and-all narrative [...] with polished dance floor-ready beats". John Calvert of NME gave the extended play a mixed review; though he praised Lo's sincerity in the lyrics of [...] "Habits (Stay High)", he criticized the production of Truth Serum, writing that it is not [...] "anywhere near as boundary pushing, sonically – instead, it's dominated by anodyne, cliché-packed Scandi-pop". Tord Litleskare of the Norwegian publication Gaffa also gave the EP a mixed response, stating that the lyrics of the tracks were [...] "silly and sad" [...] and [...] "too focused on heartbreaks and drugs".|$|E

2500|$|As Bellini reports, he had {{problems}} with Tosi wanting changes {{to be made to}} a cavatina and a stretta in one scene, but he stuck to his own opinion, proving to be correct when he reported the audience's reaction to Florimo: [...] "the public was very happy with the entire opera, particularly with the second act". Overall, the first performance was even greater {{than it had been in}} Naples, and the opera was given a total of 21 times. However, critical reaction was not as positive as that of the audience: [...] "The second act is a long bore" [...] stated L'Eco di Milano, although the Gazzetta di Genova was more helpful, noting [...] "the more <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> to the style of the music, the more we appreciate its merit".|$|E

[...] "Retrospect for Life", produced by James Poyser and No I.D. featuring Lauryn Hill (who was due on the same day as Rashid's girlfriend), is the song that is the driving force behind the project. Rashid listens to [...] "Retrospect for Life" [...] today at the mastering session geeked, as if it were for the first time.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to her musical skills, Callas had a particular gift for language {{and the use of}} language in music. In recitatives, she always knew which word to emphasize and which syllable in that word to bring out. Michael Scott notes, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> attentively, we note how her perfect legato enables her to suggest by musical means even the exclamation marks and commas of the text." [...] Technically, not only did she have the capacity to perform the most difficult florid music effortlessly, but also she had the ability to use each ornament as an expressive device rather than for mere fireworks. Soprano Martina Arroyo states, [...] "What interested me most was how she gave the runs and the cadenzas words. That always floored me. I always felt I heard her saying something—it was never just singing notes. That alone is an art." [...] Walter Legge states that, ...|$|E

2500|$|At age 13, Parker met fellow Tame Impala member Dominic Simper {{in their}} high school music class, whom he found a musical {{connection}} with. Parker and Simper started off playing covers of Rage Against the Machine, Unwritten Law, Sunk Loto and Korn songs, along with Dan Debuf, {{who is now a}} presenter on 2Day FM. In his late-teens, Parker discovered the many '60s and '70s psychedelic rock artists that would have a huge influence on his music, saying that [...] "I got into bands like Cream and Jefferson Airplane in a big way, and loved the sound of their recordings. My friends were listening to bands like Brainticket and Demon Fuzz who opened my eyes to different ways of constructing songs. The Beatles way of singing vocal lines often crept into the recordings because they are so unique, whereas the elements we take from those other bands are usually common among a few other bands <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> to." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of their debut album Yes in July 1969 for Atlantic Records, Yes resumed {{extensive}} touring across the UK. The line-up of the group at this time included lead vocalist Jon Anderson, guitarist Peter Banks, bassist Chris Squire, drummer Bill Bruford, and organist Tony Kaye. Towards the end of 1969, they booked time at Advision Studios in London during gaps between shows to record Time and a Word. In a November 1969 interview during a tour of Switzerland, Bruford talked about the album, saying Anderson was [...] "pouring out new numbers for us to play ... Usually he writes a tune and <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> to the tape and take it from there". At Advision, Yes were joined by producer Tony Colton, a friend of Anderson's who was also the singer of the rock band Heads Hands & Feet. Phil Carson, the European managing director of Atlantic and {{a fan of the}} band, brought in audio engineer Eddy Offord to assist Colton in the album's production because of his skills and hard work. Offord would become a key figure in the band's history in the 1970s as their producer and live sound mixer.|$|E
2500|$|Sanders {{does not}} {{regularly}} attend synagogue, and {{he works on}} Rosh Hashanah, a day when Jews typically take a holiday from work. He has attended yahrzeit observances {{in memory of the}} deceased, for the father of a friend, and he attended a Tashlikh, an atonement ceremony, with the mayor of Lynchburg on the afternoon of Rosh Hashanah in 2015. According to Sanders's close friend Richard Sugarman, a professor of religious studies at the University of Vermont, Sanders's Jewish identity is [...] "certainly more ethnic and cultural than religious". Deborah Dash Moore, a Judaic scholar at the University of Michigan, has said that Sanders has a particular type of [...] "ethnic Jewishness" [...] that is somewhat old-fashioned. Sanders's wife is Roman Catholic, and he has frequently expressed admiration for Pope Francis, saying that [...] "the leader of the Catholic Church is raising profound issues. It is important that <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> to what he has said." [...] Sanders has said he feels [...] "very close" [...] to Francis's economic teachings, describing him as [...] "incredibly smart and brave". In April 2016, Sanders accepted an invitation from Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, an aide close to the pope, to speak at a Vatican conference on economic and environmental issues. While at the Vatican, Sanders met briefly with the pontiff.|$|E

2500|$|Author Michael Zager {{wrote that}} Pet Sounds resembles Spector's {{productions}} {{more than it}} does Rubber Soul, and that it recycles many of Spector's Wall of Sound production watermarks. Wilson talked of Spector's influence on his work, having learned how to produce records through attending his sessions, and in a 1988 interview, Wilson asserted that the album aspired to [...] "extend" [...] Spector's music, that [...] "in one sense of the word, we [...] were his messengers." [...] In Pet Sounds, Wilson sought to emulate Spector's Wall of Sound, driven by his fascination with [...] "combining one [...] to make another... It's amazing". Shortly before the album's release, Wilson spoke of recent popular music trends, saying [...] " [...] helped the Beach Boys evolve. <b>We</b> <b>listen</b> to what's happening and it affects what we do too. The trends have influenced my work, but so has my own scene." [...] In 1996, Wilson said of his partnership with Asher: [...] "none of us looked back... We went forward, kind of like on our own little wavelength. It wasn't like we were thinking, 'Okay, let's beat Spector,' let's out-do Motown.' It was more what I would call exclusive collaboration not to specifically try to kick somebody's butt, but just {{to do it the}} way you really want it to be. That's what I thought we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2001, Fallon Bowman left Kittie. Bowman {{explained}} why {{she left the}} band, saying: [...] "I was unhappy with some things in the band so I felt that maybe {{it was time for}} me to depart. I think it was for the best". On October 30, 2001, Kittie released their second album Oracle. Sounding more aggressive than [...] "Spit", the album features elements of death metal and thrash metal. Morgan Lander noted how the band members were only 14 years old when writing their debut album and said [...] "We haven't written in 4 or 5 years." [...] She acknowledged a change in influence from their early days, stating, [...] "Then we listened to bands like Nirvana, Silverchair, and Alice in Chains. Now <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> to stuff like Cannibal Corpse and Nile." [...] However, the band would continue to write in the same fashion by first composing the music and then using that [...] "as the backdrop behind the vocals." [...] The album Oracle was recorded with Morgan Lander as the sole guitarist. Fallon's position as guitarist was filled by Jeff Phillips who worked as Kittie's guitar technician. In 2002, Talena Atfield left the band and was replaced on bass by Jennifer Arroyo. In 2004, the group added guitarist Lisa Marx, and Jeff Phillips went to work full-time on his side project, Thine Eyes Bleed. On July 27, 2004, Kittie released their third studio album Until the End.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sound of}} the album was notably {{different}} than Forever as the female vocals and violins had disappeared and the band's focus had shifted away from melody towards more technicality and progressiveness, featuring more complex song structures and time signature changes. Remy Beauchamp elaborated, [...] "Basically, it was over three years between the recordings of both albums so within that time, the music <b>we</b> <b>listen</b> to has changed. Also, we all improved on our instruments... The female vocals are just something we tried a long time ago. The song was actually written in 1994, and then every band started doing it {{so we decided to}} drop it. The violin is not out definitely though, we might be putting some on our next album but for 'Day Into Night', we wanted to have a good heavy album, no extras." [...] Bart said that [...] "the production is much better; we spent 3 months in the studio as opposed to a week and a half... Our budget helped as well - we basically spent ten times the amount that we spent on Forever..." [...] He also said, [...] "One thing that many fans asked about... was why there was no violin. At the time we wanted to distance ourselves from all the bands that filled space in their music with different instruments as opposed to writing good music that stood on its own. We did the violin thing five years ago when the idea was a new concept so we wanted to move in. In face, we did record a violin piece for the album but chose not to include it for the reason above. Too many bands with violins. We wanted Day into Night to be heavy and kick ass and not diluted by association." ...|$|E
