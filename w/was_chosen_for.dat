5|$|As {{a proven}} Test player {{and the senior}} spin bowler, Ring <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> his second tour of England in 1953, this time under the {{captaincy}} of Hassett. It proved not much happier than his 1948 experience, though in a less strong side his eventual wicket tally, 68 first-class wickets {{at an average of}} 19.89, placed him third among the regular bowlers.|$|E
5|$|Icke made {{no effort}} at school, {{but when he was}} nine, he <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> the junior school's third-year {{football}} team. It {{was the first time he}} had succeeded at anything, and he came to see football as his way out of poverty. He played in goal, which he wrote suited the loner in him and gave him a sense of living on the edge between hero and villain.|$|E
5|$|Princeton University {{built the}} chapel {{to replace the}} Marquand Chapel, which stood between where the present chapel and McCosh Hall stand until it {{burned to the ground}} in 1920. The {{location}} for the new chapel <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> two reasons: symbolically, the new chapel would rise from the ashes of the old one, and practically, it would locate the new chapel centrally as the campus expanded eastward.|$|E

25|$|There {{were also}} two other {{opportunities}} for those few who had talent. Some <b>were</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> {{the house of}} song and dance, and others <b>were</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> the ball game. Both occupations had high status.|$|R
5|$|Smith saved {{more than}} 30 games while the Cubs had losing records in 1985, 1986 and 1987. In 1987, he <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> his second All-Star Game. When the midsummer classic went into extra innings, Smith pitched the 10th, 11th and 12th innings, {{striking}} out four and getting {{credit for the}} win when the NL scored the only two runs {{of the game in}} the 13th.|$|E
5|$|The name of Louis was {{bestowed}} {{because it}} was typical of a prince of France; Stanislas was chosen to honour his great-grandfather King Stanisław I of Poland; and Xavier <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> Saint Francis Xavier, whom his mother's family held {{as one of their}} patron saints.|$|E
5|$|Why Halotus in {{particular}} <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> such a high-paid position is unclear. Why Halotus was even spared is also unclear, as {{almost all of}} Nero's former servants were killed on Galba's assumption of the throne, as Suetonius notes above.|$|E

5|$|According to Kamal Haasan, when Mahendra narrated {{the story}} of Moondram Pirai to him, Haasan listened to Mahendra for about twenty minutes before {{accepting}} the role of Cheenu. The role of Bhagyalakshmi was initially offered to Sripriya, who could not accept the role due to her prior commitments, before Sridevi <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> it. Poornam Vishwanathan was cast as the school headmaster, while Silk Smitha, who had done around 20 films by then and was considered only for performing item numbers, was cast as the headmaster's sexually excited wife.|$|E
5|$|Although San Francisco {{had sought}} Tuolumne River water {{as early as}} the 1890s, this project did not move forward until the {{disastrous}} earthquake and fire of 1906, which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply. The Hetch Hetchy Valley – then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An act of Congress was required to circumvent federal protection of the Tuolumne River, with the reasoning that public land should be developed for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Although an {{air-cooled}} design <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> {{the reactor}} at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized {{that this would}} be impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build. The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.|$|E

5|$|As an American icon, the Statue of Liberty {{has been}} {{depicted}} on the country's coinage and stamps. It appeared on commemorative coins issued to mark its 1986 centennial, and on New York's 2001 {{entry in the}} state quarters series. An image of the statue <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> the American Eagle platinum bullion coins in 1997, and it {{was placed on the}} reverse, or tails, side of the Presidential Dollar series of circulating coins. Two images of the statue's torch appear on the current ten-dollar bill. The statue's intended photographic depiction on a 2010 forever stamp proved instead to be of the replica at the Las Vegas casino.|$|E

Republished with a new translation by Marion Wiesel, Wiesel's wife, and a new preface by Wiesel, it sat at no. 1 in The New York Times bestseller list for paperback non-fiction for 18 months from 13 February 2006, until the newspaper decided to remove it. It became the club's third bestseller to date, with over two million sales of the Book Club edition by May 2011.|$|E
5|$|Establishing {{an early}} {{reputation}} {{playing for the}} Shannon Club in Trinidad, St Hill was selected for Trinidad in 1912 and played in every Inter-Colonial Tournament until 1930. Although he missed selection for the 1923 tour of England, he played for representative West Indian sides in 1926 against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and scored a century against the tourists for Trinidad. Success in trial matches led to his selection for the 1928 tour of England where he failed badly. In 1930, he hit another century for Trinidad against MCC and <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> one final Test, after {{which he did not}} play any further first-class cricket.|$|E

5|$|Falkner Island Light <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> fog-signal {{experiments}} in 1865 and in 1902. In 1865, Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution, the Chairman of the Lighthouse Board, set up {{bells and whistles}} and tested the distances they could be heard. In 1879, a steam fog whistle was installed {{at the cost of}} $5000. In 1902, a air siren was installed and powered by two 16½ horsepower engines and used in an experiment in sound penetration. In 1934, a Leslie-Tyfon trumpet was installed.|$|E
5|$|For {{the home}} Ashes series of 195051 Tallon was fit {{once more and}} {{available}} for national selection. Despite making only 37 runs in four innings in the lead-up matches, Tallon <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> all five Tests. He had a poor time with the bat, making only 39runs {{at an average of}} just 6.50. He took only eight catches, but kept tidily to retain his place in the team. His performances for Queensland were hardly more productive; he scored 161 runs at 16.10 and aside from a rain-affected draw, his state lost their remaining six matches.|$|E
5|$|Historically Leigh {{was well}} {{connected}} to the local transport infrastructure, but with {{the closure of the}} railway in 1969 this is no longer the case. Public transport is co-ordinated by the Transport for Greater Manchester. There are bus services operated by First Greater Manchester, Jim Stones, Maytree Travel, Diamond Bus North West, Stagecoach Manchester and Network Warrington from Leigh bus station to many local destinations including Wigan, Bolton, Warrington, Manchester and St Helens. There had been suggestions to reopen the railway via Tyldesley to Manchester, but a guided busway scheme <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> the route; this decision was not universally popular.|$|E

5|$|In 1904, Gus Mears {{acquired}} the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium {{with the aim}} of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered. Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook), opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Shaw <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> {{the small}} but crucial role of unmasked and dying Anakin Skywalker in Return of the Jedi, {{the third and final}} film in the {{original}} Star Wars trilogy. Although David Prowse played the costumed scenes and James Earl Jones voiced Darth Vader, just as they had in the first two films, Shaw was cast in a single scene with Mark Hamill, during the moment aboard Death Star II when Luke Skywalker unmasks his dying father. Since the scene was unquestionably the emotional climax of the film, the casting crew sought an experienced actor for the role.|$|E
5|$|In 1997–98 she {{attended}} the state under-17s trials and {{was successful in}} gaining selection {{at the age of}} 14.

In January 2000, at the age of 16, Ebsary <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> the South Australian team for the Under-19 interstate championships. Playing as a specialist batsman—she bowled a solitary wicketless over in six matches—she did not failed to pass five in her first five matches, before scoring an unbeaten 34 in the final match against Tasmania. Nevertheless, it was not a successful tournament, yielding 45 runs at a batting average of 9.00.|$|E
