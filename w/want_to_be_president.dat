500|$|McGovern {{formally}} {{announced his}} candidacy on August 10, 1968, in Washington, {{two weeks in}} advance of the 1968 Democratic National Convention, committing himself to [...] "the goals for which Robert Kennedy gave his life". Asked why he was a better choice than McCarthy, he said, [...] "Well – Gene really doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>President,</b> and I do." [...] At the convention in Chicago, Humphrey was the near-certain choice while McGovern became the initial rallying point for around 300 leaderless Kennedy delegates. The chaotic circumstances of the convention found McGovern denouncing the Chicago police tactics against demonstrators as [...] "police brutality". Given the internal politics of the party, it was difficult for McGovern to gain in delegate strength, and black protest candidate Channing E. Phillips drew off some of his support. In the actual roll call, McGovern came in third with 146½ delegates, far behind Humphrey's 1760¼ and McCarthy's 601.|$|E

There's a difference," [...] he said. Colbert made no attempt to appear on the ballots in any other state primaries, and so it is unlikely that he {{would have been able to}} gather enough delegates to secure either party nomination unless he were to win other states by a write-in vote.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{during the}} 1980s, Rather gained further renown for his {{forceful}} and skeptical {{reporting on the}} Iran-Contra affair, which eventually led to an on-air confrontation with then Vice President George H. W. Bush: Bush referred to Rather's [...] "dead air incident" [...] saying, [...] "I {{want to talk about}} why I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>President,</b> why those 41 percent of the people are supporting me. And I don't think it's fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. How would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York?" [...] Rather ignored Bush's comment.|$|E

2500|$|During a {{campaign}} stop in October 2007, a reporter inquired {{as to why}} Obama had stopped wearing a lapel pin of the American flag, which he had started wearing after the September 11, 2001 attacks, and his response was that {{it had come to}} feel like [...] "a substitute for true patriotism." [...] This led to discussion on the cable news channels and was covered by satirists such as Stephen Colbert, who had an ongoing disagreement with the Fox & Friends assertion that [...] "this is America, and if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>president</b> of America, it might be [...] behoove him to wear an American flag." [...] Commentator Bill Maher, who was highly critical of such questions about Obama's patriotism and called it a [...] "non-story" [...] nonetheless referred to the incident as [...] "he first genuine controversy of the presidential campaign." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1989 to 1990, the Najibullah {{government}} was partially successful in {{building up the}} Afghan defence forces. The Ministry of State Security had established a local milita force which stood at an estimated 100,000 men. The 17th Division in Herat, which had begun the 1979 Herat uprising against PDPA-rule, stood at 3,400 regular troops and 14,000 tribal men. In 1988, {{the total number of}} security forces available to the government stood at 300,000. This trend did not continue, and by the summer of 1990, the Afghan government forces were on the defensive again. By the beginning of 1991, the government controlled only 10 percent of Afghanistan, the eleven-year Siege of Khost had ended in a mujahideen victory and the morale of the Afghan military finally collapsed. In the Soviet Union, Kryuchkov and Shevardnadze had both supported continuing aid to the Najibullah government, but Kryuchkov had been arrested following the failed 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt and Shevardnadze had resigned from his posts in the Soviet government in December 1990 – there were no longer any pro-Najibullah people in the Soviet leadership and the Soviet Union {{was in the middle of}} an economic and political crisis, which would lead directly to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991. At the same time Boris Yeltsin became Russia's new hope, and he had no wish to continue to aid Najibullah's government, which he considered a relic of the past. In the autumn of 1991, Najibullah wrote to Shevardnadze [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>president,</b> you talked me into it, insisted on it, and promised support. Now you are throwing me and the Republic of Afghanistan to its fate." ...|$|E

[...] "Theodore Hastings {{may not be}} exactly my type of man, but I am not out to see him cornered like that, and besides, {{to tell you the}} honest truth, Mr. Fischer," [...] he added, pausing at the door, [...] "when I stand for the Presidency, I want to do so not on the {{nomination}} of you or your friends, or any underground schemers. I want the support of the real American citizen. I want to be free from, all outside ties and obligations. I want to stand for America, and America only, I not only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>President,</b> you see, but I want to be the chosen President of the right sort of people.... I am {{going to ask you to}} excuse me to the ladies and our host, Mr. Fischer," [...] he concluded, holding out his hand. [...] "I had a note asking me to visit the Attorney General, which I only received on my way here. I have an idea that it is about this Roughton business." ...|$|E
5000|$|Having {{withdrawn}} from the presidential race, Hart left for Ireland to spend {{time away from the}} media with his son. He rented a cottage in Oughterard, though remained in contact with key members of his team. What news did filter out was that he was not excluding a return to the race. The New York Times also pointed to his odd ambivalence toward the presidency even before being caught by [...] "the system":"Only half of me <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>President.</b> ... The other half <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> go write novels in Ireland. But the 50 percent that <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> better than 100 percent of the others." ...|$|R

'My hypothesis is that voters are practical and they care more about national security than the media seems to believe; I think, right now, especially after two terms of President Obama, they want a president who has the know-how to lead during a crisis, a president who can defend our national interests,' he says.|$|R

Among those coveting Harding's seat were former governor Willis (he had been defeated by James M. Cox in 1916) and Colonel William Cooper Procter (head of Procter & Gamble). On December 17, 1919, Harding made a low-key announcement of his presidential candidacy. Leading Republicans disliked Wood and Johnson, both of the progressive faction of the party, and Lowden, who had an independent streak, was deemed little better. Harding was far more acceptable to the [...] "Old Guard" [...] leaders of the party.|$|R
