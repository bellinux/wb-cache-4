5|$|One of his few close companions was {{his niece}} Betsy (Elizabeth Etty), fifth {{daughter}} {{of his brother}} John. Betsy was unmarried and 14 years younger than William, and became his housekeeper in 1824. She remained in his service {{for the rest of}} his life, and as he grew older William increasingly came to depend on her, suffering distress <b>whenever</b> they were apart and regularly writing to her in panic <b>whenever</b> he did not hear from her. She became his companion and acted as his assistant, alongside his official assistant George Franklin.|$|E

5|$|Some pundits {{have argued}} that the top was not in fact Cobb's totem, {{rendering}} the discussion irrelevant. They say that the top was Mal's totem; Cobb's was his wedding ring, as he can be seen wearing it <b>whenever</b> he is in a dream and without it <b>whenever</b> he isn't. As he hands his passport to the immigration officer, his hand is shown with no ring; thus he was conclusively in reality when seeing his children. Furthermore, the children were portrayed by different actors, indicating they had aged.|$|E

5|$|Bugfix releases, which {{introduce}} no {{new features}} but fix bugs. The {{third and final}} part of the version number is incremented.

Security vulnerabilities are also patched in bugfix releases.|$|E
5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party. The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending. The new president thus sought to minimize costs not by acting <b>whenever</b> and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather <b>whenever</b> and wherever the United States could afford to act.|$|E
5|$|DAGs can model many {{different}} kinds of information.

5|$|Like all flounders, Peacock flounders, Bothus mancus, have {{excellent}} adaptive camouflage. They use cryptic coloration {{to avoid being}} detected by both prey and predators. <b>Whenever</b> possible rather than swim, they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colours and patterns to match their background. In a study, some flounders demonstrated the ability to change pattern in eight seconds. They were able to match the pattern of checkerboards that they were placed on. Changing pattern is an extremely complex process involving the flounder's vision and hormones. If one of the fish's eyes is damaged, or covered by the sand, the flounder has difficulties in matching its pattern to its surroundings. <b>Whenever</b> the fish is hunting or hiding from predators, it buries itself into the sand, leaving only the eyes protruding.|$|E

Such a TZ value must be changed <b>whenever</b> DST rules change, and the new value applies to all years, mishandling some older timestamps.|$|E
