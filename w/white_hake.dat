The purpose of my study was, therefore, to investigate the habitat use and behavioural interactions of juvenile <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> and Greenland cod and how this may vary in response to predator threat (an age 3 + Atlantic cod; G. morhua) and interspecific competition. A series of laboratory experiments were undertaken to determine habitat use under these different scenarios by dividing the bottom of two replicate arenas (2 x 2 x 0. 5 m) into thirds and covering these with artificial eelgrass, cobble, or sand. My study documented overlapping habitat use by juvenile <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> and Greenland cod and supported the contention that eelgrass serves as an important refuge habitat for both species, with Greenland cod showing the highest affinity. Furthermore, interspecific competition experiments showed evidence of <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> excluding Greenland cod from preferred habitat as a result of competition for refuges. The size advantage that <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> gain over Greenland cod early during demersal life may be the main mechanism that influences the outcome of this habitat competition...|$|E
40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the biology of <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> in the {{southern}} Gulf of St. Lawrence were investigated from commercial and research survey data collected between 1965 and 1978. Nominal catches have generally declined from an annual average of 5, 400 metric tons in 1960 - 69 to 4, 800 tons in 1970 - 78. Length compositions af <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> landed by otter trawlers indicate {{a higher proportion of}} larger fish in the mid- 1970 's than in the mid- 1960 's, the difference probably being due to a change in fishing practices. There was no difference in the length-weight relationships of males and females, but males attained sexual maturity at smaller sizes than did females. Comparable length-at-age data for Div. 4 T and 4 X show considerably faster growth in Div. 4 X, indicating that growth may be inversely related to temperature.

40|$|The {{preliminary}} SCAA/ASPM {{assessment of}} <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> {{presented to the}} previous GARM meeting is refined and updated, being advantaged by the greater availability of catch-at age information for the surveys and now also for commercial catches. Six assessment variants are presented, which reflect {{whether or not to}} take survey catchat-length information into account in fitting the assessment models, whether to use a Ricker or a Beverton-Holt form for the stock-recruitment relationship, and whether or not to constrain the multiplicative bias factor for the autumn NEFSC survey sweptarea estimates of biomass to preclude the possibility of herding. Imposing this last constraint leads to an appreciable deterioration in the overall likelihood of the model; the likelihood also indicates a slight preference for the Ricker over the Beverton-Holt form. Inclusion of the survey catch-at-length data in the likelihood leads to a considerable improvement in estimation precision, but also shows a marked overestimate by the model of the proportion of <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> of 20 cm and less in the autumn NEFSC surveys. Both variants are put forward as candidates to provide the basis for scientific management advice. The variant which includes the catch-at-length information reflects lesser abundance in absolute terms, a greater retrospective pattern, but also current abundance at a greater proportion of the MSY level, when compared to its counterpart. The estimation of current resource status in relation to the MSY level is critically dependent on the determination of the parameters which specify the starting (1963) numbers-at-age vector for the assessment. ...|$|E

On the Grand Bank, it is concentrated mainly to the southwest where water temperatures are warmest. Survey data indicate that mature adult females aggregate on the southwest (SW) Grand Bank slope in spring and first-year juveniles settle on the southern, shallow Grand Bank in autumn. Dispersion patterns and survival potential of eggs, larvae and juveniles were investigated with re-spect {{to the effects of}} location (horizontal and vertical) and timing (monthly) of spawning under monthly-mean circulation fields, M 2 tidal currents and associated turbulent mixing computed from a three-dimensional regional ocean circulation model. The results indicate that releases below the surface Ekman layer and in late spring have the highest chances for juveniles to settle in the southern Grand Bank nursery area in autumn. On an interannual scale, the strong recruitment of the 1999 year-class has been used as an example to examine the potential linkage between recruitment and the strength of the Labrador Current.

Projections: Projection models were run sampling estimated age- 1 recruitment from a cumulative density function derived from agreed assessment model (ASAP) under two recruitment assumptions: the complete recruitment series between 1963 and 2009, and recent recruitment between 1995 and 2009, a period of lower recruitment.

40|$|Diet {{composition}} of grey seals in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Gulf) {{and around the}} coast of Newfoundland, Canada, was examined using identification of otoliths recovered from digestive tracts. Prey were recovered from 632 animals. Twenty-nine different prey taxa were identified. Grey seals sampled in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence fed mainly on capelin, mackerel, wolffish and lumpfish during the spring, but consumed more cod, sandlance and winter flounder during late summer. Overall, the southern Gulf diet was more diverse, with sandlance, Atlantic cod, cunner, <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> and Atlantic herring dominating the diet. Capelin and winter flounder were the dominant prey in grey seals sampled from {{the east coast of}} Newfoundland, while Atlantic cod, flatfish and capelin were the most important prey from the south coast. Animals consumed prey with an average length of 20. 4 cm (Range 4. 2 - 99. 2 cm). Capelin were the shortest prey (Mean = 13. 9 cm, SE = 0. 08, N = 1126), while wolffish were the longest with the largest fish having an estimated length of 99. 2 cm (Mean = 59. 4, SE = 2. 8, N = 63). In the early 1990 s most cod fisheries in Atlantic Canada were closed because of the collapse of the stocks. Since then they have shown limited sign of recovery. Diet samples from the west coast of Newfoundland indicate a decline in the contribution of cod to the diet from the pre-collapse to the postcollapse period, while samples from the southern Gulf indicate little change in the contribution of cod. </div...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of habitat configuration on faunal distribution and success is largely unknown, despite {{a large body}} of literature concerning implications of habitat fragmentation. In Newfoundland coastal waters, a number of juvenile fish species, including Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), are associated with eelgrass (Zostera marina), a habitat that naturally occurs in a variety of configurations and that is susceptible to anthropogenic fragmentation. Studies have shown that the strength of this association is variable at different eelgrass sites and across scales. Given this inconsistent association and the complex spatial configurations of eelgrass, I investigated the relationships between a number of spatial characteristics of eelgrass and density of three juvenile (age- 0) fish species, Atlantic cod, Greenland cod (G. ogac), and <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> (Urophycis tenuis). I used data from aerial photographs to determine perimeter and area measurements at multiple scales, fractal dimensions of perimeter (DP) and area (DA), and a measure that combines perimeter and area complexity at these scales βP/A. Age- 0 fish densities were estimated at each eelgrass site using a seine net. I found parabolic relationships between βP/A and density for all three species, indicating highest fish densities at sites of intermediate patchiness and edge regularity. Furthermore, I determined that βP/A provided a less ambiguous estimate of spatial configuration than other measures. This intermediate maximum may reflect a trade-off, whereby eelgrass sites of intermediate spatial complexity provide juvenile fish with both optimal protective cover and opportunity to feed. I assessed this hypothesis by measuring foraging success in age- 0 Greenland cod at sites of varying eelgrass fragmentation, as measured by βP/A I found that foraging success depends on cod density. I then combined this relationship and the parabolic relationship between density and fragmentation to develop a model that predicts the observed relationship between foraging success and eelgrass site configuration. My thesis demonstrates that eelgrass habitat configuration influences the density and success of resident fish fauna. Furthermore, this research demonstrates that predictive models are possible in ecology...|$|E
40|$|Multispecies {{interactions}} (predation and competition) {{are known}} to have important consequences for the dynamics of marine fish populations. These interactions depend on the spatial overlap among fish species in the community. Several approaches have been used to quantify species interactions, including production models and age- (or length) structured multispecies models. In this study, multi-species biomass dynamics models were extended to account for food-web interactions in multiple spatial areas (Gulf of Maine, Southern New England, and Georges Bank). A total of 15 fish species collected from the study areas were aggregated into four trophic groups: non-migrating benthivores (haddock, yellowtail flounder, winter flounder, and little skate), non-migrating piscivores (Atlantic cod and summer flounder), migrating piscivores (silver hake, spiny dogfish, winter skate, goosefish, pollock, and <b>white</b> <b>hake),</b> and migrating planktivores (Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, longfin squid). The spatial distribution of each species group was determined from trawl-survey data, taking into account distributional shifts. We assumed that the migratory groups (planktivores and piscivores) range over the entire study area, such that their production can be described with a single set of model parameters (r and k). By contrast, production of non-migrating groups (piscivores and benthivores) was assessed with a different set of model parameters (r and k) for each spatial area. A hierarchical model fitting procedure was used to estimate the production parameters (r and k) and interaction coefficients among migrating and non-migrating species groups. In our study, migrating groups (F and P) played a spatially essential role in species interactions across multiple areas, indicating that the three spatial areas are functionally connected through the high degree of connectivity and direct linkages between migrating groups (F and P) and non-migrating groups (B and S). Our results demonstrate that accounting for trophic interactions improves the model fit and that the strength and direction of these interactions vary among spatial areas. Based on the area-specific interaction effects, this approach can help us understand the functional connections among multiple areas and thus inform current fisheries management. ...|$|E
40|$|In Newman Sound, Newfoundland, {{juvenile}} fish settle in shallow near-shore waters {{and are often}} associated with eelgrass beds of intermediate structural complexity.

The settlement and close association of age 0 and 1 juvenile fish (approximately 60 - 100 mm SL) with eelgrass habitat may be the result of an active compromise in which optimal foraging habitat is sacrificed for habitats with increased shelter from predators. In this study, I quantified the relative growth rates of fishes associated with three adjacent habitats of differing structural complexity (barren seafloor, eelgrass, and water column) at five sites in Newman Sound, Newfoundland. Juvenile Greenland cod (Gadus ogac), Atlantic cod (G. morhua), and <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> (Urophysis tenuis) were placed in 1 m³ enclosures positioned over eelgrass, barren seafloor, and water column habitats in 2002 and 2003. Changes in standard fish length (mm SL) and volume (ml) were measured, and specific daily growth rates were determined and compared. Stomach contents were examined for habitat-related differences in the type and quantity of items consumed by enclosed fish at the termination of each experiment. Zooplankton samples were also collected biweekly during summer and fall in 2003 to determine if differences in prey concentration differed among the habitats.

40|$|Small cetaceans, such as harbour porpoises, {{often become}} {{entangled}} in gillnets, and this anthropogenic mortality is a conservation concern. For years, harbour porpoises have been captured regularly in fisheries in waters of Newfoundland and Labrador (Canada), but defendable estimates have been lacking. Incidental catch of small cetaceans in nearshore and offshore gillnet fisheries in Newfoundland and Labrador waters was studied {{for the years}} 2001, 2002 and 2003, using datasets from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, reports from fishers, and Fishery Observer records. Fisheries studied included those targeting Atlantic cod, lumpfish, Atlantic herring, monkfish, <b>white</b> <b>hake,</b> Greenland halibut, redfish and winter flounder. [...] A methodology was developed to estimate incidental catch, based on datasets currently available within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Confidence intervals were generated using resampling statistics, allowing an assessment of uncertainty surrounding these estimates. Despite reductions in fishing effort since 1992, an estimated average of 1, 516 harbour porpoises were captured in various Newfoundland and Labrador gillnet fisheries annually between 2001 and 2003. Most captures occurred in nearshore fisheries for Atlantic cod and lumpfish. Several dolphin species were also captured in smaller numbers, mostly in the offshore monkfish fishery. The impact of this mortality on the population of harbour porpoise and other small cetaceans cannot be assessed until population estimates become available. [...] Using the same methodology, incidental catch assessments were compiled for numerous species of pinnipeds, seabirds, sharks and bony fish that had been reported as incidental catch. For most species, insufficient information exists {{to assess the impact}} of this mortality. However, catch rates of harbour seals, murres. shearwaters, various shark species and sturgeons appear to warrant concern. [...] In conclusion, Newfoundland and Labrador gillnet fisheries annually remove considerable numbers of non-target large marine vertebrates from the local marine ecosystem. The nearshore fisheries for Atlantic cod and lumpfish, and the offshore fishery for monkfish, appear to capture the greatest diversity of species, including small cetaceans, various seals, murres, shearwaters, schooling sharks and sturgeons. Various potential measures to mitigate this incidental catch in Newfoundland and Labrador are discussed. A framework for assessing the impacts of fisheries on marine environments is described...|$|E
40|$|Data from EU-Spain (Instituto Español de Oceanografía) {{bottom trawl}} surveys in the NAFO Regulatory Area (2002 – 2011) were {{analyzed}} to examine {{patterns on the}} South of Grand Banks (NAFO Div. 3 NO) of groundfish assemblage structure and diversity in relation to depth. The 1160 hauls from the slope surveys spanned between 38 and 1460 m in depth. We focused on the 28 most abundant species, which made up 92. 6 % of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 300 m. Five assemblages were identified. Two shallow assemblages {{were found in the}} shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 150 and include yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea), American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), Northern sand lance (Ammodytes dubius), moustache sculpin (Triglops murrayi), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and web sculpin (Hemitripterus americanus). Assemblage II (Shallow) includes the strata with depths between 151 and 300 m and comprises Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), American angler (Lophius americanus), wolfish (Anarichas lupus) and thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). Assemblage III (Intermediate) contains the depth strata between 301 and 600 m. Redfish (Sebastes spp.), spotted wolfish (Anarhichas minor), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulatus), Northern wolfish (Anarhichas denticulatus), <b>white</b> <b>hake</b> (Urophycis tenuis), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and longfin hake (Phycis chesteri) were included in the intermediate assemblage. Finally, we found two deep clusters: Assemblage IV (Deep) contains the depths between 601 and 1000 m, and Assemblage V (Deep) the depth strata greater than 1001 m. Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax) and spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) formed Assemblage IV. Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemnitzii), blue antimora (Antimora rostrata), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), Arctic skate (Amblyraja hyperborean) and longnose chimera (Harriotta raleighana) made up the deepest assemblage. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the collapse. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacements of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. Yellowtail flounder appears to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod and American plaice that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the fishing effort in the deep waters of the Grand Banks, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|E
