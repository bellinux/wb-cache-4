25|$|With {{the tournament}} {{moving back to}} Dubai, United {{registered}} a thrilling win against Quetta Gladiators. After putting up a total of 166, the team <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> almost certain defeat after the Gladiators were 148 {{for the loss of}} just one wicket at the 16th over. However, after a flurry of wickets and the inability of the opposition batsmen to finish the game, United prevailed by 1 run. This win also ensured the team of a play-off spot.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Test, Kippax travelled to Melbourne where he led NSW in a Sheffield Shield match beginning on 22 December. At stumps on the second day, NSW <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> defeat as they were seven for 58 in pursuit of Victoria’s first innings of 376. When play resumed on Christmas Day, NSW slipped to nine for 113, with Kippax 20 not out. [...] However, the number eleven batsman Hal Hooker stuck with his captain as the score gradually mounted and the opposition’s frustrations grew.|$|E

2500|$|Her friend's {{attitude}} immediately {{takes on}} a more threatening quality as a sudden lunar eclipse happens above them but before he can do anything he is confronted by Timbaland and SoShy's characters. [...] He tells them that this time he's brought a couple of friends, and the vampire and the cat man appear to back him up only for {{the three of them}} to be frightened away by much larger crowd that Timbaland summons. [...] The woman caught between the two sides looks down to see that her circular birthmark is glowing and looks like the eclipse, and the necklace worn by the vampire who <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> her in the club. [...] She quickly wakes up from the dream, only to see that the television is playing what it was {{at the start of the}} dream and the phone is ringing with her mother on the other end as the black cat comes in through the window.|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that once Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah was {{standing}} on a step on the Temple Mount, and Ben Zoma (who was younger than Rabbi Joshua) saw him but did not stand up before him in respect. So Rabbi Joshua asked Ben Zoma what was up. Ben Zoma replied that he <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> {{the space between the}} upper and the lower waters (described in [...] ). Ben Zoma said that there is only a bare three fingers' space between the upper and the lower waters. Ben Zoma reasoned that [...] says, [...] "And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters," [...] implying a distance similar to that of a mother dove that hovers over her young without touching them. But Rabbi Joshua told his disciples that Ben Zoma was still outside the realm of understanding. Rabbi Joshua noted that [...] says that [...] "the spirit of God hovered over the face of the water" [...] {{on the first day of}} Creation, but God divided the waters on the second day, as [...] reports. (And thus the distance that God hovered above the waters need not be the distance between the upper and lower waters). The Gemara presented various views of how great the distance is between the upper and the lower waters. Rav Aha bar Jacob said that the distance was a hair's breadth. The Rabbis said that the distance was like that between the planks of a bridge. Mar Zutra (or some say Rav Assi) said that the distance was like that between two cloaks spread one over another. And others said that the distance was like that between two cups nested one inside the other..|$|E
