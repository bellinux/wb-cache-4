5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} as a playing experience that newcomers to the series could come to. Its presentation was compared to that of a fairy tale, as depicting the usual style of the series <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> on the platform. Both Tetsuya Nomura and Yoko Shimomura, veterans from the main series, returned as director and composer respectively. The game received favorable reception from critics.|$|E
5|$|The tower-keep had {{a modest}} entrance, which was reached by a draw-bridge that lay across the {{surrounding}} moat, which initially reached {{right up to}} the base of the castle. A simple, 12-foot (3.6 m) high bailey wall, with minimal defensive value, surrounded the moat, which was in contrast wide, 10-foot (3 m) deep, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> for an attacker to drain. On the east side of the castle Nunney Brook was used as a line of defence rather than a bailey wall.|$|E
5|$|Libya's prompt retreat {{took many}} {{observers}} by surprise. One reason lay in Gaddafi's desire {{to host the}} OAU's annual conference in 1982 and assume the organization's presidency. Another was Libya's difficult situation in Chad where, without some popular and international acceptance for Libyan presence, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> to take the concrete risk of causing a war with Egypt and Sudan, with US support. Gaddafi had not renounced the goals he had set for Chad, {{but he had to}} find a new Chadian leader, as Goukouni had proved himself unreliable.|$|E
50|$|For these reasons, {{commentators}} {{said that}} it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very <b>difficult,</b> if not impossible, to replace Trump as the Republican nominee.|$|R
50|$|Scarman {{concluded}} that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very <b>difficult</b> for Catholics to gain membership in 1969, {{even if they had}} applied to join.|$|R

5|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 {{mandated}} that all new construction on transit stations including making the stations handicapped accessible. Because the 1885 depot {{is very close}} to the tracks, such upgrades at the old station location <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult.</b> New platforms, with mini-high platforms on their west ends for level boarding, were built just west of the former station. A footbridge with two elevators was built to allow passengers to reach the outbound platform without crossing the tracks, which carry slow-moving CSX freight service as well as MBTA and Amtrak trains. The new station was built in 2000 and opened in early 2001.|$|E
5|$|In an August 10 Small Group meeting, the {{principals}} agreed to use Tomahawk cruise missiles, rather than troops or aircraft, in the retaliatory strikes. Cruise missiles {{had been previously}} used against Libya and Iraq as reprisals for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing and the 1993 attempted assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush. Using cruise missiles also helped to preserve secrecy; airstrikes would have required more preparation that might have leaked {{to the media and}} alerted bin Laden. The option of using commandos was discarded, as it required too much time to prepare forces, logistics, and combat search and rescue. Using helicopters or bombers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> {{due to the lack of}} a suitable base or Pakistani permission to cross its airspace, and the administration also feared a recurrence of the disastrous 1980 Operation Eagle Claw in Iran. While military officials suggested bombing Kandahar, which bin Laden and his associates often visited, the administration was concerned about killing civilians and hurting the U.S.' image.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers {{knew from}} the {{beginning}} of production that the whales were their biggest effects concern; Dow recalled that they were prepared to change to another animal in case creating the whales proved too difficult. When Humphrey the Whale wandered into the San Francisco Bay, Dow and his camera crew attempted to gather usable footage of the humpback but failed to do so. Other footage of real humpbacks either did not exist on 35mm film or <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> to match to specific actions required by the script. Compositing miniatures shot against bluescreen on top of water backgrounds would not have provided realistic play of light. Creating full-size mechanical whales on tracks would severely limit the types of angles and shots. To solve the whale problem, Rodis hired robotics expert Walt Conti. While Conti was not experienced in film, Rodis believed his background in engineering and design made him well-equipped for Rodis' planned solution: the creation of independent and self-contained miniature whale models.|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} {{describes}} {{the process of}} fusing the data from several wind tunnel experiments into a single coherent visualization. Each experiment was conducted independently and was designed to explore different flow features around airplane landing gear. In the past, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very <b>difficult</b> to correlate results from the different experiments. However, with a single 3 -D visualization representing the fusion of the three experiments, significant insight into the composite flowfield <b>was</b> observed that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> extremely <b>difficult</b> to obtain by studying its component parts. The results are even more compelling when viewed in an immersive environment...|$|R
50|$|If the Dutch {{had made}} the mine at Pahaquarry, the mining {{operation}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> extremely <b>difficult</b> and backbreaking. The area is in the Silurian High Falls Formation, a sandstone rock which is extremely hard. Given the technology of the 17th century, in which iron hammers and chisels <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used, mining the low-quality ore in extremely hard rock <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a very <b>difficult</b> undertaking. In reality, the Dutch had all the copper they needed, as they bought it from Sweden.|$|R
50|$|The local ore {{contained}} {{only two}} to three percent copper, and hauling so much ore of very low quality on rugged roads using wooden carts <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very <b>difficult</b> and not economically feasible.|$|R
5|$|The Breves causae and Argumenta {{belong to}} a pre-Vulgate {{tradition}} of manuscripts. The Breves causae are summaries of the Old Latin translations of the Gospels and are divided into numbered chapters. These chapter numbers, like the numbers for the canon tables, are not used on the text pages of the Gospels. It is unlikely that these numbers would have been used, even if the manuscript had been completed, because the chapter numbers corresponded to old Latin translations and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> to harmonise with the Vulgate text. The Argumenta are collections of legends about the Evangelists. The Breves causae and Argumenta are arranged in a strange order: first come the Breves causae and Argumenta for Matthew, followed by the Breves and Argumenta for Mark, then, quite oddly, come the Argumenta of both Luke and John, followed by their Breves causae. This anomalous order mirrors that found in the Book of Durrow, although in the latter instance, the misplaced sections appear {{at the very end}} of the manuscript rather than as part of a continuous preliminary. In other insular manuscripts, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Book of Armagh, and the Echternach Gospels, each Gospel is treated as a separate work and has its preliminaries immediately preceding it. The slavish repetition in Kells of the order of the Breves causae and Argumenta found in Durrow led scholar T. K. Abbott to the conclusion that the scribe of Kells had either the Book of Durrow or a common model in hand.|$|E
25|$|Lomu {{was offered}} a {{contract}} with the Gold Coast Titans, a new Queensland franchise in the National Rugby League competition, but turned it down as it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> to reconcile his sponsorship contracts with companies associated with rugby union.|$|E
25|$|The railway {{operated}} two revenue-earning freight {{trains in}} May 2007 which carried 6-metre-long pipes from Kidderminster to the Severn Trent water handling plant at Trimpley. Carriage by road of such long pipes <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> {{because of the}} narrow roads in the immediate area of Trimpley.|$|E

60|$|It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a <b>difficult</b> {{question}} to have decided {{which of the}} three faces displayed the most extreme surprise.

25|$|This {{demonstrates}} {{that even after}} 1896 the career figures were sufficiently uncertain that he revised the list of first-class matches. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> for Ashley-Cooper to include and exclude matches in which Grace scored a century but clearly the career run total was sufficiently uncertain that matches in {{which he did not}} score a century could be added or removed without much comment.|$|E
25|$|From '75 to '79, the Most Valuable Player (MVP) {{award was}} being awarded {{after the first}} conference (All-Filipino). Without this ruling, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> for Adornado to win the award in '76 as he {{suffered}} a serious knee injury in the second conference (Open) and missed the entire third conference (Invitational). Beginning in 1980, the league started handing out awards {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Villa's attack on Columbus, New Mexico in 1916, Villa's {{military}} power had been marginalized (he was repulsed at Columbus by a small cavalry detachment, albeit after {{doing a lot of}} damage), his theater of operations was mainly limited to western Chihuahua, he was persona non grata with Mexico's ruling Carranza constitutionalists, and the subject of an embargo by the U.S., so communication or further shipments of arms between the Germans and Villa <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult.</b>|$|E
60|$|The idea of sentimental flirtations and love-making on {{the part}} of a married woman was one so beyond her {{conception}} of possibilities that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very <b>difficult</b> to make her understand or believe it.|$|R

50|$|Sculpting {{can often}} {{introduce}} details to meshes that <b>would</b> otherwise <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> or impossible to create using traditional 3D modeling techniques.

25|$|The 20,000 {{evacuees}} {{started to}} return in batches from July, with 2,000 deportees returning in August. The children, {{many of whom were}} very young when they had left five years earlier, hardly knew their relatives and many could no longer speak the local Patois language. Men and women who had volunteered for the armed services returned when demobbed, mainly in 1946. Relationships <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> at first. Returned children not understanding why you did not throw any food away, even having to eat apple cores.|$|E
25|$|To {{evaluate}} the vague and even contradictory {{form in which}} Bernal treats the matter of kidnapping Indians as a possible objective of the voyage, one {{must take into account}} that he wrote his history of the conquest some fifty years after the occurrence of these events, and that at least in part his objective was to have his services and those of his fellow soldiers recognized by the Crown. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> in these circumstances for him to have clearly stated that this had originally been a slaving expedition.|$|E
25|$|In palaeoanthropology, hominins {{carried out}} several early {{expansions}} out of Africa (known as Out of AfricaI) and into Eurasia between 1.8 million and 500,000 years ago. {{and though it}} may have briefly reformed, the evaporation of the Red Sea and associated increase in salinity would have left traces in the fossil record after just 200 years and evaporite deposits after 600 years. Neither have been detected. A strong current flows from the Red Sea into the Indian Ocean and crossing <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> without a land connection.|$|E

25|$|Kono Manga ga Sugoi! {{recommended}} Steel Ball Run as a {{good place}} to start for people who have not read previous parts, due to how it serves as a reboot of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, and appreciated how its move from Weekly Shōnen Jump to the monthly seinen magazine Ultra Jump enabled Araki to write longer stories and depict things that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> to do in a magazine aimed at children. Erkael of Manga-News called the manga one of the best in the series, and said that it does not disappoint the reader at any point.|$|E
25|$|When {{the clergy}} and the nobles elected {{different}} candidates in 844, Emperor Lothair I sided with Pope Sergius II, the noble candidate; {{three years later}} Pope Leo IV was consecrated without imperial approval, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> in any case as the Carolingian Empire {{was in the process}} of breaking up. Lothair II of Lotharingia indeed failed to impose his own candidate, Pope Benedict III, in 855 until the Roman-elected candidate refused the office (the first recorded historical refusal). Lothair II was present for the election of Pope Nicholas I, who prohibited anyone outside of the Roman community from interfering in papal elections, and as a result Pope Adrian II was consecrated without even informing the Franks.|$|E
25|$|Women {{began to}} dance ballet in 1681, {{twenty years after}} King Louis XIV of France ordered the {{founding}} of the Académie Royale de Danse. At that time, the standard women's ballet shoe had heels. Mid-18th century dancer Marie Camargo of the Paris Opéra Ballet was the first to wear a non-heeled shoe, enabling her to perform leaps that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>difficult,</b> if not impossible, in the more conventional shoes of the age. After the French Revolution, heels were completely eliminated from standard ballet shoes. These flat-bottomed predecessors of the modern pointe shoe were secured to the feet by ribbons and incorporated pleats under the toes to enable dancers to leap, execute turns, and fully extend their feet.|$|E
