25|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to the United States she {{submitted}} a very thorough and insightful report to Congress. One of her recommendations was that Congress should {{create a new}} State Department Bureau for African Affairs to be overseen by a new {{assistant secretary of state}} for African affairs. Bolton helped to see that this did in fact happen, and Congress created the new bureau in 1958. In addition to sharing information about her trip with Congress through her official report, Bolton also made an impressive effort to enlighten the American people about the diversity of the African continent by creating a film about her trip, entitled Africa: Giant With a Future, 1955. This film is an excellent resource for students and instructors wanting a look at several African countries/colonies in the mid-1950s, and has been made available on DVD by the National Archives. In addition to educating Congress and the general public about Africa, Bolton's trip helped to begin the process of opening doors for women to play a major role in US foreign relations.|$|E

Mr. Jones was not loved among them, and the chance of war seemed to run very much in favour of the lady. One discreet youth had gone out in quest of a policeman, but he was not successful in his search till he had walked half a mile from the door. Mr. Jones was at last nearly smothered in the encounter, for the great weight and ample drapery of Mrs. Morony were beginning to tell upon him. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> his <b>back</b> against the counter, it was as though a feather bed was upon him.

However, that thought {{had to be put}} on hold when Cristina came {{sweeping}} through, grabbed Mer and pulled her into an on-call room. She couldn’t go, not before they danced it out. As Meredith found a song, Cristina told her to call at least twice a month and to text all the time, told her to take care of Owen and keep him from getting all dark and twisty, to take care of Alex, which meant mocking him {{at least once a day}} to keep him from becoming insufferable. Oh, and “Don’t get on little tiny planes that can crash, or stick your hand in a body cavity that has a bomb in it, or offer your life to a gunman. Don’t do that. Don’t be a hero. You’re my person.

5000|$|Smith {{worked as}} a state {{organizer}} for the Committee as well as tracked suffrage votes and reported the activities of other suffrage organizations. Then in April 1917 Smith was appointed as Director of the National American Woman Suffrage Association’s Industrial Committee and their Publicity Bureau. [...] Within the Industrial Committee Smith worked to safeguard the industrial standards during World War I and organized a “systematic propaganda campaign against excessive overtime and underpay in industries where women are employed.” [...] Smith began to push the suffrage movement to extend their organizational experiences and interests to include other areas that were in need of legislative change, such as women’s labor. [...] She began to call for reforms saying that work performed rather than gender should determine the wage. The National American Woman Suffrage Association disagreed, however. The President, Carrie Catt, wrote Smith that although they supported Smith they were worried she had {{lost sight of the}} goal to obtain the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and it was best to focus their primary efforts on that issue.Smith continued to work for the National American Woman Suffrage Association and continued to be devoted to the suffrage cause. She also began “to join forces with labor unions and organizations that promoted collective action to educate and unite working men and women.” [...] In November 1917 Smith became active in the National Federation of Federal Employees which engaged in a range of actives to establish modern standards of wage and working conditions in the civil services. [...] Smith became a member of their Legislative Committee to further education on social and economic welfare for Federal employees. [...] Then in 1918 Ethel Smith was offered two paid positions in the Women's Trade Union League as the Executive Secretary of its Washington Committee and the Resident Secretary for its National Legislative Committee. [...] While on the Legislative Committee Smith began to be recognized as an effective lobbyists for minimum wage laws, the creation of the Women’s Bureau in the Department of Labor, and the eight-hour work day. The Washington Committee allowed her to educate working women on the power of unions and to create several unions between 1918-1920 including unions for women cigar makers and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. [...] Also in 1918, The Central Labor Union of Washington, D.C. selected her to serve as a labor representative on the local minimum wage board which became crucial to creating the Kesting-Tramell Minimum Wage Law. Smith continued to be very active in both labor organizations and women’s organizations but her hard work took its toll on her health and in late 1920 Ethel Smith collapsed due to extreme exhaustion. [...] Smith spent the next several months recuperating but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> finally <b>got</b> <b>back</b> on her feet she continued to be very active. In the 1920s she joined the newly formed group called Women’s Bureau. [...] Women’s Bureau worked to “formulate standards and policies which shall promote the welfare of wage earning women… and advance their opportunities for profitable employment.” [...] Smith worked closely with the Women’s Bureau in the campaign to enforce the merit system and pay equality for women in the federal civil service. For the next few years Ethel Smith worked for the passing of a minimum wage law for women and children in Washington, D.C. and the Child Labor Amendment. However, eventually both failed. [...] Smith “continued to struggle within the conservative political climate but her attempts to represent the diversity of women’s interests through legislative means were increasingly defeated.” Ethel Smith died in 1951.|$|R
60|$|With a heavy heart she {{returned}} to the hut, pressed down by the weight of solitude, and the sense that in the midst of so much death she could not hope to escape.
