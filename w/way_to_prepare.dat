Several leagues, known as independent baseball leagues, do not have any official links to Major League Baseball.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} after Ulam reached Los Alamos in February 1944, the project {{experienced}} a crisis. [...] In April, Emilio Segrè discovered that plutonium made in reactors would not work in a gun-type plutonium weapon like the [...] "Thin Man", which was being developed in parallel with a uranium weapon, the [...] "Little Boy" [...] that was dropped on Hiroshima. [...] This problem threatened to waste an enormous investment in new reactors at the Hanford site and to make slow separation of uranium isotopes the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> fissile material suitable for use in bombs. [...] To respond, Oppenheimer implemented, in August, a sweeping reorganization of the laboratory to focus on development of an implosion-type weapon and appointed George Kistiakowsky head of the implosion department. [...] He was a professor at Harvard {{and an expert on}} precise use of explosives.|$|E

Of Bacary Sagna's move from Arsenal to Manchester City in the summer, Wenger told reporters: [...] "I made him a proposal to stay for three years, but he chose them. Had he chosen a long time ago? Maybe – it looks to me like he agreed it a long time before." [...] Wenger also revealed Arsenal had received offers for defender Thomas Vermaelen; on the day of the Community Shield match the player transferred to Barcelona.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers praised Super Punch-Out!! overall for {{not trying}} to be realistic, for the {{originality}} of its different opponents, and for its simple controls. Chris Scullion from Official Nintendo Magazine praises the game for its outlandish characters, addictive gameplay, and simple controls. He adds that Super Punch-Out!! is [...] "superb <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for the upcoming Wii [...] title". Scullion states that [...] "the thing that makes Super Punch-Out!! interesting (along {{with the rest of the}} games in the series) is that it's not a realistic boxing game". He adds that the opponents in the game are [...] "the real stars of the show", with each opponent having a unique personality, traits, and boxing styles. Skyler Miller from Allgame, like Scullion, praised the game for its simple, responsive controls, for its colorful, detailed opponents, and for its usage of the Super NES's transparent color palette for the fighter, which facilitates the [...] "behind the back" [...] perspective. He also appreciates the game's sound and music, in particular the usage of real voice for the announcer. Game Players magazine applauded the game's [...] "large, colorful graphics and easy-to-learn controls".|$|E
500|$|During the First World War, MacLaren {{joined the}} Royal Army Service Corps as a {{lieutenant}} {{and worked in}} the Manchester area recruiting men into the army. He was promoted to captain before leaving the Army on health grounds. After the war, he was employed as cricket manager for Lionel Robinson and wrote for various newspapers and cricket publications. MacLaren and his family lived for a time on Robinson's estate when their financial situation was poor. He advised Robinson on the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> cricket pitches and to organise matches which might bring about Robinson's greater acceptance in society. As part of this process, MacLaren arranged for the 1921 Australian touring team to play at Robinson's cricket ground against a team selected and captained by MacLaren himself. The Australians struggled against MacLaren's team, but went on to dominate the Test matches against England; MacLaren insisted throughout the summer that the Australian team was not as strong as it appeared, and that younger English players should be chosen. Eastbourne Cricket Club invited him to captain a team named [...] "An England XI" [...] against the tourists following the conclusion of the Tests. He was dismissed by critics when he claimed that he could beat the Australian team; prior to the game, the Australians were undefeated on the tour and had won 22 of their 36 games. MacLaren planned meticulously for the match; he chose an all-amateur team, selecting spin bowlers noted for their reliability and excellent fielders. Although bowled out for 43 in their first innings, MacLaren's team came back strongly to win by 28 runs, the touring team's first defeat, although his batting contribution was slight.|$|E

500|$|For these concerts, Bache {{programmed}} five of Liszt's symphonic poems, the Faust and Dante symphonies, the Thirteenth Psalm and the Legend of St. Elisabeth. Works of Berlioz, Schumann and Wagner {{were also}} featured, but Liszt's compositions predominated. While {{the performances of}} the Faust and Dante symphonies were British premieres, the symphonic poems had previously been introduced at the Crystal Palace; nevertheless, Bache felt that offering repeat performances of the symphonic poems was important in making them familiar to audiences. Les préludes was performed three times at the Bache concerts, Mazeppa, [...] Festklänge and Orpheus each twice and Tasso once. Part of this strategy of familiarity was {{the inclusion of the}} two-piano arrangements of the symphonic poems as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> audiences for the orchestral versions. Bache had begun this practice with his first concert in 1865, when he and Dannreuther presented the two-piano arrangement of Les préludes. Another part of this strategy was supplying learned, well-considered and thoroughly detailed essays for program notes. Sometimes Bache wrote them himself; at other times, he relied on prominent theorists such as Carl Weitman and Frederick Niecks. According to musicologist Alan Walker, they [...] "are filled with insights that were both new and original for their time, and they are lavishly illustrated with music examples—a sure sign that they were aimed at a sophisticated public and were intended to have a potential life after the concert was over." [...] According to Walker, they still are worth study for Liszt scholars as many of the ideas, while transmitted through members of Liszt's inner circle, probably originated with the composer himself. These notes, along with the inclusion of the two-piano arrangements and what musicologist Michael Allis calls [...] "a thoughtful approach to programming ... all contributed to an aggressive marketing of Liszt's new status as a composer".|$|E

2500|$|Meat was {{prepared}} {{in several different}} ways. The most common was to cook it with water as a broth or a stew (for example, [...] ).

Stewed meat {{was considered to be}} a dish worthy of serving to honored guests (...)

2500|$|In 2002, {{researchers}} did {{not believe}} {{it was possible to}} distinguish between Anthrax variants. In January 2002, Ivins suggested that DNA sequencing should show differences in the genetics of anthrax mutations which would allow the source to be identified. Despite researchers advising the FBI that this may not be possible, Ivins tutored agents on how to recognise them. Considered cutting edge at the time, this technique is now commonplace. In February 2002, Ivins volunteered to provide samples from several variants of the Ames strain in order to compare their morphs. He submitted two test tube [...] "slants" [...] each from four samples of the Ames strain in his collection. Two of the slants were from flask RMR-1029. [...] Although the slants from flask RMR-1029 were later reported to be a positive match, all eight slants were reportedly in the wrong type of test tube and would therefore not be usable as evidence in court. On March 29, 2002, Ivins's boss instructed Ivins and others in Suites B3 and B4 on how to properly prepare slants for the FBI Repository. [...] The subpoena also included instructions on the proper <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> slants. When Ivins was told that his February samples did not meet FBIR requirements, he prepared eight new slants.

2500|$|Traditionally, {{most people}} {{continued}} to make tepa in the summer. Heads (pakegvissaaq is head of fish including pectoral fins) of chinook (king), sokeye (red), chum (dog), and occasionally, coho (silver) salmon were prepared by burying them {{in the ground and}} allowed them to ferment before eating. The traditional <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> tepa was to bury the heads in the ground along with most of the fish guts in a wooden barrel covered with burlap material. Earthern pits lined with grass were used for this process. Salmon milt and eggs were added to the heads which were then covered with another layer of grass before being covered over with earth. The fermenting process took from one to two weeks depending on temperature of the ground. One salmon production unit prepared four pits of tepa. The pits measured approximately 18 inches deep and 2 feet square and contained approximately 75 salmon heads each. The heads of 1,000 chinook, 726 sockeye, 1,246 chum, and 41 coho salmon were prepared as tepa by Kwethluk households during 1986. One resident told the researchers, [...] "to the Native it's like candy or bubblegum, sweet and sour, in between the two." [...] However, with the introduction of plastic buckets, the danger of botulism has surfaced and informants stressed the importance of avoiding these types of modern containers since the [...] "oldfashioned" [...] methods allowed oxygen to circulate and prevented the growth of bacteria which causes botulism. Heads stored underground in plastic bags are more likely to develop botulism than fish stored in grasses. It was soon discovered that the traditional method of preparing the tepas was safer than the modern way.|$|E
