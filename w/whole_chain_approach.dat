40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the nature of}} supply chain linkages for microbrewing and contributes to existing geographical work on the specialist brewery industry. It argues that a commodity chain and, more specifically, a <b>whole</b> <b>chain</b> <b>approach,</b> can be employed to examine such linkages and to contextualise economic relations. After outlining the main features of a whole chain methodology, the paper applies it to {{a case study of}} a real ale microbrewery in Northumberland in the North East of England. As well as examining the upstream and downstream nature of the microbrewer's own business supply chain, material from interviews with wholesalers, bottlers, pubs and other brewers is included to develop a locally sensitive cultural economy perspective. The paper reveals the complex nature of economic relationships and organisation for microbrewing, the different forms of trust that typify such supply chain relationships and tensions between difference and localness in relation to selling real ale...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} {{different}} possibilities and {{the feasibility of}} applying carbon capture at an integrated steel mill based on blast furnace process, {{in order to reduce}} carbon dioxide emissions were studied. Technologies considered for capturing of CO 2 are post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) and oxygen blast furnace route (OBF). Post-combustion capture for the integrated steel mill was evaluated in an earlier study by Arasto et Al. and Tsupari et Al. [1, 2]. Implications of different capture amounts, different solvents for post-combustion capture and process integration levels to the greenhouse gas balance and operation economics are compared to the steel production base case with varying costs of CO 2 emission allowances. Furthermore the effect of reducing the carbon intensity of steel production on the final steel production cost is evaluated. Iron and steel industry is responsible of around 5 % of the overall global CO 2 emissions [3]. Steel production based on the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace-based route is the main technology corresponding to the growth in global steel production [4] and this technology route is also the main source of CO 2 emissions in the iron and steel industry. The assessment of potential and cost for carbon capture and storage in the iron and steel industry is based on a case study on Ruukki Metals Oy's steel mill in Raahe. The mill is situated on the northeastern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. It is the largest integrated steel mill in the Nordic countries producing hot rolled steel plates and coils. It is also the largest CO 2 point source in Finland emitting approximately 4 Mton of CO 2 /year. Raahe steel mill produces district heat for use in the town nearby as well as for use onsite for heating of the premises. The power plant is connected to the national electricity grid, and thus it is possible to buy and sell electricity across system boundary. In contrast to power plant applications of CCS, CO 2 emission sources at an integrated steel mill are scattered around the industrial site and the flue gases are led to several stacks. Due to this, the capture process evaluation is much more complex and requires system level optimization. Carbon capture processes and process integration options were modeled using Aspen Plus process modeling software and the results were used to estimate CO 2 emission reduction possibilities and carbon abatement costs at the integrated steel mill from an investor's point of view. Different heat integration options and heat utilization scenarios were investigated and optimized with a custom-built CC-Skynetâ„¢ economics toolkit. Heat available for solvent regeneration varies between these heat utilization scenarios and thus different capture amount are investigated depending on the heat available for solvent regeneration in different case studies. Also different technologies related to oxygen blast furnace were considered, both for oxygen production and for top gas treatment. The application of oxygen blast furnace effects directly e. g. to the coke consumption of process and power production on site, and thus a new design considering new heat and process gas integration opportunities is essential. With a <b>whole</b> <b>chain</b> <b>approach,</b> including CO 2 capture, processing, transport and storage, results show significant reduction potential at an integrated steel mill with carbon capture technologies. Ship transportation of CO 2 is considered due to the location of the installation. Results show also the cost structure and feasibility of the studied technologies. Cost breakeven points for carbon capture at an integrated steel mill, for the plant owner and costs for globally avoided emissions are calculated. The study also reveals some major technical restrictions of the application. Finally {{the pros and cons of}} the technologies are compared and the role and potential of CCS as a carbon abatement tool in the European steel industry is considered...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the farming systems in two horticulture growing regions in Timor Leste and outlines {{the challenges and}} constraints faced by farmers in the production and marketing of horticultural products. The paper {{is based on a}} wider study of farming systems in Timor Leste. One of the main challenges faced by farmers is the low productivity and quality of the produce. This is due to current farm management and post-harvest practices as well as the lack of farm inputs. Product quality is a problem due to poor product handling. Marketing is hampered by the poor transport and road network system, inadequate communication, the lack of storage facilities, and the lack of a grading and standardisation system in the industry. Given the high local demand for vegetables and the potential for exports, it is important to address these challenges for producers to benefit from market oppor-tunities and to increase their incomes. Dealing with these challenges will require a <b>whole</b> value <b>chain</b> <b>approach...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractMango is {{the second}} major fruit crop in Pakistan. The {{domestic}} retail market for mango in Pakistan is dominated by small retail shops, street hawkers, and road side stalls. The fruit sold in these retail outlets is prescribed by the traditional quality standards of size, appearance and price. However the growth of superior outlets/supermarkets chain especially in the major cities are setting additional quality standards such as blemish free, improved packaging, prestige, convenience to deliver premium quality mangoes. Similarly the export market is mainly targeted to the expatriate Pakistani consumers rather than quality conscious foreign consumers. This is because of inadequate market information and understanding all along the <b>chain.</b> A <b>whole</b> of <b>chain</b> <b>approach</b> is undertaken to improve the market understanding in an ACIAR project.

40|$|Consumers {{today are}} {{presented}} with an increasing array of products. The growing competition for consumer expenditure requires a <b>whole</b> of supply <b>chain</b> <b>approach</b> to maintain market share for existing cultivars and to successfully commercialise new cultivars. The supply chain needs to deliver value and satisfaction to the end customer and profitability to their members. Critical to getting the product right is developing inherent robustness into the cultivar, and developing processes and systems through the <b>whole</b> supply <b>chain</b> that maintain product quality and add value. This paper describes the approach we have used in working with supply chains in Australia and Indonesia to identify priority areas for improvement. Our experience demonstrates {{the need for a}} champion in the supply chain with significant influence and a desire to improve. The paper also describes our approach towards improving a specific supply chain to achieve successful commercialisation of a new cultivar. The cultivar was primarily selected for good production characteristics and attractive visual appeal. The performance of the fruit is being monitored from farm to retail shelf to identify points where quality is lost and practices can be improved. A targeted R&D program is investigating ways of improving production efficiency (nutrition, flowering and canopy management), maturity standards to optimise flavour, harvesting and packing practices to reduce skin damage, and ripening and handling practices to optimise shelf life. This integrated approach is based on similar approaches used to improve the performance of existing mango and avocado cultivars...|$|R
40|$|This study {{develops}} and empirically tests a {{model of}} factors determining green supply chain management practices in organisations. Previous research on aspects of green supply chain management is dominated by anecdotal, sector specific studies that examine specific aspects of the supply chain, such as purchasing or logistics. Many argue this field is embryonic and lacking a structured integrative framework of research. This study addresses this gap by focussing on a <b>whole</b> supply <b>chain</b> <b>approach</b> that provides a synthesis of previous research to develop {{a model of}} green supply chain management. The data from a cross-sectoral survey of 149 members the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply is used to test this model, {{using a variety of}} multivariate techniques. The model identifies environmental attitude as the primary determinant of green supply chain management practices, influenced to a lesser extent by external legislative factors. The influence of organisational contingencies on this model is also explored, and size identified as the only contingency that influences the relationships in this model. The dominant influence of environmental attitude suggests that within organisations there are internal factors, or individuals, that may push forward the green agenda, and those initiatives that focus on changing the environmental attitude/ culture of an organisation might be the most effective at improving environmental performance. This study suggests that factors previously identified as important within green supply chain management, such as supply chain or competitive pressures, are less influential than expected. However, future research should seek to compare the findings from this study with a larger, cross-sectoral sample that includes diverse organisations from different nations, sectors and levels of channel power.

Vietnam also ranks the second among the highest milk productivity in the Asia and milk consumption is increasing rapidly. However, the dairy industry in Vietnam is currently able to meet only 22 % of domestic demand; the remaining amount has been imported (VOV/VNA, 2008).

40|$|Searching for the {{specific}} contribution of the life sciences to global justice in agriculture and food, one is faced with six global problems that haunt the world today. These are: population growth (9. 2 billion by 2050); the gap between poor and rich peoples; hunger and obesity; increasing environmental pressures; climate change; and instable power relations and systems. Most {{of them seem to}} have a strong connection with the dominant system in agriculture which is high input and capital- and resource-intensive with high energetic output (food), at the cost of other factors important for sustainable development, like food quality, fresh water and liveable temperatures. However, beside this dominant system there is a plurality of other, often local, agricultural systems that donâ€™t have these disadvantages or have them in a lesser degree, and they are in particular located in the South. The current prominent perspectives on global justice, like the consequence-oriented one of Peter Singer and the rights- and institutions-oriented one of Thomas Pogge, neglect the importance of plural and local agricultural and food practices for sustainable and fair global development. Partly complementary to these perspectives, Amartya Sen has developed a capabilities approach that emphasises human capacities and the role of democracy. In complementing his approach we develop an agency- and practice-oriented perspective that stresses the importance of networking the agricultural practices that strive to enhance {{the quantity and quality of}} food systems. The tasks of the life sciences for agriculture and food would then be to develop technologies that take into account the plural practices of the poor in the production, processing and consumption of food. This <b>whole</b> <b>chain</b> oriented <b>approach</b> requires from life scientists more than just doing research in laboratories; their task is also to connect their laboratory work with farmersâ€™ practices and experiments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Inhibition of {{electron}} transport {{activities in}} the spheroplasts of Synechococcus 6301 by HgCl 2 {{is dependent on the}} concentration of mercury ions. The inhibition of <b>whole</b> <b>chain</b> electron transport activity occurs at low concentration of Hg 2 + (6 Î¼Îœ). This inhibition occurs mostly due to interaction of Hg 2 + on plastocyanin. At an elevated concentration (24 Î¼Îœ), mercury induces inhibition chiefly in photosystem II catalyzed electron transport. At this concentration it also alters both the absorption and emission characteristics of the phycocyanin. The photosystem I catalyzed electron transport was inhibited by 50 % only at high concentrations (36 Î¼Îœ) of HgCl 2. However, electron transport catalyzed by photosystems I and II from reduced duroquinone to methylviologen which involves intersystem electron transport is extremely sensitive to mercury (low concentration 6 â€“ 9 Î¼Îœ) like that of <b>whole</b> <b>chain</b> assay indicating that the observed inhibition in <b>whole</b> <b>chain</b> electron transport at low concentrations is mostly contributed by the damage involving other intersystem electron transport carrier(s) like plastocyanin.

40|$|In this report, we conduct {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} two- and three-demand class inventory threshold rationing systems under one-for-one replenishment policies. The performance metrics of interest are the fill {{rates of the}} high priority demand classes (the gold fill rate in the two demand class system and the platinum and gold fill rates in the three-demand class system). Our main interest is in the sensitivity of these fill rates to {{the form of the}} replenishment lead time probability distribution and the resulting quality of approximation methods used to estimate these fill rates. We consider three approximation methods: what we call the single cycle approach attributed to Dekker et al and Deshpande et al, the embedded Markov <b>chain</b> <b>approach</b> of Fadigloglu and Bulut, and the continuous time Markov <b>chain</b> <b>approach</b> of Vicil and Jackson. We confirm the superiority of the embedded Markov <b>chain</b> <b>approach</b> for the case of constant lead times but we find that the fill rates are relatively insensitive to the form of the lead time distribution and both latter approaches, the embedded Markov <b>chain</b> <b>approach</b> and the continuous time Markov <b>chain</b> <b>approach,</b> perform well over wide ranges of lead time variability. For the three-demand class system, we demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} achieve highly differentiated fill rates by demand class and show that these fill rates can be estimated with high accuracy using the continuous time Markov <b>chain</b> <b>approach,</b> provided the fill rate of the lowest priority demand class (the silver fill rate) is not too low...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{conveyancing}} {{is a legal}} term, {{business management}} and specifically operations management principles also apply to the processes involved in conveyancing. From a business perspective, each organisation is usually concerned with its own profit margins and processes. In our global market, however, organisations now realise that {{they can no longer}} compete successfully {{on the basis of their}} internal operational efficiencies alone. They are therefore constantly aware of the need to improve not only their internal processes but also their alignment with other supply chain linkages in an effort to optimise the performance of the <b>whole</b> supply <b>chain.</b> Such alignment, in the conveyancing environment, includes government departments that are generally less willing to adopt business principles, which in turn makes optimisation of the <b>whole</b> supply <b>chain</b> more difficult. Objectives: The article describes a supply chain perspective of the conveyancing processes in South Africa and reports some of the factors that influence and delay conveyancing transactions. It explores possibilities of collaborative relationships between different role players in the conveyancing supply chain. It aims to show that a supply <b>chain</b> <b>approach,</b> as opposed to a singular organisational approach, can help to reduce process bottlenecks and delays in order to improve overall process efficiency. Method: The research, on which the findings are based, was exploratory in nature and followed a mixed-methods (quantitative or qualitative) approach and included both structured questionnaires and personal interviews. Results: The results of the study revealed that many different types of delays occur at various entities across the <b>whole</b> supply <b>chain</b> involved in property transfers. These delays are presented in a table and diagram. Conclusion: It is recommended that greater adoption of electronic technology across the <b>whole</b> supply <b>chain</b> would improve overall efficiency, eliminate bottlenecks and contribute towards efforts to optimise the conveyancing supply chain in South Africa. In addition, it is also recommended that the South African deeds registry implement an electronic system which would allow for the electronic lodging of property transfers.
