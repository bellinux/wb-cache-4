Nibley, {{stated that}} [...] "the day would come when there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of disorder, of secret combinations taking {{the law into}} their own hands, tramping upon Constitutional rights and the liberties of the people, that the Constitution would hang as by a thread. Yes, but it will still hang, {{and there will be}} enough of good people, many who may not belong to our Church at all, people who have respect for law and for order, and for Constitutional rights, who will rally around with us and save the Constitution." ...|$|E
2500|$|The strongest {{upper limit}} on the masses of neutrinos comes from cosmology: the Big Bang model predicts {{that there is a}} fixed ratio between the number of neutrinos and the number of photons in the cosmic {{microwave}} background. If the total energy of all three types of neutrinos exceeded an average of [...] per neutrino, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> mass in the universe that it would collapse. This limit can be circumvented by assuming that the neutrino is unstable; however, there are limits within the Standard Model that make this difficult. A much more stringent constraint comes from a careful analysis of cosmological data, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation, galaxy surveys, and the Lyman-alpha forest. These indicate that the summed masses of the three neutrinos must be less than [...]|$|E
2500|$|Production {{went very}} well, and as {{expected}} {{with so many}} comic actors and personalities around, was very lively. During production, Hudlin said that whenever David Alan Grier and Martin Lawrence worked, the film's crew usually worked a little slower because wherever they were, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> comedy being generated {{and they were so}} funny that everyone wanted to hang out near where they were throughout the day. In the scene where the new fragrance is being presented to Strangé, the director said that [...] "what Grace was doing on the set while we were shooting was so funny that I remember Halle crying off camera, cause she was trying to keep a straight face but she couldn't. So whenever she was off-camera, she would just be literally crying because she was laughing so hard. And fortunately, for her reaction shots she was able to recover." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'But what, then, {{can you say}} to him, or to them,' says he, 'when {{they find}} you {{positive}} against a match which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> apparently <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to your advantage?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{advertisement}} is very curious, Netta," [...] Hilda said as {{they drove}} back. [...] "Why should he have put it in? It <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more natural {{that he should have}} gone straight down." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{the whole}} affair <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> easier, so much more expeditious with the coöperation of the Eglintons.|$|E
60|$|LADY CICELY. There <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> less {{danger of}} {{erysipelas}} {{if you would}} be so good as to take a bath.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} only let the matter be settled {{by those who}} {{understand}} it, and {{not talk about it}} just at present, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only wish}} you fellows knew a little {{something}} about evolution [...] and sociology," [...] Ernest said wistfully, as they shook hands. [...] "We [...] <b>would</b> <b>be</b> saved <b>so</b> <b>much</b> trouble if you did." ...|$|R
6000|$|The chief {{examined}} them carefully, {{and nodded}} his satisfaction. [...] "If all the pale-faces dealt as fairly {{with the red}} man as you have done there <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> trouble between them," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{the worst}} of it," [...] said the bishop. [...] "It <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better for himself {{if he would have}} allowed me to provide quietly for the {{services}} till the trial be over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Urmston; [...] "I am, unfortunately, one of {{the people}} who don't change at all. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> easier for me if I did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If Miss Houghton {{would just}} {{allow me to}} run round and bring {{something}} in. Yes? May I? That <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more cheerful. What is your choice, gentlemen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am very happy--' {{and there}} was a cordial smile and a hand held out. 'Are you here for long? My father <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> pleased to see you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'From all {{we hear it}} is not a {{very easy}} service,' said my cousin. 'I should have thought that you <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> very much more {{comfortable}} in England--and then you <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> safer also.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If, on the morrow, {{you should}} find {{yourself}} suddenly seized by her, there <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> pity in your heart," [...] Poyor replied, and before Neal could make any reply the animal had vanished in the thicket.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's funny," [...] he observed. [...] "I shouldn't {{have thought}} it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> too small for me. Here, just try how you'd look in it, Mr. Lessingham," [...] he added, handing it across to him.|$|R
60|$|He pointed {{into the}} night toward the {{northwest}} and stared {{as if he could}} see from where he stood that Bay of Bengal where--as he affirmed--he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more at home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{should there}} be a quarrel between us? I am not impatient. If you would only believe me, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more happy for both of us. You always used to believe me." ...|$|E
6000|$|If I {{could see}} you sooner, I <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the happier; but I would not {{purchase}} the dearest gratification on earth, if {{it must be}} at your expense in worldly censure, far less inward peace! ...|$|E
60|$|If {{he could}} wound {{one of these}} fellows matters <b>would</b> <b>be</b> just <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better for his friends, and jumping behind {{the trunk of a}} tree he fired every chamber of his {{revolver}} as rapidly as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "I almost wish he had--it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{easier for}} me to have kept mine and {{overlooked}} it graciously. Flo, I didn't mean to be disagreeable, but it's quite hard to be pleasant when one is in the wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will {{be first}} rate, mother," [...] Ralph said in delight. [...] "I thought in another year I might get my commission; {{but of course}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> ever <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better to get it a year earlier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There we differ, Mary," [...] said Anne. [...] "I think Lady Russell {{would like}} him. I think she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{pleased with his}} mind, that she would very soon see no {{deficiency}} in his manner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the doctor}} will charge twenty dollars," [...] Saxon pursued, [...] "and make {{me get a}} nurse because I haven't any womenfolk to come in. But Martha Skelton would do everything, and it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> cheaper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, miss," [...] said Jeff, {{with direct}} simplicity, [...] "I've always {{wondered}} {{what you saw}} in it to make you content to stay, when it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> prettier, and more suitable for you at the 'Summit.'" ...|$|E

60|$|But {{it was a}} deep haul, for the avaricious Friedrich IV. made exorbitant {{charges for}} the knighting his young nobles; and Ebbo soon saw that the {{improvements}} at home must suffer for the honours that <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better won than bought.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only this," [...] she said; [...] "would {{you begin}} already to chafe and rebel if I {{were to ask}} you not to send that telegram? It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> nicer to tell her after she gets back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Probably, if {{she wishes}} it," [...] he replied; [...] "but I {{want to travel}} first {{for a year or}} so, before we settle {{definitely}} upon anything. I did not think that you <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> surprised, Sophy." ...|$|E
