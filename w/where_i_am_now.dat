Minaj commented at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, [...] "I'm putting lots of new songs on there and I'm actually going to drop my new single like next week. Barbz, you are gonna spaz. You are gonna love it. You are gonna go crazy!" [...] Production {{of the project was}} a main focus on Minaj's three-part E! special, Nicki Minaj: My Truth, which aired in November 2012. On On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Minaj stated that [...] "I feel like the music is such a better representation of me <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>now</b> as an artist in my career. As long as people can hear the music, I'm good." ...|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{commented on}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest that [...] "I {{feel like the}} music is such a better {{representation}} of me <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>now</b> as an artist in my career. As long as people can hear the music, I'm good." [...] Much of the new material incorporates hip hop and R styles previously seen in Minaj's earlier mixtapes. The opening track [...] "Up in Flames" [...] incorporates a [...] "slow, heavy and melodramatic beat", where Minaj addresses her wealth and delivers negative remarks directed towards her adversaries. The second song [...] "Freedom" [...] was compared to material from her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010); it utilizes minimal production and reflects on Minaj's rise to prominence. The third song [...] "Hell Yeah" [...] features Parker and further criticizes Minaj's opponents. She references her much-publicized on-set tension with fellow American Idol judge Mariah Carey in the line [...] "But I'm quick to check a bitch if she’s outta line" [...] and references the series' personnel in the line [...] "Shout out Mike Darnell and Nigel [...] / Why these bums so mad that the queen on Idol".|$|E

6000|$|The mound {{was one of}} {{the tallest}} in the region of dust, and as I {{struggled}} to the top, panting for breath and with my heart beating like a sledge-hammer, I saw away to my left the dull red gleam of the sky, and nearer still the flashing of lights.

"One of {{the biggest}} things that I wanted to do on this album was make people realize why {{they fell in love}} with me {{in the first place and}} then take them on a journey to <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>now</b> musically. My ear is {{different}} but I think people will recognize me. I think you'll hear that I'm in a happy place. I miss my music. My hunger is different than the first time around".|$|E
2500|$|... "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, {{also known as}} The Neptunes, who also collaborated with Spears on another track from Britney, [...] "Boys" [...] (2002). Both recordings were originally intended for American singer Janet Jackson's seventh studio album, All for You (2001), with her recording an unreleased demo version of the latter before handing the track to Spears. [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] was recorded by Andrew Cleman at Master Sound Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia and by Brian Garten at Right Track Studios in New York City, being later mixed by Serban Ghenea in New York City. Audio engineering was done by Ryan Smith and Tim Roberts. After reading the lyrics for the first time, Spears stated it talks [...] "about me just wanting {{to go out and}} forget who I am and dance and have a good time. That's kinda <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>now</b> right now. I love working, but at the same time, I love having a good time." ...|$|E

60|$|When I {{came home}} from this journey, I {{contemplated}} with great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situation; the security from storms on that side; {{the water and the}} wood: and concluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode in, which was by far the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of removing my habitation, and to look out for a place equally safe as <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> situate; if possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of the island.|$|R

It was all fitted with lockers from top to bottom, so as to stow away the officers' belongings and a part of the ship's stores; there was a second store-room underneath, which you entered by a hatchway {{in the middle of the}} deck; indeed, all the best of the meat and drink and the whole of the powder were collected in this place; and all the firearms, except the two pieces of brass ordnance, were set in a rack in the aftermost wall of the round-house.
