25|$|Secondary {{education}} is separated into {{junior and senior}} years. In junior years, the curriculum is a broad one where history, geography and science are studied alongside subjects {{that have already been}} studied at primary schools. In senior years, this becomes more selective and students have a choice over <b>what</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> much is to be studied. Almost all schools but PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College and its feeder junior secondary college have both sessions.|$|E
25|$|In April 1997, Martha Palmer and Marc Light {{organized}} a workshop entitled Tagging with Lexical Semantics: Why, <b>What,</b> <b>and</b> <b>How?</b> {{in conjunction with}} the Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing. At the time, there was a clear recognition that manually annotated corpora had revolutionized other areas of NLP, such as part-of-speech tagging and parsing, and that corpus-driven approaches had the potential to revolutionize automatic semantic analysis as well. Kilgarriff recalled that there was “a high degree of consensus that the ﬁeld needed evaluation,” and several practical proposals by Resnik and Yarowsky kicked off a discussion that {{led to the creation of}} the Senseval evaluation exercises.|$|E
25|$|Parents {{commonly}} cite {{two main}} motivations for homeschooling their children: {{dissatisfaction with the}} local schools and the interest in increased involvement with their children's learning and development. Parental dissatisfaction with available schools typically includes concerns about the school environment, the quality of academic instruction, the curriculum, bullying, and lack {{of faith in the}} school's ability to cater to their children's special needs. Some parents homeschool in order to have greater control over <b>what</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> their children are taught, to cater more adequately to an individual child's aptitudes and abilities, to provide instruction from a specific religious or moral position, and {{to take advantage of the}} efficiency of one-to-one instruction and thus allow the child to spend more time on childhood activities, socializing, and non-academic learning. Many parents are also influenced by alternative educational philosophies advocated by the likes of Susan Sutherland Isaacs, Charlotte Mason, John Holt, and Kenneth Robinson.|$|E

25|$|In {{the privacy}} of their own homes, people are more casual in {{relation}} to clothing, though what each considers appropriate varies considerably. <b>What</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> much clothing a person removes depends on a number of considerations, including the cultural background and on whether the person is alone in {{the privacy of}} their own homes. The removal of overclothing, such as coats, hats, gloves, scarves and the like, is the norm in virtually all households. It is also common for people to remove outdoor shoes when entering one's home and at times guests may also be expected to do the same. It is also common to change out of work clothes (such as a suit and tie, overalls etc.) into something lighter, looser and more comfortable, and perhaps for a woman to remove her bra or stockings. Beyond that, how much more is removed depends on personal taste, habits, circumstance and relationships of the people inside the household at a particular time.|$|E

500|$|Before {{starting}} the march across the [...] "dreadful terrain," [...] {{the three men}} spent {{a week in a}} tent at the crash site, packing up and making decisions about <b>what</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> much to bring and where to go. The far-off North Pole was not mentioned as an option; the choice lay between two depots of food and ammunition laid down for their safety, one at Cape Flora in Franz Josef Land and one at Sjuøyane (Seven Islands) in Svalbard (see map). Inferring from their faulty maps that the distances to each were about equal, they decided to try for the bigger depot at Cape Flora. Strindberg took more pictures during this week than he would at any later point, including 12 frames that make up a 360-degree panorama of the crash site.|$|E

500|$|Lesser {{reported}} in his 1974 book, , written {{to document the}} development of the show and the CTW, that {{one of the goals of}} the show's creators was [...] "the fundamental purpose of preparing children for school". [...] They were aware of the [...] "individual suffering and frustration" [...] of the child who was ill-prepared for the demands of school, so they sought to instill in their young viewers an appetite for learning. Two related goals were providing their viewers with basic educational skills, which Lesser insisted was valuable to inner-city parents, and teaching children both <b>what</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> to think. [...] The show's creators decided to only include in their curriculum the range of skills of the three to five-year-old child, and not focus on skills they already had, or on skills beyond their reach.|$|E
500|$|In November 2002, Justin Timberlake {{released}} his debut album, Justified, and produced the U.S. top-five singles [...] "Rock Your Body" [...] and [...] "Cry Me a River". [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] {{in particular was}} credited for having helped the album sell and peak on the music charts. Justified ended selling four million copies in the United States alone. Although the album established Timberlake's career outside his then-band *NSYNC, Timberlake (who was 22 {{years old at the}} time), was [...] "at a crossroads" [...] and felt he was at the stage of being [...] "burnt out", and thought he had lost his voice [...] "in regards to knowing <b>what</b> (<b>and</b> <b>how)</b> he wanted to sing". Timberlake stated that Justified had been years in the making, and a record that would re-create its success would be a challenge he was not ready to take.|$|E
500|$|Snake Rattle 'n' Roll was {{developed}} primarily by Rare employees Tim Stamper and Mark Betteridge. Stamper {{worked on the}} game's graphics and concepts, while Betteridge worked on the game program itself. Most of the ideas behind the game came from Betteridge, who had challenged himself to get the smallest file size for a NES game possible. According to Rare member Brendan Gunn, Betteridge found out how to develop cheap backgrounds that took up little space. After thinking about <b>what</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> to move objects on such backgrounds, {{he came up with}} the idea for a snake. Much of the game derived from another isometric video game Marble Madness, of which Rare published the NES version in 1989. They would also use the same type of high speed scrolling that was used in the NES port of Marble Madness, which, according to a Nintendo Power overview of Rare, [...] "many said couldn't be done on the NES". Rare's future Creative Director, Gregg Mayles, started with the company play-testing Snake Rattle 'n' Roll. He recalls being impressed with Betteridge's development of the controls, which he said [...] "felt really responsive".|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Horn {{was quoted}} as saying that [...] "the {{entrance}} to all my work... which is extremely important to me" [...] is the ongoing series of books entitled To Place (1990-) concerning Iceland. The books consider identity, site, and nature through photographs of landscapes, ice, rocks, swirling water, and people; most of the images are accompanied by descriptive, classificatory, or literary texts. In describing her attraction to the landscape, Horn states: The drama comes from its youth. The landscape is unique in that the geology is very young. It’s like a labyrinth in the definitive sense. It’s big enough to get lost in, but small enough to find yourself. There is little erosion and, as a result, unexpected symmetries exist in unexpected places. America has everything Iceland has, but it’s ten thousand, twenty thousand, one hundred thousand years older... Growing up in a very “old” landscape—New York City—its origins are secreted from the present. I mean that the geological aspect of the landscape in New York City can only be experienced theoretically at this point. In Iceland, you understand empirically exactly what this place is: its <b>what</b> <b>and</b> <b>how.</b> That accessibility effects the nature of one’s experience, the experience of the world. Any place you’re going to stand in, in any given moment, is a complement {{to the rest of the}} world, historically and empirically. What you can see in that moment, what you can touch in that moment, is confluent with everything else.|$|E

The French united in one division amounting to 10,000 (or 7,000) cavalry in array and fired guns at the Emperor's horsemen, but all went too high and did no hurt. Thus the Burgundians and certain English struck , and as they turned and the Emperor saw the Burgundians hard pressed, he at once ordered the German horsemen to attack on the flank; but before they struck the French had turned about and fled. Our horsemen pursued them until within a short mile of their camp and brought back the prisoners and banners hereafter indicated. When the Emperor saw that no more harm could be done them, and they were near their camp wherein were yet 20,000 foot, he retired all the men in good order and marched to the camp, remaining all night in the field. In this skirmish the English used no other cry than Burgundia." ...|$|E
