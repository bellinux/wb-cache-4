5|$|Like Bülow, Bache {{performed}} {{works from}} memory instead of from the printed page, {{at a time}} when doing so <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> open debate. Also like Bülow, he began giving recitals devoted entirely to the work of one composer. In 1879, he began giving all-Liszt recitals, and in 1883 he experimented with an all-Beethoven recital.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> defending a doctrine that embodied that gift. It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology was {{before he became a}} reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|E
5|$|Adams {{returned}} to management in April 1999 with Division Three team Brighton & Hove Albion. The club {{were in the}} middle of a financial crisis, which had seen the board sell the Goldstone Ground just to stay afloat; on the pitch the club were facing a battle for their league status. His first full season as manager <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> consolidation as the club finished a respectable 11th, whilst Adams signed talent such as star striker Bobby Zamora. The £100,000 spent on Zamora was the only transfer outlay Adams made in building his squad.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1995, {{residents}} {{succeeded in}} stopping the Orange march from entering their area. Thousands of Orangemen and loyalists {{engaged in a}} standoff with the police and army at Drumcree Church. Paisley addressed a rally at Drumcree, telling a crowd of thousands:We will die if necessary rather than surrender! If we don't win this battle all is lost. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> life and death; it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> Ulster or the Irish Republic; it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> freedom or slavery! ...|$|R

5|$|In a deleted scene set {{after the}} end of the episode, Walter talks with the first patient Joseph Slater, who wonders why he was chosen to have a piece of Walter's brain. Walter {{responds}} it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> circumstance, as Slater shared his blood type and had a young resilient brain. Walter also says he himself cannot be cured, as his madness had nothing to do with the missing parts of his brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{theology}} and liturgy of the Church of England became markedly Protestant {{during the reign}} of Henry's son Edward VI largely along lines laid down by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. Under Mary, the whole process was reversed and the Church of England was again placed under papal jurisdiction. Soon after, Elizabeth reintroduced the Protestant faith but in a more moderate manner. The structure and theology of the church <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> fierce dispute for generations.|$|E
5|$|After the Duke of Northumberland's {{attainder}} {{the entire}} Dudley inheritance had disappeared. His sons {{had to start}} from scratch in rebuilding the family fortunes, as they had renounced any rights to their father's former possessions or titles when their own attainders had been lifted in January 1558. Robert Dudley financed the lifestyle expected of a royal favourite by large loans from City of London merchants until in April 1560 Elizabeth granted him his first export licence, worth £6,000 p.a. He also received some of his father's lands, but since he was not the family heir it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> some difficulty to find a suitable estate for his intended peerage. In June 1563 the Queen granted him Kenilworth Manor, Castle, and Park, together with the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk in North Wales. Other grants were to follow. Eventually, Leicester and his elder brother Ambrose, Earl of Warwick, came to preside over the greatest aristocratic interest in the West Midlands and North Wales.|$|E

5|$|Already before this, in 1430, FitzAlan had {{departed}} for France, where {{he held a}} series of important command positions. He served under John, Duke of Bedford, the uncle of the eight-year-old King Henry VI. FitzAlan was involved in recovering fortresses in the Île-de-France region, and in suppressing local rebellions. His military career ended, however, at the Battle of Gerbevoy in 1435. Refusing to retreat in the face of superior forces, Arundel was shot in the foot and captured. His leg was later amputated, and he died shortly afterwards from the injury. His final resting place <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> dispute until the mid-nineteenth century, when his tomb at Arundel Castle was revealed to contain a skeleton missing one leg.|$|E
5|$|Following {{reports of}} {{disciplinary}} problems, VI Corps ordered an investigation, {{which took place}} over four days while elements of the battalion were still engaged at Rittershoffen. It recommended that the battalion be withdrawn and retrained before returning to combat under a new commander, while Major-General Edward H. Brooks, the corps commander, instead recommended that the battalion be entirely disbanded and its men distributed to other units. General Alexander Patch, commanding Seventh Army, agreed with Brooks, suggesting that a new tank destroyer battalion be formed from the men of service units, themselves replaced by {{the men of the}} 827th. This was contentious, however; the number and status of segregated combat units <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> intense political debate, and converting a black combat unit to a service one, in favor of white troops, was likely controversial.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the Liberals gained {{office on}} Prince Edward Island. They {{immediately}} went about putting in place measures to gradually dismantle the proprietor/tenant system, although their efforts generally had limited effect largely because Samuel Cunard, who owned one-sixth of the Island, refused to sell {{any of his}} land. In 1864, the tenants organised into the Tenant League, and vowed to resist the collection of rent by their proprietors. Efforts by law enforcement to quell this rebellion had little effect, so {{the government of the}} island requested the assistance of British troops to enforce the collection of rent. In 1865, British troops arrived in the colony and successfully enforced the collection of the unpaid rent, and the Tenant League crumbled. It appeared that the operation of the Tenant League <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> principle rather than practical necessity; the rent paid by tenants to the proprietors was to the amount of one shilling per acre, and the proprietors allowed rent to go unpaid for years at a time.|$|E

5|$|Spiritualism {{appealed to}} many educated Victorians {{who no longer}} found {{traditional}} religious doctrine, {{such as that of}} the Church of England, acceptable yet were unsatisfied with the completely materialistic and mechanical view of the world that was increasingly emerging from 19th-century science. However, several scholars who have researched Wallace's views in depth have emphasised that, for him, spiritualism <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> science and philosophy rather than religious belief. Among other prominent 19th-century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer Robert Owen, who was one of Wallace's early idols, the physicists William Crookes and Lord Rayleigh, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan, and the Scottish publisher Robert Chambers.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{slavery was}} to be {{regulated}} under the new Constitution <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> such intense conflict between the North and South that several Southern states refused to join the Union if slavery {{were not to be}} allowed. Delegates opposed to slavery were forced to yield in their demands that slavery practiced {{within the confines of the}} new nation be completely outlawed. However, they continued to argue that the Constitution should prohibit the states from participating in the international slave trade, including in the importation of new slaves from Africa and the export of slaves to other countries. The Convention postponed making a final decision on the international slave trade until late in the deliberations because of the contentious nature of the issue. During the Convention's late July recess, the Committee of Detail had inserted language that would prohibit the federal government from attempting to ban international slave trading and from imposing taxes on the purchase or sale of slaves. The Convention could not agree on these provisions when the subject came up again in late August, so they referred the matter to an eleven-member committee for further discussion. This committee helped work out a compromise: Congress would have the power to ban the international slave trade, but not for another twenty years (that is, not until 1808). In exchange for this concession, the federal government's power to regulate foreign commerce would be strengthened by provisions that allowed for taxation of slave trades in the international market and that reduced the requirement for passage of navigation acts from two-thirds majorities of both houses of Congress to simple majorities.|$|E

60|$|That <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> faith. Of {{the faith}} which the holy Church {{commands}} us to have. But {{it need not}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> blind or unreasonable faith. That our God is the God of Adam; that the same Lord God who taught him teaches us likewise, need not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mere <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> faith: it may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> reason likewise; <b>a</b> thing which seems reasonable to us, and recommends itself to our mind and conscience as true.|$|R

25|$|Like Mongkut, Ajaan Mun {{stressed}} the importance of scrupulous observance of both the Buddhist monastic code (Pali: Vinaya). Ajaan Mun went further, and also stressed what are called the protocols: instructions for how a monk should go about daily activities such as keeping his hut, interacting with other people, etc.Ajaan Mun also taught that virtue <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> the mind, and that intention forms the essence of virtue. This ran counter to what people in Bangkok said at the time, that virtue <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> ritual, and by conducting the proper ritual one gets good results.|$|E

25|$|Ursu's death <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> {{international}} scandal and, {{after the}} Romanian Revolution, {{the subject of}} an inquiry initially headed by prosecutor Dan Voinea.
