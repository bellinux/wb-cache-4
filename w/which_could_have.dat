5|$|David A. Wheeler's paper How to Prevent {{the next}} Heartbleed {{analyzes}} why Heartbleed wasn't discovered earlier, and suggests several techniques <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{led to a}} faster identification, as well as techniques <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> reduced its impact. According to Wheeler, the most efficient technique <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> prevented Heartbleed is an atypical test suite thoroughly performing what he calls negative testing, i.e. testing that invalid inputs cause failures rather than successes. Wheeler highlights that a single general-purpose test suite {{could serve as a}} base for all TLS implementations.|$|E

5|$|Thirteen horses {{entered the}} Derby, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> at most twenty participants. Horse owners {{had to pay}} a final entry fee of $2,500 to have their horses officially entered. The field was larger than {{anticipated}} because of new entries following Secretariat's loss at the Wood Memorial Stakes in New York.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{eccentric}} post-capture orbit {{would have}} {{also resulted in}} tidal heating of its interior, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> kept Triton fluid for a billion years; this inference is supported by evidence of differentiation in Triton's interior. This source of internal heat disappeared following tidal locking and circularization of the orbit.|$|E

One such file has the Security Czar {{detailing}} the organization's mandate to US President Bill Clinton after his inauguration in January 1993. In the tape, Clinton is unaware that STRIKE prevented a civil war in Mexico in 1982 <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> turned the country into a secret Warsaw Pact member-state.|$|E
5|$|An't for is not {{may have}} {{developed}} independently from its use for am not and are not. Isn't was sometimes written as in't or en't, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> changed into an't. An't for is not {{may also have}} filled a gap {{as an extension of}} the already-used conjugations for to be not. Jonathan Swift used an't to mean is not in Letter 19 of his Journal to Stella (1710–13): It an't my fault, 'tis Patrick's fault; pray now don't blame Presto.|$|E
5|$|Cane later {{explains}} to Rose that Polk {{had been his}} commander of an artillery battery at a battle <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been a victory but that Polk panicked and ran, depressing his men, with those who didn't desert their positions being decimated, including Cane's brothers, or captured like Cane himself. Rose makes Cane promise not to harm Polk, but still has Polk placed in protective custody.|$|E

His participation never came to be and the country has not made another attempt to join the contest following the conclusion of its broadcaster's ban.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} which {{carnivores}} may have preyed on Massospondylus. Most of the theropods that have been discovered in rocks of Early Jurassic age in southern Africa, such as Coelophysis, were smaller than mid-sized sauropodomorphs like Massospondylus. These smaller predators have been postulated as using fast slashing attacks to wear down sauropodomorphs, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> defended themselves with their large hand and foot claws. The 6-metre-(20ft-) long carnivorous theropod Dracovenator lived {{during the same period}} (Hettangian to Sinemurian stages) as Massospondylus and has also been found in the Elliot Formation of South Africa.|$|E

5|$|One B-26, {{after being}} seriously damaged by {{anti-aircraft}} fire, made a suicide run on Akagi. Making {{no attempt to}} pull out of its run, the aircraft narrowly missed crashing directly into the carrier's bridge, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> killed Nagumo and his command staff. This experience may well have contributed to Nagumo's determination to launch another attack on Midway, in direct violation of Yamamoto's order to keep the reserve strike force armed for anti-ship operations.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of most {{specimens}} {{was made}} possible by the fast sedimentation that quickly cut the organism off from seawater; it may also have been enhanced by the decay products of the rotting organism, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> helped the overlying sediment to mineralise and harden. It has been suggested that a mucus trail produced by the organism may have assisted its preservation, but experiments suggest that mucus disintegrates too easily {{to play a role in}} binding sediment together.|$|E
5|$|Rising {{sea levels}} caused by global warming are another {{threat to the}} future of the park. Since 1932, ocean levels at Key West have {{steadily}} risen over , <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> disastrous consequences for land so close to the ocean. It is estimated that within 500 years freshwater habitats in the Everglades National Park will be obliterated by salt water, leaving only the northernmost portion of the Everglades. Cost estimates for raising or replacing the Tamiami Trail and Alligator Alley with bridges are in the hundreds of millions of dollars.|$|E

5|$|Scientists have debated {{as to how}} sauropods {{were able}} to breathe with their large body sizes and long necks, which would have {{increased}} the amount of dead space. They likely had an avian respiratory system, which is more efficient than a mammalian and reptilian system. Reconstructions of the neck and thorax of Diplodocus show great pneumaticity, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{played a role in}} respiration as it does in birds.|$|E
5|$|Taraborrelli {{stated that}} Jackson was {{diagnosed}} with lupus, that the vitiligo partially lightened his skin, and the lupus was in remission, and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> caused his lupus condition to recur. Jackson's autopsy did not confirm or refute the claim that he had lupus, but it did confirm that he had vitiligo. His skin {{was found to have}} reduced (though not absent) melanocytes, the cells active in skin pigmentation.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Giro {{featured}} {{an assortment}} of contenders for the overall victory. Defending champion Danilo Di Luca had faced potential bans which would have {{kept him out of}} the race, after investigations into his involvement with the Oil for Drugs scandal and an irregular doping test given after stage 17 of the 2007 Giro d'Italia, either of <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> resulted in a two-year suspension. Though he was suspended for three months because of Oil for Drugs, he was cleared by the Italian National Olympic Committee of any wrongdoing in the 2007 Giro, and was thus permitted to start.|$|E
