25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

Roosevelt in October 1941, inspired the U.S. government to pour {{millions of dollars into}} the pursuit of an atomic bomb. When George B. Pegram and Harold Urey visited Britain to see how the project, now known as Tube Alloys, was going, Chadwick was able to tell them: [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you that the bomb is not going to work, but I am 90 per cent sure that it will." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, it was {{announced}} that Paul Reubens was working with Judd Apatow on a new Pee-wee Herman feature film set up at Universal Pictures, with Reubens and Paul Rust set to write the script. In an October 2014, interview with Rolling Stone, Reubens gave an update on the status of the film, saying: [...] "It's been months and months of being right {{on the verge of being}} announced…I thought something was going to go public yesterday, actually, and that you’d be the first person I’d be talking about this with. But I’m thinking there will be something made public very soon. It's going to get made shortly after the new year. I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you about it right now, because…I mean, it's amazing. It's going to be amazing. It think it first got leaked four years ago or so that the movie was going to be made, and ever since then it's just been stalling and stalling. So I'm really ready for this to happen. But I’m not kidding: It's very imminent." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{her teenage}} years, she {{was locked up}} in a Nigerian prison cell because of her femininity. Being imprisoned {{encouraged}} her to leave Nigeria, if she could not have left, the other option was to finally succeed in ending her life. She remembered her experiences in this poignant piece she wrote for Gay Star News on Transgender Day of Remembrance on 20 November 2013, which was re-published by some online news outlets:I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> the younger me who tried to commit suicide twice that life gets better and dreams do honestly come through. [...] I did not imagine life could be this amazing many years ago after being released from a horrid Nigerian prison for being different. Then all I could think was I could die in this prison and no one will know or care. [...] Being imprisoned felt justifiable, considering I was being punished for being 'gay' as they assumed due to my feminine features and mannerisms. [...] I wasn't gay, I am a woman born differently due to natural defects. What I felt did not match my outward appearance. Being assigned male at birth doesn't make me a man or a woman, nobody was born a man or a woman, you are born male or female, then you develop into your preferred gender as you grow up thus making you a man or a woman. For me that gender was female. I was born male but my brain, gestures, features and carriage functioned as that of a female. Growing up and not knowing what was happening to my body made me confused and lost. I couldn't discuss it with my family because my femininity was frowned upon due to religion and I could not talk to my friends because they would not understand what I was going through. I found solace in music and dreams. I dreamt of being free to be myself, free of insults, free of judgment and free from harassments. Her experience with the Nigerian police made her to seek [...] in London, United Kingdom.|$|E

I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you how my heart drooped, and all but fainted, as I felt that he must leave me for ever. I am a married woman, and it was needful that he should go." [...] After this there was a slight pause, and then she added: [...] "Now, Sir Henry, I think you know it all. Now may I go?" ...|$|E

It would be hard, dreadfully hard, on {{either of them}} to know that he was not our son; and henceforth I will, like you, try to give up <b>wishing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> which is which.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} the woman is insane or ignorant. I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> whether {{she was trying to}} make me angry for the benefit of those horrid unshaven men, or merely for her private edification." ...|$|E

60|$|And what a sight it was, {{the leaves}} shining and glistening {{like so many}} jewels in the sunlight! <b>I</b> only <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you how {{beautiful}} that garden was.

The servant, who had travelled so long and so far, could see it plainly from where he stood, and he did not need to be told that it was the fruit of happiness. But, after all, all he could do was to stand and look, for in front of them was a great raging torrent, without a bridge for a body to cross over.|$|R
60|$|On the {{afternoon}} of his expected arrival I lingered about for hours in the orchard, hoping {{to catch a glimpse}} of him, for the gates of the park, opposite our house, were the nearest to Mellborough Station. But I was disappointed. He came, it is true, but in a closed brougham, drawn by a pair of swift, high-stepping bays, which swept like a flash by the hedge over which I was looking, leaving a confused recollection of glistening harness, handsome liveries, and a dark, noble face, partly turned towards me, but imperfectly seen. It was a glimpse which only increased my interest; yet how to gratify my curiosity in view of my mother's <b>wishes</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} very good to me," [...] said she, rising and making a step towards him, but {{suddenly}} stopping on account of her bare feet, [...] "and I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you how thankful I am to you.

6000|$|... "Ah!

But now look at the view; is it not beautiful in the sunlight? All the world seems to be rejoicing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Arthur {{rose to his}} feet, and then, {{leaning against}} the mantel-board, {{buried his face in}} his hands.

[...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you why, but I can't; you wouldn't understand!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head, perplexed. 'Owen, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> you <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> me more. <b>I</b> {{do not like}} debts.

[...] "But {{she was well}} when I last saw her. She endured the hard journey better than either Nell or I. Girty did not carry her into the encampment, as Silvertip did Joe and me, but the renegade left us {{on the outskirts of}} the Delaware town. There was a rocky ravine with dense undergrowth where he disappeared with his captive. I suppose he has his den somewhere in that ravine." ...|$|R

"You cannot {{wonder that}} we should be so anxious about Frank, Dr Thorne; an only son, and the heir to an estate that has been so very long in the family:" [...] and Lady Arabella put her {{handkerchief}} to her eyes, as though these facts were in themselves melancholy, and not to be thought of by a mother without some soft tears.
