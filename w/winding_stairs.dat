The Temple {{measured}} 60 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high, and had a portico 20 cubits long and 10 cubits deep. Its windows were broad within and narrow without. Along the Temple's wall all around were side-structures and side-chambers, with the lowest story of the side-structure 5 cubits broad, the middle 6 cubits broad, and the third story 7 cubits broad, and recesses ringed the outside wall. The Temple was built from stone made ready at the quarry, and no hammer, ax, or other iron tool was heard at the building site. The door for the lowest story of side-chambers {{was on the right}} side of the Temple, and <b>winding</b> <b>stairs</b> went into the middle story and out into the third. So Solomon built the Temple and finished it with planks of cedar over beams, with all the Temple resting on cedar timbers.|$|E

60|$|He {{remembered how}} some of the castle women were {{standing}} in a frightened group upon the landing of the stairs, talking together in low voices about a matter he did not understand, excepting that the armed men who had ridden into the courtyard had come for Sir John Dale.

60|$|We {{stood before}} an obelisk-idol, so towering, that gazing at it, we were fain to throw back our heads.

We were then well down under the precipice, but still considerably above the level of the river.|$|E
