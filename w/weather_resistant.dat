5|$|The breed {{became more}} popular still {{following}} the French Revolution and the aftermath in which hunting {{was no longer}} restricted to the nobility. Although spread throughout France, a large concentration was located in the north west where the <b>weather</b> <b>resistant</b> coat of the breed made it ideal for the wooded and swampy conditions. During the early 19th century, British hunters crossed the channel to hunt in the grounds of north west France. The British brought their own hunting dogs, and {{this resulted in a}} change of preference as French hunters switched to English breeds and caused a major blow to the existence of the Picardy Spaniel. In addition the infusion of blood from the English Setter into the local spaniel population created the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|They have a white {{double coat}} which {{requires}} regular brushing {{with a wire}} comb {{in order to prevent}} matting. It has a dense undercoat, while the outer coat is wiry and <b>weather</b> <b>resistant.</b> Markings on the face can be in a variety of colours including lemon, black, brown, blue, and badger, which is a mix of brown and black. Heavy body markings or patches or excessive ticking on the coat are discouraged. Sealyhams are low to the ground, and in muddy weather their long coats can become quite dirty. Sealyham coats are groomed by hand stripping, {{in order to keep the}} coat from becoming too soft.|$|E
5|$|The Picardy Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{developed}} in France {{for use as}} a gundog. It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds. It is thought {{to be one of the}} two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its <b>weather</b> <b>resistant</b> coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain. However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century. Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears, it can be prone to ear infections.|$|E

40|$|The {{self-cleaning}} {{property of}} building materials {{is a much}} desirable function. It not only improves the aesthetic appearance of the building, but also effectively reduces the costs of routine maintenance. Normally, titanium dioxide (TiO 2) incorporated cementitious materials display multiple photocatalytic functions, including the self-cleaning ability. However, attaining a photocatalytic functional building product with both a high photocatalytic efficiency and a robust <b>weathering</b> <b>resistant</b> ability still remains challenging. This study investigated the strategy of directly applying a TiO 2 containing paint (clear in colour) {{on the surface of}} self-compacting architectural mortars (SCAM). Its self-cleaning (in terms of rhodamine b (RhB) degradation) and <b>weathering</b> <b>resistant</b> ability (accelerated façade weathering) were evaluated under both Ultraviolet-A (UV-A) and visible light irradiation. For comparison, 5 % P 25 -TiO 2 -intermixed and dip-coated SCAM samples were also prepared and tested. The results showed that the TiO 2 paint coated SCAM sample displayed both a high photocatalytic RhB removal ability and a robust weathering resistance under all conditions. In contrast, the 5 % P 25 -TiO 2 -intermixed samples only achieved a significantly lower RhB removal efficiency. Although the P 25 -TiO 2 -coated SCAM delivered a satisfactory self-cleaning performance, it suffered a significant loss in the RhB abatement after subjecting to the façade weathering process. The overall results suggest that the TiO 2 coated SCAM {{has the potential to be}} used as a resource and energy efficient product for air-purifying and self-cleaning applications.

50|$|The Flint Hills {{developed}} on the north-south exposure of Permian cherty limestones. The region extends from Marshall County in the north, to Cowley County {{and on into}} northern Oklahoma where they are known as the Osage Hills. The Permian limestones contain abundant <b>weathering</b> <b>resistant</b> chert (or flint) and the residuum and soils of the hilltops and the streambeds of the region contain abundant cherty gravels. Surface exposures of the rare igneous kimberlites occur in Riley and Marshall counties. The kimberlite diatremes are of Cretaceous age.

2500|$|The cliffs {{along the}} Delaware River, known as Nockamixon Cliffs, appear {{to rise from}} the land, but are in fact {{formations}} of very hard stone that have eroded at a much slower pace than the surrounding land. These cliffs are made of <b>weather</b> <b>resistant</b> rock called hornfel, formed {{at the end of the}} Triassic Period when magma rose up from deep within the Earth's crust and flowed into beds of sedimentary rock.

2500|$|Buff coats {{were made}} in {{sleeveless}} and sleeved variants and were garments typically crafted from cowhide or buffalo hide. The very finest buff coats were made of elk-hide. Buff leather was produced by a method of [...] "oil tanning"; following treatment with lime the hide was scraped to remove the outer layer which gave the finished product a matt surface. The hide then had cod oil worked into it in a process called [...] "kicking" [...] and was finally air-dried. The oiling and drying steps could be repeated. The finished leather attained its characteristic buff colour and was supple, durable and <b>weather</b> <b>resistant.</b>|$|E
40|$|There is {{an urgent}} {{requirement}} {{to examine the}} quality of harvested rainwater for potable and non-potable purposes, based {{on the type of}} roofing material. In this study, we examined the effect on the quality of harvested rainwater of conventional roofing materials (concrete, asphalt and ceramic tile roofs) compared with alternative roofing materials (green roof). The results showed that the ceramic tile roof was the most suitable for rainwater-harvesting applications because of the lower concentrations of leachable pollutants. However, in this study, the green roof was not suitable for rainwater harvesting applications. In addition, seasonal trends in water quality parameters showed that pollutants in roof runoff in summer and autumn were lower than those in winter and spring. This study revealed that the quality of harvested rainwater was significantly affected by the roofing material; therefore, local government and urban planners should develop stricter testing programs and produce more <b>weathering</b> <b>resistant</b> roofing materials to allow the harvesting of rainwater for domestic and public uses.

2500|$|The {{origin of}} Chauncey Peak and the Metacomet Ridge dates back 200 {{million years ago}} with the rifting apart of North America from Eurasia in the process that would {{ultimately}} create the Atlantic Ocean. In the area that is now the Metacomet Ridge and surrounding sedimentary rock basin, massive basalt (traprock) lava flows spread across the prehistoric rift valley, some of them several hundred feet thick, over a period of 20 million years. [...] Sediment accumulated between lava flows and lithified into sedimentary rock. [...] After the rifting processes ceased, layers of strata faulted and tilted upward. Subsequent erosion, glaciation, and uplift exposed the <b>weather</b> <b>resistant</b> edge of the traprock lava sheets, creating the cliffline of the Metacomet Ridge as it is today. The mineral content and the shape of the ridge make possible a variety of microclimate ecosystems. Hot and dry cliff faces support plant and animal species uncommon so far north. Deeply gouged ravines support cooler climate species found in more northerly climes, while gradual backslope environments support species typical of the surrounding latitude. Talus slopes beneath cliffs accumulate minerals that support alkaline-loving plant species uncommon in surrounding acidic southern New England. Extensive cliffs provide ideal habitat and important migration corridors for raptor species.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the micromagnetic properties of hemo-ilmenite particles in an alluvial soil. All magnetic accessory minerals except the <b>weathering</b> <b>resistant</b> hemo-ilmenite grains {{were removed from}} the soil matrix by chemical treatment with concentrated acid followed by magnetic separation. X-ray diffraction revealed hemo-ilmenite grains with single crystal properties and an ilmenite mole fraction of y = 0. 86. Magnetization versus applied magnetic field plots in a temperature range between 6 and 300 K were recorded in order to study the hysteresis and the exchange properties. In addition, field and frequency-dependent AC susceptibility measurements were performed with and without a DC bias field in order to analyse the dynamic magnetization of the sample down to 3 K. The hemo-ilmenite particles are considered as a mixed system with nano-sized cation-ordered areas (COA) and cation-disordered areas (CDA), which differ in their local Fe(III) concentration. Ferrimagnetic single-domain order in the Fe(III) -enriched CDA started at about 220 K. Upon cooling gradual transdomain transformation generates multidomain order. A maximum in the blocking distribution was reached at 44 K, followed by the onset of spin-glass dynamics. At lower temperature, blocking of superparamagnetic clusters in the COA created antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering, which became more prominent with decreasing temperature. The interaction between the spin-glass like CDA and the AFM areas was documented by the onset of exchange bias at T < 20 K. The occurrence of exchange bias as well as spin-glass dynamics in the hemo-ilmenite grains is probably an effect of the inhomogeneity of the local Fe(III) concentration. This effect leaves a magnetically competitive regime with areas showing ilmenite-like magnetic properties, and Fe(III) rich disordered areas with magnetic long-range ordering up to 220 K and frustration near the ordering temperature of ilmenit...|$|R
