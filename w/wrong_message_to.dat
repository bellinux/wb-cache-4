2500|$|The {{amount and}} quality of sleep {{experienced}} in space is poor due to highly variable light and dark cycles on flight decks and poor illumination during daytime hours in the space craft. Even the habit of looking {{out of the window}} before retiring can send the <b>wrong</b> <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> the brain, resulting in poor sleep patterns. These disturbances in circadian rhythm have profound effects on the neurobehavioural responses of crew and aggravate the psychological stresses they already experience (see Fatigue and sleep loss during spaceflight for more information). Sleep is disturbed on the ISS regularly due to mission demands, such as the scheduling of incoming or departing space vehicles. Sound levels in the station are unavoidably high because the atmosphere is unable to thermosiphon; fans are required at all times to allow processing of the atmosphere, which would stagnate in the freefall (zero-g) environment. Fifty percent of space shuttle astronauts take sleeping pills and still get 2 hours less sleep each night in space than they do on the ground. NASA is researching two areas which may provide the keys to a better night’s sleep, as improved sleep decreases fatigue and increases daytime productivity. [...] A variety of methods for combating this phenomenon are constantly under discussion.|$|R
5000|$|In {{terms of}} {{business}} and home security, target hardening {{is one of the}} suite of protective measures that are included in crime prevention through environmental design. This can include ensuring all doors and windows are sourced and fitted {{in such a way that}} they can resist forcible and surreptitious intruder attack, adding hard barriers and landscapes that resist vehicle and pedestrian intrusion, adding fences, walls and hostile planting. All of which is greatly assisted by removing or pruning any trees or bushes that could offer suitable hiding places or could be used to climb to a higher level of the property.

40|$|We {{consider}} secure multi-party computation (MPC) in {{a setting}} where the adversary can separately corrupt not only the parties (nodes) but also the communication channels (edges), and can furthermore choose selectively and adaptively which edges or nodes to corrupt. Note that if an adversary corrupts an edge, even if the two nodes that share that edge are honest, the adversary can control the link and thus deliver <b>wrong</b> <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> both players. We consider this question in the information-theoretic setting, and require security against a computationally unbounded adversary. In a fully connected network the above question is simple (and we also provide an answer that is optimal up to a constant factor). What makes the problem more challenging is to {{consider the case of}} sparse networks. Partially connected networks are far more realistic than fully connected networks, which led Garay and Ostrovsky [Eurocrypt’ 08] to formulate the notion of (unconditional) almost everywhere (a. e.) secure computation in the node-corruption model, i. e., a model in which not all pairs of nodes are connected by secure channels and the adversary can corrupt some of the nodes (but not the edges). In such a setting, MPC amongst all honest nodes cannot be guaranteed due to the possible poor connectivity of some honest nodes with other honest nodes, and hence som...|$|R

The framework is useful for examining frequent claims that harm reduction "sends the <b>wrong</b> <b>message.</b> " Opposition <b>to</b> harm reduction is based in part on a recognition of potential trade-offs among the strategies, but it is also fueled by several more symbolic psychological factors.

However upon her second stint that saw Leanne accepting towards Nicole and Maia's relationship, Ludlam believed that the character had been toned down and found portraying the character to be [...] "a lot less fun". Leanne's mispronunciation of Ula Levi's (Frankie Adams) name as [...] "Ew-la" [...] became a running joke throughout the cast and crew, with a 2015 scene showing Ula correcting her after many months, receiving much praise by the audience. Karima Madut praised the relationship between Leanne and her character fellow receptionist Clementine Dean, [...] "They are a great team, I guess Leanne is more the older, wiser woman and they develop a great relationship. My character looks {{up to her and}} she learns to not become more subdued, but she starts to become more thoughtful." [...] The character proved hugely controversial upon her debut April 2010 after several homophobic comments she made were perceived to be insulting the city of Tauranga in suggesting it was not gay friendly. The controversy surrounded Leanne telling Gerald Tippett (Harry McNaughton) that his shirt was [...] "too gay" [...] for Tauranga. The episode also featured Nicole referring to the city as not being as gay friendly as Auckland. Bay of Plenty Tourism general manager, Tim Burgess believed the show was establishing a [...] "negative stereotype," [...] and that the, [...] "only positive thing I can say is they were pronouncing Tauranga and Mauao correctly." [...] In response to the episode he referred to the writing team as [...] "disappointing and lazy." [...] Burgess also requested an apology. Matthew Denton of the University of Auckland student magazine, Craccum, named Leanne as the shows 5th most annoying character. He attributed this to her blatant homophobia and the irony of this due to her disregard for relationships after attempting to seduce married man Murray Cooper (Matthew Chamberlain). Leanne's homophobia again drew controversy in 2017, with a stuff.co.nz columnist believing it was sending the <b>wrong</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> young watchers.
