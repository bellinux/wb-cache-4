5|$|By {{the early}} 14th century, before the {{outbreak}} of the Black Death, the town of Clare had a population of around 600. The de Clares continued to own estates across England, but in Suffolk their possessions were concentrated in estates clustered around Clare Castle. The castle was passed through the de Clare line until Gilbert de Clare died at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314, when the estate passed onto his sisters. Elizabeth de Clare, <b>whose</b> <b>husband</b> John de Burgh had died the previous year, acquired the castle; the combined estates made Elizabeth one of the wealthiest women in England. Elizabeth used the castle as her main residence between 1322 and 1360.|$|E
5|$|In Priyadas' biography, Tulsidas is {{attributed}} {{with the power}} of working miracles. In one such miracle, he is believed to have brought back a dead Brahmin to life. While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas on the way who addressed her as Saubhagyavati (a woman <b>whose</b> <b>husband</b> is alive). The widow told Tulsidas her husband had just died, so his words could not be true. Tulsidas said that the word has passed his lips and so he would restore the dead man to life. He asked everybody present to close their eyes and uttered the name of lord Rama, on doing which the dead Brahmin was raised back to life.|$|E

They did, however, allow any woman who was married to an ex-helot but <b>whose</b> <b>husband</b> was in exile to join him.|$|E

5|$|President Andrew Johnson {{appointed}} Ewing as U.S. Minister to Holland, {{where he}} served from 1866 to 1870. This appointment may have drawn the ire of the Radical Republicans, for Speaker of the House James G. Blaine urged President Ulysses S. Grant that Ewing be recalled and replaced with his brother, Charles Ewing. Blaine told the President that Hugh was 'acting badly'. Blaine himself was disingenuous, having represented to prominent politicians in Ohio including Senator John Sherman {{that he was doing}} everything possible to nominate his close personal friend, former Ohio General Roeliff Brinkerhoff, for the post. Nonetheless, Blaine's request to recall General Ewing was never acted upon, possibly due to the influence of his sister, <b>whose</b> <b>husband</b> General Sherman was a very close friend to President Grant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} {{of domestic violence}} remains unacceptably high with numerous consequences ranging from psychological to maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity outcomes in pregnant women. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify factors that increased the likelihood of an event of domestic violence as reported by ever married Ghanaian women. Methods Data from the 2008 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) was analysed using a multivariate logistic model and risk factors were obtained using the forward selection procedure. Results Of the 1524 ever married women in this study, 33. 6  % had ever experienced domestic violence. The risk of ever experiencing domestic violence was 35  % for women who reside in urban areas. Risk of domestic violence was 41  % higher for women <b>whose</b> <b>husbands</b> ever experienced their father beating their mother. Women whose mother ever beat their father were three times more likely to experience domestic violence as compared to women whose mother did not beat their father. The risk of ever experiencing domestic violence was 48  % less likely for women <b>whose</b> <b>husbands</b> had higher than secondary education as compared to women <b>whose</b> <b>husbands</b> never had any formal education. Women <b>whose</b> <b>husbands</b> drink alcohol were 2. 5 times more likely to experience domestic violence as compared to women <b>whose</b> <b>husbands</b> do not drink alcohol. Conclusion Place of residence, alcohol use by husband and family history of violence do increase a woman’s risk of ever experiencing domestic violence. Higher than secondary education acted as a protective buffer against domestic violence. Domestic violence against women is still persistent and greater efforts should be channelled into curtailing it by using a multi-stakeholder approach and enforcing stricter punishments to perpetrators...|$|R
