In order to develop rolled magnesium alloy sheet having excellent plastic formability, the authors attempted the grain refinement and randomization of the rolling texture of the alloy by means of surface modification utilizing wet-type shot blast (<b>wet</b> <b>blast)</b> and subsequent annealing. Then the microstructural observations including texture analysis and tensile tests were carried out. Furthermore, the bendability and stretch formability were investigated. After <b>wet</b> <b>blast</b> and subsequent annealing at 573 K for 1 h, the region of 50 µm depth from the sheet surface that experienced deformation by <b>wet</b> <b>blast</b> is recrystallized, and fine and equiaxed grains are generated. Although rolling texture remained in {{the central part of}} the sheet, the recrystallized grains near the surface of such specimens have random crystallographic orientation. The tensile strengths of both rolled and wet-blasted specimens are almost the same but the elongation of the latter increases due to grain refinement and randomization of crystallographic orientation. Such a microstructural feature realizes bending with the radius of 1 mm without cracks and wrinkles and leads to an increase in limiting stretching depth by 1. 5 ~ 2 mm...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, <b>wet</b> <b>blasting</b> is {{generally}} used such as liquid honing and water jet machining in surface before plating of stainless steel. The outstanding feature of <b>wet</b> <b>blasting</b> {{is to prevent}} generation of static electric charge, to use micro abrasive grain, and to have cushioning for workpiece.

Moreover, the using abrasive grain is available on a limited basis. In particular, improvement disposal of liquid waste under processing is crucial in the near future. This paper makes proposal for improvement of surface texture by utilizing dry blasting, and it conducts improvement of surface texture about martensite stainless steel (SUS 420 J 2 In JIS), which is used in material for scale applications.

50|$|Process speeds are {{generally}} not as fast as conventional dry abrasive blasting when using the equivalent size and type of media. However the presence of water between {{the media and the}} substrate being processed creates a lubricating cushion that can protect both the media and the surface from excess damage. This has the dual advantage of lowering media breakdown rates and preventing impregnation of foreign materials into the surface. Hence surfaces after <b>wet</b> <b>blasting</b> are extremely clean, there is no embedded secondary contamination from the media or from previous blasting processes, and there is no static cling of dust to the blasted surface. Subsequent coating or bonding operations are not effected by the use of <b>wet</b> <b>blasting</b> or dry blasting because of the cleanliness levels achieved are identical. However <b>wet</b> <b>blasting</b> of mild steel will result in immediate or 'flash' corrosion of the blasted steel substrate due to the presence of water. The lack of surface recontamination also allows the use of single equipment for multiple blasting operations—e.g., stainless steel and carbon (mild) steel items can be processed in the same equipment with the same media without problems.|$|R

40|$|Recently, <b>wet</b> sand <b>blasting</b> on coated {{cutting tool}} inserts has drawn {{interest}} to the tooling industry due to its positive effects on cutting performance and tool life. This performance boost has partly been attributed to the buildup of compressive residual stresses in the coating during the blasting process. However, the mechanism of forming residual stresses in ceramic coatings during sand blasting is not fully understood. This work utilize x-ray diffraction as the main tool to study the formation and relaxation of residual stresses after <b>wet</b> sand <b>blasting</b> and annealing on 001, 012 and 110 textured α-Al 2 O 3 coatings. To minimize the influence of stress gradients in the samples, all stress measurements were set up with a fixed analysis depth of 2 µm. Sand blasting was made with an alumina based slurry at 2, 3. 2 and 4 bar pressure and the anneal was done at temperatures from 400 to 1000 °C for 2 hours or more. The coating hardness was evaluated by nanoindentation. Finally, the activation energy for the relaxation of residual stresses was estimated using the Zener-Wert-Avrami function. The results reveal the highest compressive residual stress with up to - 5. 3 GPa for the 012 texture while the stresses for the 001 and 110 textures peaked at - 3. 1 and - 2. 0 GPa, respectively. Further, a hardness gradient was present after blasting of the 001 and 012 textured samples indicating a higher stress at {{the surface of the}} coating. The 110 textured sample is the most brittle resulting in flaking of the coating during sand blasting. The different deformation mechanisms are related to difference in active slip planes between coatings with different textures. Both the stress and hardness decreased after heat treatment and the activation energy for stress relaxation was found to be as 1. 1 ± 0. 3 eV, 1. 9 ± 0. 2 eV and 1. 2 ± 0. 1 eV for the 001, 012 and 110 textures, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The Penrice Quarry in South Australia mines {{chemically}} pure marble {{for use in}} the chemical industry. The Quarry's major customer is the Penrice Soda Products plant at Osborne, S. A., where 508, 000 tonnes of high grade marble are used per annum. The marble is burnt in vertical shaft kilns (calcining) as part of the Solvay Process for soda ash (sodium carbonate) manufacture. Since early 1993 the kilns operations have been plagued by elevated kiln pressures coupled with the production of undesirable wastes called 'grits' (i. e. fine grained, partly calcined marble). These undesirable operating parameters and end products create limitations within the kilns plant and ultimately affect the down stream production of soda ash. It is known that the Penrice marble, although {{chemically pure}}, does not always behave ideally during calcining as it often has a tendency to disintegrate in the kilns. This disintegration, termed 'decrepitation', generates excessive amounts of granular material that interferes with the airflow updraft in the kilns. This results in elevated kiln pressures, increases in 'grits' production and difficulties in controlling other operating parameters. Given these criteria, it was apparent that this decrepitation had been the major contributor to these poor kilns performances since early 1993. Consequently, it was decided that a series of new investigations needed to be undertaken to determine: i. The major cause(s) at the quarry of potentially decrepitating marble given that the kilns operations are essentially constant, ii. Why the levels of decrepitation have increased, and iii What changes could be made to current quarry practices to prevent or at least minimise the occurrence of decrepitating marble. These investigations commenced with a break down of the current mining practices at the quarry which indicated that the most significant change to occur was the introduction of new production scheduling procedures (i. e. in-pit blending). Production records showed that since the introduction of these new scheduling procedures a significant proportion of marble for the Osborne plant was sourced from the lower benches in the northern end of the pit. Historically this marble was considered to be of unsuitable grade for the Osborne plant and as such almost all Osborne marble was sourced from {{the southern end of the}} pit. Further investigations indicated that the major difference between the southern and northern ends of the pit was that much of the mining in the northern end of the pit was below the water table and necessitated the use of waterproof explosives (i. e. Handibullc Wet*). For this reason it was decided to engage ICI Explosives to undertake some trial blasts and subsequent photogrammetric analyses to determine the differences between <b>wet</b> and dry <b>blasts</b> and the influence they had on the production of potentially decrepitating marble. The trials showed that both wet and dry hole blasts produced structurally weak marble around the explosive column in the blastholes, which was subsequently termed 'blast affected marble'. The main finding of the blasting trials was that <b>wet</b> hole <b>blasting</b> (Handibulk <b>Wet)</b> produced 6. 6 per cent blast affected marble while dry hole blasting (ANFO) produced only 1. 5 per cent. These results suggested that the increase in decrepitation and therefore poor kiln performances were linked to an increase in the utilisation of low strength (i. e. blast affected) marble as a result of increased <b>wet</b> hole <b>blasting.</b> Petrographic analyses were undertaken by the author in an effort to understand the nature and intensity of the fracture systems produced via blasting and how those findings could be related to blasting practices. Some point load strength tests were also conducted in order to gain an appreciation of the degree of strength loss produced between heavily blast affected marble and marble unaffected by blasting. Blend changes incorporating less marble from the northern end of the pit have helped to alleviate the problem while further work is continuing into alternative explosive types and dewatering methods within the lower benches of the pit to enable ANFO type explosives to be used...|$|R

Three subprimal cuts - ribeye rolls (n = 90), strip loins (n = 90), and sirloins (n = 90) - were utilized with three replications of five samples per treatment per week (total of 9 weeks, N = 270). Blast freezing occurred by placing spacers between the boxes of meat on pallets at - 28 ° C with high air velocity for 3 – 5 d until all the meat was frozen, and then the pallets were moved to a - 28 °C freezer for storage. Conventional freezing occurred with boxes of meat stacked on pallets {{and placed in a}} - 28 ° C freezer with minimal air movement, the pallets were left in the freezer until shipping. Fast thawing of subprimals (to an internal temperature of - 2 ° to 0 ° C) occurred by immersion in a circulating water bath (3 ̆c 12 ° C) for 21 hrs, and slow thawing of subprimals occurred over a two week period by placing individual subprimals on tables at 0 ° C. Purge loss was measured after thawing. Steaks (2. 5 cm thick) were cut from the longissimus thoracis (LT), longissimus lumborum (LL), and gluteus medius (GM) for Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBS) and trained sensory evaluation. Sensory samples were rated for tenderness, juiciness, connective tissue, and off-flavor after cooking to 71 ° C. Slow thawed subprimals had the greatest amount of purge loss (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) in the LT, LL and GM. Fast thawed subprimals were equal or had less purge loss to fresh-never-frozen 14 - and 21 -d aged subprimals (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) in the LT, LL and GM. For LL and GM steaks, frozen treatments were equal or lower in WBS values to fresh-never-frozen 14 - and 21 -d aged steaks. For LL and LT steaks, slow thawed steaks we equal or lower in WBS when compared to fast thawed steaks (P = 0. 01). No differences were detected in WBS among the GM steaks (P = 0. 08). There were no differences in sensory tenderness within the LL, LT, and GM (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). Juiciness in the LL and GM (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) did not differ among treatments. The LT fresh-never-frozen 14 - and 21 -d aged product was juicier than the frozen product (P = 0. 001). Differences were not detected in connective tissue in the LT or GM (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). A greater amount of connective tissue was detected in the slow thawed LL compared to the fast thawed LL (P = 0. 02). There were no differences in off-flavor in the LT and LL (P 3 ̆e 0. 05).

40|$|Iron {{industry}} generated numerous by-products {{that are}} now found in brownfields after activity suspension. Among them, sludge resulting from scrubber <b>wet</b> cleaning of <b>blast</b> furnace fumes was not often recycled because of its composition in Zn, Pb, Cd and alkali metals but dumped into settling ponds. In the Lorraine region (North-East of France) the quantity of iron industry sludge in ponds is estimated at 2106 tons. After dumping suspension, some ponds have been colonized by vegetation despite the potentially polluting compounds, e. g. heavy metals or cyanides, they contain [1]. This development of vegetation may suggest a rather low bioavailability and mobility of metals in the soil. With the aim of confirming and explaining this hypothesis, a former settling pond was investigated by characterizing the properties of materials and the dynamic of metals in the soil. This pond (Frouard, Lorraine) mainly received blast furnace sludge until the mid- 20 th century and is nowadays covered by a diversified forest. The soil is composed of contrasted layers and a 20 cm organic layer has developed at its surface [2]. To monitor metal fluxes through the soil, two lysimeters (2 m deep – 1 m² in area) were sampled in the pond and installed in the GISFI experimental station under real climatic conditions ([URL] Homécourt, Lorraine). The percolates were quantified and analysed. To characterize the materials, twelve samples were collected in different layers along the profile resulting from the extraction of one lysimeter. Chemical and mineralogical characterizations were carried out to determine metal speciation. Physical and hydraulic parameters, e. g. specific surface area, porosity and water retention were measured to characterize solute transport. Elemental composition was dominated by Fe, Mn, Ca and Si with very high contents of heavy metals, up to 10 wt% and 8 wt% for Pb and Zn respectively. The soil was slightly alkaline (5 - 30 wt% carbonate). Cation exchange capacity was quite high (24 - 83 cmol+ kg- 1). Mineralogy was characterized by poorly crystalline and reactive phases, mainly aluminosilicates, Fe and Mn (hydr) oxides and carbonates. Main bearing phases of Pb and Zn were poorly crystalline Mn oxides and aluminosilicates. Physical and hydraulic properties were characterized by a low bulk density (0. 2 - 0. 7 g cm- 3), a high total porosity (75 - 92 % (v/v)) dominated by micropores, a strong water retention capacity and a high specific surface area (50 - 300 m² g- 1). The presence of reactive mineral phases, known to bear metals, the alkaline conditions and the microporous structure of the materials favoured a low availability and mobility of metals.

The studied pond (Frouard, North-Eastern France) received mainly blast furnace sludge until the mid- 20 th century and is nowadays covered by a diversified forest. To monitor the flows of metals through the soil, two lysimeters (2 m deep – 1 m² in area) were sampled in the pond and installed in the GISFI experimental station ([URL] Homécourt, North-Eastern France) under real climatic conditions. The percolates were quantified and analysed. Twelve samples were collected in different layers along the profile resulting from the extraction of one lysimeter. Chemical and mineralogical characterizations were carried out to determine speciation of metals. Physical and hydraulic parameters, e. g. specific surface area, porosity and water retention were measured to characterize phenomena of transport in the soil. In order to study the potential influence of roots on metal mobilization, samples were collected in the surface layer and separated into rhizospheric and bulk soils. Chemical and mineralogical characterizations were carried out on these both fractions. Elemental composition was dominated by Fe, Mn, Ca and Si with very high contents of heavy metals, up to several percents for Pb and Zn. The soil was slightly alkaline with a quite high cation exchange capacity. Mineralogy was characterized by poorly crystalline and reactive phases, mainly aluminosilicates, Fe and Mn (hydr) oxides and carbonates (5 - 30 %). The main physical and hydraulic properties were a low bulk density, a high microporosity, a strong water retention capacity and a high specific surface area. All these properties were favourable to a low mobility of metals, which was rather confirmed by the monitoring of percolates of lysimeters. However, the characterization of the surface layer revealed a higher extractability of metals in the rhizospheric soil than in bulk soil even if the extractible fraction of metals remained low. This may arise the problem of the sustainability of vegetalization as solution of management for such sites...|$|R
