5|$|Another {{formation}} with tyrannosaur {{remains is}} the Lance Formation of Wyoming. This {{has been interpreted}} as a bayou environment similar to today's Gulf Coast. The fauna <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to Hell Creek, but with Struthiomimus replacing its relative Ornithomimus. The small ceratopsian Leptoceratops also lived in the area.|$|E
5|$|Marking Specter's {{entire career}} in the Senate and, indeed, in all his public offices was one {{overriding}} fact: First and foremost, he considered himself essentially a trial attorney rather than a professional politician. During his tenures on Senate committees, his approach to their hearings <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to courtroom examinations of trial witnesses.|$|E
5|$|The 1884 squad <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to the 1882 squad with Alexander, Cooper, Midwinter and Scott {{replacing}} Tom Garrett, Tom Horan, Sammy Jones and Hugh Massie. Cooper and Scott {{were making}} their {{first visit to}} England.|$|E

5|$|After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did {{not return}} to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the Principality of Antioch, the County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their {{acquisitions}} were designed mostly by Syrian master-masons. Their design <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to that of a Roman fort or Byzantine tetrapyrgia which were square in plan and had square towers at each corner that did not project much beyond the curtain wall. The keep of these Crusader castles would have had a square plan and generally be undecorated.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the founders}} of the Tang related to the glory of the earlier Han dynasty (3rd century–3rd century), the basis for much of their {{administrative}} organization <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to the previous Northern and Southern dynasties. The Northern Zhou (6th century) fubing system of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The equal-field system of the Northern Wei (4th–6th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the Punic wars of the 2nd century BC, this form of {{organisation}} was found to be inefficient. In a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, the principes being older veterans with a greater degree of experience. Their equipment and role <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to the previous system, except they now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears. Each princeps also carried two pila, heavy javelins that bent on impact to prevent them being removed from the victim or thrown back.|$|E
5|$|Kingdoms—roughly {{the size}} of commanderies—were ruled {{exclusively}} by the emperor's male relatives as semi-autonomous fiefdoms. Before 157 BC some kingdoms were ruled by non-relatives, granted to them {{in return for their}} services to Emperor Gaozu. The administration of each kingdom <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to that of the central government. Although the emperor appointed the Chancellor of each kingdom, kings appointed all the remaining civil officials in their fiefs.|$|E
5|$|The Accounting Review is a {{bimonthly}} peer-reviewed academic journal covering accounting, and is {{the flagship}} journal of the American Accounting Association. Its current Senior Editor is Mark L. DeFond (University of Southern California).

5|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviewssome critics {{claimed it}} was fresh and a new sound, while others argued it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to music already available. Desolate North has an extremely slow rhythm and has only limited vocals. The music is interspersed with various woodland sounds, such as running water and footsteps. The natural imagery used on the album is reminiscent of that used in black metal, but the music is closer to ambient.|$|E
5|$|The hemmema's design <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> {{to that of}} the turuma. The primary {{difference}} was that the turuma's oarsmen sat on the weather deck above the guns, whereas the hemmema's oarsmen sat on the gundeck. The later hemmemas were considerably larger, more heavily armed, and of a more robust construction. Glete has described them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs.|$|E
5|$|The turuma's design <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> {{to one of}} {{the other}} types of {{archipelago}} frigates, the hemmema. The primary difference was that hemmemas were rowed from the gundeck, providing the oarsmen with better leverage by placing them closer to the waterline. The later hemmemas were also considerably larger, more heavily armed and of a more robust construction. Naval historian Jan Glete has gone as describing them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs. The crew varied between 220 and 266, depending on the model. Between 128 and 152 of these were required to man all the oars.|$|E

5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen Sarah Jane being captured by an alien, who uses her DNA to impersonate her, and frame her for stealing an important piece of alien merchandise. Sarah would have used her gadgets to fight her clone. This story however, <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to Sarah Jane in Prison, so it was scrapped.|$|E
5|$|An HDF {{counterpart}} {{in the southern}} celestial hemisphere was created in 1998: the HDF-South. Created using a similar observing strategy, the HDF-S <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> in appearance to the original HDF. This supports the cosmological principle that at its largest scale the Universe is homogeneous. The HDF-S survey used the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instruments installed on the HST in 1997; the Hubble Deep Field has since been re-observed several times using WFPC2, {{as well as by}} the NICMOS and STIS instruments. Several supernova events were detected by comparing the first and second epoch observations of the HDF-N.|$|E
5|$|The five-storey City Terminus Hotel, which fronted the station, {{was opened}} in May 1867. It was an Italianate style hotel and forecourt, {{designed}} by E. M. Barry, and it provided {{many of the}} station's passenger facilities, {{as well as an}} appropriate architectural frontispiece to the street. This arrangement <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to that put in place at Charing Cross. The hotel was not profitable, and was over £47,000 (now £) in debt by 1870. The City Terminus Hotel was renamed the Cannon Street Hotel in 1879. In July 1920, the hotel was the first meeting point of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Most of the hotel was closed in 1931, but the public rooms were kept open for meetings. The rest were converted into offices and renamed Southern House.|$|E

5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{displacement}} along the Imperial Fault <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to that observed {{for the northern}} part of the rupture during the 1940 El Centro earthquake, although on this occasion the rupture did not extend across the border into Mexico. This had been explained as the behavior of individual slip patches along the Imperial Fault with two patches rupturing in 1940 and only the northern one in 1979. The faulting that gave rise to the earthquake has been modeled by comparing synthetic seismograms with near-source strong motion recordings. This analysis showed that the rupture speed had at times exceeded the shear wave velocity, making this the first earthquake for which supershear rupture was inferred.|$|E
5|$|To unify all weight systems used by apothecaries, the Irish pharmacopœia of 1850 {{introduced}} a new variant of the apothecaries' system which subdivided a new apothecaries' pound of 12 avoirdupois ounces instead of the troy pound. To allow effective use of the new system, new weight pieces were produced. Since an avoirdupois ounce corresponds to 28.35g, the proposed system <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to that in use in Portugal and Spain, and in some locations in Italy. But it would have doubled {{the value of the}} avoirdupois drachm (an existing unit, but by then only used for weighing silk). Therefore, it conflicted with other non-standard variations that were based on that nearly obsolete unit.|$|E
5|$|Although {{details of}} the siege were not recorded, it {{appeared}} to be bloodless. The Byzantine garrison could not expect any help from the humbled regime of Heraclius. After a siege of four months, Sophronius offered to surrender the city and pay a jizya (tribute), on condition that the caliph came to Jerusalem to sign the pact and accept the surrender. It is said that when Sophronius's terms became known to the Muslims, Shurahbil ibn Hassana, one of the Muslim commanders, suggested that instead of waiting for the caliph to come all the way from Madinah, Khalid ibn Walid should be sent forward as the caliph, as he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> in appearance to Umar. The subterfuge did not work. Possibly, Khalid was too famous in Syria, or there may have been Christian Arabs in the city who had visited Madinah and had seen both Umar and Khalid, remembering the differences. Consequently, the Patriarch of Jerusalem refused to negotiate. When Khalid reported the failure of this mission, Abu Ubaidah wrote to caliph Umar about the situation, and invited him to come to Jerusalem to accept the surrender of the city.|$|E
