5|$|Among Madgwick's priorities, in {{addition}} to the mandated extension program, was the expansion of the university's curriculum while orienting it to meet the needs and culture of the New England community. As the first Australian university located in a rural area, Madgwick focused the university's development in the areas of adult education, agriculture, and ranching. These programs <b>would</b> <b>help</b> define the new university.|$|E

5|$|Banking also {{developed}} in this period. The Bank of Scotland was suspected of Jacobite sympathies {{and so a}} rival Royal Bank of Scotland was founded in 1727. Local banks began to be established in burghs like Glasgow and Ayr. These would make capital available for business and the improvement of roads and trade, which <b>would</b> <b>help</b> create the conditions for the Industrial Revolution that accelerated {{in the second half}} of the century.|$|E

5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 365/8, with Evans on 47 not out. Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures, with 4/95.

5|$|England {{declared}} at 8/365 {{after two}} overs {{on the last}} day. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which <b>would</b> <b>help</b> {{to break up the}} wicket and make it more likely to spin. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his belief that such a device would only make batting more difficult.|$|E

5|$|Hardy often {{acted as}} a scout who <b>would</b> <b>help</b> bring {{supplies}} to troops on the front line. On September 25, 1918, he {{was present at the}} Meuse River during a mustard gas attack and, {{at some point during the}} war, he received an injury to his knee. Hardy rarely spoke about the fighting itself, and preferred to talk about France's weather when asked about his experiences overseas.|$|E
5|$|He was {{not only}} {{concerned}} with higher education, but also with primary education, and promoted the creation of free schools for poor children.

5|$|In {{the second}} innings, Loxton took 0/29 from ten overs, and England batted on {{for five minutes}} on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller. This <b>would</b> <b>help</b> {{to break up the}} wicket and make the surface more likely to spin, therefore making life more difficult for Australia’s batsmen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Spanish Civil War, Hitler gave several possible motives for German involvement. Among these were the distraction it provided from German re-militarisation; the prevention of the spread of communism to Western Europe; {{the creation of a}} state friendly to Germany to disrupt Britain and France; and the possibilities for economic expansion. Although the offensive on Madrid was abandoned in March 1937, a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas was supported by Germany; despite prolonging the Civil War, it <b>would</b> <b>help</b> to distract the other western powers from Hitler's ambitions in central Europe. The offensive on Vizcaya, a mining and industrial centre, <b>would</b> <b>help</b> fuel German industry. On 27 June 1937, Hitler (in a speech at Wurzburg) declared he supported Franco to gain control of Spanish ore.|$|E
