25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am <b>writing</b> <b>you</b> all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E
500|$|While Ray Davies {{had been}} {{instructed}} {{at the time}} to write [...] "Beatle-type" [...] material for commercial reasons, [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] was written as a more R composition. The song is centred on a guitar riff by Dave Davies, which has since been referred to as [...] "instantly identifiable." [...] American musicologist Robert Walser described [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] as [...] "the first hit song built around power chords." [...] The song has since been labeled as an early influence of the heavy metal genre, with critic Denise Sullivan of AllMusic <b>writing,</b> <b>You</b> Really Got Me' remains a blueprint song in the hard rock and heavy metal arsenal." [...] However, Dave Davies has since rejected the idea that the song is heavy metal, saying [...] "I've never really like that term, heavy metal. I think, in all humility, it was the first heavy guitar riff rock record. Just because of the sound—if you played it on a ukulele, it might not have been so powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|World Painted Blood {{marked the}} first time that the band wrote {{material}} in the studio rather than entering the studio fully prepared with lyrics. The fact that they were not prepared made guitarist Kerry King skeptical. King related: [...] "I was kind of thinking, 'Man, this could be the first record in a long time that's got a little bit of filler,'" [...] he acknowledges. [...] "But I think every song came out great. I was concerned some would sound similar, and every one is completely different. It's cool how it worked out." [...] The majority of the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. Kerry King stated: [...] "I like when Jeff writes as much as he did for this record. When you have one guy doing most of the <b>writing</b> <b>you</b> only get one perspective. A lot of Jeff's stuff has a very punky vibe this time; the stuff I write sounds thrashy but with a hint of punk, and when Jeff writes the stuff is more punk with a hint of thrash. It works together well." [...] Unlike 2006's Christ Illusion, the band was [...] "under-ready" [...] with their lyrics and music.|$|E

2500|$|December 11: A {{letter to}} Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, dated December 11 and signed [...] "Atiyah" [...] (thought to be Atiyah Abd al-Rahman) is later intercepted and {{publicly}} reported in The Washington Post the following year. The letter indicates that bin Laden and the al-Qaeda leadership were {{based in the}} Waziristan region of Pakistan at the time. In the letter, translated by the United States military's Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, [...] "Atiyah" [...] instructs Zarqawi to [...] "send messengers from your end to Waziristan so that they meet with the brothers of the leadership ... I am now {{on a visit to}} them and I am <b>writing</b> <b>you</b> this letter as I am with them..." [...] Al-Rahman also indicates that bin Laden and al-Qaeda are [...] "weak" [...] and [...] "have many of their own problems."

The plan I'm <b>writing</b> <b>you</b> about has been worked out in detail and is three quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me. I want to cry all the time. My mood is terrible. I've never had one like it before... I don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me to Petrograd. Come down here instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such things to you. But I can't go on any more, I don't know what's the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think. Don't be angry with me, please don't be angry.
