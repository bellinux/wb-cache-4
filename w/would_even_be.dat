In the 20-year span from 1960 to 1989 from the theater standpoint, the majority of cartoons in Hong Kong were imported from the US. It was typical to play American movies in major cinemas preceded by an American cartoon segment. Sometimes the segment <b>would</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> shown in its entirety. An MGM or Disney movie was almost certain to be preceded by another Disney animation.|$|E

In addition to attacking cities and fortifications, these {{would be used to}} help defend Roman forts and fortified camps (castra) as well. They <b>would</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> employed on occasion, especially in the later Empire, as field artillery during battles or in support of river crossings.|$|E

She was sincerely shocked at Julia's conduct, and was most desirous of getting both Malchus and Clotilde away, for she knew that her daughter was headstrong as she was passionate, {{and the presence of}} Clotilde in the house <b>would,</b> <b>even</b> <b>were</b> Malchus absent, be a source of strife and bitterness between herself and her daughter.|$|R

He recalled, [...] "He would have some ideas and I would say, 'Alejandro, we can’t pull this off. It’s not going to work,' and he would say, 'Mark, trust me, we can do this.'

It is unlikely that humanity would meet the basic requirements for membership at its current low level of technological advancement. A galactic club may, William Hamilton speculates, set extremely high entrance requirements that are unlikely to be met by less advanced civilizations.|$|E

Now {{widely regarded as the}} most influential fight in MMA history, the bout took place in what was the first ever MMA event on live and free television. The bout ended in a unanimous decision victory for Griffin and led to the show's renewal on Spike TV. Regarding the success of the show, UFC president Dana White said, [...] "It's amazing to think.... how close we came to not being here today.

500|$|It was {{far from}} certain that Lincoln <b>would</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> {{nominated}} in 1864, let alone re-elected, as the tide of war, though generally favoring the North, washed back and forth. Lincoln sought nomination by the National Union Party, composed of Republicans and War Democrats. [...] No one proved willing to oppose Lincoln, who was nominated. [...] Seward was by then unpopular among many Republicans and opponents sought to prompt his replacement by making Lincoln's running mate former New York Democratic senator Daniel S. Dickinson; under the political customs of the time, one state could not hold two positions as prestigious as vice president and Secretary of State. [...] Administration forces turned back Dickinson's bid, nominating instead Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson, with whom Seward {{had served in the}} Senate. Lincoln was re-elected in November; Seward sat with Lincoln and the assistant presidential secretary, John Hay, as the returns came in.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode an 8.3 out of 10, praising the visual style, {{which he called}} [...] "less glossy" [...] than {{previous}} episodes, {{as well as the}} introduction of new characters and development of old ones, especially the introduction of Carl Creel and the [...] "nicely done FX showing off his power". He did note that the episode [...] "did little to actually give Hunter or Mack [...] " [...] and stated [...] "I don’t really buy that Fitz <b>would</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> there, working alongside the team, at this point. Doesn't he have friends or family he could be with?" [...] Marc Buston for Den of Geek scored the episode 4.5 stars out of 5, feeling that the series had finally reached its potential by incorporating Marvel elements such as Creel and Whitehall, while also creating a darker tone and developing the original characters. He specifically highlighted the changes made to Fitz's character, saying [...] "This lair of tragedy greatly deepens Fitz’s character and gives the comic relief of last season a heartbreaking edge." [...] James Hunt, also for Den of Geek, gave a positive review as well, stating [...] "The momentum of last season's finale hasn't been lost, and indeed, it's even been added to. Last year I criticised the pilot episode for, above all else, failing to recreate the feel of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This year, it's only fair that I praise the season opener for doing exactly that." [...] He did feel, however, that the opening sequence featuring Carter was [...] "by some distance, the most exciting part of the episode". Kevin Fitzpatrick at Screen Crush called the premiere [...] "unexpectedly good", noting that the series [...] "remains as serialized a show as it can over 22 episodes", introducing interesting ideas {{for the rest of the}} season, while also setting a high standard for subsequent episodes to meet. He concluded that the series [...] "definitely seems to have hit a major groove".|$|E

2500|$|Floating {{charges have}} been criticised as a [...] "raw deal" [...] for {{unsecured}} creditors. In Salomon v. Salomon & Co.

2500|$|According to Cabezón and Greenberg, this {{stricture}} is not {{applied to}} lay people, and many Buddhist stories include positive portrayals of non-sexual same-sex relationships.

In some tales they <b>would</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> reincarnated together as animal pairs [...] "ruminating and cuddling together, very happy, head to head, muzzle to muzzle, horn to horn". Although not shown as sexual, these relationships between men are loving, and contrast with the difficult marriages to shrewish wives in many stories. Harvey however, disagress and states {{that this is a}} reference to brotherly love and not a platonic relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{enthusiasm for}} Nikolai Gogol's work became {{reflected}} in both her husband's compositions {{and those of}} his friends. On the day of their betrothal, she and Rimsky-Korsakov read Gogol's short story [...] "May Night" [...] together. Afterwards, {{she told him that}} he should write an opera based on it. A week or two later she wrote him, I've been reading yet another of Gogol's stories today, [...] "The Fair at Sorochyntsi." [...] This is good, too, and <b>would</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> suitable for an opera, but not for you; in any case, it's not like 'May Night.' As for that, it's so stuck in my head that nothing will drive it out. Either she or her sister Alexandra then suggested [...] "The Fair at Sorochyntsi" [...] to Mussorgsky. He did not act on it at the time, but a couple of years later, he reconsidered.|$|E

He also revealed {{that he was in the}} dark about whom Cowell had the intentions of bringing onto the panel. On 14 May 2015, Walsh confirmed his exit from the series, stating, [...] "The truth is I've done it for 11 years; I never thought I <b>would</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> on TV for four or five.

2500|$|The use of {{balloons}} as an air-war mechanism {{was first}} recorded in France by the French Aerostatic Corps at the Battle of Fleurus in 1794. U. S. President Abraham Lincoln {{became interested in}} an air-war mechanism for reconnaissance purposes. This created a notion at the War Department and at the Treasury {{that some sort of}} balloon aviation unit need be established and headed by a [...] "Chief Aeronaut". Several top American balloonists traveled to Washington in hopes of obtaining just such a position. However, there were no proposed details to the establishment of such a unit, or whether it <b>would</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> a military or civilian operation. Nor was there any set method to the process of selecting a Chief Aeronaut, rather it became a free-for-all in attempts {{to attract the attention of}} any officials in either the government or the military. In actuality the use of balloons was left to the discretion of the commanding generals through a process of trial and error based on the best recommendations of the balloonists themselves. Of those seeking the position, only two were given actual opportunities to perform combat aerial reconnaissance, Prof. Thaddeus Lowe and Mr. John LaMountain.|$|E
2500|$|A DVD extra on Heartbreak And Triumph, and in Michaels's {{autobiography}} of the same, titled The Rockers [...] "Fight" [...] reveals {{that they got}} into a legit fight in May 1991 that was instigated by Roddy Piper. The incident according to Michaels happened as the boys were intoxicated, Piper, also drunk, started talking about how Michaels would be an even greater competitor in the business, that he <b>would</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> {{the future of the}} business. Piper stated, that [...] "Michaels had had a great future in the business and that Michaels had all this talent". Jannetty, believing that to be an insult to him challenged Shawn to a fight to which Shawn declined. Marty however, would not take no for answer and attacked Michaels which started the fight. Piper pulled the two apart, and Michaels passed out right after, and wouldn't come to until the next day. The story, told by Jannetty, reveals that police were called to the scene and arrested Jannetty. As they were arresting him though, Randy Savage stepped in and prevented him from going to jail by telling the police that it was all part of a storyline even though in reality he did not know the cause of the fight in the first place. Michaels almost quit the WWF over the incident, and Jannetty believes that this incident was one of the factors in the WWF's decision to break up The Rockers.|$|E
