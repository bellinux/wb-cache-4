5|$|In Greek antiquity {{the ideas}} of {{celestial}} spheres and rings {{first appeared in the}} cosmology of Anaximander in the early 6th century BC. In his cosmology both the Sun and Moon are circular open vents in tubular rings of fire enclosed in tubes of condensed air; these rings constitute the rims of rotating chariot-like wheels pivoting on the Earth at their centre. The fixed stars are also open vents in such <b>wheel</b> <b>rims,</b> {{but there are so many}} such wheels for the stars that their contiguous rims all together form a continuous spherical shell encompassing the Earth. All these <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> had originally been formed out of an original sphere of fire wholly encompassing the Earth, which had disintegrated into many individual rings. Hence, in Anaximanders's cosmogony, in the beginning was the sphere, out of which celestial rings were formed, from some of which the stellar sphere was in turn composed. As viewed from the Earth, the ring of the Sun was highest, that of the Moon was lower, and the sphere of the stars was lowest.|$|E

This article summarized and analyzed force of the forklift's <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> according to the typical working conditions of forklift, and calculated the load of various working conditions. It provided the correct boundary conditions for the finite element analysis of the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> [1]. After the analysis of <b>wheel</b> <b>rim's</b> three typical conditions, found the weak parts {{of the structure of the}} rim, and this part was consistent with the feedback part, so it proved correct of the finite element analysis model. Clever was used ribbed-plate and punching groove to strengthen the weak part of <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> and the finite element model was used to calculate and check the improved <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> again. The results showed that the improved <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> stress decreased quite, so the measure was correct...|$|R

25|$|What bicycle did Moore {{ride in the}} Paris–Rouen race in 1869? There are two {{candidates}} and three or four accounts. Bonneville said that Moore was riding a Suriray bicycle specially built by Tribout, fitted with ball bearings, rubber tyres 48¼-inch and 15¾-inch wheels with metal rims. It was the first high bicycle, said Bonneville, overlooking {{the fact that he}} had elsewhere said the honour belonged to Vibert. The anonymous authors of the series 'Pioneers of the Cycle Industry' in Bicycling News said that Moore rode a heavy wooden Michaux fitted with solid rubber tyres which were secured to the <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> by means of sheet-iron braces screwed to the latter, and his machine embodied a type of ball bearing which had been more or less handmade by a Parisian manufacturer...|$|E
25|$|Races in {{this period}} were heavily nationalistic affairs, with a few {{countries}} setting up races of their own, but no formal championship tying them together. The rules varied {{from country to country}} and race to race, and typically centered on maximum (not minimum) weights in an effort to limit power by limiting engine size indirectly (10–15L engines were quite common, usually with no more than four cylinders, and producing less than 50hp). The cars all had mechanics on board as well as the driver, and no one was allowed to work on the cars during the race except for these two. A key factor to Renault winning this first Grand Prix was held to be the detachable <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> (developed by Michelin), which allowed tire changes to occur without having to lever the tire and tube off and back on the rim. Given the state of the roads, such repairs were frequent.|$|E
500|$|After Anaximenes, Pythagoras, Xenophanes and Parmenides all {{held that}} the {{universe}} was spherical. And much later {{in the fourth century}} BC Plato's Timaeus proposed that the body of the cosmos was made in the most perfect and uniform shape, that of a sphere containing the fixed stars. [...] But it posited that the planets were spherical bodies set in rotating bands or rings rather than <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> as in Anaximander's cosmology.|$|E

40|$|A wheel {{assembly}} for an electric vehicle includes a <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> that is concentrically disposed about a central axis. A propulsion-braking module is disposed within an interior {{region of the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>rim.</b> The propulsion-braking module rotatably supports the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> for rotation about the central axis.

A motor-wheel interface hub is fixedly attached to the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim,</b> and is directly attached to the rotor for rotation with the rotor.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} detect leaks {{on the surface of}} a <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> manufactured by aluminum die casting and forging. Leaks in the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> may be caused by temperature gradient differences during the cooling period, impurities, or flowing air bubbles in the die casting process. We developed a new low-cost approach to detect leaks that only required a short inspection time by observing the movement of soap bubbles on the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> surface. We designed new light sources to minimize mirror image effects and irregular luminance distributions on the curved <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> surface. A preprocessing procedure for image processing was also developed to determine the bubble configurations using threshold and morphology techniques. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the inspection system. The results demonstrated that leaks generated during the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> manufacturing process could be accurately detected even under various environmental lighting conditions...|$|R

2500|$|A popular legend {{that has}} been around since at least 1937 traces the origin of the 1435 mm (4 ft [...] in) gauge even further back than the coalfields of {{northern}} England, pointing to the evidence of rutted roads marked by chariot wheels dating from the Roman Empire. It is curious that the Roman pace or passus was 4.855ft or 1435mm; a thousand such was one Roman mile. Snopes categorized this legend as [...] "false", but commented that [...] "it is perhaps more fairly labelled as 'True, but for trivial and unremarkable reasons. [...] The historical tendency to place the wheels of horse-drawn vehicles approximately [...] apart probably derives from the width needed to fit a carthorse in between the shafts. [...] In addition, while road-traveling vehicles are typically measured from the outermost portions of the <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> (and {{there is some evidence that}} the first railroads were measured in this way as well), it became apparent that for vehicles travelling on rails it was better to have the wheel flanges located inside the rails, and thus the distance measured on the inside of the wheels (and, by extension, the inside faces of the rail heads) was the important one.|$|E
2500|$|Nineteen fifty-three saw the {{introduction}} of a new 175cc overhead cam model. MV Agusta produced the 175 CST and CSTL (Turismo Lusso) for street use and soon developed a sportier 175cc version with larger carburetor, a larger cylinder head with bigger fins, aluminum <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> and plenty of glossy red paint. The first year version (1954) of the 175 Sport featured a beautifully sculpted fuel tank that quickly earned it the unofficial nickname [...] "Disco Volante" [...] (flying saucer) as, viewed from the front, the tank shape was reminiscent of a flying saucer. Soon after, MV began offering a very limited-availability racing version 175cc [...] "Super Sport" [...] for MSDS racing (production club racing) equipped with unusual Earles-design front forks. In 1955, it was superseded by a new and improved Super Sport model with radical new styling and a five-speed gearbox. Its design earned it the nickname [...] "Squalo" [...] (Shark). This 175cc racing machine was very popular in Britain in the mid-1950s, where tuners learned to bore it out to over 200cc capacity. [...] Racers including Micheal O’Rourke, Derek Minter, and Bob Keeler raced the 175 and 125 Sport Competizione around Europe {{with a great deal of}} success. The marketing strategy of [...] "race it on Sunday, sell it on Monday" [...] was adhered to, and it worked. MV street motorcycles enjoyed immense popularity throughout Europe. In 1958 American rider Dave Schuler, riding a borrowed and barely modified MV 175 Sport street bike, won the 175 class at the famed Catalina Island GP off-road race, in California.|$|E
