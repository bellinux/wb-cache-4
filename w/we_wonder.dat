500|$|Dudley {{negotiated}} a separate {{peace with the}} Abenakis at Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1713. [...] He hoped to separate the western Kennebec tribe from French influence and consequently adopted a fairly hard line, threatening to withhold trade that was vital to their survival and reiterating claims of British sovereignty over the Abenaki. [...] The Treaty of Portsmouth resulted from those negotiations and repeats the claims of sovereignty. Dudley claimed that the French had ceded Abenaki lands as part of Acadia, and one sachem responded: [...] "The French never said anything to us about it, and <b>we</b> <b>wonder</b> how they would give it away without asking us". [...] Nevertheless, Dudley and succeeding governors treated the Abenaki as British subjects, and friction persisted over British colonial expansion into Maine which flared into Dummer's War in the 1720s.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{have placed}} parts the novel in the mystery genre. Edinger found {{that despite the}} broad genres, the novel is mainly [...] "a thrilling puzzle". She relates the pieces slowly; clues {{are found in the}} story itself, on the map, in words and chapter titles. At {{the end of the book}} {{everything}} is tied together and makes sense. Ann Crewdson of School Library Journal found that each note Miranda receives foreshadows the next event. Each note is [...] "skillfully" [...] integrated into the novel, along with subsequent clues, until the climax is reached and all the clues come together. Stead's editor Lamb agreed with the mystery genre, in that [...] "there's plenty to wonder about after you finish the book. Just as <b>we</b> <b>wonder</b> why our feelings change so suddenly, or why someone like the laughing man appears on the corner one day." [...] Gurdon of The Wall Street Journal concurred with Lamb, adding that although the novel is clearly a mystery, the mystery itself is not revealed until the end where the last note comes and where everything ties together.|$|E
500|$|On October 19, 2010, Scribner {{published}} {{a collection of}} short stories, Palo Alto, by Franco. The book is named after the California city where Franco grew up and is dedicated to many of the writers he worked with at Brooklyn College. Inspired by some of Franco's own teenage memories Palo Alto, and memories written and submitted by high school students at Palo Alto Senior High School, consists of life in Palo Alto as experienced by a series of teenagers who {{spend most of their time}} indulging in driving drunk, smoking weed and taking part in unplanned acts of violence. Each passage is told by a young narrator. The book has received mixed reviews; Los Angeles Times called it [...] "the work of an ambitious young man who clearly loves to read, who has a good eye for detail, but who has spent way too much time on style and virtually none on substance". The Guardian said that Franco's [...] "foray into the literary world may be met with cynicism in some quarters, but this is a promising debut from a most unlikely source". Writing in The New York Times, reviewer and fellow author Joshua Mohr praised Franco for how, in the story [...] "American History", he juxtaposed historical parts with a present-day social commentary that [...] "makes the <b>we</b> <b>wonder</b> how much we've actually evolved in post-bellum America". At least one editor of a literary journal testified he would not publish Franco's stories, claiming he has been published due to his star power, not literary talent. Publishers Weekly reviewed the collection, stating [...] "The author fails to find anything remotely insightful to say in these 11 amazingly underwhelming stories".|$|E

2500|$|The Israel Defence Forces (IDF), {{although}} it admitted striking the building, initially {{denied that the}} explosion that caused the mass deaths {{were the result of}} their attack. This was contested by Qana's residents, who said the building collapsed due to the Israeli bombing. According to the IDF, the bombing was an attempt to stop Katyusha rockets supposedly being fired by Hezbollah into northern Israel from the village over a two-week period and said residents were warned to leave. International observers and journalists said there was no evidence the building served any military purpose. Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora accused Israel of war crimes and asked, [...] "Why, <b>we</b> <b>wonder,</b> did they choose Qana yet again?", in reference to an artillery shelling carried out by Israeli forces that killed over 100 civilians at a UN compound 10 years before.
