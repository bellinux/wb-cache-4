500|$|Ringo Starr {{identified}} {{his initial}} inspiration for [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] as having come from Marc Bolan, the singer and guitarist with English glam rock band T. Rex. In a 2001 interview with Mojo editor Paul Du Noyer, Starr described Bolan as [...] "a dear friend {{who used to}} come into the office when I was running Apple Movies, a big office in town, and the hang-out for myself, Harry Nilsson and Keith Moon". Over dinner one evening at Starr's home outside London, Bolan had used the word [...] "boogaloo" [...] so often that it stuck in Starr's mind, after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight. When discussing the composition on VH1 Storytellers in May 1998, Starr explained: [...] " [...] was an energised guy. He used to speak: 'Back off boogaloo... ooh you, boogaloo.' 'Do you <b>want</b> <b>some</b> potatoes?' 'Ooh you, boogaloo!'" [...] Starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children's toys that night, in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song.|$|E

The [...] "quintessential workhouse yarn" [...] is of course Oliver Twist (1838) by Charles Dickens, which contains the well-known request from Oliver to the master of the workhouse: [...] "Please, sir, I <b>want</b> <b>some</b> more [...] ". Another popular piece of workhouse literature was the dramatic monologue [...] (1877) by George Robert Sims, better known by its first line of [...] "It is Christmas Day in the workhouse". In chapter XXVII of his first novel Down and Out in Paris and London (1933), George Orwell gives a brief but vivid account of his stay in a London workhouse when he roamed the streets as a tramp during a short period in his late twenties. In 1931 an early version of this account had already been published as an essay (The Spike) in an issue of The New Adelphi.|$|E
500|$|Another common {{criticism}} of Wintour's editorship focuses on Vogues {{increasing use of}} celebrities on the cover, and her insistence on making them meet her standards. She reportedly told Oprah Winfrey to lose weight before her cover photograph. Likewise, Hillary Clinton was told not to wear a blue suit. At the 2005 Anglomania celebration, a Vogue-sponsored salute to British fashion at the Met, Wintour {{is said to have}} personally chosen the clothes for prominent attendees such as Jennifer Lopez, Kate Moss, Donald Trump, and Diane von FÃ¼rstenberg. [...] "I don't think Vreeland had that kind of concentration," [...] says WWD publisher Patrick McCarthy. [...] "She wouldn't have dressed Babe Paley. Nor would Babe Paley have let her." [...] By persuading designers to loan clothes to prominent socialites and celebrities, who are then photographed wearing the clothes not only in Vogue but more general-interest magazines like People and Us, which in turn influence what buyers <b>want,</b> <b>some</b> in the industry believe Wintour is exerting too much control over it, especially since she is not involved in making or producing clothes herself. [...] "The end result is that Anna can control {{it all the way to}} the selling floor," [...] says Candy Pratts Price, executive fashion director at style.com. She has been credited with killing grunge fashion in the early 1990s, when it wasn't selling well, by telling designers if they continued to avoid glamour their looks would not be photographed for Vogue.

500|$|Weston persuaded Dorsey to {{audition}} {{the group in}} 1938, and the eight drove together to New York City. Dorsey liked them and signed them for ten weeks. After their second broadcast, the sponsorvisiting from overseasheard the group sing [...] "Hold Tight (<b>Want</b> <b>Some</b> Seafood Mama)". Until this point, the sponsor knew only that he was paying for Dorsey's program and that its ratings were very good; transcription discs mailed {{to him by his}} advertising agency always arrived broken. He thought that the performance was terrible, and pressured the advertising agency representing his brand to fire the group. They stayed in New York for several months, landing one job that paid them $3.60 each, and they recorded some material for RCA Victor Records. Weston later said that he and Stordahl felt responsibility for the group, since Weston had arranged their audition with Dorsey. After six months in New York and with no work there for them, The Pied Pipers returned to Los Angeles, where four of their members left the group to seek regular employment. Shortly afterwards, Stafford received a telephone call from Dorsey, who told her he wished to hire the group, but wanted only four of them, including Stafford. After she agreed to the offer the remaining Pied PipersStafford, Huddleston, Lowry and Wilsontraveled to Chicago in 1939. The decision led to success for the group, especially Stafford, who featured in both collective and solo performances with Dorsey's orchestra.|$|E
