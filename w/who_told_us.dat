25|$|Late one {{afternoon}} when returning from town we {{were met by}} a few women and children <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that Mexican troops from some other town had attacked our camp, killed all the warriors of the guard, captured all our ponies, secured our arms, destroyed our supplies, and killed many of our women and children. Quickly we separated, concealing ourselves as best we could until nightfall, when we assembled at our appointed place of rendezvous— a thicket by the river. Silently we stole in one by one, sentinels were placed, and when all were counted, I found that my aged mother, my young wife, and my three small children were among the slain.|$|E
6000|$|... "I lay hidden {{with the}} boy Jonas, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> of the track down to the water," [...] John said, quietly, [...] "and have since then been {{fighting}} the Romans. While you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he commented, [...] "in {{that case}} I guess it's quite a pity we didn't, but I begin to {{understand}} the thing. This is the young lady <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> the trail. She must have taken a shorter way." ...|$|E
60|$|There the two {{seemingly}} conversed {{for a long}} time, and I {{was left}} comparatively alone, until the soldier <b>who</b> had <b>told</b> <b>us</b> of General Herkimer's doings nearabout Johnson Hall, came up.|$|R
6000|$|... "James Walsh!" [...] {{the general}} said; [...] "I {{said nothing about}} James. It is you <b>who</b> have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> his Christian name, which is, I have no doubt, the correct one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas, alas, I {{chose to}} rust out, and here I am, a miserable, {{worthless}} thing, whom {{no one can}} use or care for. Lift the ruffle, and behold a sad contrast to the faithful, honest, happy Granny, <b>who</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> such a varied tale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{met the man}} {{you call}} Il Duca, but <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> he was Signor Victor Valdi, on board the ship, {{where many of the}} {{passengers}} knew my uncle well. If he listened to their conversation he would soon know all about John Merrick, of course." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Cronaca; [...] "I was in San Marco at the time, and saw {{her come}} out from the chapter-house with Fra Girolamo, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that the dying man's breath had been {{preserved}} as by a miracle, that he might make a disclosure to his sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Lambert went on: [...] "After {{that he came}} every night, {{and soon}} the {{tappings}} began, and finally we got into communication with my father, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> to be patient and wait and Waltie would speak to us. Then the power took hold of Viola and frightened her almost into fits." ...|$|E
60|$|Therefore, {{it is good}} to go to church; and good, {{for some}} at least, to go as often as possible: but only if we {{remember}} why we go, and whom we go to worship--a Father, who asks of us to worship him in spirit and in truth. A Father <b>who</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> what that worship is like.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hester, I can't {{think where}} I've heard that dear Soames wants Irene {{to come back}} to him again. <b>Who</b> was it <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that George had made a funny drawing of him with the words, 'He won't be happy till he gets it'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am rejoiced to see you," [...] {{the sheik}} said gravely. [...] "I heard how you had before befriended Sidi, and the {{messenger}} <b>who</b> arrived here <b>told</b> <b>us</b> how you had saved {{the lives of}} my brother and nephew, and I wanted to see your face.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] {{explained}} the Lavender King in denying them this privilege, [...] "he's {{a very valuable}} bear, because his magic is a correct guide on all occasions, and especially if one is in difficulties. It was the Pink Bear <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that Ugu the Shoemaker had stolen the Cookie Cook's dishpan." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were not}} murdered, {{and we had}} a very {{pleasant}} breakfast with the artist, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> more anecdotes of his life in Mexico and other places. When, after breakfast, he shut up his valise, preparatory to starting away, we felt really sorry. When he was ready to go, he asked for his bill.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{that old}} woman from Guestwick <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> then. The {{women will be}} at you at once, you'll find. If there's nothing in it, it's what I call a d---- shame. Why should they always pull a fellow to pieces in that way? They were going to marry me the other day!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Jefferson, [...] "you {{must ask}} another. I guess nobody's {{going to find}} the full answer to that conundrum. There are only two or three men <b>who</b> could have <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> and we're not going to have an {{opportunity}} of worrying them about it, unless we get the fever, too." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{strategic}} {{position of the}} islands of Attu and Kiska off Alaska's coast meant their location could control the sea lanes across the Northern Pacific Ocean. Japanese planners believed control of the Aleutians would therefore prevent any possible U.S. attacks from Alaska. This assessment had already been inferred by U.S. General Billy Mitchell <b>who</b> <b>told</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Congress in 1935, [...] "I believe that in the future, whoever holds Alaska will hold the world. I {{think it is the}} most important strategic place in the world." ...|$|R
60|$|The first scout <b>who</b> {{returned}} <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that he {{had fallen}} in with {{a large body of}} the enemy encamped on the margin of a small pond. Creeping like a snake through the grass, he succeeded in getting near enough to overhear the conversation, from which he gathered two important pieces of information--namely, that they meant to return to their own lands in a north-easterly direction, and that their prisoners had escaped by means of a canoe which they found {{on the banks of the}} river that flowed past King Jambai's village.|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] he said, [...] "is {{a subject}} of which I've a monopoly; and I've volumes to say upon {{it as soon as}} there's a chance of doing it justice. George, I hear that Singleton, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> about the wheat, is home on a visit. Stephen has asked him over; you must meet him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Vex {{not your}} mind on that," [...] the prince answered, smiling. [...] "We {{have had a}} citizen from Montauban here this very day, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> such a tale of sack and murder and pillage that it moved our blood; but our wrath was turned upon {{the man who was}} in {{authority}} over them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 2. If Dr. J----ne, Author of the Character of a Low-Churchman, Mr. ---- Author of the New Association, if {{a famous}} Bishop <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> 'twould never be well with England till all the Dissenters were serv'd like the Hugonots in France, {{if any of}} these were Indicted for Moderation, they might safely plead not Guilty.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the period}} of 1959 to 1961, NWAF {{colleague}} Dee Green was editor of the BYU Archaeological Society Newsletter and had an article from it published in the summer 1969 edition of [...] in which he acknowledged that the NWAF findings did not back up the veracity of the Book of Mormon claims. After this article and another six years of fruitless search, Ferguson published a 29-page paper in 1975 where he concluded, [...] "I'm afraid that up to this point, I must agree with Dee Green, <b>who</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that to date there is no Book-of-Mormon geography".|$|R
5000|$|Although {{parliamentary}} rules allowed {{such practices}} at the time, {{the head of}} IPSA said in 2017 that employing family members {{in such a way}} was [...] "out of step with modern employment practice" [...] and insufficiently [...] "fair and open". A ban on MPs employing a family member in their office is due to come into effect by 2020. In reaching their conclusion IPSA wrote “this decision is not based on any identified abuse or misclaiming, the report concludes, and even ‘agrees with the MPs <b>who</b> have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that connected parties regularly go “above and beyond” in supporting MPs in their constituency.|$|R
2500|$|New York {{personal}} injury attorney Howard Hershenhorn filed a negligence lawsuit for Robert Dirks' wife Christine Ueda. It names Metro North, the train engineer Steven Smalls Jr., Westchester County {{and the town}} of Mount Pleasant among the defendants. The complaint lists bad visibility, poorly designed third rail, local official negligence and unsafe speed among the reasons for the defendants' alleged negligence. [...] "We are going to focus on the operation of the train and the train operator and his failure to recognize and stop the train," [...] Hershenhorn said. [...] "We have spoken with qualified experts <b>who</b> have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that these are very strong areas." ...|$|R
60|$|Emma was too {{overcome}} to object, for {{she believed}} that it was her aunt who slept beneath that mound, so once more we mounted the weary mules. But we did not get far. Within half a mile of the hacienda we were met by two armed rurales, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> plainly that if we attempted to go further they would shoot.|$|E
6000|$|... "`You won't {{have her}} long,' said my sweet father, {{in his usual}} blunt and {{pleasant}} way. `I am convinced that I know her father. Of course Arnold is a name you gave her?' `No; {{when she came to}} us she said her name was Mariquita, but she knew of no other name. It was the priest <b>who</b> <b>told,</b> <b>us</b> her surname was Arnold.' ...|$|E
60|$|Upon being {{informed}} {{that he had}} gone down to the beach, we proceeded in that direction; and soon met a native, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that, apprised of our vicinity, Wilson was keeping out of the way. We resolved to meet him; and passing through the village, he suddenly came walking toward us; having apparently {{made up his mind}} that any attempt to elude us would be useless.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the period}} of 1959 to 1961, NWAF {{colleague}} Dee Green was editor of the BYU Archaeological Society Newsletter and had an article from it published in the summer 1969 edition of Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought in which he acknowledged that the NWAF findings did not back up the veracity of the Book of Mormon claims.

6000|$|During their journeying the trappers had {{mutually}} agreed to rest from all labour on the Sabbath day. Some {{of them did}} so from no higher motive than the feeling that {{it was good for}} themselves and for their beasts to rest one day in seven from bodily labour. Although not absolutely regardless of religion, they nevertheless failed to connect this necessity of theirs with the appointment of a day of rest by that kind and gracious Father, <b>who</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that [...] "the Sabbath was made for man." [...] Made for him not only, and chiefly, for the benefit of his soul, but also, and secondarily, for the good of his body.|$|R
6000|$|Lest {{the reader}} should fancy {{that we are}} here merely inventing a mode of action, it may be well to state that we have conversed with a man styled [...] "the Rescue," [...] whose duty it was to watch the boys of Aberdeen while bathing on the {{dangerous}} coast there, and <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that he had saved some hundreds of lives--many {{of them in the}} manner above described.|$|E
60|$|Mutton tasted {{good that}} night around our camp-fire; and Romer ate a generous portion. A ranger {{from the station}} near there visited us, and two young ranchers, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that the {{influenza}} epidemic was waning. This was news to be thankful for. Moreover, I hired the two ranchers to hurry us by auto to Flagstaff on the morrow. So right there at Mormon Lake ended our privations.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess they}} should be here by now, if the fellow <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> was playing a {{straight}} game," [...] said the lad. [...] "The trouble is, they've a good many friends, and nobody can tell exactly who's standing in with them. It's kind of easier to pick up an odd case of whisky and say nothing than {{to give us the}} office and have a fire-stick shoved into your granary. I'm not counting too much on the Ontario man." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the purpose}} of our journey to Ober-Ammergau and back, we each carried with us a folio {{containing}} some ten or twelve first-class tickets between different towns, covering in all a distance of some thousand miles; and one afternoon, at Munich, seeing a railway official, a cloak-room keeper, <b>who</b> they <b>told</b> <b>us</b> had lately lost his aunt, and who looked exceptionally dejected, I proposed to B. that we should take this man into a quiet corner, and both of us show him all our tickets at once--the whole twenty or twenty-four of them--and let him take them {{in his hand and}} look at them {{for as long as he}} liked. I wanted to comfort him.|$|R
5000|$|... "These {{accusations against}} Pacific Rim {{contradict}} {{the view of}} the National Anti-Mining Working Group's own attorney, Luis Francisco Lopez, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> PolOff <b>U.S.</b> Embassy political officer in a separate interview that he has 'no evidence' linking Pacific Rim to the crimes," [...] the cable, leaked by WikiLeaks, reported. The political officer approached senior Salvadoran law enforcement officials, the human rights ombudsman, and the Archbishop of San Salvador to investigate the cases thoroughly, and concluded, [...] "there is absolutely no compelling evidence, nor credible motive, linking Pacific Rim to these murders." [...] Even so, the FMLN took out full-page newspaper ads on December 29, 2009, alleging a [...] "campaign of terror" [...] against anti-mining activists.|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} geometric realization for non-exceptional mutation-finite cluster algebras {{by extending}} {{the theory of}} Fomin and Thurston to skew-symmetrizable case. Cluster variables for these algebras are renormalized lambda lengths on certain hyperbolic orbifolds. We also compute growth rate of these cluster algebras, provide positivity of Laurent expansions of cluster variables, and prove sign-coherence of c-vectors. Comment: 58 pages, lots of figures; v 4 : the accepted version with further corrections (not included in the journal version) : the definition of an arc on an orbifold is corrected (thanks to T. Nakanishi <b>who</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> about the mistake), typos corrected, references to the paper of Fomin-Thurston updated (including the numbers of statements). arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1210. 5569 by other author...|$|R
