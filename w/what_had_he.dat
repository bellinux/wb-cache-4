500|$|He {{would claim}} that the Sex Pistols were his personal, Situationist-style art project: [...] "I decided to use people, just the way a {{sculptor}} uses clay." [...] But <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> supposedly made? The Sex Pistols were as substantial as pop culture could get: [...] "Punk became the most important cultural phenomenon of the late 20th century", McLaren would later assert. [...] "Its authenticity stands out against the karaoke ersatz culture of today, where everything and everyone is for sale.... unk is not, and never was, for sale." [...] Or they were a cynical con: something with which [...] "to sell trousers", as McLaren said in 1989; a [...] "carefully planned exercise to embezzle {{as much money as}} possible out of the music industry", as Jon Savage characterises McLaren's core theme in The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle; [...] "cash from chaos" [...] as the movie repeatedly puts it.|$|E
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} the door clicked and closed. They turned their heads, {{and he started}} violently back. In {{the shadow of the}} room stood a great shadowy figure--silent. They saw the face dimly in the half-light, with unexpressive dark patches under the penthouse brows. Every muscle in Raut's body suddenly became tense. When could the door have opened? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> heard? Had he heard all? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> seen? A tumult of questions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! what! he {{mentioned}} that? He observed me signalling the lads, did he? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> {{to say about}} his friend Hunsden--anything sweet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who is {{this man}} to whom my being yearns? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been to me? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> to do with thee? Speak, O Oracle and make the secret clear. Speak, I command, even though {{afterwards}} thou dost slay me--if thou canst." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait!" [...] said Cassy. [...] "Haven't I waited?--waited till {{my head is}} {{dizzy and}} my heart sick? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> made me suffer? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> made {{hundreds}} of poor creatures suffer? Isn't he wringing the life-blood out of you? I'm called on; they call me! His time's come, and I'll have his heart's blood!" ...|$|R
6000|$|GILBEY. [horrified, pitiable] Oh my-- [his breath fails him]. Do {{you mean}} {{that when he was}} in the police court he was in the dock? Oh, Maria! Oh, great Lord! <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> done? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> got for it? [Desperate] Will you tell me or will you see me go mad on my own carpet? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I see--it was {{the only}} way to avoid a tete-a-tete!' said Albinia. 'Well done, Genevieve. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> been saying to you, my dear?' ...|$|E
6000|$|The breathless {{sense of}} really monstrous {{injustice}} cut {{the power of}} speech in Soames' throat. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> done! What had they done to him! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{business}} had he at Chaldicotes? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> {{to do with}} such friends as that? I {{do not know how}} I am to forgive him." ...|$|E
6000|$|What brave tales {{could he}} not tell me. He fought in the first Crusade, heard the clarion voice of Peter, met the great Godfrey face to face, stood, hand on sword-hilt, at Runny-mede, perhaps. Better than a whole library of {{historical}} novels would an evening's chat be with such a ghost. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> done with his eight hundred years of death? where <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been? <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> seen? Maybe <b>he</b> <b>has</b> visited Mars; has spoken to the strange spirits who can live in the liquid fires of Jupiter. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> learned of the great secret? Has he found the truth? or is he, even as I, a wanderer still seeking the unknown? ...|$|R
5000|$|Question 2. The Yaksha asked, [...] "Who is Arjuna Krishna? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> achieved"? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> got in {{his hand}} now? More cucumbers? No. A long strip of paper. It's the bill.|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> been thinking? Suppose {{after all}} that ending with Mrs. Skelmersdale was simply a beginning. So far he had never looked sex in the face....|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, {{in answer}} to the woman's remark, [...] "that was {{certainly}} foolish of him. But <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> {{to do with the}} row, anyway?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl's first proud {{impulse was}} to turn coldly away and leave him. But some strange tumult in her heart kept her still. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> come to say? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then your {{chat with}} Comrade Downing {{was not of}} the old-College-chums-meeting-unexpectedly-after-years'-separation type? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been doing to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{suppose he}} has--explained," [...] said Mr. Brumley slowly and with {{infinite}} distaste. [...] "Lady Harman, <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> explained?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{once said}} the word to me, he should not change. But then <b>what</b> right <b>have</b> I to expect it? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> ever said about me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Amyas sat thunderstruck. His {{first impulse}} was to ask, [...] "Lundy? What knew you of him? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> or you to do at Lundy?" [...] but pity conquered curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> done? What had {{happened}} in these five days to make her like this to him? He took her hands and tried to kiss them; but she said quickly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{one thing}} I don't see yet," [...] I said. [...] "I don't {{understand}} Oscar's embarrassment in speaking to you. As you interpret him, <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> to be afraid of?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He changed!' {{returned}} the other. 'What for? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> suffered? There is change enough for twenty in me. Isn't that enough?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! how nice! Where <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> seen? Why <b>has</b> <b>he</b> {{been away}} so long? How jolly!" [...] were the various {{expressions}} {{with which the}} news was received.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} Dan Baxter {{wants to}} be major," [...] said Stuffer. [...] "Talk about gall! <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> ever done for the school? Nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|Tommy {{felt his}} {{ascendancy}} less sure than a moment before. His hold had slipped a little. But he was puzzled. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> said wrong? He spoke {{out on the}} impulse of the moment.|$|E
60|$|Who was he and <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> done? On {{this she}} pondered {{half the night}} through, while fever coursed through her veins and her brows were moist and aching, her heart palpitating with pain.|$|E
60|$|The {{relief was}} but momentary. Why was Jimmy {{in the room}} at that time? Why had he a lamp? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> been doing? The {{questions}} shot from her brain like sparks from an anvil.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, the veechy {{is a good}} {{fellow at}} the bottom, Griffin; though he'll never burn the bay of Naples. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> to say now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Martha," [...] said a tall, broad-shouldered, deep-voiced man at her elbow, [...] "don't wop {{the poor}} cheeld like that. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been doin'--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, the man, bating he is a pestilent Roundhead and Puritan," [...] said Whitaker, [...] "is no bad neighbour. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> done to thee, man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Where {{had he been}} in his time? he repeated, when I {{asked him}} the question. Lord, he had been everywhere! And <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> been? Bless you, he had been {{everything}} you could mention a'most! ...|$|E
60|$|Their tone {{of disgust}} {{amounted}} to being offensive. Why should {{the young man}} be so calumniated? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> done? He had only made an innocent and natural mistake. I controlled my generous indignation, and said so.|$|E
60|$|The breathless {{sense of}} really monstrous {{injustice}} cut {{the power of}} speech in Soames' throat. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>HE</b> done! What had they done to him! And with quite unconscious dignity {{he put his hand}} on his breast, and looked at her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! mamma, mamma, don't! I haven't said anything. I haven't {{complained of}} Mr. Comfort. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> said now? You forget {{that you have}} not told me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And is {{that what}} you mean? Come, dearest, tell me the whole of it. <b>What</b> <b>have</b> you said to him yourself? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been led to think from the answer you have given him to-day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been saying?" [...] {{demanded the}} aristocratic bully, coolly. [...] "Has he {{been telling you}} how I had to polish him off for {{insulting}} me?" ...|$|R
