A certain amount of this loneliness appears to be related to greater migration, smaller household sizes, a larger degree of media consumption (all of <b>which,</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be noted, have positive sides as well in the form of more opportunities, more choice in family size, and better access to information), all of which relates to social capital.|$|E
25|$|Renpō Niwa, {{a former}} abbot of Eihei-ji, divides the texts into five parts. The first {{part is the}} preface in which Dōgen {{emphasizes}} the importance of the work of the tenzo, or head cook. He asserts that the position is only suitable for experienced monks with a certain deep degree of understanding of zen practice. The next section describes the actual work the tenzo must carry out, as well as the attitude with <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be undertaken. The third part includes instructions for serving, as well as an account of Dōgen's famous encounters with two monks serving as tenzo while he was visiting China. He acknowledges that these meetings had a deep and lasting impact on his understanding of Buddhism, and they thus ultimately helped shape Sōtō Zen in Japan. Next, Dōgen focuses on the need for the tenzo to act without any thought of discrimination or duality. In the last section, the discussion of the tenzo's attitude is concluded with a discussion of the Three Minds (Sanshin, 三心), a set of three ideals for Zen practice.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} with the earlier article shows that {{the reconstruction of the}} vicariate is not an organic continuation of the former condition but that an entirely new organization has been created. There is in this change an evident effort to organize the official bodies as servants of the public and to do this {{on the basis of the}} modern method of carrying on business, as it is found everywhere in countries that lead in civilization and in well-organized central boards of authorities. Formerly the administration was a cumbrous one, impeded by traditional obstacles; it may perhaps be said to have regarded itself as the primary object and the public <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> serve as of subordinate consideration. This state of things is now past, thanks to the energy of the reigning pope, which overcame all obstacles. Now, anyone who has business with the vicariate knows exactly to which department, which official, he must go in order to have the matter in question speedily settled. It is to be expected that in the course of time the third department owing to the test of practical working may undergo slight changes, as it is not probable that all ordinances will prove capable of permanent execution. The characteristics of the new organization are division of work and rigid separation of the judiciary from the executive administration, together with an ample supply of officials for the different departments. In the reorganization customs that had become historical were taken into consideration only insofar as they could be combined without difficulty with modern methods of business.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} disaster was identified as the Turbo train passing signal SN109 (located on an overhead gantry—gantry 8—with four other signals serving other tracks) at <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> have been held. It was established that the signal had been showing a red aspect, and the preceding signal (SN87) had been showing a single yellow which should have led the driver {{to be prepared for}} a red at SN109. Since the Thames Turbo driver, 31-year-old Michael Hodder, had been killed in the accident, {{it was not possible to}} establish why he had passed the signal at danger. However, Hodder was inexperienced, having qualified as a driver only two weeks before the crash. His driver training was found to be defective, whilst the signalling in the Paddington area was known to have caused problems – SN109 had been passed at danger on eight occasions in six years, but Hodder had no specific warning of this. Furthermore, 5 October 1999 was a day of bright sunshine and at just past 8 o'clock the sun would have been low and behind Hodder, with low sunlight reflecting off yellow aspects. Poor signal placement meant that Hodder would have seen sunlit yellow aspects of SN109 at a point where his view of the red aspect of SN109 (but not of any other signal on the gantry) was still obstructed. The inquiry considered it more probable than not that the poor sighting of SN109, both in itself and in comparison with the other signals on and at gantry 8, allied to the effect of bright sunlight at a low angle, were factors which had led Hodder to believe that he had a proceed aspect. Since 1998 a campaign to have the signal SN109 properly sited had been running, and the Bristol HST drivers were re-routed as not to pass this signal.|$|E
500|$|Knut Helle {{interprets the}} saga to leave an {{impression}} of Skule as a skilled warrior and politician, while noting that {{the author of the}} saga purposely created a diffuse image of his role in the conflict with Haakon. On the other hand, Helle notes that Skule was outmaneuvered with relative ease by Haakon's supporters in the immediate years after 1217, and that this may suggest some limited abilities. While neither giving a clear picture of Haakon, Helle maintains that Haakon [...] "obviously" [...] learned to master the political game in his early years. He interprets Haakon as an independent and willstrong ruler whom he assigns a [...] "significant personal responsibility" [...] for the policies pursued during his reign—notably regarding the internal consolidation of the kingship, the orientation towards European culture and the aggressive foreign policy. In his article in Norsk biografisk leksikon, Knut Helle acknowledges that Haakon was empowered by the strong institutional position of the kingship {{at the end of his}} reign (<b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be noted that he had developed himself), and that his policies were not always successful. It nonetheless recognises the substantial political abilities and powerful determination Haakon must have had in order to progress from the difficult position in which he started his reign.|$|E
