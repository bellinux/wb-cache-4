There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{significance}} of the victory to the US Track and Field program, Brown Trafton's winning distance of 212 feet 5inches (64.74m) caused one track and field reporter to label Beijing a [...] "low-standard competition". It wasn't a personal best for the athlete. Nor <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> Olympic record, as Copeland's gold had been in 1932. [...] And it failed to approach Gabriele Reinsch's 1988 world record of 251 feet 11inches (76.80m). [...] In fact, not only was Leslie Deniz' 24-year-old silver medal-winning throw longer than any throw of the 2008 Olympics, but no gold medalist since Lia Manoliu in the 1968 games had posted a shorter winning distance. [...] Only 2 of the 12 finalists at the Beijing Olympics had a personal best under Brown Trafton's winning throw, and the average personal best of the field was 219 feet even (66.75m). [...] However, she was peaking when most of the field was in personal decline. [...] When viewed against the prism of 2008-only performances, the only members of the field other than Brown Trafton to better the winning 212 feet 5inches (64.74m) mark were Aretha Thurmond, Nicoleta Grasu and Yarelis Barrios. In fact, only six women other than Brown Trafton had thrown better in 2008, and they were not all present in Beijing.|$|E
