5|$|The ironic {{thing is}} that we grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music. I grew up with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff was playing in the house. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to seek out. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.|$|E
5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E
5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted.</b> It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

I didn't come home because of a sense of duty to anybody here. I came home because it was time, because of my sense of duty to myself. I'm all the better from my three years of {{wandering}} about, and now it's up to me to go on with my education--my book education, I mean." ...|$|R
25|$|For {{the first}} time I liked school and for {{the first time}} I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the {{property}} of Barnard College at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{told the}} Sunday Times that ‘From {{the age of}} 13, I wanted to play cricket for England. I’ve never felt any shame in saying this is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do. And the people at home {{involved}} in cricket, they were like, “Fair play, it’s going to be unbelievable if you make it”. So I’ve never had any shame about this and my father’s never had any shame about it.’ England {{is one of the}} ten full members of the International Cricket Council, while Ireland is an associate member. Only full member nations can play a full schedule of international cricket, including Test matches.|$|E
25|$|I {{was very}} much {{surprised}} when Mill informed {{me that he had}} not read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire Hegelian philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry. I mentally confronted this with the opinion of the man at the Copenhagen University who knew the history of philosophy best, my teacher, Hans Brochner, who knew, so to speak, nothing of contemporary English and French philosophy, and did not think them worth studying. I {{came to the conclusion that}} here was a task for one who understood the thinkers of the two directions, who did not mutually understand one another. I thought that in philosophy, too, I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted,</b> and saw a road open in front of me.|$|E

500|$|Production duo Rock City {{stated that}} [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] was {{originally}} written with recording artist Rihanna in mind before offering it to record producer Mike Will Made It, who ultimately {{offered it to}} Cyrus. They felt that [...] "this could be somebody’s first single", and decided against Rihanna because of the commercial success of her track [...] "Diamonds" [...] in 2012. Cyrus commented that [...] "it really just {{turned out to be}} perfect and exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted,</b> and exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> my first sound to be, and my first look to be".|$|E

He stated, [...] "I always knew I wanted to be in films but I did not know exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do. I loved movies and watched a lot of them.

500|$|It {{describes}} how I {{got into the}} business, verbatim.

And the thing is, what she had talked about as well, is that before a concert, what she finds very interesting is the rehearsals and the straining and maybe {{she would like to}} injure. [...] And she said that the process of making the concert became more intriguing than the final result." ...|$|E
500|$|Hartman {{was born}} Philip Edward Hartmann (later {{dropping}} one [...] "n") on September 24, 1948 in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. He {{was the fourth}} of eight children of Doris Marguerite (Wardell) and Rupert Loebig Hartmann, a salesman specializing in building materials. His parents were Catholic and raised their children in that faith. As a child Hartman found affection hard to earn and stated: [...] "I suppose I didn't get <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> out of my family life, so I started seeking love and attention elsewhere." ...|$|E

I wanted to keep [...] simple in structure, concentrating on the {{layering}} of vocals and guitars." [...] With Love in Motion, Moa moved away from her traditional pop and country pop sound to a pop rock environment. She intentionally changed the sound, through alterations in production and engineering, rather than the writing style. Moa told co-producer Andre Upston that she wanted the album to sound [...] "dirty and gritty." ...|$|E

In an {{interview}} with Phillymag, Larter gave reason for the move: [...] "I took some time off to define myself outside the pressures of the industry. Part of me really needed to know if this is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{do with the rest of}} my life." [...] In January 2005, she moved to Los Angeles for a role in Heroes.|$|E

His parents wanted him in the army, but he told them that he wanted to get a degree first, which acted as his [...] "cover story", and immediately began playing in bands.|$|E
