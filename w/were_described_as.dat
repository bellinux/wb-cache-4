Subsequent authors have assigned this species to the genus Carcharhinus. Because Müller and Henle's type specimen was a 53-cm-long female fetus from Cuba, adult silky sharks were historically not recognized as C.falciformis and <b>were</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a separate species, Carcharhinus floridanus, by Henry Bigelow, William Schroeder, and Stewart Springer in 1943. Jack Garrick, Richard Backus, and Robert Gibbs, Jr. synonymized C.floridanus with C.falciformis in 1964.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{the absence of}} an active high yield market {{prompted}} KKR to change its tactics, avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what <b>were</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> leveraged buildups or rollups. One of KKR's largest investments in the 1990s was the leveraged buildup of Primedia in partnership with former executives of Macmillan Publishing, which KKR had failed to acquire in 1988. KKR created Primedia's predecessor, K-III Communications, a platform to buy media properties, initially completing the $310 million divisional buyout of the book club division of Macmillan along with the assets of Intertec Publishing Corporation in May 1989.|$|E
5|$|Level Mountain basalt and {{andesite}} flows {{were presented}} in the 1926 Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. The andesites <b>were</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> porphyritic rocks with phenocrysts of feldspar of various size in a greyish or greenish matrix. Both hornblende and augite andesites were noted to have been represented under a microscope. The basalts <b>were</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> black rocks with basic plagioclase with or without olivine and were noted in many cases to contain a considerable percentage of brownish glass. Although there was not sufficient time available to study these flows in detail it was revealed at several points that the andesites formed the older and the basalts the younger flows. G. M. Dawson of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) was able to demonstrate that on the Stikine River {{there were at least}} four flows of basalt. The basalts and andesites were considered to be younger than all the rocks they were observed in contact with, namely granitic intrusives, porphyries and greenstones. More definite evidence as to their age was obtained by W. A. Johnston and F. A. Kerr of the GSC who placed them in the Tertiary {{with some of the most}} recent flows of the Stikine valley probably belonging to the Pleistocene.|$|E

One {{of the goals of}} the civil rights movement was to end disenfranchisement of African Americans, but the Nation of Islam forbade its members from participating in voting and other aspects of the political process. Civil rights organizations denounced him and the Nation as irresponsible extremists whose views did not represent African Americans.|$|E

5|$|Overlordship was {{a central}} feature of Anglo-Saxon {{politics}} which began before Æthelberht's time; kings <b>were</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> overlords {{as late as the}} ninth century.
