5|$|Wisden {{believed}} that Jardine's effective batting technique meant that fast bowlers troubled him less than other batsmen. He did have difficulties {{with a few}} bowlers. Alec Kennedy, a medium paced inswing bowler, took Jardine's wicket eleven times, eight of these occasions before the batsman had scored 20 runs. Kennedy found that Jardine had slightly slow footwork, often bowling him or trapping him lbw. Bert Ironmonger also troubled Jardine, taking his wicket {{in five of the}} eleven Test innings in which they faced each other. Jardine displayed a slight weakness against Australian slow bowlers, not moving his feet well enough against them. In 16 Test innings in Australia, he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> slow bowlers ten times, but he rarely experienced similar difficulties against English spinners. One other bowler to cause Jardine problems was the Australian paceman Tim Wall, who took his wicket five times on the nine occasions he bowled to him.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{unfavorable}} {{developments in}} South Vietnam, North Vietnamese General Tran Van Tra believed North Vietnam and the Viet Cong could still {{win the war}} if they pursued a strategy of attrition. In other words, the Communists would have to fight on {{for as long as}} possible, until the United States recognized that the war was unwinnable and would disengage from the conflict in Vietnam. To achieve that objective at the tactical level, Tra argued that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces would have to destroy American military units, and cause as many casualties as possible until they got tired and left. Indeed, towards mid-1967 General Thanh, who had the Viet Cong 7th and 9th Division at his disposal, <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> do just that. In June, U.S. military forces in III Corps Tactical Zone began to detect the build-up of Viet Cong troops in northern Phuoc Vinh located War Zone D. To stop a major enemy attack on Phuoc Vinh, Major General John H. Hay—commander of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division—launched Operation Billings with the objective of trapping three Viet Cong battalions in War Zone D.|$|E

Bell <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Smith just before tea and the visitors were still struggling at 4/143. Root made 87 before falling to Lyon and at the close, England had progressed to 6/247.|$|E

Hayden and Hussey {{took over the}} crease with Hayden scoring another hundred. Hayden had to get Ricky Ponting as a runner due to an injury, and was eventually dismissed of Kumble for 123. On the next ball Kumble claimed Clarke for a golden duck. On the hat trick ball Kumble hit Symonds on the pads, sparking a big appeal from the Indian team, {{but it was not}} given. Symonds and Hussey remained unbeaten at stumps.|$|E

It left the Netherlands with a lead of 107, and as {{they did not want}} to give Kenya the 14 points {{available}} for the win, they batted out the day for a draw. Van Bunge ended unbeaten on 70, while five Kenyan bowlers got a wicket each, and when stumps were drawn on the final day Netherlands were 202 for 5.|$|E
25|$|Consistent {{performances}} in the Carib Beer Series led to Johnson's selection for the tri-series involving Bermuda and Canada. He made his international debut– along with Brendan Nash and Kemar Roach– in a One Day International match against Bermuda. Johnson scored 27 runs off 28 balls before being caught out off the spin bowling of Delyone Borden as the West Indies won by six wickets. Johnson scored his first ODI half century on 22 August 2008. He scored 51 off 77 balls in a 128-run stand with Xavier Marshall who in the same innings broke the record for number of sixes hit in an ODI as West Indies beat Canada by 49 runs. In the final against Canada, Johnson <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> debutant Balaji Rao for one run from nine balls as the West Indies won by seven wickets.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{went on to}} face India in the semi-final. Blackwell ran out {{opposing}} {{captain and}} all rounder Jhulan Goswami, one of three wickets to fall in the 17th over bowled by Ellyse Perry. Australia were set a target of 120, and Blackwell promoted herself to No. 3 after opener Elyse Villani fell for a duck in the first over. Blackwell and Nitschke counter-attacked, and scored the next 50 runs in 40 balls, before Nitschke <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> end a stand of 74 runs in 60 balls. Blackwell reached her fifty in 37 balls and was eventually out for 61 from 49 balls with 17 runs still required from 28 balls for victory. The Australians reached their target with seven wickets and seven balls to spare, and Blackwell was named the player of the match.|$|E
25|$|Born in Islamabad, Naved {{played at}} under-19 level for Islamabad, and in January 1992 scored 45 against the touring English under-19 side. He made his senior Wills Cup debut in October 1993, against Rawalpindi. On his {{first-class}} debut the following season, against Lahore City in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy, Naved made a first-innings duck, {{and was one}} of nine batsman to fall to Naved Anjum (who finished with 9/35). In the second innings he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Test bowler Abdul Qadir for one run. During the 1995–96 Wills Cup season, Naved was appointed captain for all three of Islamabad's matches, despite being only 24 and having played only one prior match in the format. He first became a regular for Islamabad during the 1996–97 season, when his seven Quaid-i-Azam matches yielded 223 runs (the sixth-best return for his team). His season included a maiden first-class half-century, 72 against Lahore City, and also a maiden limited-overs half-century, a man of the match 69 against Peshawar in the Wills Cup.|$|E
25|$|Hartland {{had still}} not passed fifty in six Test innings, {{but was still}} taken on tours of Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka in 1992–93, and {{though he did not}} play a Test against Zimbabwe (with Mark Greatbatch and Rod Latham {{preferred}} as openers), he played his first ODI on that tour, scoring five runs from number three in the batting order as New Zealand won by four wickets. Greatbatch and Latham were dropped for Sri Lanka, however, and Hartland was back as opener together with Wright; after he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Dulip Liyanage for 3 in the first innings, and Sri Lanka had declared 39 runs ahead with five sessions remaining, Hartland batted for four hours in an opening stand worth 110 with Wright, making his maiden Test fifty. New Zealand batted out the match, making 195 for 5 the second innings in a drawn game.|$|E

25|$|Iqbal and Razzaq {{continued}} to hit out for Pakistan, before Iqbal was dismissed for 139 and Razzaq joined {{him in the}} pavilion the next over. With seven men down, Pakistan declared on 599, leaving India with 606 runs to win the match. Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif each took wickets in their first over, and when Sachin Tendulkar was bowled by a low ball from Asif, India were 74 for 4. Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh batted together until tea on day four, adding 103 runs, but Ganguly <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the first ball after tea and Abdul Razzaq and Danish Kaneria shared the last six wickets as India went from 177 for 4 {{to a total of}} 265. The last wicket to fall was that of Singh, who with his 122 posted his second Test century. Pakistan won the match by 341 runs and the series by a margin of 1–0.|$|E
25|$|In Lancashire's second innings, Ottis Gibson got {{two quick}} wickets as Lancashire fell to 22 for 3 shortly before stumps {{on the second}} day, but Australians Stuart Law and Andrew Symonds batted well {{together}} with a 111-run partnership before Law <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Henderson. Symonds powered on from there, bludgeoning 17 fours in his 121, and Glen Chapple and Warren Hegg made season-best scores of 60 and 77 respectively as they added for 121 for the eighth wicket. Lancashire declared on 368 for 9, not bothering to send in James Anderson to bat, thinking he might be better use with the ball. Indeed, he was - he took three for 39 before stumps on day three, as Leicestershire collapsed to 78 for 5 in chase of 399. There wasn't much respite {{on the fourth day}} either - after Dinesh Mongia and Habib had added 27, Anderson came back with two quick wickets, finishing with five for 79. Dominic Cork and debutant leg-spinner Simon Marshall wrapped up the Leicestershire chase as they were all out for 164.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{started the}} day slowly as the Indian pace pair of R. P. Singh and Sharma bowled accurately. After a short rain delay, the Australians began {{to seize the}} {{initiative}} and soon wiped out their first innings deficit. Approaching lunch, Jaques <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Kumble after a lofted sweep went to the fielder on the fence. Ponting came to the crease but was caught at silly point off the first ball he faced from Harbhajan, sparking major celebrations among the Indians, including two half-commando rolls from Harbhajan. After lunch, Hayden and Hussey rebuilt Australia's innings with the former scoring another hundred. Ponting acted as his runner due to an injury he collected while batting. Hayden was eventually dismissed by Kumble for 123 while attempting a reverse sweep. The very next ball Kumble claimed Clarke for a golden duck. Clarke stood his ground as he was caught at slip off the glove, and only walked after the umpire had given him out. On a hat trick, Kumble hit Symonds on the pads sparking a loud appeal which was turned down. Symonds and Hussey saw Australia to stumps with a healthy lead.|$|E

25|$|No {{team had}} ever managed to chase down a T20I score {{of more than}} 200 in England, and it had only been done three times {{anywhere}} in the world. Michael Lumb and Alex Hales got them {{off to a good}} start, reaching 50 runs in just 3.3 overs; however, Lumb <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the very next ball, bowled by Nathan McCullum. Hales was joined at the wicket by Luke Wright, and the pair put on another 55 runs for the second wicket, before Hales holed out to Franklin at mid-wicket for 39. Morgan was next to go, his 7 runs off 10 balls making him the only England batsman to score at a rate of less than a run a ball, and he was followed in the very next over by Wright. However, Wright's 52 off 34 balls left England needing 63 off the last five overs. An unbeaten 30 from Ravi Bopara, Buttler's quick-fire 17 and a six off the first ball of the final over from Ben Stokes got England to within five runs of the New Zealand total, but {{in the end it was}} too little, too late and the tourists took a 1–0 lead in the series.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{continued}} their dominance throughout the second day. Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey {{continued their}} partnership, putting together 209. Flintoff finally took Hussey's wicket {{when he was}} on 86, bowled through the gate, with the off-stump out of the ground, when he had looked set for a century. Matthew Hoggard finally made a significant breakthrough in the afternoon, taking the wickets of Ponting (for 196) and Adam Gilchrist (for a duck) in the same over, both men out lbw. Gilchrist, in particular, <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a ball bowled from around the wicket from the right-arm bowler Hoggard, a continuation of England's tactics against him in the 2005 Ashes series, which had restricted him to a top score of 49*. Ponting's 196 allowed him to surpass Graham Gooch as the seventh highest Test runscorer of all time (Gooch scored 8900 runs). Michael Clarke crafted a solid 56 before falling to James Anderson, edging a good delivery to slip. Australia's tail wagged, with Brett Lee scoring 43 and Stuart Clark hitting a quick-fire 39 off 23 balls before having his leg stump knocked out of the ground by Flintoff. His innings included two huge sixes off the bowling of James Anderson, who ended the innings with figures of 141 runs for just one wicket. Australia were able to declare their innings with the score 9/602 after tea.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand made {{a couple}} of forced changes for the second Test, with Brendon McCullum keeping wicket in place of the injured BJ Watling, Martin Guptill filling Watling's role with the bat, while Doug Bracewell came in for spinner Bruce Martin to form a four-man seam attack. The first day was {{completely}} washed out by rain, which, although there were some breaks in the cloud, was never away long enough to allow the toss to be made. With play abandoned before 4p.m., the match was effectively turned into a four-day game. After losing Compton (1) early on day 2, England recovered well, with Cook and Trott putting on another 50 runs before both were dismissed in consecutive balls in the last two overs before lunch; however, this only brought Joe Root to the crease, and he proceeded to add 104 more runs for his maiden Test century, becoming the first Yorkshireman to do so at Headingley. Root <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the first delivery with the new ball, but not before he and fellow Yorkshireman Jonny Bairstow had added 124 for the fifth wicket. Bairstow (64) went next, followed by Broad for a second-ball duck, but Prior and Swann combined to get England to 337/7 {{by the end of the}} day. England's tail only lasted another nine overs on day 3, enough to round the innings off for 354 runs. Trent Boult took the last two wickets of Finn (6) and Anderson (0) to complete a five-wicket haul.|$|E
