40|$|Research in {{accounting}} and psychology predicts that accountability should impact decision behavior by inducing greater {{effort by the}} decision maker when the source 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>views</b> are unknown. Often, decision makers {{have more than one}} source to which they are accountable. While the literature does evaluate whether different sources 2 ̆ 7 views will impact effort and accountability, it has not done so when consequences are revealed and in particular has not considered the impact of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) on behavior. ^ This dissertation finds that knowledge of source 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>views</b> impacts the level of effort exerted by auditors in making judgments regarding the valuation of receivables and inventory. When auditors knew the source 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>views</b> regarding the valuation, they exerted less effort than when the views were unknown, although their judgments did not necessarily converge to the source 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>view.</b> This effect of knowledge of the source 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>view</b> persisted whether the source was the client or the PCAOB, and whether the auditor faced personal consequences of the decision. ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} information on views of economist Karl Marx. Economist Royall Brandis asserted that Karl Marx {{was faced with}} a problem he could not solve. The problem, as presented by Brandis, is that Marx was fundamentally concerned with the decline and fail of capitalism, and that he 2 ̆ 2 had no need for, nor for that matter, any room for business cycles, 2 ̆ 2 and yet he dealt extensively with the problem of business cycles. The purpose of this comment is to show that Man 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>views</b> on the business cycle were perfectly consistent with, and in fact followed from, his views on the development and decline of capitalism. In Marx 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>view,</b> the fundamental process governing all social development is the contradiction between the relations of production and the development of the forces of production. In Man 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>view,</b> the development of the forces of production is a continual process, and, at a particular point, the particular relations of production in existence become a fetter on the further development of the forces of production.

Emitter clogging can affect distribution uniformity and the system performance, which has direct relationship with water quality. In this study five types of emitters with different nominal discharges, with or without self-flushing system and with or without pressure compensating system were evaluated under three management schemes; untreated well <b>water</b> (<b>S</b> 1), acidic treated <b>water</b> (<b>S</b> 2) and magnetic treated <b>water</b> (<b>S</b> 3) in order to reduce chemical clogging. Flow reduction rate, statistical uniformity coefficient (Uc), emission uniformity coefficient (Eu) and variation coefficient of emitters’ performance in the field (Vf) were monitored. The emitter performance indexes (Uc and Eu) decreased during the experiment due to emitter clogging. The Uc and Eu values in different management schemes confirmed that the acidification has better performance than the magnetic water in order to control emitter clogging and keep high distribution uniformity.

However, no studies have examined how maternal self-efficacy changes over time, which is potentially important during periods of rapid child development. This study examined tracking of maternal self-efficacy for limiting young children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> television <b>viewing</b> over 15 -months and associations with children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> television <b>viewing</b> time. METHODS: In 2008 and 2010, mothers (n =  404) from the Melbourne InFANT Program self-reported their self-efficacy for {{limiting their}} child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> television <b>viewing</b> at 4 - and 19 -months of age.

RESULTS: Tracking of maternal self-efficacy for limiting children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> television <b>viewing</b> was low (kappa =  0. 23, p <  0. 001).

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is centered}} around the Moral Virtuosity Project (the attempt to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a thing 2 ̆ 7 s being a moral virtue). The central task of the dissertation is to examine what other philosophers have had to say on this topic and ultimately to successfully complete this project. ^ Chapter One is concerned exclusively with Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to complete the Moral Virtuosity Project. I defend the view that Aristotle holds that each moral virtue is a disposition toward proper practical reasoning, action, and emotion within a certain sphere. I critically examine Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s argument for {{the unity of the}} virtues. I then try to point to some areas where Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>views</b> on moral virtue fail to correspond with our ordinary common sense views on moral virtue. ^ Chapter Two has three main parts. First, I consider Immanuel Kant 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to complete the Moral Virtuosity Project. I develop an interpretation of Kant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>views</b> on this topic. Second, I take up the topic of the relationship between Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>views</b> on moral virtue and Kant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>views</b> on moral virtue. Third, I examine some objections to Kant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>views</b> on moral virtue. I conclude that Kant 2 ̆ 7 s account of moral virtue goes wrong because it is inextricably tied up with the concept of moral obligation. ^ Chapter Three is devoted to critical discussions of contemporary attempts to complete the Moral Virtuosity Project. Authors whose views are discussed include: G. H. von Wright, Philippa Foot, Judith Thomson, Linda Zagzebski, and Thomas Hurka. I conclude that each view has serious problems. ^ In Chapter Four I develop a novel account of moral virtue by appealing to the concept of admirability. Drawing on work on virtue by Michael Slote, I try to shed some light on the concept of admirability and distinguish the concept from related concepts. I then appeal to the concept of admirability to explicate the concept of a moral virtue, thus completing the Moral Virtuosity Project. I discuss a number of other topics, including “hard cases”, excessive virtue, and two sorts of morally virtuous persons: the Good Hearted Hero and the Conflicted Hero. ...|$|R
