40|$|INTRODUCTION: Adenoid {{is thought}} {{to be one of the}} causes of otitis <b>media</b> <b>with</b> effusion, though it is controversial. Grading the adenoid by rigid nasal {{endoscope}} in patients <b>with</b> otitis <b>media</b> <b>with</b> effusion may justify adenoidectomy in otitis <b>media</b> <b>with</b> effusion in the future. METHODS: A prospective study was carried out at GMS Memorial Academy of ENT and head neck studies from 15 th December 2005 -April 2007. Study group comprised of 32 children <b>with</b> otitis <b>media</b> <b>with</b> effusion and control group of 28 children with clinically normal ear and nose. Rigid nasal endoscope was used for grading of adenoid in study and control group. The severity of otitis <b>media</b> <b>with</b> effusion was assessed by preoperative air-bone gap and thickness of the fluid aspirated from middle ear during ventilation tube insertion. RESULTS: In the study group 13 out of 32 had grade 4 adenoid hypertrophy. This grade 4 adenoid hypertrophy was found to be statistically significant in children <b>with</b> otitis <b>media</b> <b>with</b> effusion (P < 0. 0002). In control group 15 out of 28 had grade 1 adenoid hypertrophy which was significant in the same group (P < 0. 002). Air-bone gap and thickness of fluid did not correlate with the increasing grade of adenoid hypertrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Grade 4 adenoid hypertrophy was statistically found to be significant <b>with</b> otitis <b>media</b> <b>with</b> effusion but severity of hypertrophy were not reflected by hearing loss and thickness of fluid.

Parise joined fellow free agent signee Ryan Suter in signing with the Wild; Suter signed on terms identical to Parise's deal. Parise would wear number 11 with the Wild, the same number that his father J. P. wore with the North Stars, as number 9 was already taken by team captain Mikko Koivu. Both Parise and Suter were named alternate captains for the Wild on July 10.|$|E

Thorpe began his campaign with a victory over Hackett in the 400m freestyle in a time five seconds outside his world record. Afterwards, he revealed that both he and Hackett had deliberately conserved energy for the 4×100m freestyle relay later in the night. Australia subsequently won the relay, with Thorpe again overtaking Jason Lezak in the last 50m. He subsequently won the 200m freestyle, and anchored the 4×200m freestyle relay to victory to take his tally to four golds. After qualifying second in the 100m freestyle, Thorpe came from fourth at the 50m mark win his fifth gold in a time of 48.84s. Thorpe's run ended in the 4×100m medley relay final, when despite setting the second fastest ever relay split of 47.20s, Australia were defeated.|$|E
5|$|The Raptors {{continued}} to rebuild during the 2005 NBA draft, selecting Charlie Villanueva, Joey Graham, Roko Ukić and Uroš Slokar, with Villanueva's selection being very controversial amongst basketball pundits and Raptors fans alike. The Raptors started their training camp by trading Alston to the Houston Rockets for Mike James and signing free agent José Calderón {{as a backup}} for James. Despite the infusion of new players, Toronto's overall 2005–06 season was a disappointment; they set a franchise record by losing their first nine games and 15 out of their first 16 games. With losses mounting and media scrutiny intensifying, the Raptors hired ex-Purdue coach Gene Keady as an assistant off the bench to help develop the young Raptors team, as well as establish a defensive persona for the team. On January 15, 2006, the Raptors set a franchise points record in a 129–103 win over the Knicks when Villanueva hit a three-pointer late in the game. But {{less than a week}} later, the Raptors gave up an 18-point lead against the Los Angeles Lakers and allowed Lakers star Kobe Bryant to score 81 points, the second highest single-game total in NBA history. <b>With</b> <b>media</b> scrutiny intensifying once more and the Raptors entrenched {{at the bottom of the}} league in defensive field goal percentage, CEO Richard Peddie fired Babcock.|$|E

40|$|Background :  Otitis <b>Media</b> <b>with</b> Effusion(OME) {{also known}} as  Secretory Otitis Media, has been {{identified}} as the commonest middle ear condition causing deafness in children in developed countries. Neither the indication for surgical treatment nor the types and number of procedures used are uniform. Possible treatment includes myringotomy with or without insertion of ventilation tube either alone or with adenoidectomy and occasionally tonsillectomy. Aims and Objectives :  To assess the prevalence and the different modes of presentation of Otitis <b>Media</b> <b>with</b> Effusion among the rural school children of Puducherry and to assess the improvement in hearing after 6 months of surgical intervention done on patients <b>with</b> Otitis <b>Media</b> <b>with</b> Effusion. Materials and Methods:  A school screening camp was conducted on 600 children in the age group of 5 - 12 years in a government middle school near our medical college hospital for identifying children <b>with</b> Otitis <b>Media</b> <b>with</b> Effusion. Students <b>with</b> Otitis <b>Media</b> <b>with</b> Effusion were further classified into 4 groups for various interventional procedures namely adenotonsillectomy with bilateral grommet insertion (Group A), adenoidectomy with bilateral grommet insertion (Group B), bilateral grommet insertion (Group C),  bilateral myringotomy with wide field incision in the antero-inferior quadrant (Group D). Result : The prevalence was almost in equal proportions in the age group between 5 - 12 years and the overall prevalence of Otitis <b>Media</b> <b>with</b> Effusion among the study population was 13. 3 %. The adenotonsillectomy with bilateral grommet insertion procedure had shown a significant improvement in hearing, which was measured by using pure tone audiometry by assessing the mean air-bone gap, which was 9. 81, 8. 27 and 6. 73 at the end of 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months respectively, when compared to the other procedures.   Conclusion : Adenotonsillectomy with bilateral grommet insertion should be considered in a child <b>with</b> Otitis <b>Media</b> <b>with</b> Effusion who is at risk for speech/language/hearing loss...|$|R
