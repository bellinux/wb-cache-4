5|$|The {{connectors}} at {{the back}} of the Stage allow the connection of a sustain pedal, a swell pedal for organ, a footswitch to select the rotary speaker emulation speed, and a control pedal to modify effects such as wah-wah. A set of screw-in legs are an available option for the 88 and 76 note models and a custom designed soft case is also available from Clavia. A third party company, Ocean Beach Digital, has manufactured a set of MIDI controlled drawbars for the Nord Stage, for users <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> to use real drawbars instead of the buttons provided as standard.|$|E
5|$|Unstable, always codenamed sid, is the trunk. Packages are {{accepted}} without checking the distribution as a whole. This branch is usually run by software developers {{who participate in}} a project and need the latest libraries available, and by those <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> bleeding-edge software. Debian does not provide full Sid installation discs, but rather a minimal ISO {{that can be used}} to install over a network connection. Additionally, this branch can be installed through a system upgrade from stable or testing.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} visual {{preference and}} value for fresh beef steaks differing in marbling level and color, consumers in Chicago and San Francisco (n = 124 per city) evaluated {{two pairs of}} steaks in a retail case. Steaks differing in marbling level (Modest/Moderate vs. Slight) and color (bright, cherry-red vs. dark red) were purchased at retail stores in each city. Consumers selected their preferred steak in each pair, described their selection criteria, and provided the price {{they were willing to}} pay {{for each of the four}} steaks. There was a difference in visual preference in each city, with most consumers preferring (P < 0. 01) low (Slight) over high (Moderate/Modest) marbling; however, more (P < 0. 01) consumers in Chicago (86. 7 %) preferred low marbling than in San Francisco (67. 0 %). Selection criteria were categorized into five groups: marbling, fat, color, appearance, and palatability. Marbling was mentioned by 65. 4 % of consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> high marbling, whereas 64. 9 % of consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> low marbling mentioned fat as a selection criterion. Bright, cherry-red color was preferred by a higher (P < 0. 01) percentage of consumers in both Chicago and San Francisco (67. 6 and 76. 5 %, respectively). Color was mentioned both by consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> bright, cherry-red color (64. 8 %) and those <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> dark red color (63. 9 %). All preference groups were willing to pay more for their preferred steak (P < 0. 01), but consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> low marbling were willing to pay more (P < 0. 01) for their preferred steak than consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> high marbling. Consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> bright, cherry-red color were willing to pay more (P < 0. 01) for their preferred steak than consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> dark red color. Consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> low marbling seemed to desire lean products, and consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> high marbling seemed to desire products with high eating quality. In this study, consumers were willing to pay more to purchase their preferred product; however, most consumers preferred low marbling and bright, cherry-red color...|$|R

5|$|By 2007, Songpol Somsri, a Thai {{government}} scientist, had crossbred {{more than}} ninety varieties of durian to create Chantaburi No.1, a cultivar without the characteristic odour. Another hybrid, Chantaburi No. 3, develops the odour {{about three days}} after the fruit is picked, which enables an odourless transport yet satisfies consumers <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> the pungent odour. On 22 May 2012, two other cultivars from Thailand that also lack the usual odour, Long Laplae and Lin Laplae, were presented to the public by Yothin Samutkhiri, governor of Uttaradit Province from where these cultivars were developed locally, while he announced the dates for the yearly durian fair of Laplae District, and the name giver to both cultivars.|$|E
25|$|Keg beer was {{replacing}} traditional cask ale in {{all parts}} of the UK, primarily because it requires less care to handle.

CAMRA has lobbied the British Parliament to ensure support for cask ale and microbreweries have sprung up to serve those consumers <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> traditional cask beer.|$|E

25|$|Thinking {{and feeling}} are the {{decision-making}} (judging) functions. The thinking and feeling functions are both {{used to make}} rational decisions, based on the data received from their information-gathering functions (sensing or intuition). Those <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> thinking tend to decide things from a more detached standpoint, measuring the decision by what seems reasonable, logical, causal, consistent, and matching a given set of rules. Those <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> feeling tend to come to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation, looking at it 'from the inside' and weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony, consensus and fit, considering {{the needs of the}} people involved. Thinkers usually have trouble interacting with people who are inconsistent or illogical, and tend to give very direct feedback to others. They are concerned with the truth and view it as more important.|$|E
