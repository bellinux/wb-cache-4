40|$|Abstract. Detecting the weld {{position}} is the precondition of seam tracking during an arc welding process, and {{is crucial to}} achieve high-quality welds. Visual sensing {{is one of the}} most attractive approaches to detect the weld position, which provides valuable information to control the arc following the expected path. The <b>weld</b> <b>edge</b> is main characteristics of the weld position image, here the visual technique for detecting the weld position based on Hough transformation is proposed. The weld position can be detected and recognized through Hough transformation, while the <b>weld</b> <b>edge</b> image is detected using the Canny operators. And Hough transformation is modified based on the actual weld situation. Therefore, the precision of the weld detection can be improved.

This spatial distribution study, using survey data from seven dryland wheat Welds at four locations in north-cen-tral Montana over two years, examined: (1) the spatial distribution and spatial association of C. cinctus infestation and parasitism, and (2) parasitism {{in response to}} the level of C. cinctus infestation. Spatial distribution analyses revealed that C. cinctus infestations were signiWcantly aggregated along <b>Weld</b> <b>edges</b> in three of Wve Welds, while parasitism followed a random spatial distribution in all Wve Welds. We demonstrate that the level of parasitism is highest for lower levels of C. cinctus infestation, in Welds where parasitoids are either scarce or abundant. The combination of (1) a spatial aggregation of C. cinctus infestations along <b>Weld</b> <b>edges,</b> and (2) a potential negative interaction between parasitism and C. cinctus infestation may lower the level of parasitism at high host densities. This out-come can be viewed as beneWcial to the insect pest, because parasitized C. cinctus larvae are at a greater risk of being cannibalized by conspeciWcs. An equally plausible hypothesis for this negative interaction is a limitation on the successful location of unparasitized hosts at higher host densities, which is also compelling because of the cryptic location of hosts within wheat stems that belie little vis-ible evidence of infestation.

40|$|The {{geometrical}} {{aspects of}} laser hybrid welding before, {{during and after}} the process differ from autonomous laser welding and from arc welding. When studying the fatigue behaviour of laser hybrid welded fillet joints we identified that the microgeometry, i. e. the surface ripples can be more critical than the macrogeometry of the weld surface and even than lack of fusion (LOF), which frequently was detected. The plastic replica method was applied to measure the toe radii at the <b>weld</b> <b>edges</b> while the topography was identified by interferometric profilometry. From metallurgical analysis of the joint interface the tendency to LOF can be explained. Stress analysis was carried out by FEA for the complex joint geometry and bending load situation, showing maximum stress on the weld toes, even when including LOF. It was shown that the position and value of the maximum stress depends on a non-trivial combination of the weld geometry, including possible LOF, and the surface topography. Thus it can be explained that at compressive stress conditions LOF does not contribute significantly to the fatigue strength of laser hybrid welds while the surface topography does. Recommendations for defining and in turn avoiding critical geometrical aspects during the welding process are discussed. Godkänd; 2009; 20091103 (minala...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAustenitic {{stainless}} steels are generally {{known to have}} very good laser weldability, when ordinary grades of sheets are concerned. But {{it is not necessarily}} the case, if special grades of fully austenitic structures with e. g. high molybdenum, or thick-section are used. It is also known that hot cracking susceptibility is strictly controlled by composition and welding parameters. If solidification is primary ferritic, hot cracking resistance is dramatically increased. It is also well known that laser welding needs a careful control of <b>weld</b> <b>edge</b> preparation and air gap between the edges. The dependence on edge quality can be decreased by using filler metal, either cold wire, hot wire or hybrid laser-arc welding. An additional role is high molybdenum contents where micro segregation can cause low local contents in weld which can decrease the corrosion properties, if filler metal is not used. Another feature in laser welding is its incomplete mixing, especially in thick section applications. It causes inhomogeneity, which can make uneven microstructure, as well as uneven mechanical and corrosion propertiesIn this presentation the features of laser welding of thick section austenitic {{stainless steels}} are highlighted. Thick section (up to 60 mm) can be made by multi-pass laser or laser hybrid welding. In addition to using filler metal, it requires careful joint figure planning, laser head planning, weld parameter planning, weld filler metal selection, non-destructive and destructive testing and metallography to guarantee high-quality welds in practice.

A practicable procedure was developed for the welding of this transition joint and {{the properties of the}} weld were evaluated by mechanical testing and metallurgical evaluation. After evaluating the technical aspects of the project and their relation to the fabrication of the generator, it was considered desirable to overlay the <b>welding</b> <b>edge</b> of the 2 1 / 4 % Cr- 1 % Mo steel with a suitable austenitic weld metul which would subsequently be welded to the type 316 stainless steel of the superheater.

40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess the total fatigue lifetimeof 5083 -O aluminum alloy spot-welded joints including the crack initiation and propagation life. To this end, first, the nonlinear finite element analysis was carried out to obtain the local stress and strain in the spot <b>weld</b> <b>edge</b> and then the modified Morrow's damage equation was adopted to predict the crack initiation life. Next, three dimensional finite element model based on the experimental observations of dominate fatigue kinked crack angle and the crack path was used for simulating the fatigue crack in the spot welded joints. The linear elastic fracture mechanics approach was used to obtain the local stress intensity factors related to fracture modes I and II in the crack tip. Fatigue crack growth life was estimated using the Walker equation. Finally, the total fatigue life of spot welded joint was obtained from the summation of fatigue crack initiation and propagation phases. To have a confirmation, the numerical predictions of total fatigue life of spot welded joints have been compared with the available experimental fatigue test data. The results showed that there was a very good agreement between theoretical propagation and experimental values of total fatigue lifetime. Therefore, one may conclude that propagation phase plays very important role in evaluation of fatigue life. The initiation fatigue life can be, also, neglected in evaluating the fatigue life since the values of experimental fatigue and propagation theoretical fatigue lives were very close to each other.

The operating principle of these methods is that, under certain arrangement of the electrodes, the defect or crack in a conducting specimen will cause a measurable increase in resistance between given points compared to the situation without the defect or crack. In recent years, this simple contact technique was largely obscured by more sophisticated noncontacting eddy-current techniques especially in industrial applications.
