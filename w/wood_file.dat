40|$|Abstract- This paper {{outlines}} the effective filing process which {{is done by}} machine. Filing operation {{can be used on}} a wide range of materials as a finishing and burr removing operation. However mostly hand filing is done in industrial fields which is time consuming and not effective as much. Filing is probably very important and most frequent operation in metal work. The filing is done generally by hand with one hand on wood handle and other hand on tip of file. The aim of the present work is reduce human efforts in the filing process by designing the advanced filing machine. There are many problems related to hand filing. So, this paper describes filing process by use of small machine. Prior to the development of modern machining equipment it provided a relatively accurate means for the production of small parts, especially those with flat surfaces. This machine will definitely help in reducing time and human effort in metal as well as <b>wood</b> <b>filing</b> process. Filling machine is in compact size, portable and can be taken anywhere on shop floor. This machine is electrically operated and very easy to handle with one hand. The working model of filling machine is designed in Pro-Engineer software...|$|R

As the kinetic properties of these two main isoenzymes differ slightly (Bourbonnais et al. 1995; Moldes & Sanromán 2006), different proportions of isoenzymes in the mixture can lead to slightly different oxidation behavior.

Embargo ends 16 th Aug 2017 - smAbstract to replace when embargo ended: The study of human palaeopathology has developed considerably in the last three decades resulting in a structured and standardised framework of practice, based upon skeletal lesion patterning and differential diagnosis. By comparison, disarticulated zooarchaeological assemblages have precluded the observation of lesion distributions, resulting in a dearth of information regarding differential diagnosis and a lack of standard palaeopathological recording methods. Therefore, zoopalaeopathology has been restricted to the analysis of localised pathologies and ‘interesting specimens’. Under present circumstances, researchers can draw little confidence that the routine recording of palaeopathological lesions, their description or differential diagnosis will ever form a standard part of zooarchaeological analysis. This has impeded the understanding of animal disease in past society and, in particular, has restricted the study of systemic disease. This research tackles this by combining the disciplines of human palaeopathology and zoopalaeopathology and focusing on zoonotic disease. The primary aim of this research was to investigate the skeletal manifestation of bTB in cattle, sheep/goat and pig to establish differential diagnostic criteria for its identification in zooarchaeological assemblages. Methods commonplace in human palaeopathology were adapted and applied to zoopalaeopathology, in addition to radiography and aDNA analysis. The results emphasise the difficulties but also the potential associated with the identification of systemic diseases in zooarchaeological assemblages. An approach to the classification of potentially infectious lesions is presented that enables the calculation of crude prevalence in disarticulated assemblages. In addition, the potential for aDNA analysis to shed further light on animal disease in the past is emphasised.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2009. Major: Pharmacology. Advisor: W. Gibson <b>Wood.</b> 1 {{computer}} <b>file</b> (PDF); viii, 112 pages. Two {{key players}} in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are amyloid beta protein (Aβ) and apolipoprotein E (apoE). We and others have reported that Aβ elevates apoE protein levels in astrocytes, which in turn could alter lipid trafficking and cell function. The mechanism for the Aβ-induced increase in apoE levels is not clearly understood. We propose that Aβ affects apoE transcriptionally through the activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor (βAR), cAMP and the activator protein 2 (AP- 2). To test this hypothesis it was first determined if the stimulation of apoE protein levels by Aβ was triggered by an upregulation of apoE mRNA, in contrast to changes in secretion or degradation. The results show a time-dependent increase in apoE mRNA expression levels with peak expression reached after 1 hour of Aβ treatment. βAR antagonists were used to evaluate the involvement of the βAR. The antagonists significantly inhibited the Aβ-induced stimulation of apoE mRNA and protein levels. In order to further understand the mechanism behind these results we assessed cAMP role in the proposed Aβ-apoE pathway. This second messenger has been associated with AD and has been shown to elevate apoE message and secretion levels. The data shows an Aβ-dependent elevation in cAMP levels as well as an increase in apoE levels after dBcAMP treatment, confirming the activation of a cAMP-dependent pathway. In addition, I provide evidence that confirms the participation of the transcription factor AP- 2, specifically that of AP- 2 β. AP- 2 is known to be unregulated by cAMP and to bind to the apoE promoter. I report an increase in AP- 2 β translocation to the nucleus after both cAMP and Aβ treatment and confirm its participation in the activation of the apoE promoter. In conclusion, my work reveals a novel pathway for Aβ stimulation of apoE abundance in astrocytes involving βAR and the transcription factor AP- 2 β. These findings not only help clarify the relationship between Aβ and apoE but also help understand AD progression and possibly show a mechanism that could aid in the fight against this fast growing disease...|$|R
