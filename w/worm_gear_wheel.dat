40|$|Abstract: <b>Worm</b> <b>gear</b> {{is usually}} made of bronze, {{which is a}} {{precious}} and nonferrous metal. In order to substitute for the bronze, {{a new kind of}} antifriction composite material of polymer-matrix, ZW- 1 material has been successfully developed. Compared with <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of bronze, <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of ZW- 1 material has made <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission possess many advantageous properties. In order to bring the excellent properties of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 material into play and substitute for bronze, the test for anti-fracture capacity of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of ZW- 1 material under static load has been made. A simple test-bed is designed. The test has been carried out under static load. The test of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> with ZW- 1 and nylon materials, different teeth numbers„ÄÅtooth width and tooth forms is made. The test findings show that in the test conditions the invalidation of ZW- 1 <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> is radial fracture in gear rim. Applying stress transmission theory and micrographic analysis, fracture mechanism of ZW- 1 material is found out, namely degumming on the interface between fiber and polymer. Anti-fracture capacity of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> of ZW- 1 material is twenty three times as much as that of bronze worm gear(Q/ZB 125 - 73). Archimedes <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> has the same anti-fracture capacity as arc tooth <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> of ZW- 1 material. Macrographic analysis shows that load concentration and contact stress concentration of bolt hole caused by bending bolt are significant factors which affect invalidation of <b>worm</b> <b>gear.</b> The test result shows an important fact that overlapping coefficient of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 material <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> is much higher than that of calculating in theory, for small modulo of elasticity has a good effect upon the <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 <b>worm</b> <b>gear...</b>|$|R
