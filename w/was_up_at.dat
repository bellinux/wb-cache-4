25|$|On November 8, 1999, Toronto traded star outfielder Shawn Green to the Los Angeles Dodgers for left-handed relief pitcher Pedro Borbón and right-fielder Raúl Mondesí. Green {{had told}} the Jays {{that he would not}} be re-signing when his {{contract}} <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the end of the year (he wished to play closer to his home in Southern California).|$|E
25|$|In {{the top of}} {{the ninth}} inning, Vuckovich retired Jorge Orta on a ground ball. Vuckovich then struck out Richie Zisk. For the day, Zisk had four hits in five at bats. With one out to go for the win, Jim Spencer hit a line drive to left field but Scott dropped the ball for a two-base error. Oscar Gamble <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the plate and he {{grounded}} out to the shortstop. The Jays won their first game in franchise history with Jerry Johnson picking up the win while Vuckovich got the first save.|$|E
25|$|Sting {{returned}} to singles matches in 1989, starting the year off by wrestling Flair to a one-hour draw in Atlanta's Omni on New Year's Day. He {{would also have}} his first experience in Japan with a brief tour in All Japan Pro Wrestling, with his most notable match in AJPW against Dan Spivey on January 25. After a long push, Sting won his first title in the NWA when he defeated Rotundo for the NWA Television Championship at a live event in March. Sting defended the Television title actively but tended to face sub-par challengers such as The Iron Sheik. In mid-1989, The Great Muta challenged Sting at The Great American Bash. The match was booked with a classic, controversial Dusty finish even though Rhodes (the namesake of the technique) had been fired months earlier. Sting got the three-count and was announced as the winner, but a replay showed Muta's shoulder <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the count of two. The NWA decided to declare the title vacant. Sting and Muta battled in many rematches for the vacant Television title, but they always ended in disqualification, giving neither man the championship. Eventually, Muta won a No Disqualification match against Sting at a live event in September by using a blackjack to get the win and the title.|$|E

500|$|On {{arriving}} at Suez, {{the water that}} the Battalion had been promised {{was nowhere to be}} found. They were assured that the water was coming, but hours later it still had not appeared. Elliott then made one of the [...] "vigorous protests" [...] that he was becoming famous for. He even threatened to march them back across the Suez Canal to get them a drink. [...] "It was outrageous to deprive men of water in the desert" [...] Elliott thundered. He was assured that the water would be available at 05:30 the next morning. Elliott <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 05:00, and found many of his men had been unable to sleep due to their thirst, and were licking at the taps around camp. He found the camp's Chief Engineer who informed him that the Egyptian civil authorities had not provided enough water for the troops in camp, and that he had strict orders not to start the pumps before 08:00, as it would wake the II Anzac Corps Commander, Lieutenant General Sir Alexander Godley. Elliott remounted his horse and went to II Anzac Corps Headquarters, where he informed a yawning staff officer in silk pyjamas that unless the water was turned on in the next five minutes, the brigade would be assembling and telling the Corps Commander exactly what they thought of him. The staff officer made a phone call, and Elliott was warned that he shouldn't make such a fuss again. He simply replied that he would do whatever was needed to help his men whenever he had to.|$|E
2500|$|At 16, DeVante Swing {{traveled}} to Minneapolis, hoping to visit Paisley Park Studios {{in order to}} audition to Prince. Swing would later say, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Paisley Park every day begging for a job, asking people to listen to my tape. The receptionist kept saying she couldn’t help me". The rejection motivated Swing to relocate back to North Carolina, and work to improve his songwriting and production skills. Upon arriving, Swing continued to record with the group's additional members, eventually forming Jodeci, and began work on a demo tape to present to label executives.|$|E

Tereshchenko owned an aircraft construction business and wanted to hire someone to test his designs. When her contract with Fokker expired, four months later, Golanchikova returned to Russia to work for Tereshchenko. On 1 December 1913, she signed a contract to become the first female test pilot, agreeing to test [...] "Farman-22" [...] aircraft manufactured in the Chervonskaya airplane workshop, in Chervone.

2500|$|Lennon, being {{mindful of}} Elvis Presley's [...] "All Shook Up", wanted {{something}} equally as stirring: [...] "I don't {{know where the}} 'yeah yeah yeah' came from [...] I remember when Elvis did 'All Shook Up' {{it was the first}} time in my life that I had heard 'uh huh', 'oh yeah', and 'yeah yeah' all sung in the same song". The song also included a number of falsetto [...] "wooooo"'s, which Lennon acknowledged as being inspired by the Isley Brothers' recording of [...] "Twist and Shout", which the Beatles had earlier recorded, and which had also been inserted into the group's previous single, [...] "From Me to You". As Lennon later said: [...] "We stuck it in everything". McCartney recalls them playing the finished song on acoustic guitars to his father Jim at home immediately after the song was completed: [...] "We went into the living room and said 'Dad, listen to this. What do you think? And he said 'That's very nice son, but there's enough of these Americanisms around. Couldn't you sing 'She loves you, yes, yes, yes!'. At which point we collapsed in a heap and said 'No, Dad, you don't quite get it!'". EMI recording engineer Norman Smith had a somewhat similar reaction, later recounting, [...] "I was setting up the microphone when I first saw the lyrics on the music stand, 'She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah!' I thought, Oh my God, what a lyric! This is going to be one that I do not like. But when they started to sing it—bang, wow, terrific, I <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the mixer jogging around." ...|$|E
