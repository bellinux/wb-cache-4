50|$|Dr John Gamgee, Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at the Dick Veterinary College, Edinburgh invited other {{veterinary}} {{academics and}} veterinarians from Europe {{to a meeting}} at Hamburg, Germany in July 1863. This later {{became known as the}} World Veterinary Congress and was attended by 103 veterinarians from ten countries. The objective of the meeting was to coordinate the response to rinderpest and other epizootic diseases. At the sixth such congress in Budapest, Hungary in 1906, a permanent committee was set up to provide an organisational link between the congresses, and at the sixteenth congress in Madrid, Spain, in 1959, it was determined to form the <b>World</b> <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Association</b> (WVA). At the same congress, a decision was taken to also set up the International Association of Small Animal Specialists, for organisations representing small animal practitioners, and this had its first meeting two years later in London. By the twenty-fifth congress in Yokohama, Japan, in 1995, there were over ten thousand participants representing 82 countries.|$|E

50|$|Pet Nutrition Alliance The Pet Nutrition Alliance (PNA) {{was created}} by {{veterinary}} organizations including the American Animal Hospital <b>Association,</b> the American <b>Veterinary</b> Medical <b>Association</b> (AVMA), the <b>World</b> Small Animal <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Association</b> (WSAVA) and others to help raise awareness {{about the importance of}} proper pet nutrition, and the value of nutritional assessments for every pet, every time. The PNA is a response to the education gap in providing nutritional assessments and proper nutrition for pets. With 55% of U.S. dogs and cats overweight in the United States (according to a 2012 survey by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention), proper nutrition is more important now than ever before. With the rise of obesity, dogs and cats are at an increased risk for weight-related disorders such as diabetes, osteoarthritis, hypertension, and many cancers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{international}} prominence {{accorded the}} 'One Health' concept of co-ordinated activity {{of those involved}} in human and animal health is a modern incarnation of a long tradition of comparative medicine, with roots in the ancient civilizations and a golden era during the 19 th century explosion of knowledge in the field of infectious disease research. Modern One Health tends to focus on zoonotic pathogens emerging from wildlife and production animal species, {{but one of the most}} significant One Health challenges is rabies for which there is a canine reservoir. This review considers the role of small companion animals in One Health and specifically addresses the major vector-borne infectious diseases that are shared by man, dogs and cats. The most significant of these are leishmaniosis, borreliosis, bartonellosis, ehrlichiosis, rickettsiosis and anaplasmosis. The challenges that lie ahead in this field of One Health are discussed, together with the role of the newly formed <b>World</b> Small Animal <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Association</b> One Health Committee. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to test the {{accuracy}} and consistency of veterinary pathologists, not specialists in hematopathology, in applying the World Health Organization (WHO) system of classification of canine lymphomas. This study represents an initiative of the ACVP Oncology Committee, and the classification has been endorsed by the <b>World</b> Small Animal <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Association</b> (WASVA). Tissue biopsies from cases of canine lymphoma were received from veterinary oncologists, and a study by pathologists given only signalment {{was carried out}} on 300 cases. Twenty pathologists reviewed these 300 cases with each required to choose a diagnosis {{from a list of}} 43 B and T cell lymphomas. Three of the 20 were hematopathologists who determined the consensus diagnosis for each case. The 17 who formed the test group were experienced but not specialists in hematopathology, and most were diplomates of the American or European Colleges of Veterinary Pathology. The overall accuracy of the 17 pathologists on the 300 cases was 83 %. When the analysis was limited to the 6 most common diagnoses, containing 80 % of all cases, accuracy rose to 87 %. In a test of reproducibility enabled by reintroducing 5 % of cases entered under a different identity, the overall agreement {{between the first and second}} diagnosis ranged from 40 to 87 %.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>World</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Poultry <b>Association</b> (WVPA) {{was formed}} in 1959, the honour {{of being the first}} President of the Association going to Professor de Blieck and Secretary to Dr R. F. Gordon, who had both championed its formation. The first WVPA Conference (the name ‘Congress' was not applied until the third meeting) took place in Utrecht in 1960. The second (1962) and third (1965) were in Cambridge and Paris, respectively. The fourth Congress, in Belgrade (1969) was a {{landmark}} one for two reasons firstly, submitted papers were introduced and secondly, the notion of a WVPA journal, later to be called Avian Pathology, was first discussed. A year later, 1970, the journal came into being, Professor Klimeš (Czhechoslovakia), the driving force behind its creation, being the first Editor-in-Chief, with Professor Kosic (Yugoslavia) as production Editor. Due to the ill health of Professor Klimeš, Peter Biggs was confirmed as Editor-in-Chief (EiC) in 1973. A charitable company, Avian Pathology Ltd., {{was formed in}} 1980, under which Avian Pathology was published. Dr L. N. (Jim) Payne succeeded Dr Biggs as EiC in 1988. The fifth and six Congresses were in Munich (1973) and Atlanta, Georgia, USA (1977), respectively. Four years later, at the Oslo Congress, it was agreed that the rather crude logo adopted at the fourth Congress should improved. This was done and is the current logo. On the 25 th anniversary (1985) of the first WVPA Congress, the eighth Congress was held in Jerusalem. Membership had increased to almost 1000, with members in 39 countries, 22 of which had branches of WVPA.
