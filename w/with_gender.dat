5|$|Largely {{concerned}} <b>with</b> <b>gender</b> issues, Midas {{comments on}} the definitions of femininity and masculinity {{in the early nineteenth}} century and the developing ideology of separate spheres which encouraged women to restrict themselves to domestic affairs and men to political affairs. Part of the Romantic interest in rewriting classical myths, Midas focuses on challenging patriarchy and satirising the unbounded accumulation of wealth.|$|E
5|$|As a {{character}} introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long's weapon, {{a pair of}} nunchaku with mounted blades, were selected before {{other elements of the}} character. One of several weapons initially considered for the character Hwang early in development, they were designed to be unique amongst the other weapons in the game. Li Long's design and concept were built to revolve around them, starting <b>with</b> <b>gender,</b> then physical measurements, and lastly background details. After his appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist, his character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on him, and then animated by a motion designer using motion capture to create his in-game movements. During development, many ideas were considered for Li Long's appearance, including several younger drafts. Another idea considered was for him to fight using kung fu, instead of solely with his nunchaku.|$|E
5|$|Mental health {{consists}} of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence of mental health disorders among women in India, including older age, low educational attainment, fewer children in the home, lack of paid employment and excessive spousal alcohol use. There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} disadvantages associated <b>with</b> <b>gender</b> increase the risk for mental health disorders. Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may view themselves as less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their ability to cope with various mental disorders.|$|E

50|$|As a {{means of}} coping, African American women relied heavily on {{the support of the}} black community. They also coped by overachieving or being overly successful, and {{thinking}} positively. Research demonstrated that the coping mechanisms employed by African American women were not always beneficial because they heightened distress rather than decrease it. Possible ways to cope <b>with</b> <b>gendered</b> racism include education, in which African American women are provided with a space to openly discuss their experiences and develop strategies to better handle situations when they are being discriminated against. Another research experiment was conducted in order to assess how black female college students cope <b>with</b> <b>gendered</b> racial microaggressions. Microaggressions are the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.|$|R
25|$|One {{idiosyncratic}} {{feature of}} Darger's artwork is its depiction of apparently transgender characters.

Darger's second novel, Crazy House, deals with these subjects more explicitly.|$|E

They also thought it was selfish of parents to want to control their children and that this did not give room for the child to grow as their own person.|$|E
