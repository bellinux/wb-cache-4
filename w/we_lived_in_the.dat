2500|$|During {{his time}} at Gravesend, Gordon was much {{involved}} in charity work, trying to ensure that homeless boys he found begging on the street did not go hungry while attempting to find them homes and jobs. Many of the [...] "scuttlers" [...] as Gordon fondly called the homeless boys were taken in by him to live at his home, the Fort House. Outside of the Fort House were graffito written on the wall {{by one of the}} evidently less educated boys that read: [...] "God Bless the Kernel". Another [...] "scuttler" [...] later recalled: [...] "He made me feel, first of all, the meaning of the phrase, the Goodness of God. Goodness become to me, through Gordon, the most desirable of ideas...We were under the spell of Gordon's personality. <b>We</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magic of his mystery-enchanted".|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Maurice Garin well. I met him {{and talked}} to him almost every day because <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same area, 200m from each other, at Lens. Le Père Garin, as my father and grandfather called him used to bring out a chair in fine weather {{and sit in the}} doorway of the little office of the service station he owned at 116 rue de Lille in [...] Lens, under the sign for Antar fuel and oil. My barber was in the neighbouring house and I used to go there once a month to have a crew cut, [...] which was the fashion in those days. My friends and I were aged seven to ten and on our one-speed bikes we used to pin numbers on our back... and we never missed riding past Maurice Garin in a tight group so that he would see. It's strange that nobody thought to take a picture of me, the little kid, alongside the first great champion of the biggest race in the world. But life's like that.|$|E
2500|$|Rolfe was an {{enthusiastic}} letter writer. [...] John Holden recalled that [...] "Corvo {{was one of}} those men who never speak a word if they can write it. <b>We</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same house, a very little one, yet he would always communicate with me by note if I was not {{in the same room with}} him. He had dozens of letter books. He seized upon every opportunity for writing a letter, and every letter, whether to a publisher or to a cobbler, was written with the same care." [...] About a thousand of his letters have survived, and several sequences of them have been published in limited editions. [...] The letters reveal a lively, intelligent and absorbent mind, but because of Rolfe’s paranoiac tendencies they are often disputatious and recriminatory. [...] Among the commentators who rated Rolfe’s letters more highly than his fiction was W H Auden, who wrote that Rolfe [...] "had every right to be proud of his verbal claws … A large vocabulary is essential to the invective style, and Rolfe by study and constant practice became one of the great masters of vituperation." [...] The letters have yet to be collected into a single scholarly edition.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly thereafter, Miller {{appeared}} {{in an interview}} with Chris Matthews on the MSNBC show Hardball. Here, Miller became visibly angry. Matthews criticized the premise of Miller's assertion that Kerry had actually voted against such defense programs by noting that in voting on appropriations bills, senators often vote against a version of a bill without wishing to oppose every item in that bill. Matthews also asked Miller to compare his assertion that a military under Kerry would be armed with only [...] "spitballs" [...] with rhetoric from Democrats that Republicans [...] "want to starve little kids, they {{want to get rid of}} education, they want to kill the old people" [...] and whether such level of rhetoric was constructive. When Miller expressed irritation at this line of questioning, Matthews pressed Miller with the question, [...] "Do you believe now– do you believe, Senator, truthfully, that John Kerry wants to defend the country with spitballs?" [...] Miller at first said that he wished the interview had been face-to-face so that he could [...] "get a little closer up into your face." [...] Miller angrily told Matthews to [...] "get out of my face," [...] and declared, [...] "I wish <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day where you could challenge a person to a duel." [...] At the conclusion of the interview, Matthews asked [...] "Let's be friends," [...] which Miller ignored. Miller later said about the interview, [...] "That was terrible. I embarrassed myself. I’d rather it had not happened." ...|$|E
