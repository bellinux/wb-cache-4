[...] Marsh, who wrote for Rolling Stone, was one who, at the time, deemed the event an expression of bigotry, writing in a year-end 1979 feature that [...] "white males, eighteen to thirty-four {{are the most likely}} to see disco as the product of homosexuals, blacks, and Latins, and therefore they're the most likely to respond to appeals to wipe out such threats to their security.

500|$|The {{concerts in}} England and Ireland {{received}} mixed feedback from critics. Kitty Empire (The Observer) was not {{impressed with the}} show at Windsor Hall. Empire wrote, [...] "It's easy to sneer at boy bands, but always worth considering their appeal. It goes <b>without</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> One Direction are slick, and often bland. With the exception of their persuasive No 1 single, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", their songs aren't wildly distinctive". For the concert at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in London, James Robertson (Daily Mirror) gave the band a positive review. He states, [...] "The room shook with hair raising, ear drum piercing and (if there had been windows) glass-shattering screams. Each took a turn walking forward to embrace the cries from the sold-out Hammersmith Apollo while singing the lame-named Na, Na, Na. It {{was impossible to tell}} which one of the five boys had the biggest ovation but the loudest cheer came when Niall played acoustic guitar as they sang solo around an artificial camp fire". Another glowing review was done by Alexandra Ryan (Evening Herald) for the concert at Dublin's The O2. She says, [...] "THEY came, they saw, they conquered. Dreams came true for thousands of Irish female fans as their pop idols One Direction took to the stage at the O2. Swarms of screaming girls flocked to the sold-out venue last night as Zayn, Harry, Louis, Liam and Mullingar teen Niall Horan performed for 14,000 fans".|$|E

Orderly planning had become almost impossible in East Germany, with entire towns existing without physicians, crops going unharvested and fifty-five-year-olds put to work running street cars.

2500|$|Political {{scientist}} Daniel Barbu {{speaks of}} Ornea's works as having supplemented {{the lack of}} sociological research under communism, and thus one of the [...] "outstanding authors" [...] to have dedicated themselves to such overviews during that period (alongside Vladimir Tismăneanu, Pavel Câmpeanu, Henri H.

Trained as a sociologist but cohabitating, for the longest part of his career, with the community of literary historians, this author came closest of all exegetes of Romanian culture to offering a global investigation on the interrelationship to offering a global investigation of the interrelationship between literary, philosophical, sociological and economic ideas that confronted and influenced each other in the intellectual debates of the period 1860-1945." ...|$|E

In 1922, H. P. Davis suggested that the best solution was [...] "five or six large, well-located and powerful stations" [...] which [...] "could be licensed, protected and organized... and that it would become a matter of such public value, that endowments or Federal subsidies would be possible which would assist those responsible for the service to carry it on and to continue the development and research required to get the most value out of it."

He also {{compared}} it to another chillwave album that was released a few months before, Washed Out's Within And <b>Without,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Where Within is an immaculately conceived graduation from [...] Greene's early lo-fi work, Extraña is a minor refinement that still feels chintzy in places". Beck and Robertson also discussed Washed Out, as well as Toro y Moi, dubbing the album an unfunny parody of chillwave and also criticized it as [...] "such a strong homage to everything that's cool about retro-chic that you can't help but smell a rat". At PopMatters, Wisnicki wrote that Era Extraña did not have the same quality tunes and aesthetic that Psychic Chasms had, declaring that while each song on Psychic Chasms [...] "felt like getting to open another piece of candy", Era Extraña [...] "feels more like opening one of those refrigerated boxed sandwiches from the grocery store".|$|E

2500|$|Instances of this {{behavior}} {{have been found}} in the Bible. In a cave painting from at least 8000 BC in the Northern Italian Val Camonica a man is shown about to penetrate an animal. Raymond Christinger interprets that as a show of power of a tribal chief, and so we do not know if this practice was then more acceptable, and if the scene depicted was usual or unusual or whether it was symbolic or imaginary. The Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art says the scene may be humorous, as the penetrating man seems to be waving cheerfully with his hand at the same time. Potters seem to have spent time depicting the practice, but this may be because they found the idea amusing. Dr [...] "Jacobus X", said to be a nom-de-plume for a French author, said this was clearly [...] "before any known taboos against sex with animals existed." [...] Marc Epprecht states that authors such as Jacobus X do not deserve respect because their methodology is based on hearsay, and was designed for voyeuristic titillation of the reader. Masters said that since pre-historic man is prehistoric it goes <b>without</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> we know little of his sexual behaviour, depictions in cave paintings may only show the artist's subjective preoccupations or thoughts.|$|E
2500|$|Adelson {{says that}} because of his {{upbringing}} in an immigrant family in an underprivileged neighborhood of Boston, [...] "it went <b>without</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> we were Democrats". He attributed his family's loyalty to their belief that the Democratic Party of the 1930s and 1940s shared their commitment to charity, self-reliance, and accountability, as well as support for Jewish causes. In a 2012 Wall Street Journal op-ed titled [...] "I Didn't Leave the Democrats. They Left me", Adelson specifies three reasons why he switched political parties to the Republicans. First, he cites foreign policy, pointing to a Gallup poll that suggests Republicans are more supportive of Israel than Democrats. Second, he cites statistics that suggest Republicans are more charitable than Democrats. To support this claim Adelson cites {{a report from the}} Chronicle of Philanthropy, which claims, after studying tax data from the IRS, that U.S. states that vote Republican are more generous to charities than those states that vote Democratic. [...] "My father, who kept a charity box for the poor in our house ... would have frowned on this fact about modern Democrats." [...] Third, he cites a nonpartisan study of Illinois's finances by the State Budget Crisis Task Force and political scientist Walter Russell Mead claiming that Democratic Party economic policies don't deliver on their promises of social justice and have wrecked one of the country's potentially most prosperous and dynamic states (Illinois).|$|E

2500|$|Women who do {{not follow}} the {{domestic}} norm are looked down upon in society. Beauvoir is explaining that woman referred as “the other.” She states, “What is a woman?’...The fact that I ask it is in itself significant. A man would never get the notion of {{writing a book on}} the peculiar situation of the human male. But if I wish to define myself, I must first of all say: ‘I am a woman’; on this truth must be based all further discussion. A man never begins by presenting himself as an individual of a certain sex; it goes <b>without</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> he is a man. [...] It would be out of the question to reply: ‘And you think the contrary because you are a man,’ for it is understood that the fact of being a man is no peculiarity.” (34-5) As for man {{there is no need to}} define what is to be a man, there is no reason because they identified themselves as the superior part. Man represents both “the positive and the neutral,” which doesn’t need to be explained or defined, and it is self-explanatory. “Thus humanity is male and man defines woman not in relation to herself but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being.” (35) Men are the default setting and women are considered a recessive gender. “He is the Subject, he is the Absolute—she is the Other.” (35) It is like an asymmetrical comparison, but masculine and feminine aren’t asymmetrical.|$|E
