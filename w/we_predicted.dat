The researchers begin by stating information conducted by previous research that explained, [...] "subjects exposed to violent rap music {{were less likely to}} hire a Black applicant for a job that required intelligence (whereas a White applicant was not discriminated against), suggesting that priming one aspect of the Black stereotype (violent) increases the accessibility of related stereotypic traits" [...] (unintelligent; Macrae, Stangor, & Milne, 1994). With this previous research, Rudman and Lee wanted to provide information on how our actions are primed because of hostile rap music. They did so by exposing their subjects to either rap or popular mainstream music and then provided them with a questionnaire that assessed how they explicitly and implicitly viewed Black men. The researchers hypothesized that, [...] "Because <b>we</b> <b>predicted</b> that violent and misogynistic rap music would temporarily activate associations between Black men and negative attributes (e.g. hostile, violent, sexist), while simultaneously deactivating associations between Black men and positive attributes (e.g. calm, lawful, trustworthy) we used these attributes in our stereotype IAT" [...] (Rudman, Lee). Rudman and Lee then completed an experiment on 30 men that [...] "tested the assumption that violent and misogynistic rap music would activate automatic Black stereotypes in high and low prejudiced subjects alike (Devine, 1989). Subjects were exposed to either rap or popular music and their stereotypes regarding Black men were then assessed, both implicitly and explicitly. It was expected that rap music subjects' stereotype IAT scores would be higher, relative to controls. Explicit stereotypes were also obtained for comparison purposes" [...] (Rudman, Lee). After listening to the explicit and profane music, the subjects completed the IAT test which resulted in the following: [...] "Overall, subjects showed a strong tendency to associate Blacks with negative attributes and Whites with positive attributes. That is, subjects who performed the Black + negative task first were somewhat more likely to show automatic stereotyping, compared with subjects who performed the White + negative task first" [...] (Rudman, Lee). The researchers concluded that, [...] "Thus, exposure to violent and misogynistic rap music had the generalized effect of strengthening the association between Black men and negative attributes (e.g. hostile, criminal, sexist) and decreasing the association between Black men and positive attributes (e.g. calm, trustworthy, polite)" [...] (Rudmand, Lee).|$|E

[...] "I warned players about the fast play of Karabükspor", he said. [...] "Sometimes, no matter how much you talk, you are not prepared." [...] Touching on his legacy with the club, Kocaman described his coaching role at Fenerbahçe as the pinnacle of his career, but admitted the toils of the position proved too demanding for him. [...] "As a former Fenerbahçe player, being a coach in this team is the top of my coaching career. After two and a half years, I could not find enough strength to continue. [...] "I struggled too much and I can not carry on anymore. Thanks to everyone." [...] But on 27 December 2012, Kocaman has remained at the helm of the Fenerbahçe, retracting his decision to resign.
