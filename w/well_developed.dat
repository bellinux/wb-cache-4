5|$|Most rodents {{are small}} animals with robust bodies, short limbs, and long tails. They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food, {{excavate}} burrows, and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant material, but some have more varied diets. They {{tend to be}} social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other. Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy, to polygyny, to promiscuity. Many have litters of underdeveloped, altricial young, while others are precocial (relatively <b>well</b> <b>developed)</b> at birth.|$|E

The basisphenoid is wide and deep and the tympanic bullae are relatively small.|$|E
5|$|The hookbill's {{distinguishing}} characteristic was a heavy, parrotlike bill. The {{upper mandible}} hooked sharply downwards, while the heavy lower mandible hooked sharply upwards towards {{the middle of}} the upper mandible. This structure left a gap between the two mandibles when the bird held its beak closed. It is believed that the bill was pale pink in coloration. The jaw muscles were particularly <b>well</b> <b>developed</b> around the bill. The hookbill's tongue was primitive and nontubular.|$|E

5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) {{is short}} and deep. The mental foramen, an opening {{at the front of}} the mandible, just before the first molar, opens to the side. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, is <b>well</b> <b>developed.</b> The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their front edges, which are located below the first molar.|$|E
5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, the molars are pentalophodont (have the mesolophs and mesolophids, {{accessory}} crests, <b>well</b> <b>developed)</b> and bunodont, with the cusps {{higher than the}} connecting crests. The cusps on the upper molars are arranged in two longitudinal series, not three as in the black and brown rats. The front cusps of the first upper and lower molar (anterocone and anteroconid, respectively) are broad and not divided completely by an anteromedian flexus or flexid. Behind the anterocone, the anteroloph (a smaller crest) is complete and separated from the anterocone. On both {{the second and third}} lower molars, the anterolophid (a crest on the inner front corner) is present, a putative synapomorphy of the genus. The first molars have additional small roots in addition to the main ones, so that the upper first molar has four and the lower has three or four roots.|$|E
5|$|At the {{posterior}} {{angle of the}} wing base in some Diptera there {{is a pair of}} membranous lobes (squamae, or calypteres) known as the alula. The alula is <b>well</b> <b>developed</b> in the house fly. The outer squama (c) arises from the wing base behind the third axillary sclerite (3Ax) and evidently represents the jugal lobe of other insects (A, D); the larger inner squama (d) arises from {{the posterior}} scutellar margin of the tergum of the wing-bearing segment and forms a protective, hoodlike canopy over the halter. In the flexed wing the outer squama of the alula is turned upside down above the inner squama, the latter not being affected by the movement of the wing. In many Diptera a deep incision of the anal area of the wing membrane behind the single vannal vein sets off a proximal alar lobe distal to the outer squama of the alula.|$|E
