500|$|Wellman {{frequently}} {{conflicted with}} the military officers brought in to supervise the picture, especially the infantry commander whom he considered to have [...] "two monumental hatreds: fliers and movie people". After one argument Wellman retorted to the commander, [...] "You're just a goddamn fool because the government has told me {{you have to give}} me all your men and do just exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Although Wellman paid much attention to technical details in shooting, he used cars and clothing of the year during the filming, forgetting to use those of World War I. He took six weeks to fully edit the film and prepare it for release.|$|E
2500|$|A {{technique}} {{attributed to}} Sigmund Freud {{to help in}} making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: [...] "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to {{make up your mind}} and come to the right decision." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Worse. That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> see. I {{know you}} do not know. They will keep things from you, they will take you {{presently}} to a Pleasure City. But you have noticed {{men and women and}} children in pale blue canvas, with thin yellow faces and dull eyes?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... chief I(emph.) {{come you}} child seek, eh, is-it <b>what?,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> child marry (verbal noun) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To run {{was exactly}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to do," [...] Ray answered. [...] "You had the dispatch-box, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to see <b>you</b> safe away." ...|$|R
60|$|Any man {{who holds}} a place here, now, stands {{prepared}} at all times to vacate it. You are doing, now, exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to do a year ago.|$|R
60|$|FANNY. What does it matter? We're both ready. I havnt {{told you}} yet <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You've had no encouragement. In {{this case}} I {{should give you}} the greatest. Leave your husband before the worst comes; that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> promise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You'll do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do, sonny,' said Marshall, 'or I'll jest {{turn you}} over my knee {{and give you}} one of those spankings your mother forgot.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{visit is}} quite informal, my dear fellow; I can't say at all. But there is evidently much feeling; that is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to know. You haven't quite seen, I think, that--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Friends, that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want.</b> <b>You</b> bet!" [...] That was {{the work}} {{he was going to}} do--make acquaintances. A girl who would {{understand}} him, with whom he could trot about, seeing department-store windows and moving-picture shows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Tommy!" [...] she said. [...] "It {{was just}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to do. It's leaking a little, but that doesn't matter. Wasn't I telling you? It's {{the little things}} that count. And you remembered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't say you did, Bob. But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{do is to}} tell me {{everything}} that you know. Was there anybody in this office during my absence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Reasonable," [...] she interrupted. [...] "That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be! Ask {{yourself}} a plain question. Which {{is the more}} fitting place for her--my house, or your chambers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The moral je-ne-sais-quoi, so to speak,' said Marriott. 'That'll be all right. Wait till we get at 'em. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{turn your}} great brain to now is this letter.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{she said}} at last, [...] "you have done <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted.</b> <b>You</b> have given it more of the {{listening}} look. My good Piero,"--she turned towards him with bright moist eyes--"I am very grateful to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You’ve made {{a pretty}} mess of it," [...] groaned the other; [...] "there’ll {{be a fine}} set-out now. Why couldn’t you coax ’em away? That’s <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to do. That’s <b>what</b> <b>I</b> told you to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, George," [...] says Mr. Bucket, [...] "don't you go {{and commit}} yourself. I'm a-going to tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> for. There has been a murder in Lincoln's Inn Fields--gentleman {{of the name of}} Tulkinghorn. He was shot last night. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] she said. [...] "Now, listen. I {{tell you}} this upon my honor. He is my uncle, and his name is truly Delora!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be, Trot,' resumed my aunt, '--I don't mean physically, but morally; you {{are very}} well physically--is, a firm fellow. A fine firm fellow, with a will of your own. With resolution,' said my aunt, shaking her cap at me, and {{clenching}} her hand. 'With determination. With character, Trot--with strength of character {{that is not to}} be influenced, except on good reason, by anybody, or by anything. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be. That's what your father and mother might both have been, Heaven knows, and been the better for it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] I went on, [...] "I {{want you}} {{to find someone who}} understands explosives, and will {{undertake}} the business of blowing up the Fung idol." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{will talk}} some other way. <b>I</b> mean <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> {{to show me}} how to look at Miss Maybough. It sounds fantastic----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to go," [...] Paula urged. [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want.</b> <b>You</b> {{must bear}} with me. I am not {{considering}} myself. I am past considering myself. But I must consider Dick. I must consider you. I... I am so unused {{to such a}} situation," [...] she concluded with a wan smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Been {{playing with}} me, have you, all the time, {{like a cat}} and mouse? Knew all the time <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> for, but kept up the comedy. Is that it, eh?" [...] He was cooling down. The red colour was ebbing out of his face. He eyed her keenly. [...] "Who's been blabbing? Rita?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{rather have}} yours, John. But, in truth, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> say is, that I am right in doing this,--right in keeping my promise to my brother, and {{providing}} for his children." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> tell me," [...] she murmured, in {{tones of}} indefinable reserve. [...] "I quite believe in you, for I {{know you are}} very accomplished, because you study so hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then listen! Don't think! Here's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do! Get a two-weeks {{leave from}} your office. Weather's {{beginning}} to get chilly here. Let's run down to Charleston and Savannah and maybe Florida.|$|E
6000|$|Morton {{moved about}} the girl with growing excitement, a subtle fire {{mounting}} to his brain each time his fingers touched her smooth, round wrists. Once she said, [...] "I {{have never had a}} real test like this--this is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to do. If anything happens now it will be outside of me, won't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the good?" [...] {{he broke}} in, gloomily. [...] "You don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to know. <b>I</b> {{come down here}} for {{to find out the}} man as once owned this,"--he pulled the lock of hair out of his pocket again--"and you can't help me. I didn't believe it when you first said so, but I do now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to tell me. Did you ever--did {{you use to}} {{be afraid}} {{sometimes}} that I--that you--did you put off {{telling me that you}} cared for me so long because you thought, you dreaded--Oh, <b>I</b> don't see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can ever do to make it up to you if you did! Were you afraid I didn't care for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} generous about it," [...] Wingrave {{answered}} coldly. [...] "It is the arrangement I made with him, {{and to which}} I propose to adhere. You understand <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you call}} it honour?"--his host took him up with an {{intonation}} that often comes back to him. [...] "That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go in for. I mean the real thing. This is brummagem." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do {{with your}} patients. Dress up their minds in their best; get them out into the air; and cure their ills by the {{magnetism}} of more active, earnest lives." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's of {{not a bit}} of use,' said Dora, {{shaking her}} head, until the ear-rings rang again. 'You know what a little thing <b>I</b> am, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to call me from the first. If you can't do so, I am afraid you'll never like me. Are you sure you don't think, sometimes, {{it would have been}} better to have--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{mean about}} the price?" [...] The {{vice-consul}} nodded. [...] "That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> should {{speak to him}} about, Mr. Bennam, if you would. Tell him that I haven't got but a little money now, {{and he would have}} to make it very reasonable. That is, if {{you think it would be}} right for me to stay, afta the way he tried to treat Mrs. Lander." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Macrae {{looked at}} him rather curiously. 'You are dying of fatigue,' he said. 'All your ideas have been excellent, but I cannot let you kill yourself. Ideas are <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want.</b> <b>You</b> must stay with me to-day: I shall be {{communicating}} with London and other centres by the Giambresi machine; I shall need your advice, your suggestions. Now, do go to bed: you shall be called if you are needed.' ...|$|R
