5|$|A unique <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the Universe enabled by Hubble are the Hubble Deep Field, Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, and Hubble Extreme Deep Field images, {{which used}} Hubble's {{unmatched}} sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky {{that are the}} deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths. The images reveal galaxies billions of light years away, and have generated a wealth of scientific papers, providing a new <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the early Universe. The Wide Field Camera 3 improved the view of these fields in the infrared and ultraviolet, supporting the discovery {{of some of the}} most distant objects yet discovered, such as MACS0647-JD.|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} built, the Federal-style {{house had}} three stories. The completed house had {{four or five}} parlors. It was built of unpainted, cream-colored brick. The entrance was level with the ground, with an oriel window above it {{on the second floor}} and a Palladian <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the third floor above that. An oval portico protected visitors arriving at the front doors.|$|E
50|$|At {{the south}} end of the side facades are double-recessed arched 20-over-15 sash <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> {{slightly}} projecting portions with carved medallions. Other <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> those facades are identical to the flanking <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> the front. A wooden canopy shelters the loading dock at the rear.|$|R

50|$|It is a one-story brick {{building}} with a side tower. It featured green-painted wood shingles in its gable ends and on the tower. Wide, overhanging boxed eaves seem {{to be consistent with}} Prairie School style. It has fifty-six-over-one <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> the front, fifty-six-over-four <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> the side, and one-over-one <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> the back.|$|R
5|$|The chapel's {{iconography}} pays tribute {{in places}} {{to the other}} Abrahamic religions. Abraham himself is depicted in a stained glass <b>window</b> <b>on</b> {{the north side of}} the nave, together with a Star of David, a Christian cross, and a star and crescent. Other windows show Baruch Spinoza and Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi; both images were planned before the chapel was built.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the upper and lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the first floor was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E
5|$|Fixtures {{include a}} marble font which is {{contemporary}} with the church. There is much stained glass: the oldest, {{in the form}} of heraldic emblems in cartouches, dates from 1562 and is visible in the Diocletian window in the east wall and in another <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the southwest side. The east window was erected in memory of Sir Frank Stapleton, rector of Mereworth 1832–74. Other similar glass dates from the 17th and 18th centuries. Another, depicting the Raising of Lazarus, was designed by Frederic Shields for the Heaton, Butler and Bayne firm in 1889.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two rows}} of windows, one upon the other, {{on both sides of}} the mosque. The two lower <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> each side are rectangular. The three upper <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> each side are {{slightly}} arched. The <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> the portico wall are aligned only at the lower row. All the windows are enclosed in hand-carved decorations colored with white on blue.|$|R
50|$|<b>Windows</b> <b>on</b> {{the front}} of the {{building}} outside the portico are sets of three one-over-one double-hung <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> each floor. The second floor windows each have decorative sills, and relief panels sit below. <b>Windows</b> <b>on</b> the east and west sides of the building, including the wing additions, have only two windows per set.

5|$|Hurley (Jorge Garcia) is in {{a mental}} institution, where he is friends with Dave (Evan Handler), who tells Hurley to ignore the doctors, avoid his medication, and try to escape. One day, Hurley's doctor, Dr. Brooks (Bruce Davison), proves to Hurley that Dave is not real, by taking {{a photo of the}} two, and then showing Hurley that Dave is not in the picture. Later that night, Dave wakes Hurley up to escape with him from the institute. Dave hops out of a window, but Hurley confronts him and {{declares}} that Dave is not real, and shuts the <b>window</b> <b>on</b> him before going back to bed.|$|E
5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} {{wreckage}} from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the original wreckage had been found. This wreckage was from the starboard side of the cabin just above the three front windows. Subsequent examination at Farnborough suggested that the primary failure was probably near to this area {{rather than at the}} rear automatic direction finding <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the roof of the cabin as had been previously thought. These findings were kept secret until the details were published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|John Nash drew up {{plans to}} alter the lodgings in 1802. His plans were not used {{immediately}} (although other work was carried out at that time) but they were partly implemented in 1884 when a north wing was added, using Milton stone. This extension was later converted into general college accommodation. An oriel <b>window</b> <b>on</b> {{the west side of}} the lodgings, overlooking the second quadrangle, was also added in 1884. Much of the lodgings were refaced between 1927 and 1935, using Clipsham stone on the side facing the front quadrangle in place of the original Headington stone.|$|E
50|$|This {{room without}} {{woodwork}} had three <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> {{the side of}} the floor and two French <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> {{the side of the}} courtyard allowing to reach the balcony. The mantelpiece was of Campanian green marble.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} enhance {{this feeling of}} lightness, Gropius and Meyer used a series of optical {{refinements}} like greater horizontal than vertical elements <b>on</b> the <b>windows,</b> longer <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> the corners and taller <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> the last floor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house has}} five bay <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> its {{north and south}} sides, three on its west side, and four bays on its east {{elevation}}. The <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> each elevation are symmetrically arranged with six-over-six wooden sash windows and sandstone lintels.|$|R
5|$|Lord Rosebery had {{purchased}} Craigiehall {{as a home}} for his second son Neil Primrose MP, {{who was killed in}} Gaza during the First World War. In 1926 Rosebery therefore decided to lease the house and policies, although the agricultural lands continue to be farmed as part of Lord Rosebery's neighbouring Dalmeny estate. The lease was taken by Mr James Morton, an Edinburgh textile manufacturer, who commissioned Robert Lorimer to make various alterations, the property having stood empty for ten years. Lorimer added the oriel <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the south front, and modernised many of Bruce's remaining interiors. A water turbine was constructed in the bath house to provide electricity.|$|E
5|$|On October 22, Schlesselman and Cowart {{shot at a}} glass <b>window</b> <b>on</b> {{the front}} door of the Allen Baptist Church in Brownsville, Tennessee. The two men bragged to a female friend about the shooting; the friend told her mother, who {{notified}} the Haywood County Sheriff's Department. Investigators traced the shell casings to Schlesselman and Cowart, and notified the Crockett County Sheriff's Department, who took the pair into custody after spotting the Swastikas, slurs and 88 and 14 numbers on their car.|$|E
5|$|The 33-foot {{cast iron}} spiral {{staircase}} from 1871 was repaired and restored {{for the cost}} of $15,724. The work was done by Conservation Services and they uncovered and preserved the numbering of the stairs. In October 2010, a major restoration project repainted the tower and lantern, installed ventilated steel doors, restored the original weathervane and repaired the 12-pane casement <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the west wall of the lighthouse. The work was completed in March 2011 after it was suspended due to poor weather in December 2010; the total cost was $121,000.|$|E
50|$|The Sherwana Castle sits {{on top of}} a mound {{two stories}} high, and has eight cases of nine steps each leading up to the {{entrance}}. The entrance is under a grand arched window with two narrow arched windows and two small arched <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> each side. On each side of these are three more narrow long arched windows and three small windows at the top. The back entrance is similar, with four narrow long <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> each side and four small windows at the top. Each of the four towers at the corners has three <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> all sides. The top one of these has no glass, to enable rifles to be placed on those positions. The roof of the castle has a building on top with four sides. There are six <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> each side and two <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> its corners, which protrude out in a hexagon shape. The roof of this building has a Persian appearance with wavy crenallations.|$|R
50|$|Many {{houses have}} strikingly few and small <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> {{the ground floor}}. The beguines were keen on their privacy. Houses with large <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> the ground floor used to be hidden by an {{additional}} wall, as is still the case in other beguinages.|$|R

5|$|The Ambassador Book Award (1986-2011) was {{presented}} annually by the English-Speaking Union. It recognized important literary and non-fiction works {{that contributed to}} the understanding and interpretation of American life and culture. Winners of the award were considered literary ambassadors who provide, in the best contemporary English, an important <b>window</b> <b>on</b> America {{to the rest of the}} world. A panel of judges selected books out of new works in the fields of fiction, biography, autobiography, current affairs, American studies and poetry.|$|E
5|$|The church's {{appearance}} in the mid-16th century, shortly before its completion, is known from a woodcut by Girolamo Franzini. Its facade appears almost square; at its center there was a portal with a tympanum, surmounted by a large fanlight opened by a round <b>window.</b> <b>On</b> its side were three rows of pilasters with two pairs of niches, one over the other. A bell-gable was {{on one side of}} the roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} {{in three stages}} and is {{supported}} by buttresses. In the lowest stage, on the west side, is a doorway in Romanesque style, {{on the north side}} is an ogee-headed lancet <b>window.</b> <b>On</b> the left of the east side is a Perpendicular-style porch. The middle stage has a two-light <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the west side, above which is a circular clock face, and on the north and east sides are lancet windows. The top stage contains a two-light louvred bell opening on each side. The parapet is plain, and projecting from it on the west side is a gargoyle. The spire is octagonal, with two tiers of lucarnes (dormer windows). The north side of the church is divided by buttresses into four bays. The second bay from the east contains a priest's door, above which is a lancet window. To the right of the door is a small trefoil-headed window. The other bays contain two-light windows with Early English tracery. Battlemented parapets run around the walls of the aisle walls and the clerestory. The clerestory has seven bays on either side, each containing a four-light Perpendicular window. At the east end are three windows. The central window, {{at the end of the}} chancel, is Perpendicular with seven lights. This is flanked by two aisle windows with plate tracery, the one to the right having four lights, and that to the left five lights.|$|E
50|$|The <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> both {{levels of}} the south street {{alignment}} are rectangular while those on the western elevation are arched, flanking a semi-circular headed window with projecting keystone, surmounted by a further horizontal window; most <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> this elevation are now filled with glass bricks.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> {{the building}} were three-over-three double-hung windows with painted white frames, with smaller two-over-two <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> the dormer <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> the sixth story. The main entrance {{is flanked by}} two fluted pilasters and crowned by a molded arch and a decorative cornice. On {{either side of the}} central doorway are service entrances, still retaining their original two-over-two windows, which have been painted over. The mansard roof, unique among known extant buildings by John F. Jackson, was, according to Kate Reggev, most likely chosen for its ability to function as a roof as well as provide ample ceiling heights and dormer <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> the top floor and to distinguish the building from its neo-Classically detailed, metal-corniced residential neighbors.|$|R
50|$|The Democrat Printing & Lithograph Co. Building is a {{historic}} commercial buildint at 114-122 East Second Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is a roughly square brick building with limestone detailing, three stories in height, built in 1924 to a design by the noted architectural firm of Sanders & Ginocchio. Its street-facing facades are articulated by brick piers with limestone caps, with plate glass <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> the first floor, groups of three sash <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> the second, and large multi-paned <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> the third.|$|R
