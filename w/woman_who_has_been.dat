5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby for a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, as he watches his father row.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{recently}} released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. She is not eligible for subsidized housing, and for Section 8 she has to wait two years before she can apply. In addition to finding housing, she also has to find employment, but most likely she {{can not find a}} job because she has a criminal record so no one wants to hire her. Essentially, a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> recently released from prison comes into a society that is not prepared structurally or emotionally to welcome her back.|$|E

25|$|The highest {{elected office}} in the Church of the Nazarene is that of General Superintendent. Every four years six ordained elders, who are at least 35 years old and are not over 68 years old, are elected by the General Assembly of the Church of the Nazarene for a {{four-year}} term. Both ordained females and males are eligible to be elected {{to the office of}} General Superintendent. However of the forty-one persons who have served in this office, Dr. Nina G. Gunter (born 1940), who served for four years from 2005, is the only <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> elected. The youngest person elected General Superintendent was Roy T. Williams (1883–1946), who was only 32 when chosen to fill a vacancy caused by the deaths of Phineas F. Bresee (1837–1915) and William C. Wilson (1866–1915), both of whom died within weeks of the 1915 General Assembly. Wilson is the shortest-serving General Superintendent, dying only 33 days after his election at the age of 47. R.T. Williams was the longest-serving general superintendent, who served for just over 30 years from January 1916 to his death in March 1946. Eight of the first eleven General Superintendents died in office, resulting in both the expansion in the number of general superintendents, and an upper age limit of 72. Dr Hiram F. Reynolds (1854–1938), one of the original two General Superintendents elected in October 1907, holds the record as the oldest person to serve in this office, retiring in 1932, at the age of 78.|$|E

Another <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> identified as Herodias or simply a bystander who realizes that the execution is wrong, stands by in shock while a jailer issues instructions and the executioner draws his dagger to finish the beheading. The scene, popular with Italian artists in general and with Caravaggio himself, is not directly inspired by the Bible, but rather by the tale as related in the Golden Legend.|$|E

2500|$|American Gothic is a {{painting}} by Grant Wood {{in the collection of}} the Art Institute of Chicago.

The figures were modeled by Wood's sister Nan Wood Graham and their dentist Dr. Byron McKeeby. The woman is dressed in a colonial print apron evoking 19th-century Americana, and the man is holding a pitchfork. The plants on the porch of the house are mother-in-law's tongue and beefsteak begonia, which are the same as the plants in Wood's 1929 portrait of his mother Woman with Plants.|$|E
2500|$|Among the ACA's other provisions, Price {{is opposed}} to the bill's elimination, under most health {{insurance}} plans, of co-pays for birth control.
