5|$|The primary {{campaign}} issue was the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. Hager carried {{the stigma of}} being the hand-picked candidate of Governor Beckham, who had largely ignored the violence during his administration. On the other hand, Willson had twice represented the American Tobacco Company, <b>whose</b> <b>business</b> practices were the reason for farmers' discontent and violence. Democrats made much of this issue, and Willson did little to counter accusations that he was unsympathetic {{to the plight of}} the farmers. Hager tried to appeal to both sides of the conflict, but ultimately lost the support of both. Willson's position appealed to urban voters who wanted the state's reputation for violence to end even if it meant siding with the tobacco industry against the state's farmers.|$|E
5|$|Arnold, <b>whose</b> <b>business</b> {{activities}} {{before the}} war had included sailing ships to Europe and the West Indies, carefully chose the site {{where he wanted to}} meet the British fleet. Reliable intelligence he received on October 1 indicated that the British had a force significantly more powerful than his. Because his force was inferior, he chose the narrow, rocky body of water between the western shore of Lake Champlain and Valcour Island (near modern Plattsburgh, New York), where the British fleet would have difficulty bringing its superior firepower to bear, and where the inferior seamanship of his relatively unskilled sailors would have a minimal negative effect. Some of Arnold's captains wanted to fight in open waters where {{they might be able to}} retreat to the shelter of Fort Crown Point, but Arnold argued that the primary purpose of the fleet was not survival but the delay of a British advance on Crown Point and Ticonderoga until the following spring.|$|E

25|$|As both {{mechanical}} and electronic strobes are still {{more expensive and}} arguably more difficult to use {{in order to achieve}} the desired results than ordinary tuners, their use is usually limited to those <b>whose</b> <b>business</b> it is accurately to intone and tune pianos, harps, and early instruments (e. g. harpsichords) on a regular basis: luthiers, instrument restorers and technicians – and instrument enthusiasts. These tuners make the intonation process more precise.|$|E

Houlding responded by founding a new club to use Anfield: Liverpool.|$|E

An Act of Parliament for the Nar Valley Drainage scheme, obtained in 1881, included a clause to remove the need to maintain the river for navigation, and navigation to Narborough ceased in 1884, when construction of the Old Nar Tidal Sluice prevented boats from accessing the river at King's Lynn.|$|E
