5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E

Some leaders have praised {{the concept of}} the Green Bible, but have raised issues with how some content is presented, stating that the environmental message deemphasizes the Bible’s central message of the Gospels. Richard Land, head of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission said about the edition: “Sure it's important, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> Jesus what was most important, he said, 'Love your God, and love your neighbor as yourself.'

25|$|In an {{interview}} with The Guardian on 29 December, he narrated the incident of his arrest on 19 December. According to him, after leaving a friend's house and crossing a road in central Berlin on the evening, a car started following him after which he increased the speed of his own vehicle. When he realised {{that it was a}} police car, he pulled over <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> him to and showed his identification documents to them. He was allowed to go, but was called back seconds later and arrested. He claimed that he was tied up, blindfolded and also slapped by the police after refusing to undress for photographs. He has stated in the interview that he has gone into hiding, fearing for his life. The Guardian also stated that he had applied for asylum in Germany {{as a member of a}} secular separatist movement in Balochistan province of Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|Rav Judah {{reported}} in Samuel's name {{an account of}} the rarity of completely Red Cows: <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> Rabbi Eliezer how far the honor due parents extended, Rabbi Eliezer told of a non-Jew from Ashkelon named Dama son of Nethinah. The Sages offered Dama a profit of 600,000 gold denarii (or Rav Kahana said 800,000 denarii) in exchange for jewels that he had that the Sages could use in the ephod, but as the key to the jewels lay under Dama's father's pillow, Dama declined the offer so as not to trouble his father. The next year, God rewarded Dama by causing a Red Cow to be born in his herd. When the Sages went to buy it, Dama told them that he knew that he could ask for {{all the money in the}} world and they would pay it, but he asked for only the money that he had lost in honoring his father.|$|E
25|$|Many gay men {{and lesbians}} had children, {{especially}} if they had been previously married. Over 50 per cent of homosexuals who had been married had children. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> homosexuals whether they would be disturbed if their own children became homosexual, between 25 and 33 per cent said yes. Between 69 and 77 per cent said {{that they would not be}} upset, or only a little upset, if one of their children became homosexual. Compared to heterosexuals, homosexuals were much less likely to marry: 25 per cent of homosexuals married and 75 per cent did not, while for heterosexuals, the proportions were roughly reversed. When homosexuals did marry, they had less heterosexual intercourse and fewer children than heterosexuals. Some other findings were that 1 per cent of gay men were attracted to feminine qualities in a man, that gay men had little interest in competitive sport, and that older gay men were more likely than younger gay men to concentrate on fellatio. Bell and Weinberg were unable to explain the finding about sport, and were wary of concluding that the differences in sexual behavior between older and younger gay men represented a shift in sexual mores.|$|E

Following the release of The Food Album and The TV Album—in addition to the various greatest hits records that had been released—Scotti Brothers used-up all of their compilation options in Yankovic's contract, which prevented the release of further compilations when Volcano Records acquired his contract in the late 1990s.|$|E

500|$|In December 1979, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals {{ruled in}} favor of Professor Anspach, with an opinion that agreed with the facts about the game's history and {{differed}} from Parker Brothers' [...] "official" [...] account. [...] The court also upheld a [...] "purchasing motivation" [...] test (described in the decision as a [...] "Genericness Doctrine"), a [...] "test by which the trademark was valid only if consumers, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> for a Monopoly game, meant that they wanted Parker Brothers' version...." [...] This had the effect of potentially nullifying the Monopoly trademark, and the court returned the case to Judge Williams. Williams heard the case again in 1980, and in 1981 he again held for Parker Brothers. Anspach appealed again, and in August 1982 the appeals court again reversed. The case was then appealed by General Mills/Parker Brothers to the United States Supreme Court, which decided not to hear the case in February 1983, and denied a petition for rehearing in April. This allowed the appeals court's decision to stand and further allowed Anspach to resume publication of his game.|$|E
