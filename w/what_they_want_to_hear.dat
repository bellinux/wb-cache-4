500|$|Jackson was a {{national}} co-chairman of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. As such, he is involved in garnering support from the superdelegates. During the campaign, he provided the voice for some advertisements such as one South Carolina radio ad in which he said: [...] "Once, South Carolina voted for my father, and sent a strong message to the nation,...Next year, you can send more than a message. You can launch a president.'" [...] When describing Obama he stated that [...] "Barack Obama is not speaking {{as a friend of}} the community; he's part of the community...He doesn't always tell people <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> He tells them what they need to hear.'" [...] During the campaign, he described Obama as the first [...] "successor" [...] of Martin Luther King Jr. to use the thoughtful and careful approach to language to frame social debate {{in a way that is}} unlikely to alienate whites and noted his ability to get various factions to agree with him and his political positions.|$|E

[...] He {{supports}} embedded journalism over traditional reporting, believing that the closer writers are to events the less {{likely they are to}} repeat military public relations spin. Yon was reluctant to say about whether he supported the decision to go to war. He eventually said he had been a supporter because to his concerns about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction, which he had given the Bush Administration {{the benefit of the doubt}} over.|$|E

Today, there is danger of becoming too entranced with the presentation and less with its subject. This is also a delicate dance of overemphasizing the subjects that interest high officials, and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> declared true about them, rather than hearing what the analysts believe is essential.|$|E
