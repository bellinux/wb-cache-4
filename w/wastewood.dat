5000|$|In 1881, George Farnsworth and his {{partners}} in Wisconsin's Oconto Lumber Company founded the Bay de Noquet (later Bay de Noc) Lumber Company. [...] The company immediately built a sawmill in Nahma, along the northern coast of Lake Michigan, opening it in 1882. [...] Fires were problematic, and the Nahma sawmill was destroyed by fire in 1889 and again in 1899. [...] In response, the company built this <b>wastewood</b> burner, located on a small nearby island, to eliminate the sawmill waste. [...] Although the exact construction date is not known, it was some time between 1888 and 1893; it is not unlikely that the burner was built after the 1889 fire.|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{exploitation}} of <b>wastewood</b> with Greek lignite was investigated by performing tests in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor, a 1 -MW th semi-industrial circulating fluidized bed combustor, and an industrial boiler. Blends of natural wood, demolition wood, railroad sleepers, medium-density fiberboard residues, and power poles with lignite were used, and the co-combustion efficiency {{and the effect}} of <b>wastewood</b> addition on the emitted pollutants were investigated. Carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen emissions were continuously monitored, and, during the industrial-scale tests, the toxic emissions (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans and heavy metals) were determined. Ash samples were analyzed for heavy metals in an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy spectrophotometer. Problems were observed during the preparation of <b>wastewood,</b> because species embedded with different compounds, such as railway sleepers and demolition wood, were not easily treated. All <b>wastewood</b> blends were proven good fuels; co-combustion proceeded smoothly and homogeneous temperature and pressure profiles were obtained. Although some fluctuations were observed, low emissions of gaseous pollutants were obtained for all fuel blends. The metal element emissions (in the flue gases and the solid residues) were lower than the legislative limits. Therefore, <b>wastewood</b> co-combustion with lignite can be realized, provided that the fuel handling and preparation can be practically performed in large-scale installations...|$|E

40|$|In 2001, the Gas Technology Institute (GTI) {{entered into}} Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 01 NT 41108 with the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) for an Agenda 2020 project {{to develop an}} {{advanced}} biomass gasification-based power generation system for near-term deployment in the Forest Products Industry (FPI). The advanced power system combines three advanced components, including biomass gasification, 3 -stage stoker-fired combustion for biomass conversion, and externally recuperated gas turbines (ERGTs) for power generation. The primary performance goals for the advanced power system are to provide increased self-generated power production for the mill and to increase <b>wastewood</b> utilization while decreasing fossil fuel use. Additional goals are to reduce boiler NOx and CO{sub 2 } emissions. The current {{study was conducted to}} determine the technical and economic feasibility of an Advanced Power Generation System capable of meeting these goals so that a capital investment decision can be made regarding its implementation at a paper mill demonstration site in DeRidder, LA. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were developed for all major equipment, boiler modifications and balance of plant requirements including all utilities required for the project. A three-step implementation plan was developed to reduce technology risk. The plant design was found to meet the primary objectives of the project for increased bark utilization, decreased fossil fuel use, and increased self-generated power in the mill. Bark utilization for the modified plant is significantly higher (90 - 130 %) than current operation compared to the 50 % design goal. For equivalent steam production, the total gas usage for the fully implemented plant is 29 % lower than current operation. While the current average steam production from No. 2 Boiler is about 213, 000 lb/h, the total steam production from the modified plant is 379, 000 lb/h. This steam production increase will be accomplished at a grate heat release rate (GHRR) equal to the original boiler design. Boiler efficiencies (cogeneration-steam plus air) is increased from the original design value of 70 % to 78. 9 % due to a combination of improved burnout, operation with lower excess air, and drier fuel. For the fully implemented plant, the thermal efficiency of fuel to electricity conversion is 79. 8 % in the cogeneration mode, 5 % above the design goal. Finally, self-generated electricity will be increased from the 10. 8 MW currently attributable to No. 2 Boiler to 46. 7 MW, an increase of 332 %. Environmental benefits derived from the system include a reduction in NOx emissions from the boiler of about 30 - 50 % (90 - 130 tons/year) through syngas reburning, improved carbon burnout and lower excess air. This does not count NOx reduction that may be associated with replacement of purchased electricity. The project would reduce CO{sub 2 } emissions from the generation of electricity to meet the mill's power requirements, including 50, 000 tons/yr from a net reduction in gas usage in the mill and an additional 410, 000 tons/yr reduction in CO{sub 2 } emissions due to a 34 MW reduction of purchased electricity. The total CO{sub 2 } reduction amounts to about 33 % of the CO{sub 2 } currently generated to meet the mills electricity requirement. The overall conclusion of the study is that while significant engineering challenges are presented by the proposed system, they can be met with operationally acceptable and cost effective solutions. The benefits of the system can be realized in an economic manner, with a simple payback period on the order of 6 years. The results of the study are applicable to many paper mills in the U. S. firing woodwastes and other solid fuels for steam and power production...|$|E
40|$|U nasadu topole klona I- 214, osnovanom pri razmaku sadnje 6 × 6 m u sistemu kvadratne veze na zemljištu srednje povoljnom za uzgoj topola, analizirani su učinci prorjede koja je izvedena 11 godina nakon osnivanja nasada. Prorjeda je imala selektivan karakter, odnosno izdvojena je grupa tzv. perspektivnih stabala u broju koji odgovara prosječnom razmaku od 8, 5 × 8, 5 m i uklonjeni su njihovi izraziti konkurenti. Uzgojno neperspektivna stabla i stabla zaostala u rastu, što je uglavnom posljedica naknadnih popunjavanja, također su uklonjena. Prorjedom su uklonjena 122 stabla po hektaru (46 %), 6, 45 m 2 /ha (43 %), 66, 08 m 3 /ha (42 %) i 2645 m 2 /ha (40 %) površine projekcije krošnje, što je jačina zahvata iznad tzv. kritične temeljnice. Sortimentna struktura prorjednog etata pri selektivnoj prorjedi povoljnija je od shematskih prorjeda u mlađim nasadima na povoljnijim staništima i daje 50 % tehničkog drva, 30 % celuloznog drva i 20 % otpatka. Nakon 5 godina na prorijeđenoj je površini srednji promjer po temeljnici veći za 10, 6 %, volumen srednjeg stabla veći je za 21, 9 %, a površina projekcije krošnje srednjeg stabla veća je za 59, 0 % u odnosu na neprorijeđenu površinu. Nasuprot tomu, srednja visina po Loraju na prorijeđenoj je površini za 4, 2 % manja u odnosu na neprorijeđenu površinu. Veći tečajni prirast promjera, volumena i površine projekcije krošnje stabala na prorijeđenoj površini ukazuje na mogućnost produžetka ophodnje i povoljniju sortimentnu strukturu u odnosu na kontrolnu površinu. Research was {{conducted}} in the experiment plot of euramerican poplar, clone I- 214, which was founded with one year seedling type 1 / 1 with spacing 6 × 6 m in the square system on the alluvial soils of river Sava basin in which browning processes is expressed. Eleven years after the plantation establishment 3 blocks with two experimental plot of 0. 2016 ha, which are separated by a so-called. protective order, were singled out. In the experimental plot all the trees were numbered and measured by two cross-dbh, with an accuracy of 1 mm, and height, with an accuracy of 1 dm. The crown projection radius of 8 positions, each rotated to 45 o, were measured. On the three experimental plots (one in each block) selective thinning was carried out (PP-E), at which in each plots 50 % of trees were cut down, or {{the distance between the}} trees raised on average 8. 5 × 8. 5 m. Firstly, a collective called. promising trees set aside, in the number that corresponds to an average distance of 8. 5 × 8. 5 m, and their main competitors were removed. The trees behind in development, which is mainly due to additional filling in plantations two years after planting, are also removed because they were judged as silvicutural non-perspective. The remaining three experimental plots were control (PP-K). In each repetition trees for dendrometric analysis were sampled, the dominant one (dg 20 %) and a mean tree which has mean quadratic diameter (dg). In the 16 thyears of plantation development diameters at breast height (dbh) and height of each tree were re-measured, sa well as crown projection radius. The development of mean and dominant trees showed that the investigated habitat is the medium favorable for the cultivation of the poplar clone I- 214. Current increment of diameter, height and volume in the 11 thyear was in the intensive phase, where volume increment has not yet culminated (Figure 1 – 3). As a suitable element of growth to determine the start of thinning operation on a biological point of view, can be ring width along the spindle tree. In the first five years the tree has had a full solitary growth, and from the seventh year there is a competitive relationship between trees in plantation, which is manifested by changing the ring width along the spindle tree (Figure 4 and 5). This means that before the seventh year thinning does not have any biological justification. Models 1 and 2 of volume tables, constructed measuring felled trees from thinning (Table 2), and which are the dependence of the volume of tree from diameter at breast height (model 1) and from the diameter at breast and height (model 2), proved to be equally good at calculating the volume per hectare in the 11 thyear and more convenient compared to other tables and models (Table 3). To calculate the volume in the 16 thyear two input volume tables can be successfully used (model 2), while the application of model 1 is limited at the 11 thyear. In the 11 th year at the experimental plot an average of 263 – 266 trees per hectare are found, which represents a survival rate of about 95 %. Total basal area averaged from 14. 70 to 14. 97 m 2 /ha, while volume was an average from 156. 67 to 157. 62 m 3 ·ha- 1. By applying the statistical t-test significant difference in the number of trees, basal area and volume per hectare was not determined within the experimental plots before applying the silvicultural treatments (Table 4). By applying thinning operation, 122 trees per hectare (46 %), 6. 45 m 2 /ha (43 %) of the total basal area, 66. 08 m 3 /ha (42 %) of the total volume and 2645 m 2 /ha (40 %) of the the crown projection area were removed, which represent a strong procedure and is located above the so-called. critical basal area (Table 4, 13). Size of allowable cut in the thinning of 66. 08 m 3 /ha was in the limits expected on the basis of previous research for the density of 278 trees per hectare and the habitat medium favorable for the development of poplar clone I- 214. However, the assortment structureof allowable cut is more favorable compared to thinning in younger plantations in the more favorable habitats and produces 50 % of technical wood, 30 % of pulpwood and 20 % of <b>wastewood</b> (Table 4, 9, 15). Between 11 and 16 years on both series of experimental plot the mortality of trees was not determined. Five years after application of thinning treatment {{a significant difference in the}} number of trees, basal area, volume and crown projection areas of trees per hectarewere determined between the experimental and control plots (Table 4). The significant difference in the mean diameters, heights and crown projection areas of the mean and the dominant trees (Table 5, 6), as well as between the diameter strucures (Figure 7) were also determined between investigated plots. For a period of 5 years after application of thinning operation at the experimental field current basal area and volume increment per hectare accounted 85 % of basal area increment and 75 % of volume increment of the control plots wich had the number of trees twice higher than experimental plots (Table 14). For five years of positive reactions to increase growing space of remaining trees on the experimental plots the size of the total basal area and volume of trees removed by thinning operation is not compensated: the total basal area and the volume per hectare amounted to 2 / 3, and the crown projection area amounted 87 % of the size of the control plot. The reaction of trees on experimental plot with thinning treatment for 5 years is great and is reflected in greater mean diameter by 10. 6 %, greater mean tree volume by 21. 9 % and increased the crown projection area by 59. 0 % compared to control plot. In contrast, the mean Lorey’s height at the experimental plot with thinning treatment decreased by 4. 2 % compared to control plot. This has contributed to the intensification of the current (average periodic) volume increment compared to the period before applying thinning operation. Greater assimilation apparatus of trees in the experimental plots with thinning tretament and higher current diameter and volume increment indicate the need to extend the production cycle at the best assortment structure compared to the control plot. The research results indicate the validity of efforts that the thinning operation in poplar plantations should be treated as a biological and an economic category. As a biological category the thinning operation contributes to accelerating the growth of the remaining phenotypically better established trees and achieve optimum production. As economic categories with thinning operation realized the previous crop, and it being understood that the assortment of allowable cut in the thinning cover cost cutting and the establishment of plantations with more trees. In this framework it is necessary to direct further research, because the poplar plantations,which are aimed to applying thinning operation, are flexible enough to allow adaptation to changing market conditions...|$|E
