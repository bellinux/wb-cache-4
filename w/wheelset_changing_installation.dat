Strong manual traction combined with manual counter-traction on the torso {{is used to}} disimpact the fracture. Transcondylar traction is then applied bilaterally and two ilio-sacral screws are inserted percutaneously on each side. Open reduction and fixation, with sacral laminectomy in patients with neurological abnormalities, remains the reference standard. Early reduction and percutaneous fixation ensures restoration of the pelvic parameters while minimising soft-tissue damage {{and the risk of}} infection. Decompression procedures can be performed either during the same surgical procedure after <b>changing</b> the <b>installation</b> or after a few days.

Many {{thousands of people}} visited the installation, which was featured on the DLWP website. The gallery also organized a Vimeo broadcast of an interview with Hooker concerning the work. The project overall featured contributions from researchers based at the universities of Brighton and Reading. Postgraduate students from University of Brighton were also invited {{to contribute to a}} supporting exhibition. AUDIO ACCOMPANIMENT features a MIDI-controlled grand ‘Clavinova’ grand piano, which is triggered ‘live’ by cosmic ray particles to play a never-ending sequence of notes. The keys of the MIDI-controlled piano move in a ghostly, magical way to produce sound each time a radioactive ‘stardust’ particle hits the Geiger counter, MIDI controller and laptop that are all connected to the piano via its USB input. The piano was sponsored by Yamah UK and involved direct negotiations and modifications between Hooker, the DLWP and Yamaha. Cosmic ray particles pass through each square metre of the earth approximately every 3 seconds, so that the MIDI/Geiger counter-controlled sequence sets up an on-going series of random notes and harmonies, creating silences, then flurries of activity in a mysterious and intriguing way. The particle activity is thought by scientists {{to have an impact on}} our current weather patterns and the work was developed in collaboration with meteorologists from the University of Reading to help them explain this process through an accompanying text. The installation`s inherent concepts have a particular affinity to Cage`s work and his general philosophy regarding chance and belief systems. The notion of stars, cosmic rays and the universe allude to our own mortality and unpredictability, so that the idea of this somewhat ghostly work accompanying the <b>changing</b> <b>installation</b> of this particular dead artist`s work had a specific poignancy...|$|R

According to the examined scenarios, soil evaporation decreases at increasing drip lateral depth, while the associated WUE tends to increase when the depth of the lateral rises from 0 to 20 cm.

The installation extends Parry’s research techniques into ‘exploratory form’, developed for his ‘Exploded Sound’ project, to create a unique aural illusion that interrogates perceptions of sound. In contrast to the static musical soundworld of the former, Significant Birds focuses on rapidly fluctuating sinewaves which occasionally coalesce into recognisable speech. Each of the 12 speakers is hung in a birdcage around the exhibition space. From each speaker a pure 'chirping' sound can be heard which is in fact a single sine wave extracted from a recording of speech.

Initially, the performance of the model is evaluated {{on the basis of the}} comparison between simulated soil water contents (SWC) and the corresponding measured in two plots, in which laterals with coextruded emitters are laid on the soil surface (T 0) and at 20 cm depth (T 20), respectively. In order to choose the best position of the lateral, the results of different simulation runs, carried out by <b>changing</b> the <b>installation</b> depth of the lateral (5 cm, 15 cm and 45 cm) were compared in terms of ratio between actual transpiration and total amount of water provided during the entire growing season (WUE). Experiments were carried out, from April to June 2007, at Institut Supérieur Agronomique de Chott Mériem (Sousse, Tunisia). In the two plots, plants were spaced 0. 40 m along the row and 1. 2 m between the rows. Each plot was irrigated by means of laterals with coextruded emitters spaced 0. 40 m and discharging a flow rate equal to 4. 0 l h- 1 at a nominal pressure of 100 kPa. In each plot, spatial and temporal variability of SWCs were acquired with a Time Domain Reflectometry probe (Trime-FM 3), on a total of four 70 cm long access tubes, installed along the direction perpendicular to the plant row, at distances of 0, 20, 40 and 60 cm from the emitter. Irrigation water was supplied, accounting for the rainfall, every 7 - 10 days at the beginning of the crop cycle (March-April) and approximately once a week during the following stages till the harvesting (May-June), for a total of 15 one-hour watering. To run the model, soil evaporation, Ep, and crop transpiration, Tp were determined according to the modified FAO Penman-Monteith equation and the dual crop coefficient approach, whereas soil hydraulics and rooting system parameters were experimentally determined.

40|$|Goossen, Keith W. The {{approach}} {{proposed in}} this paper relates {{to the concept of}} solar cell cooling. By tilting the solar cell at an angle to the sun, the heating of the solar cell decreases due to reduced solar irradiance, while the cooling of the solar cell by thermal radiation and convection remains the same, and thus the solar cell will be cooler and more efficient. Of course, with such a tilted deployment, more solar cells have to be used for the same deployment area. Thus, this thesis concerns itself with how to gain the maximum energy from certain amount of deployment area by optimizing the geometry of the PV <b>installation.</b> <b>Changing</b> the incident light angle could possibly increase the electricity created by a certain area of incident light but will increase the number of solar cells required. Crystalline silicon solar cell price has fallen dramatically in the past decades and at the same time, the one-time installation fee of a PV system remains very high. Therefore, as the solar panel price becomes minimal compared to the installation cost, and as most households have limited space for solar installation, it is worth looking into the solar cells deployment that result in the largest electricity generation from a fixed size area used for solar cells placement during one installation. The behavior of solar cells at different tilt angles between the incident light has been theoretically and experimentally studied. Experimental results and simulations suggested a power output gain of at most 3 % can be achieved by deploying the solar cell at a certain angle away from sun light for the modules tested under normal weather condition. In summary, this project has explored an alternative passive cooling method that could possibly increase the PV power output from a fixed area of solar panels placed on a limited space, but is proved to be not very practical.
