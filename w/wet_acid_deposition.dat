To address the question of the role played by acid rain in population declines of eastern North American songbird species, we combine data from several sources. We use a multiple logistic regression model to test for adverse effects of acid rain on the Wood Thrush, while controlling for regional abundance, landscape-level habitat fragmentation, elevation, soil pH, and vegetation. We show a strong, highly significant, negative effect of acid rain on the predicted probability of breeding by this species, and interactions with elevation, low pH soils, and habitat fragmentation that worsen these negative effects.

Acid chloride sulfate waters of the Rio Agrio drainage basin on the northwestern flank are the only waters on PO & that are affected by leakage of acid brines from the summit hydrothermal system. Acid sulfate waters found on the northwestern flank are produced by the interaction of surface and shallow groundwater with dry and <b>wet</b> <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> of SO * and H 2 S 0, aerosols, respectively. The acid deposition {{is caused by a}} plume of acid gases that is released by a shallow magma body located beneath the active crater of PO&. No evidence for a deep reservoir of neutral pH sodium chloride brine is found at PO & The lack of discharge of sodium chloride waters at PoEis is attributed to two factors: (1) the presence of a relatively volatile-rich magma body degassing at shallow depths (< 1 km) into a high level summit groundwater system; and (2) the hydrologic structure of the volcano in which high rates of recharge combine with rapid lateral flow of shallow groundwater to prevent deep-seated sodium chloride fluids from ascending to the surface. The shallow depth of the volatile-rich magma results in the degassing of large quantities of SOz and HCl.

The previous research is mainly focused {{on the effect of}} emission. However, with the increase of NOx emissions, <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> problem could become more serious in some areas despite stricter controls on SO 2 pollution from coal-burning power plants. Therefore, a more systematic approach that focuses on both SO 2 and NOx emissions is needed for the long-term simulation and prediction of the <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> condition. In this study, <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> data from various monitoring sites in U. S. were collected. Feedforwrd backpropagation ANN models were constructed. Based on SO 2 and NOx emissions from power plants and field data on precipitation chemistry, the networks were trained and tested. Then, the networks were used to predict SO 2 and NOx emissions and hydrogen ion concentration according to the projected acid precipitation ion concentrations. The results obtained from the ANN modeling approach indicate that although it is promising to bring the precipitation pH value up to 4. 8, it is difficult to increase the pH to a normal value of 5. 0 based on the current <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> data patterns. A higher pH value of 6. 0, which is necessary for full ecosystem recovery, would be a more challenging goal for 2010.

Moreover, <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> {{becomes more and}} more serious in this area. In this context, two forest soils (a red soil and a yellow red soil, typically and commonly found in southern China) were collected from Hunan. The objectives are (i) to determine releases and changes in speciation fractions of heavy metals (especially Cd, Cu, and Zn) when the soils are contaminated with heavy metals and affected by simulated <b>acid</b> <b>deposition,</b> and (ii) to study effects of soil heavy metals and <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> on releases of soil Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and Al 3 +. The soil samples were soaked in the solutions of CdCl 2, CuCl 2, and ZnCl 2 for 15 days to make contaminated soils containing 200 mg kg 1 of Cd, Cu, and Zn. Then the contaminated soils and the original soils were extracted with five simulated <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> solutions (pH ranged from 5. 6 to 3. 0 and total dissolved salts increased). The experimental results indicate that <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> leads to great releases of soil heavy metals due to complicated soil chemical processes, mostly cation exchange and partly dissolution of minerals at pH lower than 4. 2. These released heavy metals come mainly from soil exchangeable pools and other labile fractions. Releases of heavy metals are closely controlled by pH values or, in some cases, total cation contents in acid deposition; meanwhile, concentrations of heavy metals are negatively related to the relevant pH values in soil equilibrium solutions when pH values are in a range of 4. 2 – 5. 1. From {{the point of view of}} heavy metal releases, Zn is the most sensitive to <b>acid</b> <b>deposition,</b> followed by Cd and Cu.

In Dhaka division as of 2006, the brick kilns contributed the largest SO 2 emission (about 70 %), while residential emissions had the highest share of CO and PM 10 (over 60 %) and substantial NMVOC (about 40 %). Emission rates of SO 2 and NOx in the dry season of 355 t/d and 183 t/d, respectively, were higher than the corresponding rates in the wet season of 60 t/d and 146 t/d, which was mainly due to the operation of brick kilns in the dry season.

Comparison with measurements and existing rainfall maps of the UK showed that this approach was successful in reproducing the high annual precipitation peaks of up to 4000 mm annually that occur in this area. At 13 out of the 17 measurement sites, the modelled annual precipitation differed from long-term annual average measurements by no more than 25 %. The process model was compared with a procedure used to map wet deposition of pollutants across the United Kingdom at a 5 km resolution. Significant differences between the two deposition data sets were apparent. With the mapping procedure, maximum wet deposition was correlated to areas of high precipitation in the northeast of the domain. With the process model, however, maximum deposition was observed over the smaller hills in the southwest of the domain, the first orographic barrier reached by the air mass in south-westerly flow. High exceedances of critical loads for acidic deposition to soils were calculated using the mapping procedure and found to be due to the high annual precipitation in Snowdonia.

Key objectives of TAF are to support coordination and communication among scientific researchers; to support communications with policy makers, and to provide rapid response for analyzing newly emerging policy issues; and to provide guidance for prioritizing research programs. This paper briefly describes how TAF was formulated to meet those objectives and the underlying principals which form the basis for its development...|$|R
30|$|Cases of <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> and {{acidification}} of most aquatic habitats {{have been}} documented (Baker et al., 1996; Sivaramanan, 2015). This phenomenon {{also referred to as}} acid rain is increasing especially in developing countries where modernization, urbanization and population increase have been a major driving force to the effect. One of the effects of <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> on water bodies is the lowering of the pH levels, which consequently decreases fish population (Baker et al., 1996). But in spite of <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> in these lakes and rivers, many fish species are known to live and adapt to the acidic waters. One of such fish species is Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, which has some mechanisms for adaptation to acidic water (Rebouças, Lima, Cavalcante, & Sá, 2015). Likewise, the tambaqui, Colossoma macropomum, shows increase growth in acidic waters and is negatively affected by waters with pH above 8 (Aride, Roubach, & Val, 2007). Similarly, Tribolodon hakonensis, a cyprinid teleost, lives and grows in the extremely acidic pH between 3.4 – 3.8 (Hirata et al., 2003).|$|R
