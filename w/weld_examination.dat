40|$|Fiber {{laser welding}} (FLW) {{was used to}} join {{advanced}} high strength steel (AHSS) and high strength steel (HSS); specifically two dual-phase (DP) steels, with ultimate tensile strengths above 980 MPa and with different chemistries (DP 980 Rich and DP 980 Lean), and a {{high strength low alloy}} (HSLA) steel, with an ultimate tensile strength of 450 MPa (HSLA 450). The welding speed and power were varied to develop a process envelope for minimizing weld concavity. In order to attain welds free of weld concavity a balance of speed and power was required; weld concavity could be reduced by lowering power and increasing speed. Welds with amounts of concavity ranging from 15 % to 35 % were characterized with respect to hardness, tensile and fatigue testing. Tensile results revealed that DP steel was sensitive to weld concavity while HSLA 450 was not. At stress amplitudes enduring beyond 1000 cycles, welded specimens exhibited lower fatigue resistance compared to the base metal. Concavity reduced the fatigue life of DP 980 steels, where increasing the amount of concavity further reduced the fatigue resistance, while the fatigue resistance of HSLA steel welds was not sensitive to weld concavity. Hardness profiling of the welds revealed that HAZ softening was present in the DP 980 steel welds. The amount of HAZ softening was normalized; allowing for comparison of different steels. Welds made by FLW demonstrated reduced softening compared other laser welding types because FLW was capable of welding with lower heat input. A difference in the FZ hardness was observed between the DP 980 steels because of the difference in carbon content of the steels; where higher carbon content resulted in higher FZ hardness. Additionally the high cooling rate in FLW created higher fusion zone hardness than the values predicted by Yurioka’s model based on arc <b>welding.</b> <b>Examination</b> of the microstructure revealed that the soft zone of DP 980 Lean steel possessed severely tempered martensite and untransformed ferrite while DP 980 Rich generated a structure with a mixture of tempered martensite, untransformed ferrite and a small fraction of non-tempered martensite. This difference in HAZ softening was attributed to the alloying content of the DP 980 Rich steel the higher alloying content of DP 980 Rich steel formed a stable austenite that could exist near the Ac 1 temperature and enabled the formation of new martensite in the soft zone. The effects of HAZ softening were apparent in tensile testing where the DP 980 Lean steel, which exhibited higher softening, demonstrated by a severe reduction in elongation while the DP 980 Rich steel, which had higher resistance to softening, attained elongation comparable to its base metal. HSLA 450 exhibited a slight reduction in elongation due to the hardening of the fusion zone. The welded DP 980 Rich and HSLA 450 steels consistently failed within the base metal, while the DP 980 Lean steel failed in the soft zone. The welded DP 980 Rich steel also demonstrated limiting dome heights comparable to the base metal while the severe softening in the DP 980 Lean led to premature fracture in the soft zone, yielding a larger reduction in the limiting dome height...|$|R

Evidences and consideration on growth kinetics have suggested that the layer could only remain thin (≤ 2. 5  μm) during FSLW. This layer could bear a high load during tensile-shear testing and the adjacent aluminium deformed and fractured instead. The resulting F m/w s was high. When the pin penetrated to steel, F m/w s reduced due to brittle fracture being dominant inside mixed stir zone. Evidences have shown that the amount of penetration and speed condition during FSLW do not have large effects on F m/w s...|$|R
40|$|The {{waste package}} (WP) closure weld {{development}} task {{is part of}} a larger engineering development program to develop waste package designs. The purpose of the larger waste package engineering development program is to develop nuclear waste package fabrication and closure methods that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will find acceptable and will license for disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF), non-fuel components, and vitrified high-level waste within a Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR). Within the WP closure development program are several major development tasks, which, in turn, are divided into subtasks. The major tasks include: WP fabrication development, WP closure <b>weld</b> development, nondestructive <b>examination</b> (NDE) development, and remote in-service inspection development. The purpose of this report is to present the objectives, technical information, and work scope relating to the WP closure weld development. and NDE tasks and subtasks and to report results of the closure weld and NDE development programs for fiscal year 1999 (FY- 99). The objective of the FY- 99 WP closure weld development task was to develop requirements for closure weld surface and volumetric NDE performance demonstrations, investigate alternative NDE inspection techniques, and develop specifications for welding, NDE, and handling system integration. In addition, objectives included fabricating several flat plate mock-ups that could be used for NDE development, stress relief peening, corrosion testing, and residual stress testing...|$|R
40|$|Typically, when gas {{tungsten}} arc welding (GTAW) is employed to join near-alpha titanium alloys, the resulting weld fusion zone (FZ) {{is much harder}} than that of the base metal (BM), thereby leading to lost ductility. The aim of this investigation was to improve FZ ductility of Ti- 5 Al- 1 Sn- 1 V- 1 Zr- 0. 8 Mo by modifying filler metal chemistry. In this regard, metallic yttrium was added to the filler metal and aluminum concentration reduced. It was believed that additions of yttrium would lead to formation of yttria in the weld melt, thereby promoting heterogeneous nucleation. Since oxygen and aluminum both act as alpha-stabilizers, expected pickup of oxygen during the welding process will be offset by the aluminum reduction. Tensile testing indicated that modified filler metal welds showed a dramatic increase in ductility of the FZ. Fracture toughness testing showed that while JIC values decreased in all welds, the tearing modulus, T, in modified filler metal welds was significantly higher than that of matching filler metal welds. Microhardness mapping of the weld zones illustrated that modified filler metal welds were significantly softer than matching filler metal <b>welds.</b> Microstructural <b>examinations</b> were completed through the use of optical, SEM and TEM studies, indicating that there was a presence of nano-particles in the weld FZ. XPS analysis identified these particles as yttrium oxysulfate. WDS analysis across the welds' heat affected zones demonstrated that there is an internal diffusion of oxygen from the BM into the FZ. Research results indicate yttrium oxysulfide particles form in the weld pool, act as a drag force on the solidification front and limit growth of prior-beta grain boundaries. The reduced prior-beta grain size and removal of interstitial oxygen from the matrix in modified filler metal welds, further enhanced by oxidation of yttrium oxysulfide to yttrium oxysulfate, leads to increased ductility in the weld's FZ. Addition of yttrium to the weld also acts to modify the surface tension of the melt, leading to an increased weld depth penetration. Results of this work indicate that the goals of this project and a significant advancement in the understanding of yttrium effects on titanium grain refinement have been achieved...|$|R
50|$|From the mid-1930s, {{the company}} became {{increasingly}} {{involved in the}} British rearmament programme, developing and producing military vehicles. In 1935 Guy submitted their new four wheel Ant armoured car to military trials where it impressed and 150 were ordered by the government. After this success Guy began to concentrate solely on the production of military vehicles and by 1938 Guy relied exclusively on Government contracts and had ended civilian productions. During this time Guy designed a new armoured car, the Quad Ant, which was welded rather than riveted together. The original official contract specification it had been designed in response to had been for riveted construction but Guy had suggested welding as being more suitable and effective. To that end they developed the necessary techniques including rotating jigs which meant the bodies and turrets could be produced quicker and cheaper. This new development made armoured vehicles much safer and {{is reported to have}} eventually saved the British government £100 million pounds, earning Guy a commendation from the Royal Commission. Initially though, the government's technical advisors were skeptical that welding armour plate using these techniques would be economical, so Guy offered to weld the first batch ordered, and if unsuccessful, to stand the cost. The vehicles were <b>welded,</b> and on <b>examination</b> by the British Army, the welding was found to have worked extremely well. Over time it was further developed and became widely used in allied armoured vehicles, such as later models of the Churchill and Sherman tanks.|$|R
