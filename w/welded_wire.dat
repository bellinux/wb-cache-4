2500|$|A {{reinforcing}} (rebar) ironworker, colloquially {{known as}} a [...] "Rodbuster", works with reinforcing bars to make structures based on a certain design. [...] Reinforcing ironworkers assemble structures with reinforcing bars by tying the bars together with tie wire. [...] They place the rebar inside of forms, so concrete can be poured over [...] top of them to form a solid structure. When reinforcing floors, concrete blocks are used to raise the rebar off of the deck, so no rebar can be seen underneath of {{the deck of the}} floor after the forms are stripped. In addition, ironworkers often have to cut the steel that they have for a job to fit into certain positions. [...] For example, the rebar will have to be cut with a cutting torch, so it can fit around a drain. [...] In some instances, <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> fabric is used to help strengthen concrete; however, it is difficult to place this fabric in the concrete because it must be placed while the concrete is being poured into the forms.|$|E

Surfacing of Fe-Al {{alloy layer}} is {{achieved}} {{on the surface}} of Q 235 steel plate by using the twin wire consisting of one aluminum <b>welding</b> <b>wire</b> and one steel <b>welding</b> <b>wire</b> in the shielding of pure argon. When the ER 1100 aluminum <b>welding</b> <b>wire</b> of Φ 1. 6 mm and ER 50 - 6 steel <b>welding</b> <b>wire</b> of Φ 1. 2 mm are selected as the master wire and slave wire respectively, with preheating and interlayer temperature reaching 350 ℃ by controlling filling volume of aluminum and steel, the Fe-Al alloy layer featured by well-formed welding line is thus gained with no macroscopic defect. As the mechanical performance testing shows, the shear strength of surface combining surfacing layer and steel substrate is higher than 270 MPa. The rupture position is located in surfacing layer and {{it turns out to be}} brittle fracture; the micro-hardness of surfacing layer ranges from 320 HV to 420 HV. Abrasion resistance testing indicates that abrasion resistance of surfacing layer is better than that of base material. According to micro-structure observation, the welding line is a coarsening columnar structure with a great deal of precipitated phase. According to EDAX, the aluminum content of precipitated phase in surfacing layer ranges from 24 % to 32 % (at), and the steel content ranging from 76 % to 68 % (at) - it is thus considered a Fe 3 Al structure through XRD.
