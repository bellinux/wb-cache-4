25|$|Locus {{of control}} {{generated}} much research {{in a variety}} of areas in psychology. The construct is applicable to such fields as educational psychology, health psychology and clinical psychology. Debate continues whether specific or more global measures of locus of control <b>will</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be more useful in practical application. Careful distinctions should also be made between locus of control (a concept linked with expectancies about the future) and attributional style (a concept linked with explanations for past outcomes), or between locus of control and concepts such as self-efficacy.|$|E

25|$|Not {{long after}} he joins the Legion, Superboy's life is {{threatened}} when a Green Kryptonite meteor falls to Earth, but his life is saved by a Smallville farm boy named Lex Luthor, {{who also happens to}} be a science prodigy. The two boys become fast friends, and Superboy builds Lex a fully stocked laboratory to allow him to conduct his experiments. Lex uses the lab to search for a cure for Superboy's weakness to Kryptonite. Just after Lex discovers the cure, a fire breaks out in his lab. When Superboy puts out the fire, the antidote is destroyed, along with a protoplasmic life form that Lex created, and Lex also loses all his hair. Lex blames Superboy for destroying his experiment and his hair loss, accusing the Boy of Steel of jealousy over his brilliance. Lex swears that he <b>will</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> the world that he is superior to Superboy. Lex does this by trying to implement a series of scientific quality-of-life improvements for Smallville's residents; however, each invention of Lex's winds up backfiring, requiring Superboy to intervene. This series of setbacks results in Lex dedicating his life to destroying Superboy. In the years that follow, Lex becomes Superboy's (and then Superman's) archfoe. Superboy soon acquires a small rogues gallery of recurring villains, including Lex.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{varieties}} of eliminative materialism, but all maintain that our common-sense [...] "folk psychology" [...] badly misrepresents {{the nature of}} some aspect of cognition.

500|$|In {{the context}} of materialist {{understandings}} of psychology, eliminativism stands in opposition to reductive materialism [...] which argues that mental states as conventionally understood do exist, and that they directly correspond to the physical state of the nervous system.

While assessing the series for licensing in English, Vertical marketing director Ed Chavez, a fan of science fiction, found its story [...] "technically sound" [...] and noted it as [...] "possibly one of the most heartfelt series I've read in ages". He hoped that the series would rank in top 10 of The New York Times Graphic Books Best Seller List for manga and believed that it would make Vertical a [...] "known name, not only amongst better comic shops and independent book stores, but also with anime fans and casual graphic novel readers". While the series was originally published in a seinen magazine, Chavez expected that it would also appeal to fans of shōjo manga. He believed that the word seinen [...] "means adult and does not make reference to gender". He hoped Twin Spica <b>will</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be a financial success and enable Vertical to fund future licenses of classic works by Osamu Tezuka and the Forty-Niners.
